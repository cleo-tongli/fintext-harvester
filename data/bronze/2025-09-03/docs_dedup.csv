Full Conference Call Transcript
Dan Scavilla, Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Garth, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that an earnings press release and slide presentation related to the call are available in the Investors section of our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's call, we may make certain forward-looking statements that reflect our current views about future performance and financial results. We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations on future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.
Our most recently filed Form 10-K and any updated information in subsequent Form 10-Q or other SEC filings list some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. On today's call, our remarks will be based on non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures offer investors valuable additional insights into our business' financial performance, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and enhance transparency regarding key metrics utilized by management in operating our business. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results. Comparisons provided are to the prior year quarter unless otherwise noted.
A webcast replay of today's call will be available on the Investors section of the company's website following the call. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Dan.
Daniel T. Scavilla: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. This is my first earnings call since taking the CEO role on August 1. So I thought it would be appropriate to open with a few statements before progressing into the Q2 business results. Then Matt will cover Q2 financials and give an update on our 2025 outlook. First, I want to thank Simon for his nearly 3 years in the role, where he built a strong team, strengthened communications with our customers and initiated multiple programs to improve DENTSPLY SIRONA's position in the market.
Having come from our Board of Directors, I can tell you that I personally appreciate the work he's done, and I plan to build on these programs with an eye on moving deeper, faster and strengthening our long-term position in the market. Second, I look forward to partnering with Matt as our new CFO. I believe Matt's experience and background are exactly what we need, and we're forming a strong partnership as we move forward together. I've also had the opportunity to engage with senior leadership at DENTSPLY SIRONA, and my initial assessment is that we have the core foundation to shape this company's future.
I'm sure many of you are wondering what I plan on doing and what changes you should expect from me. While I do have several hypotheses and ideas on what to focus on, I'm currently working with the team and our customers to listen and learn so we can prioritize and focus our approach before fully developing pathways. There are a few areas that are immediately apparent that I'll share with you now, starting on Slide 3. I've been focusing initially on providing stability to the organization through the CEO change, so we can focus on execution and drive results.
I've been active with the DS team connecting, interacting and conducting deep dives to listen, learn and align on our go-forward approach. We will continue to improve our focus on the customer and the customer experience. Every position in every department will make this a priority. We will enhance our support of the customers and our field-based employees through simplifying interactions, speed of response and increased strategic investments. The field team is and will become even more so a strength of our company, the tip of our spear.
We will focus on enhancing investments in innovation, including speed to market and adding value to our clinicians and their workflows so that they can offer the best products and services to their patients and grow their skills and practices. As market leaders, we will need to shape the future of our markets, partnering with our practitioners to migrate from product offerings into proceduralization, focusing on the complete provider patient experience, leveraging the strength of our entire company's broad portfolio to outpace competition. DS Core platform is a critical element of the company's strategy, and it continues to gain traction with 50,000 unique users now using the platform and more connected devices and lab orders processed each month.
We have a strong supply chain under great leadership that I believe we can enhance even further through streamlining several components to unlock value, reduce cost and free funds to invest in fueling future growth. As you've heard from us, we have programs underway that will continue, but we'll also be looking at more strategic moves to better position ourselves for the future. Wrapped around our commercial enablement, innovation engine and operations muscle will be streamlined support functions that will add value through simplifying and standardizing systems, processes and structure that will allow us to move faster support customers better and unlock funds that can be redirected into sustained profitable growth.
The team has made progress here as seen in our financial results, but there's more work to do in this area. I believe that focusing on the customer, moving with urgency, while investing in our sales team and product development capabilities will unlock value throughout our P&L. We will make decisions to support long-term sustained growth that leads to stronger financial performance, benefiting our business and our shareholders. Moving into our Q2 business results on Slide 4. Global sales were $936 million, decreasing 5% as reported or negative 7% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the Byte impact, sales declined approximately 4%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 21%, increasing 360 basis points versus prior year Q2.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.52, growing 7% versus prior year. Both adjusted EBITDA and EPS results are driven primarily from Byte impact and active cost reduction programs. Cash flow from operations was $48 million for the quarter. Our data and customer survey in the second quarter show global patient volumes and procedures largely unchanged from previous quarters. From a regional perspective, U.S. sales in Q2 were $293 million, down 18% in total or 11%, excluding the Byte impact. Results were driven primarily by continued softness in connected technology solutions and orthodontic and implant solutions. Given the performance, this is a priority area for us to address. We've already kicked off activities in my first week.
European sales were $404 million, basically flat versus Q2 prior year. Germany delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of growth, driven by CTS and SureSmile, which was up over 27%, offset by softness in IPS. Rest of World sales were $239 million, up slightly versus prior year with growth in Essential Dental Solutions and SureSmile up double digits, partially offset by softness in CTS. Before I hand the call to Matt, I want to say that I'm excited to join the DENTSPLY SIRONA team and be part of shaping the future of this organization.
I believe our potential has never been greater, but it's up to us to harness our resources and shape the future of our markets, placing our customers at the center of all we do and making thoughtful investments to drive long-term sustained profitable growth. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Matt.
Matthew E. Garth: Thanks, Dan. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As Dan noted, it's early days for us, but we are working closely together and share the belief that DENTSPLY SIRONA's potential has never been greater than it is now. Since joining DS, my priority has been helping the team focus on value-accretive activities. There is very strong engagement across the company in this regard, and Dan's arrival is helping to further our efforts and increase our pace. Our areas of immediate focus are fully aligned and currently being actioned. First, customer experience. We are directing our firepower to establish the best outcomes for customers through service and innovation. Second, margin enhancement.
We are raising the speed of transformation by eliminating waste throughout our operations and focusing the organization on value-accretive actions. And lastly, capital allocation. We are taking a disciplined approach and making appropriate investments to deliver increasing rates of return and shareholder value. And now let me turn to our second quarter results and a review of our full year 2025 outlook. Let's begin on Slide 5. Our second quarter net sales were $936 million, representing a decline of 4.9% versus the prior year quarter and a 6.7% decline on a constant currency basis, of which roughly half was due to Byte.
Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 360 basis points to 21.1%, benefiting from the suspension of Byte sales and lower operating expenses. Despite lower sales, adjusted gross margin expanded 60 basis points to 55.9%. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.52, up 6.6% from prior year largely due to higher adjusted EBITDA margins, FX and a lower share count, partially offset by below-the-line items and a higher tax rate. As you will have seen, we recorded a roughly $214 million noncash after-tax charge related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets within the OIS and CTS segments. These impairments were driven by the impacts of tariffs and current period volume changes relative to the initial investment thesis.
In the second quarter, we generated $48 million of operating cash flow compared to $208 million in the prior year quarter. The year- over-year decline is primarily attributable to timing of cash collections, a higher build of inventory in anticipation of ERP go-lives and tariffs along with an approximately $42 million foreign tax refund received in the prior year quarter. We finished the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $359 million. Our Q2 net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.1x and flat on a sequential basis. We also completed a $550 million hybrid bond offering in Q2, which helped to increase our ongoing financial flexibility. And now let's turn to second quarter segment performance beginning on Slide 6.
Starting with EDS, which includes Endo, Resto and preventative products, sales on a constant currency basis increased 1.1% with growth in the rest of the world, partially offset by lower volumes in Europe and the U.S. It's worth noting that EDS performance in the quarter reflected stable patient traffic across our major markets, a good indicator of the relatively stable environment and consistent with our customer surveys. Shifting to OIS. Sales in constant currency declined 19.4% with Byte accounting for over half of the decline. IPS declined double digits in the quarter, driven by lower lab volumes globally and lower implant sales in the U.S. and Europe, which were partially offset by growth of implants in China.
SureSmile continued to make solid gains, rising 3.3%, driven by strong performance in Europe and Rest of World, partially offset by softness in the U.S. Turning to CTS. Sales in constant currency fell 5.9% versus the prior year quarter as double-digit growth in imaging in Europe was more than offset by declines in CAD/CAM and imaging in the U.S. Note that changes in distributor inventories did not impact the comparison of CTS sales year-over-year. Moving to Wellspect Healthcare. Sales in constant currency declined 2.5%.
As expected, year-over-year results were negatively impacted by a U.S. dealer initial stocking order, which occurred in the prior year period and had an approximately 4.5% negative impact, which was partially offset by the benefit of new product launches. We continue to expect this business to deliver mid-single- digit growth for the full year. With that, let's move to Slide 7 to discuss our updated outlook for 2025. We are maintaining our full year 2025 outlook for sales, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EPS.
Now looking to the third quarter, on a sequential basis, reported sales are expected to be down slightly, following normal seasonality, while adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to decline due to tariff-related costs beginning to roll through the P&L. We expect that these factors, combined with a higher tax rate, will result in sequentially lower adjusted EPS. This outlook helps us maintain our full year projection and a relatively balanced first and second half of the year. Before we wrap up, I'd like to share an additional thought on capital allocation. We believe that DENTSPLY SIRONA has the potential to yield sustainably high levels of free cash flow.
Effort is underway to work down inventories and reduce our overall working capital requirements. We plan to prioritize investments in innovation and growth, financial flexibility and returns to shareholders. And now let me summarize on Slide 8. In the second quarter, our top line continued to be challenged. However, we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth through continued financial discipline. We're maintaining our full year outlook for sales and adjusted EPS. We've added flexibility to our balance sheet, and we are actively working to enhance our cash flow generation. We see significant untapped opportunity at DENTSPLY SIRONA. Unlocking it starts with taking a value-creation- oriented approach to financial management, and that work has already started.
We believe combining this approach with the customer experience transformation underway at DS will allow us to yield greater results faster, and we look forward to sharing our proof points in the coming quarters. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI.
Elizabeth Hammell Anderson: Welcome, Dan and Matt. There's obviously lots going on in terms of some of the product changes and you guys are new and things like that. I was wondering if you might be able to give us a little bit of like a state of the union as you see the broader overall dental market, so we can kind of set out what you're seeing on that level and then obviously some of the specific, like idiosyncratic factors that you were discussing on top of that?
Daniel T. Scavilla: Thanks for the question, Elizabeth. This is Dan. And so I'll give you my perspective of being 5 days in the seat here and go at it that way. But just using data that we have and that we've talked about, the Q2 survey in particular, which we found consistent with the ADA survey saying that patient volumes remain stable. Procedural utilization in the electives like implants and ortho continue to be soft. And we see some shifts but nothing meaningful. Maybe Germany, the dentist sentiment looks like it's slightly better. Tough to call, right? You have a lot of activity on the macro with tariffs and activities that fluctuate every hour.
I think the real thing is remain focused on the patient and the chair and the dentist, give them the right products and drive this. When you do that the right way, all those other things can soften out. Our thought is focus on the long term and not react to the short-term noise that's out there. So that's really where we're headed.
Elizabeth Hammell Anderson: Got it. That's very helpful perspective, and makes sense. Maybe just as a follow-up, anything to call out in terms of distributor stock- ups or destocking dynamics in the quarter, maybe particularly in CTS and EDS? That might be more a question for Matt.
Matthew E. Garth: Yes, it is. This is Matt. Again, we said in the prepared remarks that we really didn't see a significant revenue impact on a year-over- year basis related to stocks at dealers. And in fact, when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, they're, both on an imaging basis and on a CAD/CAM basis, in a good healthy position and the deltas year-over-year were pretty similar. So feeling good about the overall stock situation.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Saxon of Needham & Company.
David Joshua Saxon: Dan, maybe I'll start with a higher level question for you, and nice talking to you again on a DENTSPLY call. So just wanted to understand kind of what about the opportunity at DENTSPLY motivated you to switch over and then with backgrounds in spine, most recently in vision care and other areas at J&J, anything you learned in those markets that might be particularly useful as it relates to DENTSPLY's positioning in dental and how you're thinking about profitability?
Daniel T. Scavilla: Yes. Thanks for the question, David. And it's good to connect with you in another part here. So I look forward to going forward with you. There's a couple of things. Globus is such a great company, and there's such a great learning there, followed by, as you said, the breadth of moving around the different things with J&J. What I saw at DENTSPLY is the opportunity to honestly apply all of those. And I think it's more about the operational experience and the execution coming from those and bringing it in here that I think would be what interested me most. And there's a lot of areas to focus on.
I think the vast majority, I've had my hands in, in the past, and I think I can apply and help the team. And so for me, it's about taking my experience, helping what I think is truly a great team, accelerate to get where we need to get to.
David Joshua Saxon: Great. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask on implants. So maybe you can give a little more color on how that part of the portfolio did both geographically and then across premium and value. And then in the script, you talked about it being a priority area and already had some initiatives going. So can you give me -- give a little more color there? Like what exactly are you doing in that part of the business? And how should we think about the impact they might have?
Matthew E. Garth: Yes. And the implant story continued this quarter from what you have seen earlier in the year, where we've seen slower legacy brands transitioning to our new products, particularly as we looked at the premium side of the business. On the value side of the business, the Middle East volatility, I think you know that we produce a lot of our value implants in that region, and so the volatility there did impact our volumes with the limitations on being able to get product out of certain countries and into other countries, but that should be passed as we move forward.
From a headline perspective, we saw a premium down about 5%, and that is due to the exchange that we are seeing as we roll out the new products and the shift from legacy brands. We do expect for the full year that we are going to have some growth expected because of the sales force changes that we've made and that we talked about and what Dan just spoke to in terms of driving some new consumer experiences, and then also from the China VBP program that we've seen so far this year, that should carry us. From a value perspective, Q2 was down, let's call it, low double digits.
And again, largely due to what was taking place in the Middle East, and that will carry through for the full year as we look forward. But overall, the big driver, as we're looking at implants, has been from the lab side of the house, and so we expect to see that continue through EMEA and the U.S., both in the quarter and then over the year.
Operator: Next question comes from Kevin Caliendo of UBS.
Dylan Christopher Finley: Welcome, Dan and Matt. This is Dylan Finley on for Kevin. To start, just wondering, if you could maybe reframe some of your tariff assumptions for the year. I believe, previously, the team had sized at about $50 million in annual costs per year. So wondering if there's any changes around that? And then second of all, does the guide contemplate any mitigation efforts and any kind of supply chain action or price action you can talk about there?
Matthew E. Garth: Yes. Let me start with the activities that the teams are driving today, which have been extremely good results on expense control and driving efficiencies through the supply chain organization. You see that showing up in our margin as we speak. Last quarter, we told you that we were expecting about a $50 million annualized impact from tariffs. What has happened over the past couple of weeks with Europe and with Switzerland and Sweden has showed us that, that has grown to about $80 million that we were looking at on an annualized basis. So the interesting thing there for 2025 is that we have a similar situation on the $25 million that we spoke about last quarter.
The puts and takes and the timing impacts that we've seen are going to result in the same level of impact here in 2025. So that $25 million roughly spread across Q3 and Q4. The mitigation factors, we continue to look at ways, including cost savings, including activities that we are driving towards finding initiatives and finding mitigation efforts. And I think that will continue through the end of this year, and we'll look hard at what we're going to do for 2026.
Dylan Christopher Finley: And then on orthodontics, quick clarification. Did you see any adjustments or kind of chargebacks on Byte? I know last quarter, there was like a reverse of some of the refunds. It was a bit of a positive. So just wondering if there's any adjustment there on Byte. And then second of all, just quickly, if you could talk about SureSmile and what you're seeing in the U.S. today. One of your competitors called out challenging conversion rates, a potential shift to wires and brackets from orthodontists. Just any commentary you can provide on that market?
Matthew E. Garth: Yes. So the assumptions that we put into place, as you know, you saw last quarter around Byte and what's happening there, the patient load has come off faster. We did see about a $4 million adjustment here in the second quarter. For the second half of the year, we now believe we are in line appropriately with the rates of the drop-off. So not anticipating any further changes in that assumption. As you look at SureSmile, again, we said good performance, 3.3% growth on a year-over-year basis. The U.S., like many other areas that we are seeing in the U.S., there is a little bit of a drag there.
The things that we are doing to try and drive change, education programs, working with our sales force and driving new ways of working specifically with specialists and orthodontists, that's what you will see help us drive a change in the U.S.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners.
Michael Aaron Cherny: This might be getting a little ahead of ourselves, but maybe tying back a little bit to what Elizabeth asked off the top. She talked about the end market. I'd love to talk internally about how you see the portfolio, Dan, as you settle in. Obviously, we have the Wellspect review going on, but how do you see the rest of the portfolio? And relative to the business, do you feel at this early point in time like there are areas where you have holes that you want to pursue? And how do you think about the build of inorganic versus organic growth along that front? It might be a philosophical question, but thought I'd at least start there.
Daniel T. Scavilla: No problem, Mike. I appreciate the question. So there's a couple of things. I actually believe that no one else is better suited to compete holistically in this market than DENTSPLY SIRONA. We have everything that we need to do this and drive it. It's about focus and execution. I don't think there's major gaps that are out there and any minor gaps, I think you've got an incredible innovation engine seriously that is working on those things. Should we do it faster? Can we penetrate deeper? The answer is, of course. And that will always be it, no matter what the performance is that way.
But the potential and when I talk about unlocking the potential, it's about using every single thing that we have to impact further than what we've been doing. And I think that's really it that way where it comes. Organic versus inorganic, the answer is both. I lean more towards the organic because I think you build the right in-house capabilities and right productions. And you can actually do that in usually a more profitable way, eliminate unnecessary impairments and other external costs. But opportunistically, when we have a strong cash flow, the ability to buy and accelerate speed, of course, is something that we'll consider and do at the appropriate times.
Michael Aaron Cherny: Got it. And then just one more on implants, if I can. As you think about the market, I know that under the previous leadership team, there was a major focus on reinvigorating various different areas of growth. How do you feel about where those pieces of the reboot on implants fit as you settle into the seat? Again, I know these are early questions, but just trying to get a sense of some of the key trends we should expect going forward.
Daniel T. Scavilla: No, I appreciate your positioning with it. Listen, I think the following. I think the team is moving in the right direction in several areas. I haven't come in and said we're changing this, we're making a radical shift. And what I don't want to do is create a disruption that actually slows us and puts us at a temporary competitive disadvantage. I will continue to look. I might change my opinion as I go deeper in my listen and learn sessions. But to date, while I've seen the things that are in progress, I think I'm going to keep them in progress. I want to go deeper and faster in a lot of the areas.
I probably won't be as specific and focused in key areas. I think all of these are meaningful areas for us, and I want to see growth and health in all of them. How we do that, in which you order and prioritize what do we do that? Let me step back and take some time to learn and get to you later on. But so far, continue the path, accelerate it and probably broaden where I think we ought to be focused.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Mizuho Securities. Our next question comes from Michael Sarcone of Jefferies.
Michael Anthony Sarcone: Dan, congrats on the new role.
Daniel T. Scavilla: Thanks, Michael.
Michael Anthony Sarcone: Just a follow-up on the tariff stuff and how it relates to margin expansion. You talked about the updated thoughts being about $80 million annualized impact. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, but when you think about 2026 and you do see that full impact, how do you think about your ability to continue to expand gross and EBITDA margins?
Daniel T. Scavilla: Yes, Michael, let me start. This is Dan, I'll hand it over to Matt. But right now, we're not in a position to project what we want to do in 2026 and the volatility of every hour of every day of the change in tariffs would certainly tell you that prudence says to pause and focus before reacting. And so ultimately, what I think we're going to do is assess the situation and see, do keep in mind that we have the manufacturing and logistic firepower globally to position ourselves for a benefit longer term, but we're just simply aren't going to react in such a volatile market at this point.
Matthew E. Garth: Yes. The only thing I would add to that, Dan, is, as you look at how we're building the rest of 2025 and the outlook that we gave you, it does embed the tariff impact into our outlook. And the things that are allowing us to manage through that are the good activities that are taking place in the organization. And that's why having a longer-term view here as to what the value is that we can drive through innovation, through our product pipeline and the changes that Dan spoke about at the top of the prepared remarks, that's why we're taking some time to really develop what that's going to mean for 2026.
Michael Anthony Sarcone: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then second one for me. Dan, in the prepared remarks, you mentioned you've already started taking some activities to address the softness in CTS. Any chance you can elaborate on some of those?
Daniel T. Scavilla: I appreciate the question, but I think that let me do it and execute it and tell you what we did versus tell you where we're going. I'd rather keep that for competitive reasons into this team to go execute.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jonathan Block of Stifel.
Jonathan David Block: Great. Maybe I'll just start with a clarification. The $50 million that I thought you said going to $80 million tariff annualized headwind, sorry, was that a net number? Or arguably that grows before any mitigating initiatives that maybe you're able to put in place over the coming months. Just a clarification there.
Matthew E. Garth: That is the gross annualized impact. And again, for 2025, though, based on how we see the components moving, the impact to us in 2025 is still roughly $25 million.
Jonathan David Block: Got it. Not a full year and maybe some inventory that's at pre-tariff levels on the $25 million. Got it, okay. And then Dan, this one might be too early to ask, but just when we think about some of the company's prior initiatives, right, there was a lot there. I mean there was ERP, there was SKU rationalization. There were some, call it, consolidating of the manufacturing footprint. You inherit some of those things that are at various stages of completion. So would love your thoughts. I mean, are those top-of-the- list initiatives? Do those all make sense to you? Are those on track according to prior time lines?
Any update that you're able to give there would be great.
Daniel T. Scavilla: Thanks, Jonathan. Yes, it's a great question. And so what I'd say is I think all of those are the right moves. I think we have to go deeper and faster for sure. And again, let me go assess some of that and come back at a later date with a bigger, broader plan. But there's nothing in there that I would step in and say stop this or don't do this. It made sense. Listen, the real focus and the macro approach here for this company is we need to return the U.S. to health and sustained growth period.
And there's different mechanisms to do that, but it simply starts with remaining focused and improving our focus on the dentists, the customers and the field, supplying them with great innovation and with a consistent supply chain, and that's all about supporting it in-house, that's really where we're going to stay focused. And if there are some activities to strengthen that, that's really where we'll go along those lines. There'll be some broader things later, but again, more with the focus of the U.S. health first, Rest of World and Europe continuing to feed and then driving through that engine. And that's really what we're focusing in with the team now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson of Baird.
Jeffrey D. Johnson: Dan, I think John just asked you on kind of your commitment to some of those cost savings initiatives and other kind of middle of the P&L kind of efforts that prior management has been focused on. Maybe I'll go the opposite direction. Just kind of on the top line. There's been an intense focus over the last couple of years on some of this cloud-based DS Core strategy, some of the equipment becoming cloud-native equipment. My view on that, not that you care about that, I guess, but has always been that might be a great long-term opportunity, harder to monetize that in the short run.
Would love to get your input on kind of how you're thinking about that commitment to DS Core and the intense focus there versus maybe improving some of the actual hardware and products themselves, especially in some of the specialty areas.
Daniel T. Scavilla: Yes. And Jeff, that's a fantastic question, seriously. So thanks for asking it. So there's 2 pathways that you kind of asked, and I'll go through both. I believe that the world is moving into a proceduralization model, the holistic experience and not just individual components. And so having software and implants and instruments, all that are the best-in-class, are what companies are going to need to go. And of course, there's data and machine learning and all sorts of things like that, that can create connectivity and better outcomes and better planning. We have to pursue that path. DS Core is obviously a foundation for that.
But as you said, the best software in the world is meaningless unless you have great implants and great instrumentation and a procedural flow that benefits the practitioner. So the answer is, we have to go through all of those, we'll remain on our course with DS Core. We have to make sure that the investments are healthy and that innovation is consistent in all of those other things of instrumentation and implants as well.
So when Matt and I discuss how to unlock value or where to go, we're signaling that we need to streamline throughout the entire P&L, not just the middle to free up cash, so that we can reinvest and drive sustained growth through all of those mechanisms.
Jeffrey D. Johnson: Fair enough. And then maybe just one follow-up question. Just on your value implant commentary around MIS and maybe some manufacturing, headwinds there throughout the rest of the year. How confident are you or how are you able to assess whether it's truly getting product out the door versus market share gains for some of your competitors who have really focused on those value implants as well over the last couple of years. It seems like the value implant side of the market still has a little more strength in premium.
So for that to remain down, and I don't know, if you said down double digits for the rest of the year, but still down the rest of the year, a little surprised to hear that.
Matthew E. Garth: Yes. No, that's a good point of reference. The second half of the year will definitely be stronger on the value side. Again, that event in the Middle East that went down, obviously, had an impact on our ability to ship out of the region. And so you've seen some headwinds there. But that will flip, and we will be competitive as we move into the second half of the year on the volume side. The bigger piece of the overall implant story though, you've also noted, which is overall competitiveness and what is taking shape in the market.
And I think those lean purely into what Dan was talking about with changes and movements and evolutions that are taking place with our sales force in the U.S. We've seen over the last couple of weeks, a significant retraining and education program that the U.S. team has launched. Those are the types of efforts that are going to allow us to be able to get back into the game and drive growth in premium.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brandon Vazquez of William Baird.
Brandon Vazquez: I wanted to follow up on a comment, sharing his thought that was going on, I think it was John's question. But how much of the U.S. business in your mind as you come into the seat is underperforming simply because of execution on behalf of DENTSPLY? Or how much of it is simply underperformance of the dental macro market?
Daniel T. Scavilla: Brandon, it's a great question. And my honest answer is, let me evaluate it and go deeper and see. To make that split this early on, I'm not really quite comfortable doing it. I do have the belief that we have an incredibly strong team in the field and a great bag. And I think we have to look at ourselves and say, how can we move with better speed and decision-making so that we give our field the chance to actually come out and perform stronger than they've been.
What that percent split is versus macro, I don't really know, but I happen to believe that when you have the right team doing the right things, it softens a lot of those macro impacts anyway. And so let me dig deeper and come back to you once I have some better understanding.
Brandon Vazquez: Okay. And I guess my follow-up is related and it somewhat leads into this, which is the dental market has seen macro headwinds for several years now. I'm not sure, and you guys -- I'd be curious, if you guys disagree with me, but I'm not sure we see kind of like a silver lining here and where things are meaningfully improving for dental in the foreseeable future or at least in the next 6 -- let's call it, 2025. Again, if you disagree, please let me know. But in that, if this is the case for a little bit of time now, does DENTSPLY need to readjust to operate in this new environment?
I think the prior leadership team, while there were a lot of great execution initiatives going on, there was a chunk of kind of their EPS goals that was built on improving macro. Is this something that you guys think you will bank on as you start to develop plans? Or do you think the macro is weighing on the sector so much that you need to just build plans to execute regardless and anything that macro would just be upside to that.
Daniel T. Scavilla: I'll take a swing at that. So I think macro changes over time. And I think that as we look even to your point to the foreseeable future, it will obviously evolve both stronger and weaker over our lifetimes, and that's something that you need to think about us focused on the long term anyway. How do you thrive in that? I happen to believe that a strong cash flow and a strong profitability that allows you to go buy and execute and do what you want will allow you to react in a very meaningful way and eventually leads the market in a stronger way.
And so U.S. growth right now that generates more profitability through our programs, continuing and expanding that give us stronger profit and cash are going to allow us to not only react to but shape the macro as we go forward. It's about making sure we focus on the holistic set of our teams and portfolios to be able to do that. And while that sounds lofty, I truly believe that it is more than doable.
Operator: Our next question comes from Allen Lutz of Bank of America.
Allen Charles Lutz: I have a high-level question for Dan and Matt. There's a lot of areas where you can focus investments as you've talked about, sales force, implants, aligners, clinical education, you talked about DS Core. I know it's very early, so not looking for any specifics on where you're looking to invest, but just any early learnings and thoughts you've had as you've looked at the business? And then moving forward, how should we think about timing of potential investments here? And would this be a shift of dollars you're already spending? Or would this be incremental spend?
Daniel T. Scavilla: Yes, I'll go first, and then let Matt kind of go in there. So my experience, not just DENTSPLY, but my experience would show that a focus in investing on the customer and the field are always going to be the thing that will help us be the strongest and go. And so that's going to be there. There's nothing that Matt and I would signal as a significant shift that would throw off your models at this point, but rather us looking with our eyes where we can find efficiencies and free up cash to reinvest and ideally do that in a way that can generate growth.
So I would tell you, we're not going to see a radical shift that's going to throw you off. We are going to dig deep and move fast for sure. But ultimately, I think giving the field what they need, providing the customers what they need is really the key here, and doing that in a faster manner with more options in an easier way is what I think we're going to focus on.
Matthew E. Garth: Just to add, because I think Dan and I are in 100% alignment. And I -- frankly, in my time here so far, I think the entire team is, which is there is a repurposing of spend that we can do to drive speed, to drive growth and put areas where the team was already looking for efficiencies, namely in those middle P&L elements, but certainly within the corporate, shifting those into the field, shifting those into innovation. And so I think that's the primary viewpoint that I have that I'm going to try and keep them build out with Dan, and the team is of the same mindset.
So I don't know yet if there's a significant amount of additional incremental spend. I will tell you we're going to go through our strategic planning process. We will go through our annual planning process. That will be a great time after that to really hone in on some of the changes that we want to drive from a modeling perspective. But all of it is to reformulate a financial model for DS that returns higher cash, that gives us the optionality for growth and returns to shareholders.
Daniel T. Scavilla: And I would just add one last thing. Matt and I are big fans of spending what we earn and actually reducing leverage that will create longer-term flexibility.
Operator: Our next question comes from Vik Chopra of Wells Fargo.
Vikramjeet Singh Chopra: Dan, congrats on the new role and looking forward to continue to work with you. I just had a quick high-level question, Dan. Maybe just talk about some of the lessons you've learned from your time at Globus Medical that you think are applicable here? And then I had a quick follow-up, please.
Daniel T. Scavilla: Vik, thanks. It is great talking to you. Look forward to getting together again. Again, Globus is such a great facility with such great teams. I could talk a lot about that, but I won't. What I learned from that team is hands-on, literally hands-on, not some executive talking from a tower, but getting in the field with the reps and living their life eye-to-eye with the dentist and then owning it back and making sure there's execution where you as CEO are accountable to that person in the field to do it and do it better. I think that is the strength of Globus, and that's what I'm going to bring in here with that learning.
Vikramjeet Singh Chopra: Great. And I had a follow-up question. Apologies if this has been asked. I've been bouncing on a couple of calls, but I noted a double- digit decline in implants and prosthetics in the quarter. This is sort of worse than you saw in Q2, which I believe was a mid-single- digit decline. Can you maybe provide some additional color on what you're seeing in the market and your expectations for the rest of the year?
Matthew E. Garth: Yes. We went over it earlier, but let me do a quick summary here. So we did see a performance trend and the way that we spoke about it was breaking out premium and value in the quarter, premium down slightly. We continue to see the shift from our legacy brands to the new evolutionary products that we made in the market, some changeover headwinds there. On the value side, the volatility in the Middle East did provide a bit of a headwind for us in the quarter. It was significant double digits -- low double digits on the value side. That will carry through for the rest of the year.
So on the value side, you will see performance improve, but it will still be down overall for the year. Labs was the other place that we called out that had a significant double-digit decline, primarily in EMEA and the U.S. And so that rounds out, I think, on the implant side. When you look at the aligner side of the house, SureSmile up 3.3% and then you adjust out the Byte performance from the overall segment, that gets you back to that double digits.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette of Mizuho Securities.
Steven James Valiquette: I apologize. Earlier, I was kind of juggling multiple calls at once. Dan, this's obviously a time for you to focus on in the short term as you're joining the company. One area that was somewhat in limbo over the past year with some of the relationships with major dental distributors. So I guess, I'm just curious if you could provide a little more color on where that ranks on the totem pole of your priorities. And do you have a general bias coming into the role that distributors are vital or the door be opened maybe somewhere down the road where maybe a larger portion of your sales are direct.
Just curious to getting any early thoughts around this whole topic.
Daniel T. Scavilla: Steven, I appreciate the question. So a couple of things. I did have a chance to connect with both Schein and Patterson CEOs. And we're going to get together as I get further up to speed, have conversations. I would tell you, I'll refrain from telling you what I think and where we're going and what we're doing right now until I have a chance to better engage and learn this. I am not really focused on the short term. Everything we're doing is going to be about long term here. That would include what our relationship is with those. So for now, I'm active in speaking and engaging with them. I need to go further.
But let's kind of readdress that after I've got a little bit of time under me.
Operator: Our next question comes from Erin Wright of Morgan Stanley.
Erin Elizabeth Wilson Wright: There have been several iterations of turnaround stories, not just at DENTSPLY, but also across dental. I guess, how -- can you talk about what's different in your approach? And outside of some of these investments that you're making and execution and everything, what do you really think is like the optimal mix across your business, like to really set yourself up for success in dental and more consistent growth? And are you taking a hard look at even some of the strategies around some of the more flagship areas, for instance, like how do you feel about the game plan around CAD/CAM?
And how much are you taking into account the evolution of the competitive landscape there and other parts of your business that you're taking a hard look at.
Daniel T. Scavilla: Erin, I appreciate the question, and I think it's a legitimate question. Being 5 days in, let me dig deep, listen, learn, engage with the field, engage with customers, evaluate this out. Again, I do feel like the company is tracking in the right direction, but not deep and fast enough. I think there are some things we can do better internally. But again, let me get through my listen-and-learn sessions, and I will connect with you and probably give you broader scopes as I get a quarter or 2 under my belt to further answer that question the right way.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it over to Dan Scavilla, CEO, for closing remarks.
Daniel T. Scavilla: Thank you all for joining the call today. Matt and I look forward to engaging the investment community as we settle into our respective roles. Before we close, I want to take a moment to thank the entire DENTSPLY SIRONA team for the warm welcome and for their unwavering commitment to our customers. As I shared earlier, I'm truly excited to be here and to be part of shaping the future of the organization so that we can accelerate the value we provide to our customers and unlock the true potential of the company. In addition, I want to thank Andrea Daley for her dedication and leadership in the Investor Relations role.
Andrea will be moving into a new opportunity elsewhere. We're grateful for her contribution, and we wish her continued success in her new role. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Peng Li: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter fiscal year 2025 earnings call. Our journey over this past year has been purposeful and strategic. We are actively reshaping our company to serve China's rapidly growing silver economy. The numbers tells a compelling story, in Beijing alone we now have nearly 1 million people over 50, with that number growing by 0.3 million just last year. This is why our work is significant. We are shifting our focus from broad market reach to building lasting relationships with our silver economy customers.
You can see this in our new food and medicine products, which we are successfully promoting to our existing online learning users by leveraging our integrations with them. We're also in the early stages of exploring offline service center opportunities to further enhance our user experience. Now, let's take a look at this quarter. Our revenue this quarter reflects our planned strategic transition, which includes an anticipated decline as we power towards opportunities in the silver economy. Importantly, we maintained healthy profitability during this period, showing our ability to navigate this transition while safeguarding shareholders value. We’re uniquely positioned to serve China's silver economy.
It has expanded beyond basic elderly care to include wide area of lifestyle, wellness and enrichment services. Our strength lines in our established user base. These are individuals who are either in this demographic or approaching it. These users trust us as their learning service provider and we are attuned to their evolving needs and the performance preferences. Let me elaborate on the three key aspects of our business transformations. First, we are evolving our revenue model by expanding how we serve our users. Our deep understanding of our users' needs has revealed opportunities beyond online learning service courses. They are seeking integrated solutions for health, wellness and personal enrichment.
In response, we are developing products and services that create more lasting value for them, including our food and medicine product lab. This product lab is uniquely integrated with our online learning service platform. Our traditional Chinese medicine courses teach users about the principles behind these wellness products, while our nutrition experts provide practical guidance on incorporating them into daily health routines. This know how foundations help our user understand not just what product to use, but why and how to use them effectively for their personal wellness goals. Let me share a concrete example that illustrates how we are serving our users more comprehensively.
One of our 70 year old users began her journey with us through our online courses. Today, she engaged with our platform in multiple ways, following our traditional Chinese wellness courses, including Ba Duan Jin, a series of gentle exercises rooted in traditional Chinese medicine and using our health products daily.Through our courses, she has gained practical knowledge about the 24 solar terms. The traditional Chinese calendar that gets seasonal living patterns and applies this wisdom to her daily health routines. Now, she follows a consistent schedule, practicing our signature exercises at 7 A.M. each morning and has learned to adjust her wellness practices according to her body's needs.
Her experience demonstrates how our educational foundation naturally extends into broader lifestyle and wellness solutions. Second, we are strategically transforming our business mix to focus on the silver economy, while building a comprehensive ecosystem. We are gradually reducing our non-silver economy related businesses, while spending services that resonate with our core demographic. Our approach combines the convenience of online engagement with meaningful offline experiences. Our recent initiatives in Beijing showcased this strategy in action. In October, we helped to organize the Beijing Community Elderly Home Care, Autumn Family Carnival in Beijing's Fengtai district. This event brought together over 50 service providers across five essential aspects of senior living, medical care, food, housing, transportation and entertainment.
The event featured interactive demonstration of traditional wellness practices, calligraphy sessions and calculations about our study tours to culturally significant locations, such as Qingcheng Mountain, a historic Taoist site and China's selling capital. This community engagements has strengthened our customer relationships significantly. Users who participate in our offline activities show higher engagement with our online courses. We see increased retention rates and stronger brand loyalty from these users. They also tend to explore more of our products and services, validating our integrated approach to serving the silver economy market. Third, we maintain a clear focus on sustainable profitability throughout this transition.
In our initial approach to offline expansion, we aim to start with a pilot program in Beijing, six urban districts. We are collaborating with existing community centers to test and refine our operational model. Once we validate this approach, we plan to expand our coverage across the city and we will evaluate various expansion models based on the learnings from our pilot program. This measured approach allow us to optimize our operational model, while maintaining profitability during the transition period. As we transition from a traffic driven business model to one that is more product oriented, we expect to see a gradual improvement in our sales and marketing costs. This shift allows us to better allocate our resources.
We are concentrating our efforts on initiatives that directly support the silver economy. At the same time, we are gradually scaling back investments in areas that we are not central to our mission. This disciplined approach to cost management, combined with our focus on building partnerships enables to maintain healthy profit margins. It also positions us well to invest in growth initiatives that align with our long-term vision. This focus on efficiency and profitability is reflecting our strong financial position. As of September 30, 2024, we have cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments totaling RMB1,193.7 million, up from RMB1026.3 million at the end of year.
Our business continues to generate positive cash flow from operations during this position period. This solid cash position has allowed us to share our success with shareholders through special dividend announced in October. It demonstrates not only our robust financial health but also our commitment to investing in our silver economy strategy while rewarding our shareholders. Looking ahead, we remain focused on realizing the significant opportunity in China's silver economy. More importantly, we are building sustainable competitive advantages by creating comprehensive solutions for the silver economy market.
According to our 2024, senior investor based learning industry development record, over 80% of the silver population is already engaged in investor based learning, with an additional 56 expressing interest in joining such activities. This validates our strategy of building upon our educational foundation to provide broader lifestyle and wellness solutions. The silver economy in China represents more than a business opportunity. It's a chance to create meaningful impact as China's population ages.
Our existing relationships with users, combined with our understanding of their needs position us uniquely to serve this growing market.In closing, while this strategic transition may impact near-term revenue, we are confident that our focus on the silver economy, supported by our user relationships and operational capabilities positions us well for long-term value creation. We are building not just a business but a comprehensive ecosystem that enriches the lives of China's silver population.Now I will hand over to Tim, our CFO, who will provide more details on our financial performance. Tim, please go ahead.
Tim Xie: Thank you. Before I go into the details of our financial results, please note that all amounts are in RMB terms that the reporting period is the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, ending on September 30, 2024. And that in addition to GAAP measures, we'll also be discussing non-GAAP measures to provide greater clarity on the trends in our actual operations.For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, our total revenues were RMB810.4 million, representing a 6.8% decrease year-over-year. This decline primarily reflects our strategic repositioning towards the silver economy market, a transition we believe will create sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.
Among our revenues, individual online learning services generated revenues of $709 million accounting for 87.5% of total revenues. Going forward, we will continue to invest in developing our courses for the silver population. As we expand and refine our elderly focused course offerings across both categories, we expect this business to become an increasingly important revenue contributor. This realignment of our cost offerings demonstrates our commitment to meeting the specific needs and preferences of the silver economy market. Our gross billings from individual online learning services was RMB713.7 million, showing a modest decline of 6.3% year-over-year, which we view as a natural progression during this strategy transformation of our product mix.
Revenues from enterprise services were RMB47.8 million, a change of 30.2% from a year ago and representing 5.9% of total revenues. This shift reflects our evolving business mix between related party and external entity transactions. Gross profit for the quarter was RMB676 million with a gross margin of 83.4% compared to 86.4% in the same period last year. This margin change reflects our strategic shifts towards more product focused offerings within the silver economy market, which naturally carry a different cost structure compared to our traditional learning services. We believe this shift in our business mix while impacting our margin profile, better positions us to capture the diverse needs of our target demographic.
On the operational front, we maintain disciplined cost management while investing in our strategic initiatives. Total operating expenses were RMB573.7 million, a decrease of 18.8% from RMB706.7 million in the same period last year. To break this down, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 17% to RMB550 million, primarily due to optimized marketing spend and improved operational efficiency. As a percentage of total revenue, longer sales and marketing expenses, which exclude share based compensation decreased to 63.5% from 70.8% a year ago. Research and development expenses declined by 35.9% to RMB28.1 million, reflecting our focused approach to product development.
As a percentage of total revenue non-GAAP R&D expenses, which exclude share based compensation decreased to 3.2% from 4.4% a year ago. General and administrative expenses decreased by 28.4% to RMB30.6 million, mainly due to a decline in share base compensation expenses. As a percentage of total revenue non-GAAP G&A expenses, which exclude share-based compensation remain stable at 3.4% from a year ago. We achieved a net income of RMB80.7 million representing a net margin of 10% despite the decline in revenues. Our adjusted net income, which excludes share based compensation was RMB88 million, representing a healthy adjusted net margin of 10.9%. Basic and diluted net income per share was RMB0.52 and RMB0.50 respectively.
During the quarter adjusted basic and diluted net income per share was RMB0.56 and RMB0.55 respectively during the quarter. Regarding our balance sheet position, as of September 30, 2024, we strengthened our cash position to RMB1,193.7 million in cash, cash equivalence, restricted cash and short-term investments, representing an increase of RMB167.4 million from RMB1,026.3 million as of June 30, 2024. This enhanced liquidity position demonstrates our ability to generate cash, while executing our strategic transition, providing us with sustainable flexibility to invest in growth opportunities within the silver economy market.Looking ahead, our strengthened cash position of RMB1,593.7 million enhanced operational efficiency and healthy adjusted net margin of 10.9% provide us with a solid foundation during this transition period.
Our disciplined cost management and improved operational metrics give us confidence in our execution capability. While we have discontinued providing specific guidance during this transition period, we remain committed to transparent communication with our shareholders as we progress in our strategic journey. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, let's open up the call for questions. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Michael Kim with Zacks Small-Cap Research.
Michael Kim:
A - Peng Li: Thank you for your question. I'll answer in Chinese and then Leah will translate for me. [Foreign Language]
Leah Guo: We recognize that these factors present both challenges and opportunities and we are strategically positioned to have the capability to navigate them effectively. We see evolving changes in consumer behaviors, which are influencing spending patterns and demand. Despite these challenges, our diversified portfolio and focus on essential value driven products allow us to adapt to these shifts and continue to effectively meet consumer needs. We also have seen measures to booster the domestic consumption, which in house consumer confidence and spending power, this will support demand for our products and services. We are closely monitoring these developments and aligning our strategies to capitalize on emerging opportunities.
Importantly, we anticipate more positive impacts from the governments increase the focus on the silver economy and welfare for senior citizens. Policies targeting this demographic aim to boost their purchasing power and improve their quality of life opening up significant opportunities for businesses catering to their needs. As senior citizens typically have more stable consumption patterns and stronger balance sheets, our tailored offers for the senior consumers positioned us well to benefit from this focus.
Michael Kim: That's super helpful. Maybe just one other question if I may. Just curious how you're thinking about customer acquisition cost to lifetime value, as you continue to transition the business, would seem like cash trends would benefit as you increasingly leverage the existing user base and focus on e-commerce channels. And then, LTVs seem like they're set to rise just given sort of the repeat purchase nature of consumer products more broadly.
Tim Xie: I'll take this one. I think this metrics are indeed central to our strategy planning and we are actively optimizing them to ensure sustained growth and profitability. As we transition our business and focus more heavily on our private label products and services, including the existing online courses, wellness products and so on. We anticipate favorable trends in CAC. This improvement is driven by our ability to more effectively leverage our existing user base, which reduces our reliance on more expensive customer acquisition methods.
I think additionally as we deepen engagement with our current users through targeted marketing and personalized experiences, especially with our strategy of combining online with offline operation, which we are now, is cooperating with the local community, we expect to improve the efficiency of our acquisition strategies and lower the cost per new customer to extend the lifetime value of our users. On the lifetime value side, we see a significant potential for growth. Our shift and expansion of the private label offerings create strong opportunities to drive repeat purchases. And we expect to see rising LTVs across our customer segments.
The interplay between these trends position, I think they will both position us well to achieve a favorable LTV to CAC ratio over time. By leveraging the scale of our existing user base increasing repeat purchases and optimizing marketing efficiency, we aim to maximize the return on our customer acquisition investments. Furthermore, as we refine our product mix and develop offerings that resonate deeply with the consumer needs. We expect to unlock further upside in the customer lifetime value. And also because we in the past quarters, we always -- making we have made profits. So that means we have proved only the many courses, the online courses can generate the positive activity to CAC.
So what we are doing now is just to expand and to enlarge the LTV to CAC ratio over time. So that is a silver economy focused strategy with bandwidth in the future.
Operator: The next question will come from Steve Silver with Argus Research.
Q - Steve Silver:
A - Tim Xie: Okay. Thank you, Steve. I think our capital allocation strategy is just built on a disciplined approach that aims to drive sustainable growth and deliver long-term shareholder value. We remain committed to strategic growth investments with a focus to exploring high potential markets and these initiatives are vital for reinforcing our competitive edge and ensuring future scalability. At the same time, we recognize the importance of returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase especially during the periods when our stock is undervalued or our cash flow is very strong. It's important to highlight that we have consistently generated positive operating cash flows in the past years.
This funds our growth investments and share repurchase programs, while also safeguarding our balance sheet. And our robust financial position provides us with the flexibility to adapt to market conditions, seize strategic opportunities and manage risks effectively. So in summary, our ability to generate strong operating cash flows enables us to balance investing for growth, returning capital to shareholders and maintaining a healthy balance sheet. This approach positions us for sustainable long-term value creation. So, we will both consider the new opportunities that is our focus on the strategic transition, focus on the silver people's business model. And also, we will also consider and we executed the strategy to reward the shareholders, for example, the recent dividend announcement and deliver.
Steve Silver: That's helpful. And so the e-commerce business remains in the early stages and growth so far has been steady. Do you expect this pace of growth to continue in a steady fashion or do you envision a period of more rapid expansion of the private label strategy moving forward?
Peng Li: Yes, thank you. I think first I will clarify that, I think the live streaming e-commerce is just the start of our private label Chinese products business that is one of our planned channels for this kind of products. That's just because this business is started and based on our large customer base so that we can test and we can scale. And while we see steady growth, growth potentially in e-commerce as a whole, we view our private label based on online and offline operations strategy as a more significant opportunity for long-term expansion and value creation. We recognize that any business faces challenges in attempting to extend the lifetime value of the customers.
As a result, we anticipate that the growth rate of our private label business may not be as rapid as it was in the early stages. However, I think we have built a solid foundation including 134 million registered users, over 30 courses as key use and 98.5% customer satisfaction rate, which all provide strong support for further expansion and depending our private label business, this quarter we have already achieved RMB15 million GMV milestone in a private label strategy. And moving forward, we will focus on enhancing product quality and market alignment through improved operational capabilities across both the online and the offline through all proprietary channels.
We are committed to continuing to offer high quality private label products that meet the customer demands, ensuring the long-term and sustainable growth in the future.
Operator: As there are no further questions, I would like to hand the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.
Leah Guo: Thank you again for joining our call today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us or submit a request through our IR website. We look forward to speaking with everyone in our next call. Have a good day.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

This week, investors look ahead to remarks from Federal Reserve officials, earnings reports from several high-profile companies, as well as a slew of U.S. economic data, with a particular focus on Friday’s nonfarm payrolls report.
In Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major equity averages ended in the red. Marvell Technology (MRVL) tumbled over -18% and was the top percentage loser on the Nasdaq 100 after the chip designer provided tepid Q3 revenue guidance. Also, Dell Technologies (DELL) slid more than -8% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 after reporting a slowdown in AI server orders in Q2 and a weaker-than-expected operating margin in its infrastructure unit. In addition, Caterpillar (CAT) fell over -3% and was the top percentage loser on the Dow after warning that it expects a larger-than-anticipated net tariff impact of up to $1.8 billion this year. On the bullish side, Autodesk (ADSK) climbed over +9% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after the company posted upbeat Q2 results and issued above-consensus Q3 guidance.
Data from the U.S. Department of Commerce released on Friday showed that the core PCE price index, a key inflation gauge monitored by the Fed, rose +0.3% m/m and +2.9% y/y in July, in line with expectations. Also, U.S. July personal spending climbed +0.5% m/m, in line with expectations, and personal income rose +0.4% m/m, in line with expectations. In addition, the U.S. Chicago PMI fell to 41.5 in August, weaker than expectations of 46.6. Finally, the University of Michigan’s U.S. August consumer sentiment index was unexpectedly revised lower to 58.2, weaker than expectations of no change at 58.6.
“The good news is, in-line expectations likely keep the status quo intact, which leaves a Fed rate cut in play for September. The bad news is, inflation is continuing to inch higher, which isn’t really the environment the Fed likely wants to cut in,” said Bret Kenwell at eToro.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly indicated on Friday that officials are likely to be ready to cut interest rates soon, noting that inflation pressures from tariffs will probably be temporary. “It will soon be time to recalibrate policy to better match our economy,” Daly wrote in a brief social media post.
U.S. rate futures have priced in a 91.8% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and an 8.2% chance of no rate change at the September FOMC meeting.
Following Friday’s selloff in tech stocks on Wall Street, the record-breaking stock rally now faces a critical test this month, with jobs data, inflation numbers, and the Fed’s rate decision all scheduled in the coming weeks. Tariff tensions and uncertainty over the Fed’s independence are further adding to risks in September, which has historically been the weakest month of the year for U.S. markets.
In this holiday-shortened week, the U.S. August Nonfarm Payrolls report will be the main highlight. The report will serve as a key consideration for Fed officials ahead of their September policy meeting, with many analysts anticipating that August payrolls will confirm a slowdown in U.S. job creation. Ahead of the key jobs report, additional insights into the health of the U.S. labor market will come from the JOLTs Job Openings, ADP Nonfarm Employment Change, and Initial Jobless Claims. Other noteworthy data releases include the U.S. Trade Balance, Factory Orders, Nonfarm Productivity, Unit Labor Costs, the S&P Global Services PMI, the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI, Average Hourly Earnings, and the Unemployment Rate.
Investors will hear perspectives from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams, and Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee throughout the week. The Fed will also release its Beige Book survey of regional business contacts this week, which provides an update on economic conditions in each of the 12 Fed districts. The Beige Book is published two weeks before each meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
In addition, several high-profile companies, including Broadcom (AVGO), Salesforce (CRM), Zscaler (ZS), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Lululemon Athletica (LULU), are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week.
Meanwhile, market participants will also be watching the U.S. administration’s next steps after a federal appeals court ruled on Friday that most of President Trump’s global tariffs were illegal, stating he exceeded his authority by enacting them through an emergency law. However, the judges allowed the tariffs to remain in effect while the case proceeds.
Today, investors will focus on the U.S. ISM Manufacturing PMI and the S&P Global Manufacturing PMI, set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists expect the August ISM manufacturing index to be 49.0 and the S&P Global manufacturing PMI to be 53.3, compared to the previous values of 48.0 and 49.8, respectively.
U.S. Construction Spending data will also be released today. Economists forecast the July figure at -0.1% m/m, compared to -0.4% m/m in June.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.283%, up +0.87%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.52% this morning, weighed down by weakness in real estate stocks and retailers. Rate-sensitive real estate stocks led the declines on Tuesday as bond yields climbed across the bloc amid concerns over government finances, with Germany’s 30-year yields surging to their highest levels since 2011. Retail stocks also slumped. Preliminary data from Eurostat released on Tuesday showed that Eurozone inflation accelerated slightly in August, reinforcing expectations that the European Central Bank will keep interest rates unchanged next week. Meanwhile, ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel told Reuters that the central bank should hold rates steady, noting the Eurozone economy is holding up against U.S. tariffs and inflation could still exceed projections in the coming years. “I believe that we may be already mildly accommodative and therefore I do not see a reason for a further rate cut in the current situation,” Schnabel said in an interview published Tuesday. In corporate news, Nestle SA (NESN.Z.IX) fell about -1% after the company dismissed Chief Executive Officer Laurent Freixe just a year into the role over an undisclosed workplace affair. At the same time, Kering (KER.FP) climbed more than +3% after HSBC upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold.
Eurozone’s CPI (preliminary) and Eurozone’s Core CPI (preliminary) data were released today.
Eurozone’s August CPI rose +2.1% y/y, in line with expectations.
Eurozone’s August Core CPI rose +2.3% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.2% y/y.
Asian stock markets today closed mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.45%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.29%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed lower today, snapping a three-day winning streak as investors booked profits after the recent sharp rally, with attention shifting to the country’s largest-ever military parade. AI-related and semiconductor stocks retreated on Tuesday. Investors also monitored the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, where President Xi Jinping unveiled plans for an SCO development bank and pledged $1.4 billion in loans over the next three years. Meanwhile, margin trading in China’s onshore equities market climbed to 2.28 trillion yuan ($320 billion) on Monday, surpassing the previous record of 2.27 trillion yuan in 2015, as investors boosted leveraged bets to chase the stock market rally. Chinese stocks have been rallying since April, partly on optimism that the country’s advances in AI and efforts to curb overcapacity will help revive growth. Also adding to investor optimism were expectations that authorities would keep sentiment supported ahead of the September 3rd military parade, set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. In other news, Daiwa analysts noted that the contraction in China’s property sales eased in August, supported by rising average selling prices.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index reversed early losses and ended higher today, supported by bargain hunting. Energy, industrial, and financial stocks outperformed on Tuesday. The benchmark index also found support as the yen weakened against the dollar after Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino’s speech offered little guidance on the future path of interest rates. Himino said the central bank should continue raising interest rates but warned about tariff-related risks, indicating the bank was in no hurry to raise still-low borrowing costs. “Despite the three policy interest rate hikes by the bank thus far, real interest rates have remained at significantly low levels, as inflation has stayed strong,” Himino said. However, he cautioned that uncertainty surrounding the impact of U.S. tariffs on the global economy remains high, and any effects are likely to become clearer over time. Meanwhile, Japan’s 10-year government bonds rallied on Tuesday after an auction of the benchmark tenor saw its strongest demand since October 2023. In other news, the Sankei newspaper reported on Tuesday that Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba plans to ask ministers as soon as this week to compile an economic stimulus package to counter inflation and Trump’s tariffs. In corporate news, J.Front Retailing climbed over +4%, and Takashimaya rose more than +3% after a unit of the former company and the latter posted preliminary same-store sales numbers for August that marked the first year-over-year increase since February. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -2.15% to 23.70.

Macy’s Inc. beat its own expectations for top- and bottom-line second-quarter results, lifted by investments in top Macy’s doors and solid performances at Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury.
More from WWD
With its executives pleased by the quarter’s showing, the corporation raised its sales and profit guidance for 2025.
“This is the moment where we are stepping up and leaning into our recent successes, and making sure it continues,” Tony Spring, Macy’s Inc.’s chairman and chief executive officer, told WWD in an interview.
Asked if Macy’s has reached a turning point, Spring said: “I’d rather consider it the beginning of momentum. We are in a very uncertain environment, but what we can control is our work and our strategy.”
Macy’s Inc.’s net sales in the second quarter ended Aug. 2 decreased 2.5 percent to $4.8 billion, but that included the 64 Macy’s department store closings last year. Comparable sales grew 1.9 percent, marking the retailer’s best same-store sales growth in 12 quarters and exceeding the company’s guidance.
Net income was $87 million, and adjusted net income was $113 million. That compares to net income of $150 million and adjusted net income of $149 million in the year-ago period. Spring attributed the profit decline to a drop in asset sale gains and lower margins reflecting markdowns to clear spring merchandise, though the margins still came in above guidance and the impact of tariffs from Macy’s “limited amount of China content.”
The stock soared 20.8 percent to $16.28 at closing Wednesday.
At the Macy’s division, net sales, inclusive of store closures, were down 3.8 percent. Comparable sales were up 1.2 percent. Macy’s go-forward business comparable sales were up 1.5 percent.
Macy’s “reimagined” 125 department stores, where the company has been investing to improve service and staffing in high-traffic areas, achieved comparable sales growth of 1.4 percent. Spring said investments have been made “where we have undershot the customer in providing a quality experience, in fitting rooms, women’s contemporary, fine jewelry and men’s tailored.”
In addition, Spring said investments to beef up merchandise “across the board” have been made, citing women’s contemporary, denim, home furnishings, housewares and tabletop, lab-grown diamonds and shoes, while editing out some opening price points in juniors.
Bloomingdale’s net sales were up 4.6 percent; comparable sales rose 5.7 percent. It was the upscale department store’s fourth consecutive quarter of growth. “Bloomingdale’s is continuing to build stronger relationships in the marketplace. We are adding brands,” and part of that comes from “capitalizing on the disruption in the marketplace,” Spring said. “There is a clear go-get list of brands [Bloomingdale’s] wants to have.” He also cited the store’s variety of merchandise and “great storytelling,” as strengths. Additional Bloomie’s are planned for 2026 and 2027. (Bloomie’s is the scaled down, contemporary-oriented version of Bloomingdale’s.) “We don’t need more Bloomie’s or Bloomingdale’s outlets for growth. We have organic growth.” Additional Bloomingdale’s outlets are also planned for next year.
Bluemercury’s net sales were up 3.3 percent. Comparable sales increased 1.2 percent.
Spring sounded cautious on his outlook for fall and holiday, indicating a “wait-and-see” attitude that reflected uncertainties on how shopping plays out amidst fluid macroeconomics and changes in tariffs. He characterized the consumer as resilient yet choiceful, and said he’s been pleased with business for back-to-school, August and early fall, which is an indicator for business ahead, though not necessarily a sure one.
Spring feels strongly that Macy’s Inc.’s range of formats and price points, from off-price to luxury — a “good, better, best” approach as he called it — is an advantage, particularly in uncertain times with quickly shifting consumer shopping trends. Whether it’s at the Macy’s Backstage off-price format, a Macy’s department store, a Bloomingdale’s outlet or an upscale full-price Bloomingdale’s store, “there’s always something the customer can find to fit their wallet and their value equation,” the CEO said.
Macy’s Inc. raised its sales outlook for 2025 a bit, to between $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion, from the previous forecast of between $21 billion and $21.4 billion. Comparable sales are now projected at down 1.5 percent to down 0.5 percent, from the previous forecast of down 2 percent to down 0.5 percent.
Adjusted diluted earning per share are now seen reaching $1.70 to $2.05, versus the previous projection of $1.60 to $2.
“As demonstrated in its [second-quarter] report, Macy’s scale, financial position, relationships with vendors and recent initiatives to improve sales should help it navigate the challenging external environment,” David Silverman, senior director, Fitch Ratings, wrote in a note Wednesday. “During [the second quarter,] the company saw revenue improvement across its go-forward business, with solid expansion at Bloomingdale’s and more modest growth at Macy’s. These results suggest the company’s recent efforts to drive sales are bearing fruit, likely supported by execution challenges at key competitors in the department store and softlines space.
“The company will continue to face a choppy environment in the near future, with cost pressures from tariffs and a somewhat uncertain consumer. Fitch expects results for Macy’s and its discretionary retail peers to moderate in the back half of 2025 given the impact of tariffs on cost structures and consumer behavior. However, Fitch continues to expect financially stronger players like Macy’s will have the best chance to manage through near term volatility and potential fortify their market position for the longer term.”
Zachary Warring, analyst from CFRA Research, has a “hold” recommendation on Macy’s shares. “Shares rose 13 percent on the release and trades around eight times the midpoint of its fiscal year 2026 guidance. We think this was a strong performance in a tough operating environment.”
In other second-quarter results:
-
Merchandise inventories decreased 0.8 percent year-over-year.
-
The company returned $100 million to shareholders, including $50 million in quarterly dividends and $50 million in share repurchases.
-
The gross margin rate of 39.7 percent declined 80 basis points “reflecting proactive markdowns on remaining early spring product to maintain healthy inventories and product bought under prior tariff rates.”
-
Macy’s Inc. ended the second quarter of 2025 with cash and cash equivalents of $829 million and had $2 billion of available borrowing capacity under its asset-based credit facility. During July and August, the company completed a series of financing transactions to further fortify its balance sheet, increase financial flexibility and modestly reduce leverage, which resulted in a net reduction of long-term debt of about $340 million.
“Our performance highlights the advantages of being a multibrand, multicategory, omnichannel retailer,” Spring said in a statement. “The substantive, enterprise-wide improvements across our business, with a strong focus on customer experience, give us further confidence that our Bold New Chapter initiatives can drive sustainable, long-term profitable growth.” The company’s three-year Bold New Chapter strategy, introduced in February 2024, calls for closing 150 Macy’s stores, accelerating growth in the luxury sector, opening about 15 Bloomie’s stores; opening at least 30 new Bluemercury stores, and remodeling about 30 Bluemercury stores.
During his conference call with investors and industry analysts, Spring said, “As one of their largest partners, we receive compelling product from the brands our customers ask for, including Coach, Donna Karan, Levi’s and Ralph Lauren, just to name a few.
“We’ve been attracting new partners, including Abercrombie kids, expanding our distribution to existing labels such as Sam Edelman, Hugo Boss, Good American, and we’re continuing to update our private brand assortment,” Spring said.
Turning to category performance at Macy’s, Spring said: “Comparable sales of women’s contemporary and career as well as men’s tailored clothing outperformed. In addition, fine jewelry and watches, textiles and mattresses continued to experience strong demand. The success of these categories illustrates the breadth of product and price points that we offer and our ability to cater to customers’ evolving lifestyle needs.”
At Bloomingdale’s in the second quarter, ready-to-wear, fine jewelry, fragrance and tabletop were standouts. At Bluemercury, results were driven by dermatological skin care and recent brand launches, including Byredo, Victoria Beckham Beauty and Charlotte Tilbury.
He sees growth ahead in Macy’s private label business. “Private brands is still well below our 20 percent high watermark,” and is currently in the low teens as a percent of Macy’s total business. “That’s an opportunity for us to grow sales and span differentiation and improve margins,” Spring said.

APAC Data Center Colocation Market Outlook Report 2025-2030 | Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Taiwan Witness Higher Investments
The APAC data center colocation market is set to expand with an impressive CAGR of 17.25% from 2024 to 2030. Major markets include China, Hong Kong, Australia, Japan, India, and Singapore. Emerging markets like Malaysia and South Korea are seeing increased investments. Key trends include the adoption of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) fuel and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to boost efficiency and sustainability. Prominent companies such as AirTrunk and ST Telemedia are leading this evolution. The region is poised for substantial growth driven by technological advancements and rising demand for high-performance data infrastructure.
The APAC data center colocation market size by investment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.25% from 2024 to 2030.
Countries such as China, Hong Kong, Australia, Japan, India, and Singapore are among the top and established data center markets in the APAC. The countries such as Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, New Zealand, the Philippines, and Taiwan witness higher investments and are poised to become developed markets in the years to come.
Introduction of HVO Fuel for Generators
The data centers are facing increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint and operate sustainably. Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) has emerged as a viable low-carbon alternative to diesel fuel for backup generators in the APAC data center colocation market. HVO is a type of renewable diesel produced by hydrotreating waste vegetable oils and animal fats, making it a drop-in replacement for conventional fossil diesel.
In May 2025, Bridge Data Centres entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with EcoCeres, a biofuels company based in Hong Kong, to explore the use of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) as a potential alternative to diesel in its backup generation systems. The two companies will collaborate on developing technical specifications and practical solutions to integrate HVO into their operations to establish Singapore as a central hub for this initiative.
Adoption of Artificial Intelligence
The APAC region is witnessing a notable rise in the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), emerging as a leading hub for generative AI technologies, second only to North America. This growing trend spans industries such as finance, healthcare, and logistics, fueling the need for advanced, high-performance data center infrastructure.
Several data center operators have started developing AI-ready data centers in the region to accommodate AI workloads being rapidly generated by customers of different industry sectors.
Many leading data center and infrastructure companies, such as Equinix and Digital Realty, are actively collaborating with technology partners and investing in AI development to enhance their service offerings. These efforts include integrating AI models for smarter energy management, predictive maintenance, and optimizing data center operations.
SEGMENTATION INSIGHTS
Innovative data center technologies are gaining traction in the APAC data center colocation market due to its diverse climates and growing digital demand. Varying weather from tropical humidity to extreme heat requires advanced cooling solutions and reliable power backup to ensure data center efficiency and uptime. These innovations help manage energy use, reduce costs, as well as support the rapid growth of 5G, AI, and cloud services.
In March 2025, a consortium of Japanese companies and financial institutions planned to launch a demonstration project for an offshore floating data center off Yokohama's coast. The group includes NYK Line, NTT Facilities, Eurus Energy Holdings, MUFG Bank, and the city of Yokohama. The project will feature a containerized data center installed on a floating platform, powered by solar panels and battery storage, with the potential integration of offshore wind energy being considered.

APAC DATA CENTER COLOCATION MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS
As of June 2025, there were over 850 existing third-party data center facilities in the APAC region, excluding China, operated by more than 220 companies. Additionally, over 360 new data center facilities are currently in the planning and development stages, with contributions from over 180 operators; these facilities are expected to be operational within the next 5 to 6 years.
China is among the top and well-established data center markets in the APAC data center colocation market. China has a share of around 46% of the overall colocation investments in the APAC region in 2024. The country also accounts for a substantial share of the data center landscape. The market is among the top priority locations in the region.
In 2024, Japan contributed over 10.09% (approximately $2.87 billion) of the total colocation revenue generated in the APAC region. This makes Japan the second-largest contributor to the market after China, underscoring its significance in the Asia Pacific data center colocation market.
Data center construction costs differ widely across countries, with Japan and Singapore among the priciest markets, averaging approximately USD 14-15 million and USD 13-14 million per megawatt, respectively. These high costs are largely due to factors such as scarce land, expensive labor, and strict building regulations. In contrast, countries like India and China offer significantly lower construction expenses, due to more economical labor, land availability, and favorable regulatory conditions, making them appealing for cost-effective data center development.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-sell-costa-coffee-123218255.html,b47f60c83df8479e2cb4fa91d440c0a3,Should Coca - Cola sell Costa Coffee ? ,Should Coca - Cola sell Costa Coffee ? ,2025-09-03 13:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"When Coca-Cola snapped up Costa Coffee for £3.9bn ($5.2bn) in 2018, the move was hailed as a bold new step into the booming hot drinks market.
But, seven years on, Coca-Cola is reportedly weighing up a sale of the UK’s biggest coffee-shop chain – a potential shift that raises questions about whether the bet ever really paid off.
Last month, Sky News reported Coca-Cola had appointed Lazard, the investment bank, to review its options for Costa Coffee, which operates in around 50 countries worldwide.
Originally bought to reduce Coca-Cola’s reliance on sugary soft drinks, the UK broadcaster revealed indicative orders for Costa Coffee could be made in the autumn.
Coca-Cola “reflecting” on Costa
Coca-Cola doesn't disclose detailed financial numbers on Costa. Up to the start of this year, Costa was housed in the group's Global Ventures unit, alongside UK soft-drinks business Innocent and Turkish herbal tea brand Doğadan. From the start of the year, Costa's results have been reported to Coca-Cola’s Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment.
Speaking to analysts in July after Coca-Cola reported its second-quarter financial results, CEO James Quincey was asked to reflect on the coffee market and the company’s strategy in the sector.
He said: “Coffee is a large, fragmented, growing category in the total beverage industry, so, it’s clearly attractive if we and the bottling system can find ways to participate more deeply in that category.
“Now, having said that, our investment in Costa is not where we wanted it to be from an investment hypothesis point of view.
“The business is still a good business, but it’s not quite delivered on the different verticals of growth that we were hoping to accelerate much quicker, the ready-to-drink coffee, the Express machines at home.”
There are more than 2,000 Costa Coffee stores in the UK and over 3,000 globally. Quincey said the Costa business “remains more weighted to stores”.
He said: “In the stores, we’ve been driving the affordability and actually doing a good job on refreshing the stores and driving the speed of service.”
However, the Coca-Cola chief added: “Still, the investment hypothesis as originally intended has not played out despite the improvement in the store business I think I would say we’re in the mode of reflecting on what we’ve learnt, thinking about how we might want to find new avenues to grow in the coffee category, while continuing to run the Costa business successfully because it’s still a lot of money we put down and we want that money to work as hard as possible.""
Why Costa hasn’t delivered
Reading those comments in the wake of the Sky News report and Coca-Cola's reported appointment of Lazard, it seems those reflections may now include the future ownership of the business.
One analyst told Sky News a sale could fetch £2bn, almost half what Coca-Cola paid in 2018.
Nevertheless, there is a feeling among some industry watchers the company should offload the business.
“From a food and retail perspective, this looks like the right move”, Louis Bedwell, business unit lead for UK consultancy Future Food Movement, says. “Costa is a well-established consumer brand but it has never truly fitted within Coca-Cola’s operating model.
“Coca-Cola is built for beverages, with global scale, distribution and brand equity in bottles and cans. Costa is a retail and hospitality business built around property, labour and direct-to-consumer service.”
Bedwell believes selling Costa Coffee “allows each business to focus on what it does best.”
He continues: “Costa has held its ground but has not unlocked new growth. Coca-Cola has extended the brand into vending and ready-to-drink formats, which play to its strengths but the UK store estate has faced the same structural pressures as the wider high street: rising costs, tight labour markets and changing consumer habits.”
In its most recent full-year filings from 2023, the coffee chain recorded revenues of £1.22bn, which represented a 9% increase over 2022 but was below the £1.3bn recorded in the 12 months to 1 March 2018 – the last year before Coca-Cola took control of the business.
Furthermore, Costa’s 2023 accounts referred to “inflationary pressures on the cost of goods,” including energy and payroll, and “the impairment of the company's investments in two of its subsidiaries”, which resulted in an overall loss of just under £14m for the year.
A sale would not be just a retreat, it’s more like portfolio discipline Ivan Torossian
Ivan Torossian, a consulting director at GlobalData, Just Drinks' parent, says: “Costa has underdelivered compared to Coca-Cola’s original ‘total beverage’ vision and it remains operationally heavy for Coke’s asset-light philosophy.
“If Coca-Cola moves forward with the sale, it would free focus and capital for higher-velocity brands and/or adjacencies – think sparkling, hydration, energy, RTD coffee/tea, alcohol adjacencies – while leaving coffee retail to specialists.”
Torossian adds a sale “would not be just a retreat; it’s more like portfolio discipline.”
He adds: “Costa’s retail estate is an operational anomaly in Coke’s portfolio. Stores demand a foodservice operator’s mindset (real estate, labour, foodservice economics). However, Coca-Cola’s strengths are in brand building and distribution/supply chain scale.""
Coca-Cola could keep a foot in coffee
A sale of the Costa Coffee wouldn't mean Coca-Cola exits coffee completely. It also owns the Georgia Coffee packaged-coffee brand, for example.
Moreover, industry watchers believe Coca-Cola could keep an interest in the Costa brand through RTD products.
""By moving away from the coffee-shop model but retaining RTD formats, Coke can still capture coffee consumption occasions without the profit and loss distraction of a chain that doesn’t fit its DNA,” Torossian says.
“I think Coke should try to keep high-margin, scalable-coffee formats (RTD Costa, partnerships via bottlers, Express machines under licensing/franchising) and exit the capital and labour-intensive retail shops,"" he says. ""That would keep coffee presence where Coke has advantage, such as route-to-market, cooler density, vending, while removing the operational complexity.""
Bedwell adds: “Coca-Cola needs to prioritise where it creates the most value and that is not high street retail.
“The pressures it faces are already significant: consumers shifting towards healthier options, squeezed margins and trust becoming the key battleground. Costa does not strengthen Coca-Cola against those challenges.
“Trust and value are earned differently in beverages compared to retail. Costa needs an owner who can invest in formats, supply chains and hospitality experience, while Coca-Cola should focus on its unique strengths.”
Who could buy Costa Coffee?
Last month, Sky News reported initial talks had already taken place with a small number of potential bidders, including private-equity firms. Names including Apollo Global Management and TDR Capital – the owner of UK grocer Asda – have emerged in recent days.
Michel Acda, a partner at European food and drinks consultancy Food Strategy Associates, suggests one possible suitor that has yet to be formally created.
Keurig Dr Pepper subsequently plans to separate the enlarged entity into two publicly traded entities named Beverage Co. and Global Coffee Co. “as soon as practicable following the close of the acquisition”.
Acda wonders if the new Global Coffee Co. could be a contender to buy Costa.
“I think in terms of change and dynamics, the question is: is that way too early or not for sure?"" Acda says
“It is an interesting hypothesis to chew on and to see whether that could be a logical route in in terms of being part of a pure-play space and just adding another channel and another brand to the house of brands that JDE Peet’s has.”
Bedwell says he can’t comment on potential specific buyers but he thinks three types of owners make sense: “A global operator experienced in scaling food and coffee retail, a UK retailer wanting to drive footfall and brand presence through coffee and food-to-go, or private capital with an eye on optimising the estate and positioning Costa for future growth.”
Torossian adds: “I heard they are in talks with a restaurant investment group already, but I wouldn’t rule out a PE group with expertise in foodservice. Maybe RBI [Restaurant Brands International] or Jollibee, considering coffee retail expertise, but overlaps make this less likely in the UK.”
While Coca-Cola isn't commenting directly on the future of Costa, it's clear that, seven years after a deal that gave the market a jolt, the company is mulling over its position in coffee.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/no-more-boring-nestl-next-134632667.html,1a79f1492fb61a52a9fd4e467dea1edf,No more  boring  Nestlé – what next after shock CEO sacking ? ,No more  boring  Nestlé – what next after shock CEO sacking ? ,2025-09-03 22:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Nestlé’s reputation as one of the consumer goods sector’s dependable names has taken a knock over the last couple of years and a second change at the top in 12 months – this time for personal reasons – has left industry watchers uncertain what lies ahead for the world’s largest food maker.
To say Nestlé’s dismissal of CEO – and company veteran Laurent Freixe – for an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate” took the market by surprise is something of an understatement.
In part, the reaction can be explained by the fact Freixe, with almost 40 years at Nestlé, was, when he took the helm a year ago, seen as a safe pair of hands who could rejuvenate a business that had seen sales growth slow and, to some, become less focused and a little bloated.
“Laurent Freixe’s departure … has left us shocked,” RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones said yesterday (1 September). “When he took over as CEO just over a year ago following Mark Schneider's ejection from the role, we thought of him as a Nestlé lifer who would restore the company’s reputation of slightly boring predictability. How wrong we were.”
Schneider’s departure, announced last August, may itself have raised eyebrows – at the time, one analyst described the move as “abrupt” – but Freixe was seen as the right successor to improve Nestlé’s execution and breathe fresh life into sales.
However, the company’s results for the second quarter of this year were seen as a disappointment, with underlying sales declining when the market was expecting growth.
Perhaps Nestlé’s share price has been the clearest sign investors hadn’t been impressed with the progress made under Freixe. Up to the close of trading yesterday, just hours before the company’s surprise announcement, shares in Nestlé had fallen almost 17% in the last 12 months.
Nestlé had started receiving anonymous reports via staff-disclosure channels in May. The company held an internal investigation during which Freixe denied the relationship. The Nestlé board then decided to open an “external investigation with the support of independent outside counsel, which had a wider remit”, a spokesperson says. The result was Freixe’s departure. The relationship breached Nestlé’s “code of business conduct”, the company said yesterday.
“This was a necessary decision,” chairman Paul Bulcke said. “Nestlé’s values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestlé.”
Nestlé’s new CEO
There will be plenty of speculation about whether Nestlé should've appointed Freixe in the first place. Inside Paradeplatzclaims Freixe had had a relationship with another Nestlé employee when he led the company's business in Hungary. The relationship is said to have led to the pair getting married.
There will also be questions about the efficacy of Nestlé's investigations into the claims about the latest relationship once it received tip-offs earlier this year.
Nevertheless, for industry watchers and investors, the big questions centre on what the tumult at the top of Nestlé means for the company's direction. There are differing views about what could come next.
The KitKat and Maggi maker has appointed Philipp Navratil, the CEO of Nestlé’s coffee business Nespresso, as its new chief executive.
Navratil has worked at Nestlé since 2001, holding roles in Central America before becoming the SVP of the company’s coffee strategic business unit in 2020.
Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott said today the appointment also came as “something of a surprise to us”, pointing to the fact Navratil was running Nestlé’s coffee business in Mexico as recently as 2020.
“We expect that investors will question the appointment of another Nestlé insider and perhaps also the seemingly rapid timescale of his appointment which presumably implies that no extensive external search was undertaken,” Elliott added.
The speed of events would make the lack of a wide-ranging outside search understandable, although some may argue a board should always maintain a list of possible candidates for chief executive.
In yesterday’s statement, Bulcke – who himself is set to leave Nestlé next year – was keen to underline Navratil’s credentials. “Philipp is recognised for his impressive track record of achieving results in challenging environments. Renowned for his dynamic presence, he inspires teams and leads with a collaborative, inclusive management style,” he said.
How might Nestlé’s strategy change?
In April next year, Nestlé is also set to have a new chairman. Three months ago, the Nescafé and Perrier manufacturer said Bulcke would not stand for re-election as chairman at the company’s next AGM in April. Bulcke has worked for the group for more than 40 years, including nine as CEO up to 2016 before he was succeeded by Mark Schneider.
Nestlé vice chair Pablo Isla, a member of the board since 2018, has been lined up to succeed Bulcke. Isla is best known for his 17 years at Inditex, with six as CEO at the multinational fashion group and then another 11 also as chairman.
In yesterday’s statement, Navratil indicated he would push on with Nestlé’s strategy as it stands. Last year, Freixe said the company would look to “invest for growth”, focus on “big bets” and “fix rather than sell” most of its under-performing businesses.
It’s just months since Freixe’s own review, which, alongside the talk of investing to accelerate sales, did see Nestlé cut its medium-term outlook for organic growth.
“I fully embrace the company’s strategic direction, as well as the action plan in place to drive Nestlé's performance,” Navratil said. “I look forward to working closely with the entire leadership of the company, in alignment with the board, chairman Paul Bulcke and chairman-designate Pablo Isla, to accelerate execution and to drive the value creation plan with intensity.”
RBC’s Jones believes “no big change in strategy seems likely in the short term” adding: “We don’t know the new CEO, Philipp Navratil. His background seems to have been largely in coffee and he is relatively young by the traditional standards of senior Nestlé managers at Nestlé: according to Google he was born in 1976. In the circumstances, it’s hard to argue if the board has decided on a different approach.”
Jefferies analyst David Hayes says some Nestlé investors may be concerned Navratil will look to conduct another review of the group so soon after Freixe led the last reassessment.
“While he has already outlined his support of the current plans laid out, we assume he will look to take ownership of his own agenda – and direct reports – in time,” Hayes said.
“That could see another review of investment plans and margin targets and portfolio assessment. In the meantime, that uncertainty and the lack of consistency at the top of the company are likely to be unhelpful to the share price for now, we think.”
At the time of writing (13:47 CEST), Nestlé’s share price is down 0.94% on the day, suggesting, overall, a muted market response to last night’s announcement.
Baader Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx posits that a “positive” way to look at the change at the top of Nestlé is the installation of a new CEO and chairman could spark much-needed change at the business.
He argues “a more severe pruning of the portfolio” at Nestlé is necessary. “I think many of the categories that are under-performing at the moment and have been under-performing various times over the last ten years should probably no longer be part of Nestlé,” von Arx says, pointing to assets including frozen foods and the company’s chocolate business in Europe “excluding KitKat”.
He adds: “Then Nestlé should focus on categories where, product-wise, it can really make a difference, where it can charge a premium price, where it can generate an EBIT margin between 15 and 20% and not continue to struggle fighting in categories where there is significant competition from private label, where there's a lack of differentiation in product and where size alone does not guarantee a sustainable business model anymore.”

Market sentiment has plummeted, according to the Crypto Fear and Greed Index. Sentiment has exited neutral territory and dropped into the “fear” zone, falling from 75 out of 100 in mid-August to 46 today—the worst score since mid-June.
This shift in sentiment comes as traders brace for what's historically been crypto's cruelest month: “Red Septmber.” Bitcoin has dropped an average of 3.77% in price each September since 2013.
The broader macroeconomic picture adds another layer of complexity. The Federal Reserve's September 16-17 policy meeting may well be one of the most contentious in years. With markets implying an 87% chance of a 0.25% cut, the crypto market finds itself at a crossroads between seasonal weakness and potential monetary policy relief.
Meanwhile, traditional markets are showing mixed signals, with the S&P 500 futures pointing to a positive open on Tuesday after Friday's volatility, while inflation remains above the Fed's target with core CPI at 3.1%.
But while the stock market is on holiday in the United States, crypto—of course—never rests. Here’s what the Bitcoin charts are showing today:
Bitcoin (BTC) price: Testing critical support
Bitcoin is showing resilience with a modest 0.53% gain to $108,842, recovering from an intraday low of $107,270. The flagship cryptocurrency has been bounced around into its current range (the white dotted line in the chart below), suggesting buyers are defending the psychologically important $108,000 level.
Bitcoin’s Average Directional Index, or ADX, currently stands at 20, indicating no clear trend at the comment. ADX measures trend strength on a scale from 0-100, where readings below 25 suggest choppy, directionless tradings.
In this case, Bitcoin’s score of 20 suggests its inability to move further up to new all-time highs or further down towards a death cross for now. For traders, this means Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase where range-trading strategies might outperform trend-following approaches.
The Relative Strength Index at 40 points shows that the Red September effect is real: Traders are starting to sell their coins faster than usual. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, measures market momentum on a scale from 0 to 100, where readings above 70 indicate overbought conditions and under 30 suggest oversold.
Right now Bitcoin is approaching oversold territory, with more people interested in getting rid of their coins than in buying them.
The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows ""off"" status, signaling that volatility has already been released rather than building up. This indicator identifies when markets compress before explosive moves. When it's ""off,"" it suggests the recent price action has already exhausted near-term volatility. The reading shows there is bearish movement, and that selling pressure remains dominant despite today's modest recovery.
Exponential moving averages, or EMAs, provide traders with a glimpse of price resistances and supports by taking the average price of an asset over short and longer time frames. Bitcoin’s EMA configuration remains bullish, with the 50-day EMA above the 200-day EMA
But current price action hovering near these averages suggests a battle between bulls and bears. It’s also worth noting that the gap between the two EMAs is starting to close. That’s not a good sign as it shows a deceleration of the bullish trend and could potentially lead the coin into a death cross configuration which, for traders, would confirm a solid bearish trend instead of just a correction.
On Myriad, a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, traders are feeling the bearish vibes. Myriad users now give Bitcoin a 75% chance of dropping to $105,000 sooner than later. A little over two weeks ago, the Myriad market had placed the odds of Bitcoin soaring to $125,000 at over 90%.
Key Levels:
Immediate support: $105,000 (psychological level and potential September target)
Immediate resistance: $113,000 (previous consolidation zone and EMA50 price line)
Ethereum (ETH) price: Bulls struggle against resistance
Ethereum is currently underperforming with a -0.66% decline to $4,363, despite opening just a bit higher at $4,392.87. The second-largest cryptocurrency briefly spiked to $4,490.97—a move of 2.2% from the open—but failed to hold gains, signaling rejection at the $4,500 resistance level.
Ethereum’s ADX at 28 tells a more bullish story than Bitcoin's, crossing above the crucial 25 threshold that confirms trend establishment. This reading suggests Ethereum's recent price action represents genuine trending behavior rather than random volatility. Traders typically view ADX above 25 as validation for trend-following strategies, though the current price weakness contradicts this bullish signal—a divergence that often precedes sharp moves.
On the other hand, ETH’s ADX score has been decreasing over time, which may point to a weakening trend in the near future.
The Squeeze Momentum Indicator suggests volatility is building after a compression phase, typically preceding breakout moves. This is probably one small consequence of the September Effect, with short-term traders trying to sell their coins fast and long-term traders buying for what they expect to be the bounce ahead.
Ethereum’s RSI at 57 is also in what traders would consider bullish territory. It’s been higher recently, which suggests the market is calming down. Position traders may be holding and waiting for explosive movements before making judgements.
The bullish EMA alignment (with the 50-day average above the 200-day average) provides structural support, but the failure to maintain above $4,400 raises concerns. The current setup shows Ethereum is still very bullish—way above the average price of the past 50 days and coiling for a significant move as it breaks a weak, short symmetrical triangle pattern.
Myriad traders are holding the bullish Ethereum line as well. Predictors on the platform place the odds at 77% that ETH continues its upward trajectory and hits $5,000 before the end of the year.
Key Levels:
Immediate support: $4,360 (intraday low)
Strong support: $4,000 (psychological level and 50-day EMA zone)
Immediate resistance: $4,490 (today's high)
Strong resistance: $4,500 (key technical barrier)
XRP price: Adrift at sea
XRP rounds out the major cryptocurrencies with a -0.5% decline to $2.76, showing relative weakness. The Ripple-linked token briefly touched $2.8387—a 2.3% intraday move—before sellers took control, pushing it down to $2.70.
The ADX at 19 is the weakest among the three top cryptocurrencies, firmly below the 25 trend threshold. This reading indicates XRP is stuck in a range-bound market with no clear directional bias. For traders, ADX below 20 typically suggest they should avoid trend-following strategies and instead focus on support and resistance levels for range trading. A low reading like this after recent volatility often marks accumulation phases before the next trending move.
Despite the Squeeze Momentum being ""on,"" XRP's inability to hold gains above $2.80 suggests bears remain in control. The indicator's activation combined with weak ADX creates what technical analysts call a ""coiled spring"" scenario. Extended periods of low ADX often lead to violent breakouts when they finally occur, though direction remains uncertain.
The price action shows a potential descending triangle pattern that might end in a bearish breakout, potentially testing the 200-day EMA support or even lower. It’s especially worth noting that XRP has now broken below the 50-day EMA support, which means bears are in control—at least in the short term.
The RSI at 40 points confirms the coin is heading into oversold territory, with sellers in control, though still not in full panic mode.
Myriad traders believe XRP drops to $2.50 before it ever reaches $4 per coin, placing those odds at 78% now.
Key Levels:
Immediate support: $2.70 (today's low, psychological level, and the actual support of the descending triangle)
Strong support: $2.50 (previous consolidation base and EMA200 price zone)

The dispatch
Asked to name an industry in which the U.K. excels, many in business would cite life sciences.
In AstraZeneca and GSK, the country boasts two of the world's 15 largest pharmaceutical companies — only the United States and Switzerland can match that — and, in Cambridge, Oxford and Imperial College London, three of the world's top 10 universities for life sciences. It is also one of the top five global investment destinations for life sciences research.
Beneath the surface, though, all is not well. Relations between the government and the U.K. pharmaceuticals industry — whose trade body, as well as AZ and GSK, includes the domestic arms of multinationals like Pfizer, Sanofi, Merck, Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb — have frayed over the issue of drug pricing.
Most branded medicines in the U.K. are bought by the state-run National Health Service (NHS). Thanks to its size — it accounts for roughly 85% of healthcare spending — the NHS enjoys huge buying power.
This has for decades been underpinned by voluntary pricing agreements — voluntary in the sense that non-voluntary terms would have been worse — between the industry and the NHS. The latest of these, the Voluntary Scheme for Branded Medicines Pricing, Access and Growth (VPAG), came into effect in January last year.
Under the scheme, agreed between the government, NHS England and the industry body, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), a cap is set on how much the NHS spends annually on branded medicines. This cap is currently allowed to increase by 2% per year, rising to 4% a year by 2027. To enforce the cap, pharmaceutical companies agree to repay a percentage of drug sales to the NHS via a rebate or ""clawback."" Over the last 11 years, this rebate has averaged just over 10%, but in December last year Wes Streeting, the current secretary of state for health, shocked the industry by setting a rate of 23% — significantly ahead of the expected 15%.
The ABPI immediately warned this would put ""a very real strain on companies"" and put at risk U.K. industry growth and investment.
It pointed out that, at 9% of U.K.'s healthcare spending, the NHS deploys a smaller share of overall healthcare costs on medicines than any comparable country, with France spending 15% and Germany and Italy 17%.
Negotiations have since rumbled on but, 12 days ago, Streeting abandoned talks after the ABPI rejected an offer from him which had included lower rebate rates in all future years of the scheme and a rise in both the price of new medicines and net spending on them.
He told newspapers: ""I won't allow big pharma to rip off our patients or taxpayers.""
A life sciences superpower?
The danger for Streeting, who is widely seen as a possible successor to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is that the row hurts the wider economy.
It has already soured relations between the government and AZ, whose chief executive, Pascal Soriot, in July announced plans to invest some $50 billion in the U.S (which last year accounted for 43% of the company's global sales) by 2030 and who followed this up on an earnings call by calling AZ a ""very American company"". The significance of this was that, according to reports in The Times, Soriot had privately discussed moving the primary listing of AZ, the biggest company in the FTSE-100, to New York.
While he is the biggest name in U.K. pharma, Soriot is not the only industry leader unhappy at the level of the rebate.
John McGinley, U.K. country president for Pfizer, said in an ABPI report published in March that the unexpected hike in the rebate was ""incompatible with the U.K. government's ambitions to be a global life sciences leader.""
In the same report, Doina Ionescu, Merck's general manager for the U.K. and Ireland, called the new rate ""unaffordable,"" adding that it would hamper ""our ability to discover innovative medicines and deliver them to patients.""
The latest critic is Johan Kahlström, U.K. managing director of Novartis, who last week told the BBC the U.K. had ""become largely uninvestable"" for drugmakers.
Lurking in the background is U.S. President Donald Trump. The president has demanded pharma companies cut drug prices in the U.S. to bring them in line with those in Europe and Canada. This price differential largely reflects how the U.S. healthcare system is structured but, nonetheless, has allowed Trump to argue that American patients subsidize their counterparts elsewhere.
Companies like Eli Lilly have said that, for drug prices to fall in the U.S., the price paid for drugs by healthcare systems elsewhere may need to rise. It last week temporarily suspended U.K. shipments of Mounjaro, its weight-loss drug, ahead of a big price increase this month.
So, Trump's demands intensify the need for drugmakers to extract better terms from the U.K. government. Compounding the problem, they may not want to agree these terms until they know more about Trump's proposed tariffs on pharmaceutical imports, which are likely to have an inflationary impact on U.S. selling prices and thus put even more pressure on them to raise prices elsewhere.
The row over the rebate may have other unwanted side-effects. It gives drugmakers like AZ an excuse to divert research and development spending to the U.S. as Trump is demanding.
They are also less likely to launch new medicines in the U.K. — something already happening because of another running sore for the industry, namely the criteria used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body accountable to the Department of Health that decides whether new drugs represent good value for money to the NHS.
It all leaves the U.K. government, which has pledged to make the country a ""life sciences superpower,"" in a bind.

Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. At the time of writing, nine of the top 10 coins per market capitalization have increased over the past 24 hours, though some of them have barely moved.
Bitcoin (BTC) appreciated 2% at the time of writing, now trading at $110,245.
At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 0.3%, meaning that it’s mostly unchanged, now changing hands at $4,399. This is the lowest increase in this category.
The biggest rise in the category is XRP (XRP)’s and Solana (SOL)’s 2.1% each to the prices of $2.8 and $203, respectively.
The only red coin currently is Binance Coin (BNB), having decreased by 0.5%, changing hands at $854.
As for the top 100 coins, MemeCore (M) appreciated the most by far: 33.3% to the price of $0.8588.
It’s followed by Pump.fun (PUMP)’s 9.6% to $0.003756.
Of the ten red coins, the highest decrease is recorded by World Liberty Financial (WLFI): 14.3% to $0.2432. It’s the only double-digit drop. It plummeted on its first day of trading, erasing early gains, resulting in immediate losses for investors.
Official Trump (TRUMP) is next, with a decrease of 7.2% to $8.36.
The rest of the red coins are down 2.9% and less per coin.
Meanwhile, Delphi Digital warned that a US Federal Reserve rate cut could prompt a short-term spike followed by a steep correction, unless price action remains subdued heading into the decision.
James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, noted that Bitcoin was at the $107,000 level just days ago, so the current level of about $110,000 is neither “a strong start” of the month, nor does it “exactly reinforce September as one of Bitcoin’s weakest months.” Still, “sentiment can change on a dime,” Toledano warned.
Historically, BTC has often ended September in the red, averaging a ~3%–4% decline since 2013. “This year may be different, given how tariffs have hit the index, and recent Septembers have shown moderate losses, with some even posting gains. September often pressures Bitcoin, but it’s not a guaranteed down month,” the exec says.
Toledano continues: “As usual, some in the DeFi circles spin these false narratives into patterns that don’t exist with sentiment-driven assets.” Risks for 2025 are still thin liquidity, leveraged positioning, and uncertainty around the US Federal Reserve’s September meeting.
“A rate cut could inject momentum and help Bitcoin hold its ground. A decisive break below $105K risks sub-$100K levels, but institutional inflows via ETFs, growing expectations of Fed cuts, could offset seasonal pressure. Holding above $110K into mid-September may weaken the perceived curse, setting the stage for the more bullish October,” he concludes.
Moreover, analysts from the crypto exchange Bitfinex commented that major coins “endured a difficult week as macro jitters and the post-PPI sell-off weighed heavily on price action.”
The pullback, they argued, follows their prediction that BTC is likely to be prone to retracements and range trading in summer. “We believe the market is nearing the bottom of this downturn as we move into September,” the analysts said.
When it comes to altcoins, the analysts expect the pullback to reach a conclusion relatively soon in September. The altcoin market seeing sharp rotations is a signal of majors seeing capital eventually flowing back in, particularly if the overall market declines further from current levels.
“The market would likely view such a development as a signal that a bottom is being reached, which would be in line with our end-of-summer thesis, which is when ETF flows across major asset classes pick up,” Bitfinex analysts conclude.
At the time of writing on Tuesday morning, BTC trades at $110,245. It jumped from an intraday low of $107,542 to the day’s highest point of $110,507.
The price is currently moving towards the intraweek high of $113,220. The weekly time range has also turned slightly green after days of red.
Investors are now looking at resistance near $111,350–$113,500, which would lead to $115,700, as well as support at $107,335 and $105,150.

Ethereum is currently trading at $4,399. It decreased from the day’s highest point of $4,481 to the lowest of $4,238, before recovering to the current level.
Should the price continue to rise, it could hit $4,665, followed by $4,865. Conversely, it may drop to $4,265 and move lower to $4,070.
Notably, the crypto market sentiment still stands within the fear zone. The crypto fear and greed index remained unmoved, standing at 39 today.
This signals that caution turned into fear, which could continue pushing the prices down. Investors are keeping an eye on any incoming geopolitical and economic signals.

Why did crypto move against stocks today?
The crypto market increased over the past day. There is no data for the stock market because, unlike crypto, it’s closed on bank holidays. On its previous day of trading, on Friday, the stock market decreased, following quarterly earnings reports and other US economic data.

Yield on the 20-year debt is at its highest since 1999 at 2.695%, up 80 basis points in 2025.
Japanese government bond yields have been notching fresh highs as investors price in persistent inflation, tighter monetary policy, as well as fiscal uncertainty. Japan's 30-year bond yield notched a record high on Wednesday to hit 3.286%, surging more than 100 basis points this year, while yield on the 20-year debt is at its highest since 1999 at 2.695%, up 80 basis points, LSEG data showed. The benchmark 10-year bond yield is hovering at its highest since 2008 at 1.633%, over 50 basis points higher in 2025. The 40-year yield is up around 90 basis points year-to-date at 3.506%. Rising yields translate directly into higher borrowing costs for the government, corporates and down the economy — particularly worrisome for Japan that is seeing weak growth and facing headwinds from U.S. tariffs, even as they have been relaxed from what was proposed earlier. Market watchers point to a cocktail of domestic and global forces behind the relentless surge in Japanese yields: the Bank of Japan's ongoing policy normalization, inflation data that remains stubbornly above target, and political uncertainty that has emboldened fiscal expansion expectations. ""There's a lot of uncertainty in Japan,"" said Julien Houdain, head of global unconstrained fixed income at Schroders. ""Inflation is too high, real rates are too low — still way negative compared to other parts of the world where real rates have all moved positive a long time ago."" Japan's real policy rate is at about -2.6%. Consumer prices have stayed above the BOJ's 2% target for three straight years. The central bank has nudged up its short-term policy rate and scaled back bond-buying operations, all signaling that keeping yields contained will be a tough ask. JP30Y YTD mountain Yields on 30-year Japan government bonds since the start of the year ""So the BOJ is under pressure, definitely … The 10-year, 30-year points are suffering, and there's more and more competition globally for central banks and governments to find lenders at the long end,"" said Houdain, noting that the BOJ was treading a balancing act to normalize policy without destabilizing the long-end of the bond market. Overseas investors' appetite for Japanese bonds has also declined, with purchases slowing since April, Japan Securities Dealers Association data showed. The total purchase amount by foreigners fell 6% to 7.66 trillion yen in July compared to April's figures. Some overseas investors have also been unloading government bonds and rotating into Japanese equities , driving its stock markets to fresh highs, analysts who spoke to CNBC noted. Political compulsions could lead to measures that expand the country's fiscal deficit, further raising borrowing costs. In July's upper-house election, opposition parties campaigning on consumption tax cuts made significant gains, weakening Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition. Barclays analysts note that the 30-year JGB term premium was already pricing in fiscal expansion ""equivalent to 1–2pp of consumption tax cuts."" They warned that if broader opposition policies are adopted, ""more drastic tax cuts could result in more significant upward pressure on JGB term premia and yields."" On Tuesday, Ishiba reportedly said he has ""no intention at all of clinging"" to his post. If he resigns, there could be a shift toward an era of multi-party systems, as well as a move toward an aggressive fiscal policy in Japan, said Ken Katsumoto, Japan macro strategist at Credit Agricole CIB. Repatriation in sight? Prolonged elevated yields are raising questions on whether higher JGB yields will impact domestic appetite to invest abroad, while also sparking a repatriation of capital. David Roberts, head of fixed income at Nedgroup Investments, said the repatriation has started, noting that his team has shifted funds out of the U.S. and UK into Japanese bonds for the first time in decades. ""This is the first time since I started managing funds in the 1990s I have bought Japanese bonds,"" he told CNBC. Japanese life insurers have also been net buyers of JGBs, focused on shorter-duration debt, while selling foreign bonds in July 2025, Eastspring Investments' fixed income portfolio manager Rong Ren Goh noted. While some investors are starting to find the yields attractive enough, they're not piling into long-term JGBs just yet because inflation and BOJ's policy have clouded the outlook for yields. ""Investors [will be] in no major hurry to aggressively leg into duration even as valuations appear more compelling,"" said Goh. Barclays' Kadota emphasized it could take time for flows to shift back home more concretely as Bank of Japan continues to embark on its quantitative tightening cycle. ""The Bank of Japan is still on a hiking cycle, so investors are not rushing to buy JGBs yet until the end of the normalization cycle is in sight."" State Street's head of Japan markets, Masahiko Loo, said that massive repatriation concerns from the U.S. are ""not warranted,"" noting that much of Japan's holdings — like foreign reserves and pension funds — are structural and tied to the U.S.-Japan relationship. Banks, meanwhile, have plenty of cash parked at the BOJ they would shift into JGBs before selling foreign assets, while life insurers have already cut their overseas exposure during the Fed's last hiking cycle. ""Rising JGB yields do not imply a capital repatriation wave or a situation in which Japanese investors are pulling funds from the US, ultimately leading to global market disruption,"" he said. UK 2022 gilt redux The sharp volatility in superlong JGBs since early this year, which accelerated further heading into the upper-house election in July when fiscal loosening became a major theme, spurred debates on whether Japan was heading into its own version of a so-called ""Truss moment,"" Barclays analysts noted in August. In 2022, then UK Prime Minister Liz Truss unleashed a wave of market panic with unfunded tax cuts that forced the Bank of England into emergency action after 30-year gilt yields soared by over 100 basis points. Stress has been building at the long-end of the yield curve, where investors are most sensitive to fiscal credibility. ""Both [UK and Japan] feature risks concentrated more on the long end of the curve with the 30+ year maturities,"" said Michael Gayed, author of the Lead Lag Report. ""Plus, there are also fiscal concerns in the background centered around how to stimulate growth without taking on too much debt,"" he said. While Barclays said, ""Japan's striking similarities to the UK suggest that a 'Truss moment' for Japan may not be as remote a risk as many may believe,"" it is important to stress that some of Japan's fiscal context differs from the UK's. Japan's pension sector is unlikely to face a systemic crisis as seen in the UK, given key differences, most notably in derivatives usage, said State Street's Loo. UK pension funds used a lot of leverage and derivatives which magnified the impact of rising yields, he explained, leading to the panic. Conversely in Japan, pension funds tend to calculate their obligations using a fixed discount rate instead of marking them against current market rates. That means they apply a long-term assumed return to discount their future liabilities, and this assumption remains constant even when bond yields spike.",5302e36c3088c295dab25944820c7e61,trafilatura,7540,0

Contribution by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, to IMF Finance & Development Magazine
The digital euro project has a simple motivation: to ensure that people in a digital world retain the option to make or receive payments in central bank money. Supplementing physical cash with digital cash will support the modernization of the traditional two-tier monetary system that allows both cash and bank deposits as a medium of exchange.
The evolution of the two-tier monetary system over the past 300 years has provided a strong foundation for the operation of the broader financial system and has enabled central banks to deliver price stability effectively. While it is possible to theorize about alternative monetary systems in which central bank money plays only a wholesale role, prudence suggests that the retail role should be preserved, including through the introduction of a digital euro.
Central banks have a mandate to safeguard monetary stability in all circumstances. This calls for a cautious yet forward-looking approach that takes into account not only baseline scenarios but also tail risks of the future development of the monetary system. A digital euro will minimize the likelihood of adverse economic outcomes in the future and ensure the resilience of the monetary system in an increasingly digital world.
Cash issued by the central bank has historically played a critical role in maintaining trust in the convertibility of commercial bank money to central bank money. While convertibility is largely taken for granted, it’s not obvious that the two-tier monetary system would necessarily remain stable if ongoing digitalization meant that convertibility to physical cash lost relevance and a digital cash option was not made available.
Monopoly power
Compared with other services, payment instruments exhibit exceptionally strong network externalities—they gain value as more people use them. This is one reason using central bank money for payments improves economic efficiency: It limits the scope for commercial payment systems to exploit monopoly power by charging excessive fees. As the share of digital transactions increases, the option to make payments in digital euros can limit the potential monopoly power of the firms at the centre of private sector payment networks.
In addition, public access to central bank money provides a reliable fallback option to using commercial bank money for some types of transactions if there is disruption of the commercial banking system, whether from technical problems or a cyberattack. This is one reason policymakers want a digital euro to work offline as well as online.
Some argue that an alternative approach in adapting the monetary system to a digital age would be to promote stablecoins, issued and operated by private sector intermediaries. However, stablecoins are best understood as expanding the private money universe— as another substitute for bank deposits—rather than as a true substitute for central bank money. A stable value of a stablecoin in terms of currency is not intrinsic (unlike a liability of the central bank). Even a highly liquid backing portfolio does not guarantee convertibility under all scenarios.
By contrast, a well-designed digital euro promises to modernize the two-tier monetary system without destabilizing financial institutions or disrupting monetary policy implementation or transmission. Among other features, appropriately calibrated limits on digital euro holdings can provide people sufficient digital cash for transactions while preventing excessive outflows from commercial banks and outsize expansion of the central bank balance sheet.
Moreover, since people will set up digital euro accounts primarily via their banks (or other payment service providers), close interconnection will continue between central bank money and commercial bank money. If banks and other payment service providers carry out the necessary know-your-customer checks, maximum privacy will be maintained, and the central bank will not be privy to individual account details.
Unifying fragmented markets
For the euro area, a digital euro offers additional benefits in a multicountry monetary union. Among other factors, the euro area payment system is highly fragmented along national lines: Customers must typically rely on non-European card or e-wallet providers to make payments across the euro area. By mandating acceptance of a digital euro, instant network effects would help unify the currently fragmented market.
A digital euro would reduce costs for merchants and businesses by providing the network infrastructure for an areawide payment systems on a not-for-profit basis. It would increase bargaining power vis-à-vis international card networks for both in-person transactions and e-commerce. A digital euro thereby promises to enable an areawide fast payment system at the point of interaction (POI) between customers and merchants. With conflicting incentives across operators of legacy national payment systems, such an area-wide POI fast payment system will not likely develop without a digital euro.
A digital euro would also provide an important foundation for fintech innovation across the continent. A standardized, pan-European platform would allow private providers to innovate while benefiting from the economies of scale of the underlying digital euro network, ultimately reducing costs for consumers and businesses alike.
In particular, by linking customers and merchants across the euro area via a system of digital euro accounts, card and e-wallet providers could focus on additional payment services while the underlying payments travel via the rails of a digital euro system. Separation of the basic plumbing of the payment system (the digital euro network) from the delivery of add-on services also lowers the risk of lock-in effects—when one private payment network with a transitory technological advantage suppresses subsequent innovation in order to keep the upper hand.
Symbol of unity
To sum up, a retail role for central bank money is arguably integral to the sovereign foundations of the monetary system. In particular, the singleness, effectiveness, and stability of the monetary system are ultimately underpinned by the sovereign (or, in the case of the euro area, the joint sovereignty of the European Union’s member states). The monetary role of the sovereign spans the institutional foundations of the monetary system (including the definition and enforcement of legal tender), the maintenance of the budgetary discipline required to ensure that monetary policy is insulated from fiscal dominance, and the delegation of various monetary tasks to the central bank.
A retail role for central bank money maintains the direct monetary relationship between the sovereign and the citizen. It reinforces public understanding that monetary stability is intrinsic to sovereignty. This consideration is especially relevant in a European context, with the common currency seen as a critical mechanism for greater economic and political integration among member countries. Beyond its economic and monetary roles, the euro is an important symbol of European unity. This must be maintained in a digital age.

Regarding tariffs, a federal appeals court ruled late last Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs without Congressional approval, but the court let the tariffs remain in place while appeals continue. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court said, ""The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax."" The case now appears to be headed to the Supreme Court for a final decision. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.

That was one of the underlying themes of a highly-anticipated ruling issued late Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta. After ruling that Google's dominant search engine had turned into an illegal monopoly back in August 2024, the judge spent the next 13 months mulling the best way to rein in the technology powerhouse's bad behavior.
At the same time, the technology landscape had been thrust into the throes of a tectonic shift that couldn't have been anticipated in October 2020 when the Justice Department filed its landmark antitrust case against Google. At that time, few people had even heard of OpenAI, let alone its chatbot ChatGPT, which wasn't released until late 2022.
Artificial intelligence rarely came up during the 2024 trial that culminated in Google being declared a monopoly, but the technology's role became a focal point in t he remedy hearings earlier this spring — especially AI's role in spawning conversational “answer engines” from ChatGPT and Perplexity. Those advances made the judge reluctant to use his legal power to override what may already be happening through technological evolution.
Mehta ended up crafting a subdued ruling that rejected the Justice Department's push to have Google sell its popular Chrome web browser and block the company from paying — more than $20 billion annually — to make its search engine the default on popular devices and web browsers.
Instead of embracing those drastic measures, Mehta chose to prescribe what most analysts and antitrust experts viewed as a light-handed punishment, which propelled the stock price of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. to a new high of $230.86 during Wednesday's trading.
But the judge is still shaking things up by requiring Google to share some of the secret sauce in its recipe for success — the massive trove of search data that it has accumulated from billions of users since the company's 1998 inception in a Silicon Valley garage. Parts of those databases will be opened up to rival search engines such as DuckDuckGo and other “qualified competitors.""
Mehta's ruling is being viewed widely as little more than a slap on the wrist, prompting reactions of disappointment and disdain. “It is a historic misfire that fails to meet the enormity of the finding that Google is a monopolist in online search,” said Christo Wilson, a Northeastern University computer sciences professor, who has studied Google's operations.
Investors are clearly betting that it will remain mostly business as usual at Google, which is expected to generate nearly $400 billion in revenue this year. As of early Wednesday afternoon, Alphabet's stock price had surged by 9%, creating an additional $230 billion in shareholder wealth.
The Trump Administration still finds reason to celebrate
Even though the judge rebuffed most of the Justice Department's proposed remedies, the agency maintained the case would foster more competition in the online search market.
“This decision marks an important step forward in the Department of Justice’s ongoing fight to protect American consumers,"" U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.
The case is uniquely tied to President Donald Trump, given that it began during his first term in office and is wrapping up during the early stages of his second stint in the White House.
But outsiders don't see much for the Justice Department to crow about in Mehta's ruling, especially since it explicitly cited the attempt to force a breakup of Google as a bridge too far.
The decision “may prove to be at best a pyrrhic victory,” predicted Joseph V. Coniglio, director of antitrust and innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank that gets some of its funding from Alphabet and other technology companies.
“After making the legally sound and morally courageous decision to find Google liable for illegal monopolistic practices, Judge Mehta apparently decided that actually enforcing the law was more than he could stomach,” lamented Barry Lynn, executive director for the Open Markets Institute, a group focused on minimizing corporate power.
Will consumers' search experience change?
The most noticeable changes in Google will probably continue to come through its responses to AI-driven competition from ChatGPT, Perplexity and others. That's been the case since Google began to highlight AI-produced summaries at the top of its search results last year and then introduced its own version of an answer engine — via AI mode — a few months ago.
But Google will probably still be the main engine answering queries entered on the iPhone and other internet access points since the judge decided that the company is still allowed to dole out billions to be the default search choice on devices and browsers. The rationale for allowing all that money to flow went something like this: If the payments were banned, Google would be able to hoard the cash to become even more powerful and most consumers would still end up using its search engine on the iPhone and other devices because it's still best in class.
Investors also liked the idea of that part of the search status quo being maintained, paving the way for Apple to continue to be paid more than $20 billion annually by Google. Apple's shares rose more than 3% in Wednesday's afternoon trading.
Google will work to share its data
The logistics of sharing all of that search data still needs to be worked out, but Mehta did try to limit access to Google's data in a way to protect consumer privacy. He also wants to give Google rivals just enough information that will allow them to improve the relevance of their own search results, but prevent competitors from poaching all the information that Google has stockpiled during the past 27 years.
It's still unclear when the data sharing will begin because Google could still delay Mehta's ruling from taking effect through legal appeals. The company has already vowed to appeal last year's decision condemning its search engine as a monopoly, a process that couldn't start until the remedy ruling was made.
The Justice Department also said it is weighing a possible appeal in an attempt to gain more court-ordered changes to Google's business practices.",761566cd45ffcc7afdae918a47ddbd22,trafilatura,6519,0

In fact, the company has been one of Wall Street’s favorites this year, and for good reason. Business momentum remains solid, and broader demand for cutting-edge security solutions is getting stronger.
At the heart of CrowdStrike’s growth story is its artificial intelligence (AI) driven Falcon platform, built to spot, prevent, and neutralize threats with real-time precision. Now, CrowdStrike is back in the spotlight after its latest earnings release. While the earnings revealed GAAP losses and a revenue guidance that came in lighter than many had hoped, the report still carried plenty of positives. Investors seemed to agree, pushing CRWD stock up 4.6% in the trading session following its Aug. 27 results. So, does this make CrowdStrike a buy right now?
With a market capitalization hovering around $106 billion, CrowdStrike is widely recognized in the cybersecurity space for its cloud-based platform, which helps protect the most critical aspects of a company’s digital operations, such as devices, cloud systems, employee identities, and sensitive data. The core of its approach is the Falcon platform, which utilizes AI to sort through massive amounts of data in real-time.
By identifying patterns in attacks, monitoring hacker techniques, and gathering signals from across networks, Falcon can quickly detect and stop threats while also highlighting areas that may be at risk. Unlike many traditional security tools, Falcon was built in the cloud from the start. That means it only requires a single lightweight agent to function, making it faster to roll out, easier to manage, and more efficient at protecting businesses without adding extra complexity.
Last July, CrowdStrike grabbed headlines for all the wrong reasons after a faulty update to its Falcon Sensor software caused nearly 8.5 million Microsoft (MSFT) Windows systems to crash worldwide. But despite that setback, CRWD stock has made a remarkable comeback, surging 75% from its September 2024 low of $242.25. So far in 2025, the momentum hasn’t slowed. Shares are up 24% year-to-date (YTD), towering over the broader S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 10% gain.
A Look Inside CrowdStrike Q2 Earnings Results
CrowdStrike once again proved its resilience with a robust set of fiscal 2026 second-quarter results, beating Wall Street’s expectations and showing why the firm remains a force in cybersecurity. The company reported revenue of $1.17 billion, up 21% year-over-year (YOY) and ahead of the $1.15 billion that analysts had forecast. Subscription revenue continued to be the growth engine, climbing 20% to $1.10 billion, while professional services surged 45% to $66.01 million.
Much of this strength came from accelerating enterprise adoption and steady demand for its AI-driven security solutions. For a subscription-driven model, the real highlight was annual recurring revenue (ARR), which increased a notable 20% from the previous year to $4.66 billion. Net new ARR hit a record $221 million, the highest quarterly addition in the company’s history, showcasing the stickiness of Falcon even as the company continues to navigate the aftershocks of last year’s outage.
Profitability, however, took a step back. The company reported a net loss of $0.31 per share, compared to a net income of $0.19 per share a year earlier, as operating expenses and R&D investments weighed on its results. On an adjusted basis, though, earnings were $0.93 per share, up 5.7% from last year and comfortably above Wall Street’s $0.83 estimate.
Cash generation was another area of strength. Operating cash flow reached a record $333 million, while free cash flow hit a new high of $284 million. The balance sheet appeared even stronger, with cash and cash equivalents rising to a record $4.97 billion as of July 31, 2025.
CrowdStrike also announced an acquisition aimed at strengthening its platform. The company agreed to acquire Onum, a specialist in real-time telemetry pipeline management. Onum’s stateless, in-memory architecture is expected to boost Falcon Next-Gen SIEM by improving speed, scalability, and data onboarding efficiency. Importantly, the deal enables Falcon’s AI-powered detections to be applied to third-party data sources, allowing analysis to begin before the data even enters the platform.
Looking ahead, management guided Q3 revenue to be in a range of $1.208 billion to $1.218 billion. While slightly under consensus estimates of $1.23 billion, the guidance still reflects healthy double-digit growth. The caution stems from ongoing remediation and retention incentives tied to the 2024 outage. Meanwhile, adjusted EPS for the quarter is expected to be between $0.93 and $0.95, signaling a continued focus on balancing growth with profitability.
What Do Analysts Think About CrowdStrike Stock?
After CrowdStrike posted its latest earnings, Wall Street quickly adjusted expectations, but without losing faith in CRWD stock’s long-term trajectory. For instance, Jefferies trimmed its price target to $500 from $530 but reaffirmed a “Buy” rating, signaling confidence in the company’s long-term growth story despite near-term headwinds.
DA Davidson also lowered its target, cutting it to $490 from $530 while maintaining a “Buy” rating. Needham joined the group, reducing its target to $475 from $530, but maintaining its bullish stance. In short, while price targets have been adjusted downward to reflect cautious guidance, Wall Street still sees plenty of potential in CrowdStrike stock.
Overall, CrowdStrike still has Wall Street in its corner, carrying a ""Moderate Buy” consensus rating that signals steady confidence in the cybersecurity giant. Of the 48 analysts covering the stock, a majority of 26 analysts rate it a “Strong Buy,” three suggest a “Moderate Buy,” 18 analysts play it safe with a “Hold,” and one analysts gives a “Strong Sell” rating.
CRWD stock’s average analyst price target of $469.30 signals 11% potential upside from current levels. The Street-high target of $575 implies that shares could rally as much as 36% from here.

Business leaders are reacting with a mix of disappointment and approval.
Critics say Mehta's remedies are not sufficient to address the extent of Google's monopoly.
Google has been spared from the worst, and the business and tech community is weighing in.
On Tuesday, Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled that Google will not be forced to divest from Chrome and its Android operating system, after Google was found in 2024 to have illegally maintained a monopoly.
In the 230-page decision, Mehta said that Google won't be allowed to have an exclusive contract regarding the distribution of its search engines and apps and that the company must share information such as user interaction data and search index with competitors.
Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, argued earlier this year that the Justice Department's proposed remedies were essentially a ""de facto divestiture"" of its search business and warned they would have ""many unintended consequences.""
The DOJ and several states first sued Google in 2020, accusing it of monopolizing online search. Last year, Mehta ruled that Google had violated antitrust law, ruling that ""Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.""
Here is what business leaders, including some rivals to Google, have said since the Tuesday ruling.
Gabriel Weinberg
Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, wrote in a statement on X that he doesn't believe that the court-order remedies would ""force the changes necessary"" to address ""Google's illegal behavior.""
""Google will still be allowed to continue to use its monopoly to hold back competitors, including in AI search,"" said Weinberg, whose company is considered a direct competitor to Google's search engine.
""As a result, consumers will continue to suffer. We believe Congress should now step in to swiftly make Google do the thing it fears the most: compete on a level playing field,"" Weinberg added.
Tim Sweeney
Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, wrote on X Tuesday evening that Google lost the search antitrust case, but ""resoundingly"" won the remedies phase.
""They can continue doing all of the stuff the court found unlawful, but with some minor new data sharing obligations limiting search default payoffs to 1-year terms,"" said Sweeney.
Epic Games, the company that created Fortnite, won an antitrust lawsuit against Google and its app store practices in December 2023. In October 2024, a judge issued a nationwide three-year injunction requiring Google to allow rival app stores to be distributed via Google Play. Google was able to temporarily pause the injunction while appealing the case, but a federal appeals court later upheld the original verdict in July 2025.
""It's like a defendant robbed a series of banks and the court verdict found them guilty, then sentenced them to probation under which they may continue robbing banks but must share data on how they rob banks with competing bank robbers,"" Sweeney added in the thread.
Danielle Coffey
Danielle Coffey, CEO of the News/Media Alliance, told Business Insider that this is a ""missed opportunity,"" but it's not the end.
""We are disappointed that Judge Mehta's ruling did not include an opt-out of AI without effectively disappearing from search,"" said Coffey, ""And that leaves us with little options in the use of our content and little to no revenue for our quality journalism.""
The News/Media Alliance submitted an amicus brief, hoping that newsrooms and other content-creating platforms could opt out of appearing in Google's AI Overview without disappearing from search results altogether.
""There are statistics that show that we're not seeing traffic come from AI overviews and AI mode,"" said Coffey. ""By its nature, it's answering the question rather than redirecting the user.""
Google
Google posted a statement after the ruling that the decision is a response to how AI changed the industry by giving people more ways to find information.
""This underlines what we've been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want,"" Google said in a statement following the ruling. ""That's why we disagree so strongly with the Court's initial decision in August 2024 on liability.
""Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,"" the statement continued. ""We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely.""
Adam Kovacevich
Adam Kovacevich, the founder and CEO of Chamber of Progress, a tech-industry coalition, wrote on X on Tuesday that Mehta's decision is ""mindful"" even though ""longtime Google haters"" wanted ""fantastical remedies.""
""His ruling today cited the MSFT precedent nine different times: Remedies must be 'tailored to fit the wrong creating the occasion for the remedy,'"" said Kovacevich.
""Mehta spent 29 pages of his ruling discussing how competitive the AI space has become, and how that threatens traditional search engines,"" Kovacevich added. ""It's a reminder of how competitive innovation is a hare to antitrust law's tortoise.""
Brendan Eich
Brendan Eich, the CEO of Brave Software, the company behind the open-source browser Brave, said it was disappointing that the ruling didn't go further in addressing how Google monetized its dominance.
In an amicus curiae cited by Mehta, Brave had argued against letting Google offer syndication at ""marginal cost,"" saying it would only encourage copycat search engines to free-ride on Google's work.
""We can't beat Google the convicted monopoly abuser on payment, though,"" Eich wrote on X. ""Disappointing the verdict seems not to have addressed monetization, which is the direct way to open up competition.""
In a follow-up post, Eich also criticized the amount of discretion left to a technical committee, warning that key parameters like revenue-share caps remain undefined.
""What is going on, comrades?"" he added. ""I expected Trump 2 DOJ to be less Sovietnik... Silly me!""",922d324461847d1e9afd6b1b94159011,trafilatura,6116,0

Finding yourself in credit card debt is severely unfortunate. But how do you even know when things have spiraled to a level that is nearly or totally out of control?
GOBankingRates spoke with financial experts to learn five of the key signs you have a serious debt problem — and some steps you can take to fix it.
You’re Just Making the Minimum Payments
If you’re making only the minimum payments due on your credit card every month, you’re throwing money away at a hazardous rate.
“Have you found the lowest monthly payment on your credit cards?” said Shawn Carpenter, chairman and CEO at Stock Alarm. “This is a classic sign that things are looking bad. It’s easy to get caught in this trap, but how can you pay more on that debt and increase your interest rate? It’s crazy.”
“A credit score drop is a big red flag,” Carpenter said. “If it’s because you’re maxing out your cards or missing payments, you’re in troubled waters.”
You’re Stressed Out and Anxious
How you feel in terms of mental health matters, and when a debt problem becomes serious, it can take its toll here.
“If you’re having trouble sleeping at night, are anxious and stressed consistently, or feel your physical or mental health declining because of debt worries, then you likely have a serious debt problem,” said Erika Kullberg, a personal finance expert, an attorney and the founder of Erika.com. “Don’t hide from your debt, even if it’s scary. Tackling it head-on is the best way to take control and lower your stress.”
Your Debt Is Holding You Back From Reaching Your Goals
If you feel held back because of your debt, that’s another key sign of a problem.
“Does your debt get in the way of your personal, professional or financial goals?” Kullberg said. “Can you not afford to buy a home because of credit card debt? Can you not afford to take time off work to pursue higher education because you’re drowning in an expensive car loan? If you can’t reach your goals because of debt, you need to take paying it off more seriously.”
7 Ways To Fix a Serious Debt Problem
Once you’ve understood that you have a serious debt problem that needs an urgent fix, you must explore the array of potential solutions available to you.
“Acknowledge there’s a problem and that you are ready to take action,” said Sean Fox, president of debt solutions at Achieve. “It’s important to accept that it will likely require some belt-tightening and other changes in your financial behaviors.”
Make a Concrete and Realistic Plan
It’s one thing to say you’re going to get out of debt; it’s quite another thing to actually do it. Eliminating high-interest debt takes time, commitment and a concrete plan.
“You need to do your research and figure out a realistic plan that you can commit to,” Fox said. “Each person will be different. The ‘realistic’ part is important. Many people anxious to work their way out of debt start out by cutting expenses so drastically and/or jumping into a program so quickly that there’s no way they will be able to stick to it.”
Have a Detailed Budget in Place
To get out of debt, you need to overhaul your budget and aggressively track your spending. Fox pointed out that there are a lot of budgeting apps available that can make budgeting easier.
“If you go that route, make sure you select a budgeting app that connects all financial accounts to give you a unified view of your finances, automatically tracks spending and organizes your finances into categories,” Fox said, adding that you should track your expenses (online and in-person) for a couple of weeks to see just where your money goes.
“Then you can identify areas to cut back and direct the savings to your debt payoff,” Fox said.
Consider a Personal Loan
If you can’t budget your way out of debt, it’s smart to look into a personal loan.
“A personal loan may offer a rate lower than on your credit cards (or other debts),” Fox said. “The idea is to consolidate your other debts into one with a lower rate, and pay that one personal loan off faster. Interest rates can vary widely, and are generally dependent on your credit profile and scores (people with higher scores qualify for the lowest rates). This is also called a debt consolidation loan.”
Get a Balance Transfer Credit Card
You may be able to qualify for a balance transfer credit card. These are great as they enable you to move all your credit card debt onto one card for a low interest rate.
“If you are eligible for one, know that the promotional interest rate is limited, often expiring in six-12 months (sometimes longer, up to 21 months),” Fox said. “You must be able to pay off the balance within that window. In addition, fees can be high, so read the fine print and see if it’s worthwhile for you. Also, understand that each balance transfer card issue has limits on how much debt can be transferred — something that may come into play for an individual with a significant amount of credit card debt.”
Get Into Debt Management/Credit Counseling
Debt management plans, offered by credit counseling firms, are also potential solutions.
“These can lower the interest rate on a credit card by a small amount,” Fox said. “Cardholders can also call their credit card issuers and ask for a lower rate. If you have a good track record of payment, and can explain why you are asking for the lower rate, the card issuer may agree. Assess carefully whether a slightly lower rate may not be enough to really get you out of debt.”
Debt Resolution (Settlement)
If your debt problem is serious and you can’t dig yourself out of it, heading into debt resolution may be the best move you can make.
“Debt resolution is the process of working on a consumer’s behalf to lower principal balances,” Fox said. “This can be a smart option for someone who is having a hard time making minimum payments, particularly if the reason is that they’ve had a real financial hardship (such as job loss, medical expenses or divorce). Programs are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission.”",20b1da00dfb62d346ad7a177ab48eb57,trafilatura,6072,0

","Supermicro Stock Drops 29 % in a Month : Is SMCI a Buy , Sell , or Hold ? ",2025-09-03 23:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Super Micro Computer (SMCI), or Supermicro, has had a rough stretch in recent weeks. SMCI stock dropped more than 29% over the past month, with much of that decline sparked by its latest fourth-quarter earnings report. While the company has been one of the top beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, its earnings and guidance have fallen short of expectations, and growth has slowed significantly.
Supermicro is known for its high-performance servers and storage systems optimized for AI-specific workloads. Its solid positioning in the AI hardware space drove extraordinary growth in fiscal 2024, with sales surging at a breakneck pace. But in the most recent quarter of its fiscal 2025, the story shifted.
For instance, its Q4 revenue came in at $5.8 billion, up 7.4% from the prior year. That figure represented a steep deceleration compared with earlier quarters, where sales were up 19.5% in Q3, 54.9% in Q2, and 180.1% in Q1.
The company’s margins have also come under pressure. Its adjusted gross margin dropped 70 basis points to 9.6%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) declined compared to the same period last year, in part due to tariffs.
Management highlighted hurdles, including limited access to capital, which slowed production scaling, and shifting product specifications from major customers that impacted Q4 results. Longer purchase cycles, a side effect of rapid advances in AI technology, added yet another challenge.
Are Supermicro’s Problems Temporary?
Supermicro’s recent earnings and guidance fell short of expectations. However, SMCI’s management remains optimistic, signaling that the recent challenges are temporary and the long-term growth story remains intact.
The company has reassured investors that earlier capital constraints are no longer a concern. Meanwhile, large customer orders that were delayed are now expected to be recognized in the September and December quarters. The company’s customer base is also expanding, with the number of large-scale rack clients doubling from two in fiscal 2024 to four in fiscal 2025. Management expects this momentum to continue, with additional customers likely to be acquired in fiscal 2026. This trend highlights both rising demand and strong momentum in its customer pipeline.
Furthermore, to address margin concerns, Supermicro is focusing on higher-margin revenue streams, which are expected to contribute to improved profitability over time. Its strategic focus on the enterprise, internet of things (IoT), and telecom markets positions it well for long-term growth. In recent quarters, Supermicro has invested heavily in tailoring its solutions for enterprise clients, rolling out advanced server and storage systems optimized for hybrid cloud, AI, and edge computing. The launch of an enhanced enterprise service program further strengthens its offering by providing comprehensive, round-the-clock support for high-density, performance-driven data centers.
Momentum is also building in its IoT portfolio, where demand is accelerating across various industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, telecom, and smart cities. Supermicro’s embedded systems and edge servers are being adopted for a wide range of AI edge applications, and its partnerships with industry leaders are designed to fast-track innovation in both AI-at-the-edge and telecom solutions. By expanding into these higher-margin areas, the company is diversifying its revenue streams while setting the stage for sustainable profitability.
Notably, Supermicro’s global manufacturing footprint enhances its supply chain resilience and margins. With major campuses in the U.S., Taiwan, Malaysia, and the Netherlands, the company is likely to deliver complete systems and data center solutions efficiently while mitigating tariff exposure. This geographic diversity enables it to serve customers worldwide, adapt quickly to shifting regional demands, and maintain a flexible supply chain.
Is Supermicro Stock a Buy, Sell, or Hold?
Supermicro is poised to gain from the strong demand for its AI-optimized servers and storage systems. To meet the surging demand, Supermicro has been rapidly expanding both its product lineup and its manufacturing footprint. Its Datacenter Building Block Solutions (DCBBS), designed to accelerate the building of data centers, could see solid demand. Moreover, the company is doubling down on cooling technologies, including air-cooled and direct liquid cooling systems, as AI workloads grow more complex and energy-intensive. This positions Supermicro as a provider of high-performance computing solutions and a partner for greener, more sustainable infrastructure.
Looking ahead, SMCI is projecting revenue of $33 billion for fiscal 2026, representing a 50% year-over-year increase. That momentum is expected to come from its expanding base of enterprise customers, innovations in product design, and greater adoption of its full-stack data center solutions.
However, Supermicro operates in a highly competitive market, with established players such as Dell (DELL) likely to gain share in the AI-optimized server market. That pressure could put its margins under strain, even as demand continues to rise.
Thus, for now, Wall Street seems cautious. SMCI stock carries a consensus “Hold” rating.
In summary, Supermicro’s recent stock decline reflects near-term challenges. However, its strong positioning in the AI server market, expanding customer base, and focus on higher-margin opportunities provide a compelling long-term growth narrative. While SMCI may face volatility in the short run, its fundamentals suggest potential for recovery. However, one should remain sidelined until the company shows clear signs of sustained momentum.

S . government,Maine mass shooting survivors to file negligence lawsuit against the U . S . government,2025-09-03 12:00:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Families of the victims of a 2023 mass shooting in Maine and dozens of survivors intend to file a negligence lawsuit Wednesday against the U.S. government, alleging the military and others failed to respond to warning signs and a threat by the gunman, who was an Army reservist.
Robert Card, 40, killed 18 people at a bowling alley and a bar in Lewiston, setting off a two-day manhunt that ended when he died by suicide, authorities said.
The approximately 100 plaintiffs are expected to name the Defense Department, the Army and Keller Army Community Hospital in West Point, New York, in the suit, which a team of four law firms is set to file in federal court in Maine.
""The Army repeatedly broke its promise to protect the community that it pledges to defend and must be held responsible,"" Maine attorney Travis Brennan said in a statement.
Benjamin Gideon, another lawyer in Maine representing plaintiffs, added that ""it's hard to imagine the Army ever accepting accountability without being forced to do so in court.""
The law firms served legal notices of their intention to sue in October. The lawyers said the Army had multiple opportunities to intervene in Card's case but did not, including as early as May 2023, when his son reported that his father's mental health appeared to be deteriorating and his behavior was erratic.
The Justice and Defense departments and the Army could not immediately be reached for comment about the planned complaints. They previously declined to comment on the legal notices.
National Trial Law, a law firm in Texas, is working with two Maine law firms to represent the plaintiffs. The firm represented survivors and families of those killed in the 2017 church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, committed by an Air Force service member. The federal government was found partly liable in that case, and the survivors agreed to settle in 2023 after the Justice Department appealed.
The legal cases in Maine are similarly focused on the federal government and actions taken by military members.
Despite the apparent warning signs, a definitive motive for the rampage in Lewiston remains unclear. Card's family has said that he claimed to have been hearing voices months before when he was fitted for high-powered hearing aids and that he had grown increasingly paranoid.
A month after the shootings, an independent commission was formed to investigate it and scrutinize any lapses by the military, law enforcement and Card's family.
The commission's report and the military investigations shed light on possible failures.
The military's internal report said Card's unit failed to follow certain procedures after he was involved in a shoving incident with another reservist in July 2023, leading him to be hospitalized for two weeks in a psychiatric unit at a civilian hospital. At the time, his reported symptoms included psychosis and homicidal ideations, and he had created a ""hit list,"" according to the military's investigation.
The Army then prohibited Card from having access to weapons on duty.
More from NBC News:
A separate independent report by the state commission concluded that while the gunman was solely responsible for his conduct, there were missteps. Leaders of Card's unit ""failed to undertake necessary steps to reduce the threat he posed to the public,"" such as ignoring ""strong recommendations"" from his mental health providers to stay engaged with his care and ensure any weapons in his home were removed.
The commission also found that his unit ""neglected to share"" all the information it had about past threats with the local sheriff's office.
In addition, the commission said, medical staff members at Keller Army Community Hospital, where Card was initially evaluated three months before the shootings, failed to file a so-called SAFE Act notice. The report is used to alert authorities when people may be dangers to themselves or others.
The military and independent commission reports also detailed how Card's family alerted a Sagadahoc County sheriff's sergeant about his deteriorating mental health. The report further said that law enforcement agencies had probable cause to initiate Maine's ""yellow flag"" law, which allows them to confiscate people's firearms if they are believed to be threats to themselves or others, but that that was never done.
Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry said after the shootings that the Army Reserve did inform his department that Card threatened to ""shoot up"" the National Guard base in Saco, Maine. Merry said he distributed a statewide alert to law enforcement agencies after deputies sent to Card's home in Bowdoin could not find him.
Investigators also looked at whether Card's exposure to low-level blasts as a hand grenade instructor in the military was tied to the ""severe"" traumatic brain injury that researchers found evidence of last year. The military denied in its report that any brain-related injury was linked to his service.
The law firms had previously said they were focusing on the federal government and not local law enforcement because the Army had access to the most critical information about Card's state of mind and could have helped ensure he did not have access to firearms.
Card's unit failed to conduct a required ""line of duty investigation,"" which would have documented the condition of his mental state, the Army acknowledged in its internal report.
Card's family told NBC News a year after the shootings that they supported further research of military service members' brains. They also launched a nonprofit organization, Rising Over Brokenness, to focus on mental health awareness and brain injuries among service members.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/underdog-crypto-com-futures-markets-115325353.html,f2a3389ace779dc75bbac1f7359da403,Underdog to Provide Crypto . com Futures Markets in Gaming First,Underdog to Provide Crypto . com Futures Markets in Gaming First,2025-09-03 20:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Underdog is teaming with Crypto.com to provide prediction markets in its app, the first gaming company—but certainly not the last—to launch a futures product as the definition of legal sports betting continues to blur.
The company, which mostly offers fantasy-style games, announced a new relationship Tuesday with Crypto.com | Derivatives North America (CDNA), an affiliate of Crypto.com that is a registered exchange with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the government agency that oversees prediction markets. Starting immediately, sports markets on that exchange will be available to Underdog customers in U.S. dollars on the company’s app alongside its fantasy and gambling products.
It’s a notable move as well for Crypto.com, which was the first company to offer this type of sports prediction market contracts in the U.S., beating Kalshi late last year. Those efforts have been much quieter in recent months as Kalshi, and soon Polymarket, have been aggressive in growing their product, their social presence and their U.S. market share. The industry’s emergence has been the biggest story in gambling this year; advocates claim the prediction contracts are identical to other financial assets, while others believe the exchanges have found a way to bypass existence sports betting laws, regulations and tax structures, despite having a virtually identical product.
The relationship between Crypto.com and Underdog is not exclusive, a representative for Underdog told Sportico, meaning Crypto.com is free to partner with other groups to reach a wider audience for its markets. He declined to comment on how the two companies will share in the economics of the partnership—whether through revenue sharing, a cash component, etc.
While Underdog is the first major licensed U.S. gaming company to directly layer on prediction markets, others are looking intently at their options. Last month FanDuel announced a partnership with CME Group, which owns four CFTC-regulated exchanges, a move that could pave the way for its participation. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins has also made it clear that his company is also considering something similar. What remains to be seen, however, is how sports betting regulators across the U.S. react to companies that suddenly begin offering both products. In that sense, Underdog’s move will likely be closely watched by the entire gaming industry.
Crypto.com launched its sports prediction market in December 2024. The company then ignored an order from CFTC regulators in the final month of Joe Biden’s presidency to take the contracts down.
After setting up a series of media interviews to promote its contracts on the outcome of the Super Bowl, Crypto.com has been mostly silent about its prediction markets over the past seven months. It has been far slower to add new market types than competitor Kalshi, while devoting little resources to advertising even as Kalshi has flooded the zone with marketing materials. The organization has repeatedly declined requests for comment and interviews on industry developments.
Founded in 2020 as a fantasy product, Underdog has begun testing the waters of more traditional sports betting, and the regulation that comes with it. The company has had a lot of success with both social and digital media—Bill Belichick had a podcast on its platform for a while—and earlier this year said a $70+ million funding round had valued the company at $1.23 billion. That made it one of a handful of global sports gaming unicorns, Sportico reported at the time.
That round was led by Spark Capital, which was an early backer of Twitter, Overtime, Slack and Discord. Prior Underdog investors include Mark Cuban, Kevin Durant, Odell Beckham Jr., Trae Young, Nas, Kygo, Future and a number of other sports and entertainment celebrities.
As the sports futures markets have exploded in popularity, the CFTC has undergone dramatic change as well. The formal nomination of Brian Quintenz, a Kalshi board member who is President Donald Trump’s choice to run the commission, has been paused for more than a month. Under the interim leadership of Caroline Pham, the new-look commission has been permissive toward sports prediction markets, an expected outcome given that Donald Trump Jr. is an advisor and investor in both Kalshi and Polymarket. Crypto.com also recently partnered with Trump Media & Technology Group to launched a new cryptocurrency treasury firm.
The CFTC has not made any public remarks about Crypto.com ignoring the agency’s prior takedown order under former chairman Rostin Behnam. The organization has also hinted that its depleted staff and funding challenges could soon limit some of its enforcement actions.
Crypto.com’s low-key approach of late has perhaps been best captured by New Jersey seemingly overlooking its existence when sending a cease-and-desist letter to Kalshi. “[New Jersey’s] demands do not currently apply to any other [company], including a Kalshi competitor that likewise offers sports-event contracts,” Kalshi’s legal representation wrote in a court filing, referencing how Crypto.com escaped the Garden State’s notice.
A CFTC official told Sportico last month they weren’t aware of Crypto.com’s standing and would need to look into it—but still haven’t provided insight.
Ahead of the Underdog announcement, there were signs Crypto.com was ready to ramp up its prediction markets. Three weeks ago, Crypto.com announced the hire of Chris Fargis as director of sports and prediction markets. Fargis previously worked at DraftKings, Fanatics and Hard Rock in betting related role.
“This category is red-hot, and there are very exciting things happening at the company,” Fargis wrote on LinkedIn.",e929b5f03d525262706416b04d3d54c8,trafilatura,5715,0

Club stock Apple jumped more than 3% on Wednesday after a federal judge ruled that Alphabet can continue making payments to preload its Google Search onto iPhones and other Apple devices. However, the late Tuesday decision handed down by Judge Amit Mehta, who has been overseeing the Google Search antitrust trial, prevents Alphabet from paying for contracts with preconditions such as making its Google Search the exclusive search option. On Tuesday evening, during CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" Jim described it as ""shockingly favorable."" He added, ""This is a huge win for Alphabet, but it's also a big win for Apple."" The reason why this is so good for Apple is two-fold. For starters, Apple can continue to collect this highly profitable revenue stream from Alphabet in exchange for the preloading and placement of Google Search in its Safari browser. Google is estimated to have paid Apple some $20 billion per year as part of that relationship, which benefited Google because Apple was driving tons of traffic to its search engine. With minimal costs associated with generating that revenue for Apple, most of it just flows to the bottom line. The market had been concerned that the judge might bar Google from making any sort of payments in exchange for traffic. But beyond that, the ruling opens the door to Apple being able to work out similar agreements with large language model providers to bring AI services to the Apple ecosystem, particularly Siri. Apple has struggled to develop the AI-enhanced version of Siri that Apple so sorely needs to drive a big upgrade cycle for iPhone sales. Updates over recent months make it clear that they're likely to leverage a third-party company as the underlying technology provider to accomplish that, if not outright buy one of them. Currently, Apple gives Siri users the option to punt more complex queries to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Now, with the remedy ruling, Apple has the ability to get paid in those future relationships for driving traffic to the AI chatbots in addition to search. That could mean billions more in payments each year to Apple's crucial Services division, which includes the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV, and others. ""With this ruling, the tables can be turned,"" Jim said Tuesday night. ""That bot company will have to pay Apple because it's legal. What a turn of events. Maybe it's another $20 billion headed Apple's way. Maybe [it's] more,"" he added. Wall Street analysts agree with Jim that this is a great outcome for Apple. Evercore ISI, in particular, noted that the ruling will require Google to renegotiate its deals annually rather than on a multiyear basis, which could be beneficial for Apple. ""We think this is a net positive for Apple, which not only will maintain receipt of its ~$15-20B payment from Google but will also allow Apple to renew the deal each year."" The Evercore analysts, who reiterated a buy-equivalent rating on the stock, added, ""This gives Apple more leverage in search engine negotiations and paves the way for an eventual AI-enabled search engine becoming the default on Safari, whether that be with Gemini or another model builder."" Morgan Stanley analysts called the outcome a ""near best-case scenario."" They added, ""Effectively, Apple needs to offer a bit more flexibility in distributing search to users, but the remedies are even more watered down than we expected."" AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance Mehta's decision is a second major positive for Apple in less than a month. Late in the day on Aug. 6, Apple CEO Tim Cook was able to ease tensions with President Donald Trump . Cook announced, at a White House event, an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing. Over the past 30 days, the stock has jumped more than 16.5%. Despite the nice run of good news, Apple shares were still down over 5% year-to-date, compared to the S & P 500 's more than 9.5% advance. Apple had a rough start to 2025 as investors worried about the Google case, the company's lackluster generative artificial intelligence rollout, as well as increasingly heated smartphone competition in China and tariff headwinds. With Google and some of the tariff concerns behind us, Apple needs a strong showing at its Sept. 9 product event, when the iPhone 17 is expected to be unveiled. Just last week , we were talking about reports of a new, thinner design and Apple's first in-house modem chip. In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs was bullish on Apple's lineup of expected iPhone 17s — and, as a result, forecasted an upside to iPhone revenue. Investors are still going to want to hear about Apple's plans for AI. But the ruling in the Google case ensures that Apple has a full toolbox to build a solution that benefits both iPhone users and its stock price. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, META.

For Wall Street, it has long carried a reputation as the most challenging month of the year for U.S. stocks — marked by seasonal weakness and a higher likelihood of volatility after the quiet summer months.
And this time around, with a pivotal jobs report and a potential interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve on the horizon, the macro market backdrop looks increasingly uncertain.
History shows that the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has generated an average monthly decline of 1.1% in September and finished higher only 42.2% of the time dating back to 1897, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
September has also been the worst month of the year for the S&P 500 SPX and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, which have averaged monthly declines of 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 has finished higher only 44.9% of the time since 1928, while the Nasdaq has registered positive monthly returns 51.9% of the time dating back to 1971, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
“The financial markets often shift gears in September, moving away from the quiet summer months marked by low trading volumes and limited volatility, and entering a period historically associated with seasonal weakness and increased market instability,” said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial.
To be sure, seasonal trends should always be viewed in the context of current market conditions, as they simply reflect the broader market climate rather than the immediate setup on Wall Street — meaning stock performance in September doesn’t necessarily have to follow any seasonal script.
History also suggests that seasonal weakness usually fades in September on occassions when the stock market trends higher going into the month. In other words, September doesn’t look so scary when August holds up.
And U.S. equities were on a tear in August, as economically sensitive stocks roared back amid optimism that the Fed is ready to cut interest rates for the first time in 2025. Consumer prices have lately only risen slightly due to tariffs, and the labor market may be losing steam at a quicker pace than previously thought — factors that appear to support the case for a Fed easing.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 3.2% last month, booking its best August performance since 2020, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6% and the S&P 500 rose 1.9% in the same period. Small-cap stocks, as measured by the benchmark Russell 2000 index RUT, popped 7% in August — with the index logging its best month since November and its best August in 25 years, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
“Since 1950, when the S&P 500 is above its 200-day moving average going into September, the average price return for the month jumps to 1.3%, with 60% of occurrences producing positive results,” Turnquist said in a Thursday client note. “This compares to an average September price decline of 4.2% and positivity rate of only 15% when the index is below its 200-DMA going into the month.”
The 200-day moving average is usually considered a key indicator for determining the overall long-term trend of a stock index. The S&P 500 ended at 6,460.26 on Friday afternoon, comfortably holding above its 200-day moving average of 5,957.05, according to FactSet data.
Turnquist also added that while September’s seasonal weakness may be “an ancillary factor” weighing on the stock market’s performance, other “more powerful macroeconomic forces,” such as the health of the U.S. economy and corporate America, could ultimately drive future stock performance.
Key events shaping the U.S. stock market in September include next week’s August employment report, which will show whether July’s labor-market slowdown is gaining steam, and the Fed policy meeting scheduled for Sept. 16-17, when policymakers are widely anticipated to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 4% to 4.25%.
While a rate cut in September seems very likely, the key uncertainty is “whether it will be a dovish or hawkish cut,” and that will depend on the upcoming inflation and labor data between now and mid-September, Turnquist told MarketWatch in a follow-up interview on Thursday. “Overall, there’s a lot of uncertainty heading into September.”
Turnquist also said the stock market may be overbought in the short term, “as much of the good news, like the expectation of the economy executing a soft landing and avoiding a recession, seems to be priced in.
“While this is fair, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a reality check to reflect some of the uncertainty that we have to get through over the next few weeks,” he added.
To be sure, the stock market remained surprisingly calm in August, with the Cboe Volatility Index VIX — also known as the VIX, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge” — on Thursday tumbling to its lowest level of the year. The VIX fell 7.8% last month, according to FactSet.
This low-volatility market backdrop may represent “the calm before the storm,” said Turnquist. The chart below shows the VIX has historically advanced going into the fall, with a high-water mark for the year typically reached in late September or early October.
“Considering the relatively low starting point of the so-called fear gauge right now, we don’t think it is a bold call to suggest there is upside risk to the VIX,” Turnquist noted.
U.S. stocks finished lower on Friday after July’s personal-consumption expenditures index — the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — showed persistent price pressures tied to higher tariffs.",3b917762e90cebb9afa86f0dede2f560,trafilatura,5587,0

After Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year, the U.S. Department of Justice proposed Google divest some of its assets, including selling its Chrome browser. But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled in Alphabet's favor on Tuesday, vying against some of the more severe proposed consequences. He decided the company will not have to sell Chrome but will be barred from exclusive contracts that condition payments or licensing. ""Google will not be required to divest Chrome; nor will the court include a contingent divestiture of the Android operating system in the final judgment,"" the decision stated. ""Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divestiture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints."" Shares of Alphabet were last trading 6% higher in Wednesday's premarket. The stock has added more than 11% in 2025. GOOG 5D mountain GOOG 5D chart This positive decision helped reinforce Wall Street's bullishness on shares of Alphabet. Most of those covering the stock maintained a buy-equivalent rating on the stock, while some firms such as Barclays and JPMorgan upped their price target. Here's what analysts at some of the Street's biggest shops are saying following the ruling: Barclays: Price target raised to $250 Barclays' new price target of $250, up from $235, implies upside of 18% from here. ""GOOGL shares should continue to move higher following a very bullish remedy package from the court. With Chrome/TAC payment ban off the table, we see very little market share, rev or EPS impact from data sharing and syndication."" Bank of America: Price target raised to $252 Bank of America raised its price target for Alphabet to $252 from $217. This updated forecast implies shares could rally 19% from here. ""Since the potential for a Chrome divestiture seemed remote, our top takeaway is the judgment preserves Google's ability to maintain its search distribution position through TAC [traffic acquisition costs] payments to partners. Given superior Google search monetization, we believe most partners will remain aligned with Google, with little incentive to develop their own search capabilities."" JPMorgan: Price target raised to $260 The bank's new price target of $260, lifted from $232, corresponds to a 23% upside. ""The long awaited Google Search Commercial Agreement remedies announced Tuesday afternoon were much more favorable for Google than anticipated, particularly as the Judge took into account the rapidly evolving and increasingly competitive search landscape spurred by GenAI. Even as the bar for remedies moved higher through August w/GOOGL shares closing at an all-time high on the last day of the month, the Judge's conclusions were mostly positive for Google and we see them having no major impact to financials going forward, which is a win."" Deutsche Bank: Price target raised to $260 ""We believe this outcome provides clear visibility for Alphabet's long-term fundamentals, and limits the risk of structural dislocation in Search, supporting a substantial positive rerating of the stock. On the back of these developments, we also lower our regulatory discount, and as a result increase our target price to $260 from ($215) which is based on 24x (from 20x) our FY26 GAAP EPS estimate, in-line with the market multiple, despite GOOG's faster growth, AI tailwinds, Cloud acceleration, and improving margin structure."" Morgan Stanley ""Analysis of Judge Mehta's remedies (TAC, data sharing/ syndication) highlight how they are likely benign and unlikely to dislodge GOOGL's leading position. Revisions, product innovation, and commercial behavior trends matter now to push toward our $260 bull case."" Wolfe Research ""We have sized the potential implication from this outcome as a MSD% headwind to EPS. The EPS headwind we estimate assumes Google loses some market share to competitors making deals with Apple over the mid-to-long term. In the near-term, under current operating conditions, we don't expect material impact to Google's EPS."" Goldman Sachs ""We recognize that the magnitude of the impact from these remedies to Alphabet's business will likely not be fully understood for a number of years and, as a result, the multiple investors are willing to pay may continue to be capped for some time. That said, we think that Alphabet's current valuation is already pricing in notable headwinds and see the potential for this decision to act as some 'relief' on the multiple overhang on Alphabet's shares (that was resulting from the uncertainty surrounding this decision). In total, we continue to be constructive on Alphabet's long-term strategic positioning across many end-markets (both consumer & enterprise-facing; search & non-search) and continue to see the company as the leading collection of AI/machine learning-driven businesses in our coverage universe."" Citi ""We believe the ruling was largely as expected, removing a key overhang on the stock, while also underscoring the increasingly competitive Search market. Google is likely to appeal the decision with an appeals process that could last several years. We reiterate our Buy rating on shares of GOOGL as Search and Cloud revenue growth accelerated in 2Q as its AI and Gemini models increasingly launch innovative offerings.""

As always, management's decisions will have a direct impact on the business' trajectory. So, let's take a closer look at what investors might expect from the company.
UPS' plans
Management outlined its plans through 2026 at its investor and analyst day last year. In a nutshell, they involve doubling down on previously successful investments in key end markets -- such as small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) and healthcare -- and investing heavily in productivity-enhancing technologies (smart facilities, automation, etc.) to build what it calls the ""network of the future.""
The network investments are not just about increasing productivity and lowering its cost per package; UPS can also close unproductive facilities, since the newly modernized ones can handle delivery volumes previously handled in the facilities to be consolidated. And management was hopeful that the excess capacity in the U.S. small-package market (built up during the boom years of the lockdowns) would disappear as demand picked up and supply growth was tempered.
Also, at the start of 2025, management announced plans to reduce Amazon deliveries (which tend to have low or even negative profit margins) by 50% by the beginning of the second half of 2026. Furthermore, it would take back last-mile delivery for its SurePost service from the Postal Service starting in January 2025.
All of these plans make sense, not least for a company seeking to optimize the productivity of its network by transitioning from lower-margin, lower-productivity deliveries to higher-margin, higher-productivity ones.
What's going wrong with UPS
Unfortunately, UPS faces significant challenges meeting these aims, and many of them are a result of the ongoing and evolving tariff conflict. It's no surprise that anything that damages global trade is bad news for package delivery companies, and UPS faces specific challenges.
As CEO Carol Tomé said on the earnings call in April, the ""China to U.S. trade lines are our most profitable trade lines."" That's hitting UPS' international business, and the trade conflict is also inordinately affecting its key SMB market, because according to Tomé: ""Many of our SMBs, as we talk to them, are 100% single-sourced from China. And this is causing so much uncertainty in the marketplace.""
Since management had been hoping for the demand/supply gap to close in the small-package market through 2024-2026, the last thing it needs to see is a negative effect on SMB volumes.
The uncertainty is such that, for the second straight quarter, UPS declined to update its full-year guidance.
What Wall Street thinks about UPS
In the absence of management guidance, let's turn to the Wall Street consensus, which looks at earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and free cash flow (FCF).
These forecasts are problematic, to say the least, and as previously noted, UPS is paying out $5.5 billion in cash in the form of dividends. As such, according to Wall Street estimates, UPS will use more than 90% of its FCF to pay dividends in 2027, and this assumes there are no more major hiccups along the way.
Where will UPS be in a few years?
The optimistic scenario envisions the company navigating a challenging period, with end demand gradually increasing as SMBs adapt to the new tariff standard, healthcare revenue continuing to grow, and management successfully executing its cost reductions and productivity enhancements.
A pessimistic scenario envisions the continuation of tariff disputes leading to a reset of near- to medium-term expectations, a dividend cut, and a lasting structural challenge to its key SMB market.
It looks likely, at least to me, that a combination of the two scenarios is the most likely outcome. The company's near-term guidance is under threat, and it makes sense to cut the dividend and reinvest the savings in accelerating investment in the business as a whole to continue the transition to higher-margin deliveries and technology-led cost savings.
Under this scenario, UPS will be in a better place in a few years, but not before there's a reset of expectations, and possibly the dividend, too -- not something many investors will want to see. That scenario could mean the stock's decline worsens before it improves.

(UBER) stock looks very cheap here. One simple way to play UBER is to sell short put options expiring in one month for a 2.3% yield. This is for contracts in 4% out-of-the-money strike prices.
UBER closed at $93.75 on Friday, Aug. 29. The stock is up 5% from Aug. 6 ($89.22), when it released its Q2 earnings. But it's still off from a recent peak of $96.79 on Aug. 22.
But, as I recently wrote, UBER stock could be worth as much as 27% more at $119.00 per share.
You can read my full thesis on this in a TalkMarkets article, “Uber Technologies Stock Looks Cheap,” published today. I show in my article why Uber's strong free cash flow margins and analysts' revenue estimates could lead to a significantly higher stock price.
But this article will show an easy way to play UBER. This is by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) puts in nearby expiry periods. That way, investors can get paid income with a good yield, as much as 2.3%, while they wait for the stock to potentially fall to a lower buy-in point.
Shorting OTM Puts
For example, look at the Oct. 3, 2025, expiry period, one month away from today. It shows that the $90.00 put option strike price, which is 4% below Friday's close of $93.75 per share, has a $2.07 midpoint premium. That means it is an “out-of-the-money” (OTM) secured short-put play.
That provides an investor who sells short this contract can make an immediate yield of 2.30% (i.e., $2.07/$90.00). Here is how that works.
First, an investor secures $9,000 in cash or buying power with their brokerage firm, acting as collateral to buy 100 shares at $90.00.
Next, the investor can gain an immediate credit of $207 in their account by entering an order to “Sell to Open” 1 put contract at $90.00 expiring on Oct. 3.
In other words, the short-put player has invested $9,000, and their account has now earned $207. That makes it a 2.30% ($207/$9,000) one-month yield.
Breakeven Point and Downside Risks
Here is what that means. If UBER stock falls to $90.00 or lower in the next 30 days, the account collateral will be assigned to buy 100 shares. But the investor's account still keeps the $207 credit.
As a result, the potential net buy-in price is $90.00-$2.07, or $87.93. That means the breakeven point is 6.2% lower than Friday's close of $93.75:
$93.75-$87.93 = $5.82
$5.82 / $93.75 = 0.062 = 6.2% downside protection
But that doesn't mean there isn't any downside risk shorting this out-of-the-money put contract. For example, if UBER falls to $86.00 and stays there, the investor will has at least a short-term unrealized loss of $1.93 ($87.93-$86.00).
But there are ways to mitigate this unrealized loss.
Mitigating Potential Losses
For example, some investors may want to limit their downside risk by buying further out-of-the-money (OTM) puts. They can use some of the $2.07 premium to do this. But I would recommend shorting the $91.00 contract instead.
That premium is $2.49 and provides an investor a higher 2.736% one-month yield (i.e., $2.49/91.00). But it also provides more income to buy lower strike price puts.
For example, the $88.00 put strike price expiring Oct. 3 has a midpoint premium of $1.47. That strike price is 6.13% below Friday's close.
In other words, the investor would still gain a net $1.02 ($2.49-$1.47) credit or $102 on the investment of $9,100, or 1.12% ($102/$9,100). And the net breakeven point is 89.98:
$91.00-$1.02 = $89.98 breakeven
The investor would have no unrealized loss if UBER subsequently falls to $86.00. So, there is only a $3.98 interval of risk from $89.98 to $86.00, or 4% to 8.267% below Friday's close.
Another way to mitigate the downside risk is to accept an assignment and then sell out-of-the-money calls. That could potentially bring in more income to cover the unrealized loss from owning UBER shares at a price over the trading price.
Lastly, an investor can always roll forward the short-put play before the expiration period closes. That involves entering an order to “But to Close” the short-put play. This results in a loss. However, the investor may be able to make up for this loss by shorting another month or two forward in OTM puts.
The Bottom Line
Keep in mind that shorting OTM puts is not always a way to buy UBER shares cheaper than at today's price. The stock still has to fall to the strike price and the account assigned to use the collateral secured to buy 100 shares at the OTM strike price.
However, the strategy can be repeated for a very successful expected return (ER). For example, if an investor can make the same OTM short-put 2.30% yield for three months straight, the ER is +6.9%.
That would be the same as buying UBER stock and seeing it rise to $100.22 (i.e., $93.75 x 1.069). So, as long as UBER doesn't rise to $100.22 by Nov. 30, it would be more profitable to short these out-of-the-money puts.
The bottom line here is that UBER stock is very cheap, and shorting out-of-the-money (OTM) puts is one way to play the stock.

And there are good reasons to believe that shares of the artificial intelligence (AI) technology infrastructure leader will continue to outperform over the long term.
One benefit of owning Nvidia stock that doesn't get enough coverage: When you buy the stock, you also get part ownership in the company's portfolio of AI-focused stocks, those both publicly traded and privately held. It's akin to owning an AI exchange-traded fund (ETF).
Nvidia has recently ramped up its investing activity, and its stock holdings are already large enough to move the needle on its overall financial results.
Nvidia owns 6 publicly traded stocks
The below stocks are listed in order of their value in Nvidia's portfolio as of the end the second quarter. Nvidia is listed at the end for reference.
Data sources: Nvidia's 13-F SEC filing, Yahoo! Finance, and YCharts. Market cap and stock performance data as of Friday, Aug. 29, 2025. *Calculation by author. **Since initial public offering (IPO) in March 2025.
Are any of the above companies in which Nvidia has a stake profitable?
Most of the companies are not profitable, as most are relatively newly public companies and pouring money into scaling up operations to drive revenue growth.
Arm is the only company that can be considered profitable. For its most recently reported quarter and on a trailing-12-month basis, its net income -- and, hence, ""earnings"" -- was positive from both a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and adjusted basis.
None of the other companies had positive adjusted net income in their most recently reported quarter. (Nebius had positive GAAP net income but only because of a large accounting gain from ""revaluation of investment in equity securities."")
Nvidia's venture capital (VC) arm owns stakes in 27 privately held startups
Nvidia has a venture capital arm called NVentures, which focuses on investing in AI-related start-ups during their early funding rounds. NVentures aims to make an eventual profit from its investments, so it can be considered one of Nvidia's potential profit streams.
NVentures was formed in 2021, replacing Nvidia's former VC arm. It has been much more active than the former VC entity, and is led by Mohamed (""Sid"") Siddeek, who has an impressive VC background.
NVentures' website lists 27 companies as investments, as of Aug. 29. A major trend is the large number of investments in the healthcare sector (13), and specifically in companies using AI for drug discovery and development (nine).
This makes sense because the total addressable market (TAM) for pharmaceuticals is massive. Estimates by various sources peg it at about $1.7 trillion in 2024. Moreover, discovering and developing new drugs is an extremely costly and lengthy process. AI has the potential to cut those costs and speed up time to market.
Nvidia's stock ownership added about $2.2 billion to its fiscal Q2 net income
In its fiscal second quarter (ended July 27), Nvidia's portfolio of AI-focused investments added about $2.2 billion to its net income. This amounts to about 8.5% of its total quarterly adjusted net income of $25.8 billion.
This $2.2 billion gain was only an accounting gain stemming from price changes in its stock holdings over the quarter. An actual cash gain (or loss) occurs when Nvidia sells an investment in part or in entirety. This accounting gain was helped by a strong market (the S&P 500 was up 15.6% over Nvidia's fiscal Q2). However, the sheer size of this gain suggests Nvidia's investing prowess is very good.
Nvidia's active investing can help it identify potential acquisition targets
Beyond the obvious potential benefit to Nvidia's profits, the company's active investing, especially in early stage AI start-ups, has a not-so-obvious benefit: It can help Nvidia identify attractive potential acquisitions. Nvidia might like one of its NVentures companies so much that it could decide to buy it.
In short, there are many reasons to buy Nvidia stock. The icing on the cake is that Nvidia stock investors also get a stake in the many publicly traded and privately held AI stocks that Nvidia owns.

Contracts for predicting Fed moves priced in about 95% of a quarter-point rate cut this month and ramped up wagers on at least two cuts by year end after the JOLTS report showed that job openings declined more than estimated while layoffs exceeded the median survey response.
The jump in rate-cut expectations arrested a selloff in long-maturity Treasuries that had lifted the 30-year bond’s yield to just shy of 5%, the highest level since July, sending it back blow 4.90%. The two-year note’s yield touched 3.60%, the lowest level since early May, and the five-year note’s reached a level last seen in April.
Expectations for Fed rate cuts rocketed higher in early August after broad US employment data showed a slump in job creation over the previous three months. Jobs data for August are slated to be released Friday, and the JOLTS data was consistent with a weakening labor market.
“The expectation is that the Fed is going to move in September, and the Friday data is important,” Gargi Chaudhuri, chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas at BlackRock Inc., told Bloomberg TV. For policymakers to opt for something other than a quarter-point rate cut on Sept. 17, August employment data “would have to be a very strong or very weak.”
In July, the majority of Fed policymakers viewed the policy rate setting of 4.25%-4.5% as appropriate based on employment and inflation trends. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem reiterated that view Wednesday before the JOLTS data were released. Concurrently with the data, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic published an essay saying he expected just one cut would be needed this year.
Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who dissented from the central bank’s July decision to keep rates steady in favor of cutting them and has been among Trump’s candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as chair of the central bank, reiterated Wednesday on CNBC he favors cutting rates at the next meeting on Sept. 16-17 and further in the coming months.

The Fed’s Beige Book survey of regional business contacts released later Wednesday found tariff-related price increases in most districts and “little or no change in economic activity” since the previous report.
Treasury yields were three to seven basis points lower on the day in late trading, after having risen before the US day began. The market may have benefited from recent positioning shifts. JPMorgan’s weekly Treasury client survey and CME Group’s Treasury futures open-interest data indicated that traders cut long positions and added to shorts over the past week.
The 30-year Treasury bond’s yield earlier Wednesday climbed to nearly 5% for the first time since July, underscoring investor concerns about US fiscal trends and elevated inflation, mirroring similar moves in the UK and Japan, where a deepening selloff pushed borrowing costs to the highest this century.
Bond investors globally are demanding increased compensation for financing government deficits. In the US, the Trump administration’s spending and tax cut plans are projected to worsen the country’s fiscal position unless tariff revenue growth is sustained, an outcome that a federal court ruling jeopardized last week.
“The signal is quite clear that there is still at these levels no appetite for the long end,” Ella Hoxha, head of fixed income at Newton Investment Management, told Bloomberg TV this week. “The risks are there’s going to be less appetite going forward.”
At the same time, interest-rate strategists say US President Donald Trump’s efforts to gain control of the Fed in pursuit of interest-rate cuts is helping push up long-term yields relative to short maturities, which are more closely tied to central bank’s policy rate. Cuts might keep upward pressure on inflation rates that still exceed the central bank’s 2% target, strategists say.
Interest-rate strategists at Bank of America Corp. Wednesday made trade recommendations based on the possibility that the Fed will cut interest rates prematurely. They included wagers on a widening gap between five- and 30-year Treasury yields and on higher market-based inflation expectations.
As yields on Treasuries maturing in two to five years reached the lowest levels since early May last week, the move produced some of the widest differentials between short- and long-term yields in years.
The divergence is “an unusual situation reflecting investors’ wish for more compensation to hold long-term bonds,” BlackRock Investment Institute strategists including Wei Li wrote in a note.

Today’s Featured Stock
Valued at $12.39 billion, Bloom Energy (BE) generates and distributes renewable energy. It supplies electricity to the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.
What I’m Watching
I found today’s Chart of the Day by using Barchart’s powerful screening functions to sort for stocks with the highest technical buy signals; superior current momentum in both strength and direction; and a Trend Seeker “buy” signal. I then used Barchart’s Flipcharts feature to review the charts for consistent price appreciation. BE checks those boxes. Since the Trend Seeker signaled a buy on May 16, the stock has gained 148.23%.

Analyst and Investor Sentiment on SSR Mining
I don’t buy stocks because everyone else is buying, but I do realize that if major firms and investors are dumping a stock, it’s hard to make money swimming against the tide.
It looks like Wall Street analysts are in a big disagreement about Bloom.
The Wall Street analysts tracked by Barchart have issued 7 “Strong Buy,” 2 “Moderate Buy,” 9 “Hold,” and 2 “Sell” opinions on the stock.
Their price targets are between $10-$48 – a very wide range.
Value Line gives the stock an “Average” rating.
CFRA’s MarketScope Advisor gives the stock a “Hold” rating.
Morningstar thinks the stock is 178% overvalued.
155 individual investors following the stock on Motley Fool think the stock will beat the market while 61 think it won’t.
28,010 investors monitor the stock on Seeking Alpha, which rates the stock a “Hold.”
The Bottom Line on Bloom Energy
BE currently has momentum and is hitting new highs. With price appreciation and double-digit growth projected in both revenue and earnings, this might warrant further consideration.
However, Value Line makes a good point: “Bloom has the ability to produce fuel cells for utilities, ecoparks and AI data centers in less than 50 days. Compared to the more traditional electricity providers, this is an amazingly short span of time. Additionally, there are no greenhouse gas emissions that have to be sequestered, and once contracts are in place, they usually stay put for over a decade.... Currently, Bloom’s method of producing electricity is a gap filler to this industry rather than a mainstay. And in the present economic and political climate, the company is likely to struggle.”
I caution that Bloom Energy is volatile and even speculative in the current environment, which means investors should use strict risk management and stop-loss strategies.

With that in mind, at this point, should you buy, sell, or hold CGC stock? Let's take a closer look.
About Canopy Growth Stock
Based in Smiths Falls, Ontario, Canopy Growth is a well-established name in the cannabis sector. The company is known for producing and distributing a wide selection of cannabis products for both therapeutic and recreational use. Its offerings include items like dried flower, cannabis oils, edibles, infused beverages, vaporizers, and softgel capsules.
Canopy runs its business across multiple areas, including its domestic operations in Canada and international cannabis markets. It manages a variety of popular labels, including Tweed, Doja, 7ACRES, and Spectrum Therapeutics, helping it maintain a strong footprint in Canada and abroad. Canopy also operates a vaporizer technology unit through its Storz & Bickel brand. The company has a market capitalization of $431 million.
CGC stock has not performed well over the past 52 weeks, down 66% during this period, and down 34% year-to-date (YTD). The stock had also dropped to a 52-week low of $0.77 in April, but is up 134% from this low.
That said, cannabis stocks have been having a good time on Wall Street more recently after President Donald Trump announced that he is considering reclassifying marijuana. Right now, it is classified as a Schedule I drug alongside heroin and cocaine. The reclassification would allow cannabis companies to fall under a different and more conducive tax bracket.
As a result, the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS) has gained 67% over the past month. CGC shares are also up by 50% over the same period.
CGC stock is currently trading at a low price. Its price sits at 1.91 times sales, which is lower than the industry average.
Canopy Growth Reported Topline Growth For Q1
On Aug. 8, Canopy Growth reported its first-quarter results for fiscal 2026. Revenue increased 17.1% year-over-year (YOY) to CAD 88.75 million ($64.4 million), while net revenue increased 9% annually to CAD 72.13 million ($52.3 million).
This increase was driven by increased adult-use cannabis and medical cannabis in Canada, as well as an increase in international markets. However, the effect was offset by lower Storz & Bickel net revenue.
While the company still noted losses for the quarter, its loss per share reduced from CAD 1.60 in Q1 2025 to CAD 0.22 in Q1 2026. Cash and short-term investments increased to CAD 144 million ($104.4 million) as of June 30 from CAD 131 million ($95 million) as of March 31.
The company announced that it is undertaking multiple actions aimed at improving cannabis gross margins in the second half of the current fiscal year. These actions include the “deployment of automation technology” and “increased PRJ production capacity,” as well as the continued pursuit of margin-accretive bulk cannabis sales in Europe and Canada.
Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Canopy’s ability to reduce its losses. They expect the company’s loss per share to narrow by 88.4% YOY to $0.11 for Q2 2026. For the current fiscal year, loss per share is projected to decrease by 83.2% annually to $0.50, followed by a 78% improvement to a $0.11 loss per share in the next fiscal year.
What Do Analysts Think About Canopy Growth Stock?
Analysts seem to be recommending caution when it comes to Canopy Growth stock. Pablo Zuanic from Zuanic & Associates initiated coverage on the stock earlier this year with an overall “Neutral” rating. Last year, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery maintained an “Underweight” rating on the stock, while cutting the price target from $3 to $2.
Wall Street analysts are cautious about CGC stock, giving it a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the six analysts rating the stock, one analyst gives it a “Strong Buy” rating, three are cautious with a “Hold” rating, and two have a “Strong Sell” rating. The consensus price target of $2.38 represents 32% potential upside from current levels. The Street-high price target of $5.84 indicates 224% potential upside from here.
Key Takeaways
While the regulatory environment for cannabis in the U.S. may improve, Canopy Growth appears to have a long way to go before achieving profitability. Therefore, it might be wise to observe CGC stock for now, in hopes for the reclassification of cannabis.

Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, is set to attend a shareholder meeting for Japanese Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) treasury firm Metaplanet in Tokyo on Monday.
Eric Trump Acting As Advisor To Metaplanet
Reuters reported this development as part of the Trump family’s growing international crypto ventures.
Eric Trump, who became an adviser to Metaplanet in March, recently appeared at the Bitcoin Asia conference in Hong Kong. American Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency mining company founded by Eric and his brother Donald Trump Jr., plans to list on the Nasdaq this month. Asher Genoot, CEO of the company holding 80% of American Bitcoin, confirmed Eric Trump’s attendance at the Metaplanet meeting, initially reported by Bloomberg.
The meeting will involve a vote on a proposal to sell up to 550 million new shares overseas, raising 130.3 billion yen ($884.41 million) primarily for bitcoin acquisitions. Metaplanet, previously a hotel operator, has seen its shares skyrocket by nearly 760% in the past year. The company, trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, was formerly known as Red Planet Japan.
Strategy-Like Aggressive Bitcoin Hoarding
Metaplanet has been making headlines with its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, reminiscent of Michael Saylor-led Strategy Inc.’s (NASADQ: MSTR) approach. In June 2024, the firm announced plans to purchase over $6 million worth of Bitcoin using funds from a bond sale. This move was part of a broader strategy to enhance its crypto portfolio.
By October 2024, Metaplanet had further bolstered its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring an additional 107.91 BTCs, valued at nearly $7 million. This acquisition underscored the company’s confidence in Bitcoin’s potential as a valuable asset.

Metaplanet Is One Of The Top-10 Corporate Holders Of Bitcoin
In March 2025, Eric Trump was appointed as a strategic advisor to Metaplanet, a move that coincided with the company’s stock surging by an impressive 2,152% over the past year. This appointment was part of Metaplanet’s efforts to drive Bitcoin adoption and strengthen its position in the crypto market.
By April 2025, Metaplanet had become one of the top 10 corporate holders of Bitcoin, with a stash valued at $388 million. Eric Trump celebrated this achievement, highlighting the company’s rapid ascent in the crypto space.
As of the writing of this article, Coingecko data indicates that Metaplanet holds 18,991 BTC, which is worth $2.05 billion. Interestingly, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (NASDAQ:DJT) is the next-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin at 18,430 BTC, worth $1.99 billion.

Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies.

John Carrafiell, co-CEO of BGO, a global real estate investment manager with $89 billion in assets under management, takes great pride in the fact that he sits right next to his chief data scientist.
Investment strategy, whatever the market, has always relied on research and data, but artificial intelligence has taken that to a whole new level, transforming investment research models developed just a few years ago and putting them on steroids.
Carrafiell, who has been in the real estate business for roughly 40 years, said he was increasingly frustrated by the sector's research and data methodologies, which he said really hadn't changed at all over those years. Everyone seemed to be looking at the same information and coming up with the same conclusions. The question he said he kept asking himself was, ""How do we really outperform?""
The answer, he found, was to analyze all of his firm's past deals going back 20 years, using just a computer model and taking the human element out of it. What the model found was that outperformance or underperformance was determined fully by the local market that was chosen for the investment.
That may sound trite — given that real estate's mantra has always been ""location, location, location"" — but the results told his team to focus almost entirely on local market fundamentals when choosing its future investments, and not so much on property pricing and national economic trends.
There are, of course, research firms that analyze and rank local real estate markets, but BGO found their results to be somewhat random, according to Carrafiell. Instead it looked to its own past and built a model that backtested exactly what drove its best and worst performance. The model includes all sorts of local market data points, including demographic and supply trends unique to each location. AI then gave that model increased data volume and velocity.
""We have taken thousands of data inputs, many that are free from the government, many we have to buy from, for instance, telecom providers, great data. We have found the key,"" said Carrafiell. ""And we know it's accurate because we backtest it.""
BGO used its data science to inform a decision to invest in an industrial development in Las Vegas with partner Northpoint Development. Other data models suggested it wasn't a particularly good investment.
Carrafiell said the ""best research out there"" indicated the investment would be mediocre in terms of performance and returns.
""But our model was screaming, it is going to explode. We underwrote $5.88-per-square-foot rents. We've gotten rents in the $9-per-square-foot range,"" he said. ""That does not happen in commercial real estate. That is not luck.""
The model, he explained, saw that the Inland Empire of California was getting too expensive, then analyzed logistics routes. It found that companies could save big by being in Las Vegas instead, where both the rents, taxes and labor were cheaper.
""So you had an extra two-hour drive, but you saved like 60% on your total cost, and that's what the model saw,"" Carrafiell said. ""The tenants we have there are serving an entire region. They're not serving Las Vegas.""
BGO ran similar analytics for investments in Florida and the Rust Belt, resulting in big returns on its investments.
""We think our performance has materially increased as a result of this model,"" said Carrafiell.
But he admitted that although the model's accuracy is improved dramatically by artificial intelligence, it can never be totally accurate, hypothesizing, ""Boeing can move out of Seattle, and the model can't predict that, right? There could be idiosyncratic things.""
While BGO's investing team focuses on the upside models for potential properties, its lending team looks at the downside modeling, because therein lies its risk.
New iterations of the research model down the road will include asset allocation to different sectors of commercial real estate. The model would ideally suggest an optimal portfolio mix. The possibilities are still growing, which is why Carrafiell says he's dialed into the data like never before.
""AI is an enhancer and an accelerator that allows us to do so much more, but it's really data science,"" he said. ""It's [like] a six-person, dedicated data science team that is sitting next to your CEO and next to your asset management and acquisitions team.""",7797b24ed4a6d04af1d8fcddb721bd01,trafilatura,4731,0

The Treasury will publish the ""official proposed list"" of jobs in the Federal Register, and the public will be able to comment, it said in the announcement. The agency did not specify a timeline.
The agency said it expects this list to be ""substantially the same” as the preliminary list.

How ‘no tax on tips’ works
The “no tax on tips” provision allows eligible workers to deduct up to $25,000, which reduces taxable income.
The deduction phases out, or gets smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000. The tax break is available even if you don't itemize deductions.
However, “you’re still likely paying state taxes” on tip income, and you’ll owe payroll levies for Medicare and Social Security, Ben Henry-Moreland, a certified financial planner with advisor platform Kitces.com, previously told CNBC.
The provision, which defines “qualifying tips” as money willingly given by the customer or payor, includes gratuities paid in cash or by credit card, as well as earnings from a tip-sharing arrangement.",17b19587edc5b25d872b3019e4982529,trafilatura,4662,0
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/03/trump-harvard-funding-freeze-court.html,3f8eea62ddf4a641055791fb9a0b1739,Harvard funding freeze by Trump administration reversed by judge,Harvard funding freeze by Trump administration reversed by judge,2025-09-03 21:30:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University over concerns about antisemitism on campus and other issues was illegal, calling it ""a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities.""
Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard's arguments that the administration imposed the funding freeze in retaliation for the Ivy League university's refusal to capitulate to demands for reforms that violated First Amendment protections under the Constitution.
Burroughs' ruling in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts vacates freezing orders affecting Harvard and bars anyone in the Trump administration from enforcing those orders.
The White House said it would appeal the decision.
The Trump administration froze the grants to Harvard on April 14, hours after the university flatly rejected demands that it end its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and begin screening international students for ideological biases, including antisemitism.
Burroughs said that the fact that the administration swiftly terminated Harvard's funding ""was made before they learned anything about antisemitism on campus or what was being done in response, leads the Court to conclude that the sudden focus on antisemitism was, at best ... arbitrary and, at worst, pretextual.""
She also noted that the administration, in a letter in April, ""specifically conditioned funding on agreeing to its ten terms, only one of which related to antisemitism.""
Six other terms, she noted, ""related to ideological and pedagogical concerns, including who may lead and teach at Harvard, who may be admitted, and what may be taught.""
""A review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude anything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities, and did so in a way that runs afoul of the APA [Administrative Procedure Act], the First Amendment and Title VI.""
As a result of the freeze, work was ordered stopped ""on a vast number of research projects across fields that are critical both nationally and worldwide,"" Burroughs wrote.
The projects affected by the freeze include research on tuberculosis, NASA astronauts' radiation exposure, Lou Gehrig's disease, and a ""predictive model to help [Veterans Administration] emergency room physicians decide whether suicidal veterans should be hospitalized,"" the judge wrote.
""It is clear, even based solely on Harvard's own admissions, that Harvard has been plagued by antisemitism in recent years and could (and should) have done a better job of dealing with the issue,"" Burroughts wrote.
""That said, there is, in reality, little connection between the research affected by the grant terminations and antisemitism,"" she wrote.
Harvard President Alan Garber, in a statement to the university community on the ruling, said that it ""affirms Harvard's First Amendment and procedural rights, and validates our arguments in defense of the University's academic freedom, critical scientific research, and the core principles of American higher education.""
""Even as we acknowledge the important principles affirmed in today's ruling, we will continue to assess the implications of the opinion, monitor further legal developments, and be mindful of the changing landscape in which we seek to fulfill our mission,"" Garber said.
Harvard President Alan Garber, at the time of the funding freeze, said in a note to the university community, ""No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.""
White House spokeswoman Liz Huston, in a statement, said, ""Just as President Trump correctly predicted on the day of the hearing, this activist Obama-appointed judge was always going to rule in Harvard's favor, regardless of the facts.""
""To any fair-minded observer, it is clear that Harvard University failed to protect their students from harassment and allowed discrimination to plague their campus for years,"" Huston said. ""Harvard does not have a constitutional right to taxpayer dollars and remains ineligible for grants in the future.

The budget will address an economy that's ""not working well enough for working people,"" Reeves said Wednesday in comments released by the Treasury.
""Bills are high. Getting ahead feels tougher. You put more in, get less out. That has to change,"" she added.
The U.K.'s long-term borrowing costs rose this week amid market jitters over the forthcoming budget, and how the British finance minister will meet self-imposed fiscal ""rules"" to make sure day-to-day spending is funded by tax receipts, rather than borrowing, and to lower U.K. debt over the next few years. Reeves has repeatedly dismissed the possibility of bending her own fiscal rules on borrowing.
She reiterated that stance on Wednesday, stating that the U.K. ""must bring inflation and borrowing costs down by keeping a tight grip on day to day spending through our non-negotiable fiscal rule.""
She added it was ""only by doing this can we afford to do the things we want to do.""
Economists predict Reeves will have hike taxes in order to meet her rules, and to maintain some fiscal ""wiggle"" room of around £10 billion in her budget — headroom which has already been eroded by U-turns on welfare spending cuts and rising borrowing costs.
""Barely a day goes by without speculation about new and inventive ways the Chancellor could generate revenue in the Autumn Budget. Our view is that Reeves will need to raise £18-28 billion [$24-37 billion] of revenue mostly via higher taxes,"" Ruth Gregory, deputy chief U.K. economist at Capital Economics, said in analysis Tuesday.
""A tax increase that raises a lot of revenue, is politically palatable and improves the economic outlook has long been the holy grail of governments. But that will remain elusive,"" Gregory predicted.
Tax rises are one of the few levers left for Reeves after she announced a range of long-term spending plans earlier this year with defense and the National Health Service that main recipients of extra funding and investment.
Efforts to reduce spending in other areas have fallen flat, with a number of Labour Party lawmakers opposing cuts to welfare spending and winter fuel payments for pensioners.
Where the axe will fall when it comes to tax rises is the key question: Reeves has already increased the tax burden on the business sector, leaving workers to face a potential tax hike, come the budget. That would nevertheless break Labour's manifesto pledges to not raise income tax, national insurance for employees or VAT.
In a corner
Reluctance to cut welfare spending and raise taxes, while promising big-ticket spending on the NHS, defense, infrastructure and education, means that Labour has boxed itself into a corner, Peel Hunt's Chief Economist Kallum Pickering told CNBC.
""The economics of this is actually fairly straightforward. You could cut major parts of spending, especially on things like welfare, that would reset incentives in things like labor markets. You could deregulate major parts of the economy so that you would have more economic pie to tax. None of those are options that are available for Labour. They've constrained their political choices,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday.
""We're sweating over whether a government with a £3 trillion economy can raise £20 billion in a budget. It's not because the bond market won't let you make adjustments. It's because you've prevented yourself from taking the choices that could get you there,"" Pickering said.
The bond markets have certainly made their feelings known ahead of the budget, with the yield on 30-year U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, hitting their highest level since 1998 on Tuesday. Bond yields in the U.S. and other major European economies also rose, reflecting wider fiscal worries.
Investors demanding a higher interest rate to hold U.K. debt was seen as a warning shot to the British government that Reeves must stick to her fiscal rules and restore fiscal credibility to the government's policies — or risk undermining investor confidence in the country's leadership and economic prospects.",ffa9453d01706606e62e8a413dc6693a,trafilatura,4253,0

Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:
- Earnings per share: Breakeven
- Revenue: $249.6 million vs. $248.8 million expected
Revenue increased 41% year over year in the second quarter from $177.2 million a year earlier, Figma said in a statement. The company provided a preliminary estimate of $247 million to $250 million in a July regulatory filing. CNBC isn't including a profit estimate because it's Figma's first earnings report.
Net income totaled $846,000, compared with a loss of $827.9 million in the second quarter of 2024. The company's adjusted operating income came to $11.5 million, after Figma provided a prior estimate of $9 million to $12 million.
For the third quarter, Figma forecast revenue of between $263 million and $265 million, which would represent about 33% growth at the middle of the range. The LSEG consensus was $256.8 million.
The company sees between $88 million and $98 million in adjusted operating income for the full year and a little more than $1.02 billion in revenue. The revenue range implies about 37% growth and is above the $1.01 billion LSEG consensus.
Last year, Figma picked up more revenue from customers as it sold them access to Dev Mode, which helps software developers to implement designs that designers create in the company's software. That momentum is putting a damper on revenue growth for the third quarter, Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said in an interview.
In the second quarter, Figma announced Figma Make, which uses artificial intelligence to compose app and website designs based on a user's descriptions, and Figma Sites, which turns designs into working websites. The company also acquired vector graphics startup Modyfi and content management system startup Payload.
Figma has yet to start fully charging for artificial intelligence products, but says it has built the underlying costs into its model. The company is not providing a forecast for third-quarter adjusted operating income.
""We plan on letting customers know that they have the opportunity to purchase additional AI credits in the future,"" Praveer Melwani, Figma's finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts.
Several software vendors have faced pressure this year due to concerns surrounding AI and whether it will displace business. Field told CNBC that he's not seeing that play out internally and that, if anything, the role of designers will only become more critical.
""I think that the more that software becomes easier to build with AI, the more that people are going to see that that human touch is needed,"" Field said in the interview. He acknowledged Figma has been adopting so-called vibe-coding tools for AI-driven software development.
Figma reported a 129% net retention rate, a reflection of expansion with existing customers. The figure was down from 132% in the first quarter.
Following its IPO, Figma expects a share sale lockup to expire for 25% of some employees' stock after market close on Sept. 4.
Investors holding just over half of Figma's outstanding Class A stock have agreed to an extended lockup, with the final 35% of their shares expiring in August 2026.
Field said he wanted to provide clarity for investors.
""That's something that I think is valuable information,"" Field said in the interview.
On Wednesday, the company's stock closed at $68.13. The company priced shares in its IPO at $33, and saw the stock pop to $115.50 in its debut.
Figma had 1,119 customers paying more than $100,000 in annualized revenue, up from 1,031 in the March quarter, according to a filing.
The company had about $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on June 30, with $90.8 million in a Bitcoin exchange traded fund, the filing indicated.
""We're not trying to be Michael Saylor here,"" Field said in the interview, referring to the co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy. ""This is not, like, a Bitcoin holding company. It's a design company, but I think there's a place for it in the balance sheet and as part of a diversified treasury strategy.""",1a18bf935b5f42fad7c69ee2f87761c9,trafilatura,4236,0

Google will not have to divest its Chrome browser as a remedy to the search monopoly ruling, nor will it be banned from making payments for default placement on other firms' devices. Big win for Google. Why did it happen? Because of the rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT since the case began. Alphabet shares are up more than 5% this morning. Lots of analyst price target hikes too. 2. The remedy decision is also a big win for Club name Apple , with shares up almost 4%. Apple gets free money from Google, reportedly more than $20 billion a year, just so Google can be the default on Apple's over 2.35 billion active devices. There is no clear winner so far in AI, but whoever decides to pay Apple the most will win. It's all about leverage. 3. The strength in Alphabet and Apple shares are giving a lift to Nasdaq and S & P 500 futures, putting the indexes on pace for a positive day after yesterday's slide. The 30-stock Dow , which has less tech exposure, is set to open flat. 4. Chinese President Xi Jinping said the rejuvenation of China is ""unstoppable"" as the country held a military parade with Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un in attendance. How about unstoppable spending on the People's Liberation Army? President Donald Trump accused the trio of conspiring against the U.S. 5. Can the cybersecurity cohort including Club names Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike come back to life? Perhaps Zscaler's quarter with very good annual recurring revenue can help catalyze that. Analysts from BMO, KeyBanc and JPMorgan raised their price targets. 6. Signet Jewelers joins the value plays as the Kay, Zales, and Jared nameplates surged in its fiscal second quarter. Very impressive resurgence led by CEO J.K. Symancyk, who has been in the job less than a year. Despite steep tariffs on imports from India, a big diamond exporter, Signet raised its guidance. Bank of America went to $100 a share from $90 but kept its neutral rating. 7. HubSpot , a provider of customer relationship management software, was upgraded to a buy-equivalent rating from market perform at Bernstein. Could this help revive the entire group of seat-based enterprise software stocks weighed down by AI fears? We'll find out tonight when its larger rival and Club stock Salesforce reports. It's down almost 25% year to date. 8. A wave of price target cuts for Modelo brewer Constellation Brands after horrendous numbers including at BofA, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley. Even with the stock's struggles this year, the company is still worth over $26 billion. I'm not sure that should be the case with sales coming down. Molson Coors , which had more revenue in its last fiscal year, has a roughly $9.5 billion market cap. 9. Shares of Macy's surged after the retailer's results came in much better than expected and it raised its earnings and revenue outlook. Bloomingdale's continues to perform well with strong same-store sales growth, while a group of 125 Macy's stores that are the focus of turnaround efforts outperformed the broader brand. 10. Truist raised its price target on the hotel chain Marriott to $278 from $273 but kept its hold rating. While down year to date, this stock has been a consistent winner with remarkable long-term growth. Truist also lowered its PT on the hated Airbnb by $2 to $104 and maintained its sell rating.

",2025-09-03 20:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Snowflake (SNOW), an artificial intelligence (AI) innovator, has continued its streak of robust growth, building on a strong first quarter with yet another impressive performance. The company's Q2 2026 earnings report on Aug. 27 energized investors, driving shares up approximately 20.3% on Aug. 28.
The market responded decisively to this beat-and-raise quarter, propelling SNOW stock to a new 52-week high of $249.99 on Aug. 28. Confidence was further bolstered as management raised the full-year guidance, signaling both resilience in operations and the strength of its underlying business model.
The durability of demand is evident in Snowflake’s substantial addressable market and its robust backlog, reflected in remaining performance obligations. These factors continue to underpin bullish sentiment on Wall Street, as analysts recognize the company’s ability to deliver consistent growth while scaling efficiently.
About Snowflake Stock
Headquartered in Bozeman, Montana, Snowflake powers the AI Data Cloud, a platform that consolidates enterprise data into a single source. With a market capitalization of approximately $79.6 billion, its technology enables organizations to analyze information, apply AI for complex business solutions, build custom data applications, and share data products efficiently.
SNOW stock has performed exceptionally well, rising 114% over the last 52 weeks and delivering a year-to-date (YTD) gain of 55%. Momentum remains strong, with shares up 21% over the past five trading days, reflecting investor optimism in the wake of strong quarterly results.
SNOW stock trades at 208 times forward adjusted earnings and 21.97 times sales.
Snowflake Surpasses Q2 Earnings
On Aug. 27, Snowflake announced Q2 2026 results that exceeded Wall Street expectations. Revenue rose 32% year-over-year (YOY) to $1.1 billion, slightly surpassing the Street’s projection of $1.09 billion. Product revenue matched at $1.09 billion, reflecting 32% YOY growth.
Customer growth remained strong, with net new additions up 21% compared to the prior year, and the quality of customers improved alongside quantity. During the quarter, 50 customers surpassed $1 million in trailing 12-month (TTM) revenue, pushing the total number of such high-value customers to 654, while the overall customer count reached 12,062.
Forward-looking indicators also show promise. Remaining performance obligations rose 33% YOY to $6.9 billion, and the net revenue retention rate stayed robust at 125%, signaling that existing customers continue to expand their usage steadily.
Operational gains translated into stronger profitability, with adjusted operating margins reaching 11%, up from 5% a year ago. Non-GAAP net income grew 104.4% to $129 million, while adjusted EPS climbed 94.4% to $0.35, beating analyst estimates of $0.27.
Looking forward, Snowflake projects October quarter product revenue between $1.125 billion and $1.13 billion, while raising full-year product revenue guidance to $4.4 billion.
Meanwhile, analysts expect Q3 2026 loss per share to narrow by 30.7% YOY to $0.61, and full-year fiscal 2026 loss per share to decline 30.6% to $2.43.
What Do Analysts Expect for Snowflake Stock?
Morgan Stanley has taken a particularly bullish stance on Snowflake, with analyst Sanjit Singh raising the price target from $262 to $272 and maintaining an “Overweight” rating. The firm views Snowflake as a premier opportunity to capitalize on the ongoing trend of data modernization in enterprise software.
SNOW maintains a consensus rating of “Strong Buy” among 44 analysts covering the stock. Of these, 35 recommend a “Strong Buy,” three give a “Moderate Buy"" rating, five provide a “Hold"" rating, and one analyst has a “Strong Sell.” SNOW stock has an average price target of $256.90, implying 8% potential upside from current levels. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $285 reflects a 19% potential gain from here.

For the fifth consecutive year, Vietnam is the most affordable country in the world for expats, ranking first out of 46 destinations when it comes to personal finances, according to the 2025 Expat Insider study by InterNations, an online platform and global community for expats.
Conducted annually since 2014, the study gathered insights from more than 10,000 expats representing 172 nationalities living in countries and territories worldwide.
Survey participants for the personal finance index were asked to rate their satisfaction with their financial situation, general cost of living, and whether their disposable household income was enough to lead a comfortable life in their country of residence.
Here are the top 10 most affordable destinations for expats in 2025, according to InterNations:
- Vietnam (most affordable)
- Colombia
- Panama
- China
- Thailand
- Indonesia
- Philippines
- Mexico
- Malaysia
- Brazil
Asian countries dominated the list when it comes to personal finances for expats, with five out of the top 10 countries being from Southeast Asia: Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia.
""Compared to 2024, nine of the countries in the top 10 retain this title. Only Malaysia (9th) is a new addition, edging its way in from 11th place last year,"" according to the report. Notably, no European country made the list.
In Vietnam, 89% of respondents were pleased with the general cost of living, while 87% of respondents said their disposable household income was about or more than enough to lead a comfortable life, compared with a global 40% and 69%, respectively, according to the report.
That financial breathing room may also explain why some expats put down roots in the country – 54% have lived there for five or more years already, and 30% want to stay forever, according to the report.
Colombia and Panama followed in second and third place, respectively.
In Colombia, the majority of survey respondents said their disposable income was enough to live comfortably — 92% compared with 69% globally. Also, no expat in the country flagged cost of living as a major concern before moving, a stark contrast to the global average of 21%, according to InterNations.
Meanwhile, Panama is particularly popular with retirees — 35% of expats there were already retired, compared to just 11% globally, data showed.
Here are the 10 least affordable countries for expats in 2025, according to InterNations:
- Norway (37 out of 46 globally)
- Australia
- Ireland
- South Korea
- Singapore
- Qatar
- Türkiye
- Finland
- United Kingdom
- Canada (least affordable)
Canada and the UK round out the bottom of the personal finance index, with 62% and 61% of expats surveyed unhappy with the general cost of living, respectively, compared with the global average of 40%, the study found.
Notably, there were three new additions to the bottom 10 in this year's study: Qatar (42nd) and Australia (38th) slid into the bottom, while South Korea (40th) nosedived 25 places from 2024, according to the report.
The United States ranked 35th out of 46 globally in the study's personal finance ranking, just missing the bottom 10.

His 23-year-old mentee had spent 1½ years crafting a luxury travel persona — one that suggested she was living a $500,000-a-year lifestyle, he said. In reality, her annual expenditure was closer to $12,000, he said.
""She would book $200 day passes at exclusive beach clubs in Miami [and] take 400 photos in six hours,"" Morgan told CNBC Travel.
Then she would post the photos over a span of eight weeks to give the impression that she frequently stayed in luxury resorts.
That was not all. Morgan said she would strike up conversations with concierges at luxury hotels, offering them money in exchange for letting her into the hotel.
""For $50 tips, they would let her access rooftop pools and lobbies at Four Seasons properties for 30-minute photo sessions,"" he said.
The illusion worked. Her Instagram account grew to 85,000 followers, who were drawn in by her seemingly extravagant lifestyle, he said.
But the goal was not just influence — it was income.
""She viewed her fake luxury content as business investment, eventually landing brand partnerships worth $180,000 annually,"" said Morgan.
Her fabricated image on social media had morphed into a money-making machine.
Luxury funded by debt
Gen Zs spent an average of $11,766 — more than any other generation — to travel in the summer of 2024, according to a review in April of policies purchased through the travel insurance marketplace Squaremouth.
In 2025, 31% of Gen Zs said they planned to go into debt to pay for their summer vacations, according to a survey by the financial services company Bankrate.
Yet, for some, their luxury vacations are all a facade.
Instead of documenting the whole trip, they highlight only the most 'Instagrammable' moments.Mohd RizwanDirector at Travelosei
American property manager Daniel Rivera said he experienced this with one of his tenants.
The 24-year-old tenant posted photos of a $400 per night Airbnb rental in Miami, despite being three weeks late on her $1,800 monthly rent, said Rivera.
""She later admitted she split that luxury rental with six friends for just one night to get the perfect poolside shots,"" he said. ""The photos made it look like a week-long luxury vacation.""
Rivera said the housing applications he received from Gen Zs often reveal details on how they afford their lifestyles.
""During tenant screenings, I've noticed 30% more applications showing recent personal loan inquiries, often labeled as ""vacation funding"" in their financial histories,"" he said, adding that they often have high debt-to-income ratios and maxed-out credit cards.
A thread on Reddit asked how Gen Zs pay for their frequent travels, especially those who travel in their late teens and early 20s.
One user commented on their decision to use debt to fund their vacations.
""Was it financially irresponsible? Yes. Did most people tell me I was wasting my money and that I should be saving my money? Yes. Would I do it again? 1000%,"" the user wrote. ""You prioritize what you want in your life and deal with the consequences.""
False framing
Other Gen Zs use loopholes to pay for trips without disclosing them on social media.
Rivera mentioned other tenants who house-sit in wealthy neighborhoods in New Jersey, like Montclair and Short Hills. Though they were there for a job, the tenants took photographs which gave the impression that they lived there, he said.
Mohd Rizwan, a director at the New Delhi-based luxury travel company Travelosei, said he too has seen a shift in how younger generations frame their vacations online.

Ahead of Wednesday evening's drawing at 10:59 p.m. ET, the prize is now ranked as the fourth largest in the game's history and the sixth-largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association that runs the lottery.
Here's a look at the 10 biggest Powerball jackpots of all time and where the winning ticket was purchased:
- $2.04 billion — Nov. 7, 2022 (California)
- $1.765 billion — Oct. 11, 2023 (California)
- $1.586 billion — Jan. 13, 2016 (California, Florida, Tennessee)
- $1.40 billion (estimated) — Sept. 3, 2025
- $1.326 billion — April 6, 2024 (Oregon)
- $1.08 billion — July 19, 2023 (California)
- $842.4 million — Jan. 1, 2024 (Michigan)
- $768.4 million — March 27, 2019 (Wisconsin)
- $758.7 million — Aug. 23, 2017 (Massachusetts)
- $754.6 million — Feb. 6, 2023 (Washington)
And here's how Wednesday night's drawing compares with the 10 biggest jackpots ever awarded:
- $2.04 billion Powerball — Nov. 7, 2022 (California)
- $1.765 billion Powerball — Oct. 11, 2023 (California)
- $1.602 billion Mega Millions — Aug. 8, 2023 (Florida)
- $1.586 billion Powerball — Jan. 13, 2016 (California, Florida, Tennessee)
- $1.537 billion Mega Millions — Oct. 23, 2018 (South Carolina)
- $1.40 billion Powerball (estimated) — Sept. 3, 2025
- $1.348 billion Mega Millions — Jan. 13, 2023 (Maine)
- $1.337 billion Mega Millions — July 29, 2022 (Illinois)
- $1.326 billion Powerball — April 6, 2024 (Oregon)
- $1.269 billion Mega Millions — Dec. 27, 2024 (California)
If no ticket matches all six numbers in Wednesday's Powerball draw, the jackpot will roll over and grow based on ticket sales. The next drawing would then offer a prize even larger than the current $1.4 billion, potentially setting a new record as the third biggest in Powerball history.
What to know if you win
If you're lucky enough to win the jackpot prize, you'll have a choice between the full $1.4 billion annuity, paid out over 30 years, or the lump-sum cash option of $634.3 million.
Winnings are taxed by the federal government and by most states, so the actual take-home will be less than the listed prize amounts.
Financial experts often recommend taking a few practical steps before rushing to claim a life-changing prize:
- Secure the ticket. Sign the back of the ticket and keep it in a safe location, such as a home safe or bank deposit box. Some experts also suggest making a copy or taking a photo for your records.
- Keep it quiet. Avoid publicizing the win until after the claim is official. Announcing it too soon can invite scammers or unwanted attention.
- Assemble a team. A lawyer, financial advisor and tax professional can help with the complex decisions around claiming and managing such a large amount of money.
- Plan for the long term. A financial planner can help you decide whether the annuity or lump sum better suits your financial goals and tolerance for risk, as there are pros and cons to both options.
Powerball tickets are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The odds of winning the jackpot are about 1 in 292.2 million, though the odds of winning any prize are 1 in 24.9, according to the lottery.

Labor Day in the U.S., which took place Monday, marks the unofficial end of summer — which means saying goodbye to the promise of all life could be and once again squeezing it to fit the four walls of the office.
But there was someone eager to get back to work: U.S. President Donald Trump. (Not that he appeared to take a summer vacation at all, as CNN reported.) Trump said Tuesday he will request an ""expedited ruling"" from the Supreme Court to overturn a federal appeals court decision that most of his tariffs were illegal.
The White House leader blamed that ruling for the fall in stocks Tuesday. ""The stock market's down because of that, because the stock market needs the tariffs,"" he said. ""They want the tariffs.""
It's a debatable assertion, given that stocks sank after Trump announced his ""reciprocal"" tariffs on that fateful April day, and surged — in one of the biggest rallies in history — following a pause in the implementation of levies.
However, Trump is potentially right in one aspect of the market benefiting from tariffs: Treasurys. The yield on the 30-year bond nearly touched 5% as investors, fearing a hit to the U.S. government's coffers if deprived of tariff revenue, demanded more returns for lending to a White House already persistently in fiscal deficit.

The Restore Trust in Congress Act combines several different proposals into one vehicle that supporters say will focus the debate and lead to passage.
Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., one of the lead sponsors of the bill, said the fact that members of Congress are permitted to trade and own individual stocks makes ""people go nuts, because it is crazy to the average person that this has been allowed to go on for so long.""
""We have reached a tipping point where the pressure from outside the building is becoming too much for leadership to deny,"" he said during a press conference at the Capitol on Wednesday.
The bill's supporters span the political spectrum – they include hardline conservative Republicans like Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who is also leading the bill, and Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee; moderate Republicans like Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania; and progressive Democratic Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York
The new bill would ban members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning, buying or trading individual stocks and other banned assets while in office — even if those assets are held in a blind trust.
It would also require lawmakers to sell any stocks, options, futures and commodities they own soon after being sworn into office. Any member who violates the ban would need to pay a fee equal to 10% of the value of the covered investment, and get rid of any profits from that investment.
The measure doesn't include executive branch officials, including the president, unlike a bill from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., that was advanced by a committee in July but is unlikely to get a floor vote after it was criticized by President Donald Trump.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has expressed general support for a ban in the past, but not any specific bill. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said during the press conference Wednesday that if leadership didn't bring a bill to the floor by the end of the month, she would force a vote on it though a procedural maneuver that would require a simple majority of the House – 218 lawmakers – to back it.
Despite the growing momentum in support of a ban, there's still significant opposition to it — the same opposition that has thwarted past attempts to enact limits on congressional stock trading beyond those contained in the 2012 STOCK Act.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., was one of several lawmakers to argue during a July hearing that the measure would be a barrier that kept business owners and executives from running for public office.
""We have we have too many career politicians. We don't have enough people who have experience in private sector,"" Johnson said. ""This piece of legislation would be hugely discouraging to people from the private sector coming here and serving.""
But supporters of the ban said that those who wanted to serve needed to put the country's interests ahead of their own.
""If you want to trade stocks go to Wall Street,"" Luna said Wednesday. ""Don't go to Congress.""",6327ac64e7139e60c3de3cfe494283f7,trafilatura,3229,0

The persistent growth is reshaping both client portfolios and financial advisor conversations. As the industry looks ahead to the potential approval of share classes, a game-changing structural development, it’s more important than ever for advisors to understand the evolving ETF landscape to help their clients navigate a growing list of investment choices.

Advantage, ETFs
Investors’ growing preference for ETFs is largely driven by the structural advantages. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs typically transact in-kind on the primary market, making them more tax-efficient. They also offer intraday liquidity by trading on exchanges in the same way stocks do, enabling investors to respond to market fluctuations in real time. ETFs generally feature lower expense ratios than mutual funds, too, making them a more cost-effective option for many investors.
Since the SEC’s adoption of the ETF rule in 2019, launching them has become faster and more streamlined. More than 2,500 such funds have come to market over the last six years, with actively managed ETFs accounting for the majority. In addition, more than 140 mutual funds have converted into ETFs, giving investors new access points to long-established strategies in a tax-advantaged structure.
Now, advisors have over 4,000 ETFs to navigate in the US marketplace alone. While this abundance offers flexibility, it also introduces complexity. Advisors looking to guide their clients through the noise, should keep the following in mind:
-
Educate on the ETF structure. The lower cost profile, tax-efficiency and liquidity are all compelling benefits to ETFs. The ETF vehicle offers investors access to more strategies than ever, and advisors must be able to articulate this expanded access to investors clearly.
-
Address common misconceptions. Many still associate ETFs with passive investing. While that was once the norm, today’s market includes a wide range of actively managed ETFs that provide access to various asset classes and investment strategies.
-
Check manager track records, even outside the ETF vehicle. The performance of the ETF vehicle is not limited to its structure; it rests heavily on the manager’s broader experience. Advisors should ensure managers have a strong track record across mutual funds and other vehicles, offering their clients insight into consistency, strategy and long-term performance.
-
Align with client risk profiles and objectives. ETF selection goes beyond general exposure. Advisors must evaluate how well the fund’s strategy and exposure aligns with their client’s tolerance for risk, as well as their short- and long-term goals.
-
Don’t forget about liquidity. Many investors fall into the trap of focusing only on bid-ask spreads or daily volume, but underlying asset liquidity is just as crucial for execution and flexibility. Advisors can ensure their clients are not overlooking compelling opportunities by focusing solely on superficial metrics.",636eb4c47777771516c7f4fa86547844,trafilatura,3211,0

The one-month return of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was 28.59%, and its shares lost 47.50% of their value over the last 52 weeks.

Janus Henderson Forty Fund stated the following regarding UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
""Conversely, healthcare selection and an overweight position detracted from relative performance. The sector remains challenged due to government policy uncertainty and initiatives to encourage domestic drug manufacturing. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was a top relative detractor. The company missed earnings expectations and lowered financial guidance twice during the quarter, citing unexpectedly high medical costs and stronger-than anticipated Medicare Advantage demand. Its Optum Health unit also came under pressure as patients required more intensive care, compounded by ongoing Medicare funding cuts. The company appointed a new CEO who previously led UnitedHealth successfully for a decade. Despite recent challenges, we have confidence in new management and believe the company maintains its structural scale and data competitive advantages that should allow market share gains over time.""

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 1%, ending the day back strongly in the green after wobbling in the afternoon. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained around 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost nearly 0.1%.
Tech hopes looked to buoy after a judge's decision not to force Google to sell its Chrome browser to loosen its search dominance. The ruling late Tuesday also allowed the Alphabet-owned company to continue paying Apple (AAPL) to use Google Search as the default in Safari and Siri.
The outcome of the landmark antitrust case fell far short of Wall Street's worst fears, lifting a regulatory risk that had hung over Google's stock. The tech giant's shares rallied Wednesday, as did Apple's, and faith in the staying power of the Big Tech rally got a boost.
But the Dow lagged even as the sell-off in bonds eased, having piled on pressure amid uncertainty around President Trump's trade policy and the Federal Reserve. The 30-year Treasury yield (^TYX) traded below 4.9%, pulling back after rising to within a hair's breadth of the key 5% level overnight. Meanwhile, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) also pared gains to 4.2%.
Job openings hit 7.18 million in July, according to the latest JOLTS report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure was below the 7.38 million expected by economists tracked by Bloomberg and the 7.36 million open jobs in June.
The JOLTS report served as the first course in a jobs-heavy week, after July's jobs report showed cracks appearing in the labor market. Further signs of stress in last month's data could convince the Fed to make a deeper cut in interest rates than currently expected at its September meeting. The crucial August jobs report is set to land Friday.
As of Wednesday, more than 95% of bets were on a 25-point cut.
LIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 20 updatesGoogle stock surges as investors cheer antitrust ruling
Shares in Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) jumped almost 6% in premarket trading after a judge ruled it doesn't have to sell Chrome as an antitrust remedy.
Judge Amit Mehta also allowed Google to keep control of the Android mobile operating system. But in a setback, the tech giant will have to end billion-dollar contracts that fueled its search market dominance.
The DOJ had argued that Google should divest Chrome and Android after a judgment last year that it held an illegal monopoly in search. However, Judge Mehta noted that AI bots now threaten its dominance, and that fed into his ruling.
At the same time, he stopped short of putting an end to Google's distribution search deal with Apple (AAPL). Its payments for making Google Search a default in Safari and Siri have added up to $20 billion per year in revenue for the iPhone maker, whose shares rose almost 3% in premarket.

Please note that Sam will be speaking on this subject at the GlobalData Automotive Europe Conference 2025, set to take place on 15-16 October in Munich.
These are exciting and transformative times in the auto industry. How do you think the transition to electric vehicles and away from ICEs is going in general terms?
There is a clear bifurcation in EV adoption between China versus the rest of the world. The transition for China is going along just fine – EVs there are now generally as cheap in terms of price and production cost as their ICE counterparts.
And they could even accelerate it if they wanted to, but China wants a controlled and orderly transition that does not disrupt economic factors and targets while still maintaining China has the leading EV industry and market.
As for the rest of the world, especially Western markets, demand has undeniably underwhelmed compared to automakers’ expectations, but targets and investments have now been recalibrated and rationalised.
It seems now that the teething problems and resistance to change among Western OEMs are now turning into acceptance and pragmatic solutions – shrewd investments in the EV supply chain and software, partnering with Chinese peers and suppliers, making do with options available to them in the context of trade barriers, and ultimately turning these into more affordable and compelling vehicles.
Policy has a habit of getting in the way, but I believe the technology and economics of EVs and batteries are conducive to continued long-term growth.
What do you see as the biggest challenges in the battery supply chain?
The number one priority for OEMs is cost control, but a close second is supply chain de-risking. The challenge is balancing them.
A notable example is that the US has been requiring automakers and battery makers to cut out Chinese companies from their supply chain to be eligible for hefty tax credits. These Chinese suppliers provide the cheapest (and generally the highest quality!) product, and they have the technical advantage, speed, and resources to guarantee delivery.
EV margins for Western automakers are under pressure, and affordability is one of the main barriers to broader EV adoption in Western markets. But supply chain diversification and de-risking is a long-term imperative for manufacturers given the disruptions the industry has seen over the last seven years.
Besides that, a major challenge specific to the West is that their nascent domestic battery industries and supply chains face a horse-and-cart problem: companies are reluctant to invest in supply chain projects if there are no direct customers or suppliers in the region. You wouldn’t set up a precursor plant in the US if there’s no cathode plant to take that material, but you wouldn’t set up a cathode plant if there are no precursor suppliers.",569e0f12480a4877798a2732c2788169,trafilatura,2990,0

The Eurozone Aug CPI rose +2.1% y/y, right on expectations. The Aug core CPI rose 2.3% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.2% y/y.
ECB Executive Board member Schnabel said the ECB should maintain borrowing costs at current levels with inflation risks tilted to the upside.
On the geopolitical front, diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine remain elusive, which is bearish for the euro. Last Friday, German Chancellor Merz and French President Macron called for secondary sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine and said they will push for measures targeting ""companies from third countries that support Russia's war."" Last Thursday, German Chancellor Merz stated that a meeting between Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky is unlikely to take place. The outcome of the Russian-Ukrainian war could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.",9d12b674e084b960135215f966eacf95,trafilatura,2963,0

The stock dropped 4% in extended trading.
Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:
- Earnings per share: $2.91 adjusted vs. $2.78 expected
- Revenue: $10.24 billion vs. $10.14 billion expected
Revenue increased 10% from $9.33 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income rose to $1.89 billion, or $1.96 per share, from $1.43 billion, or $1.47 per share, a year ago.
For the fiscal third quarter, management called for $2.84 to $2.86 in adjusted earnings per share on $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had been looking for $2.85 per share on $10.29 billion in revenue.
Salesforce maintained its full-year revenue outlook but now sees higher earnings. The company is targeting $11.33 to $11.37 in adjusted earnings per share on $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion in revenue. The consensus estimate from LSEG was $11.31 in earnings per share and $41.2 billion in revenue. The forecast in May included $11.27 to $11.33 in adjusted earnings per share.
Salesforce is dealing with challenges selling marketing and commerce products and slower growth in its expiration base, Robin Washington, the company's president and chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts.
The company has fallen out of favor on Wall Street this year due to an extended stretch of meager revenue growth, which has been stuck in the single digits since mid-2024. While the company regularly touts its investments in artificial intelligence and the advancements in its software as a service, or SaaS, it hasn't been lifted by the artificial intelligence boom in the same way as many of its tech peers.
""To hear some of this nonsense that's out there in social media or in other places, and people say the craziest things, but it's not grounded in any customer truth,"" co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff said on the call.
Going into Wednesday's report, Salesforce was down 23% for the year, lagging behind all but one stock in the Dow and trailing all other large-cap tech companies.
The ratio of Salesforce's enterprise value to its free cash flow has reached a 10-year low because of fears of disruption from AI, according to analysts at Jefferies, who have a buy rating on the stock. Salesforce is trying to counter the pressure by selling its Agentforce AI software that can automate the handling of customer service questions.
Salesforce has racked up over 6,000 paid Agentforce deals, Benioff said.
During the fiscal second quarter, Salesforce said it was planning to increase the cost of some products and announced its intent to acquire data management software company Informatica for $8 billion.
On Wednesday Salesforce announced a $20 billion increase to its share buyback program, bringing the total to $50 billion.",6deebab585e3eaa35e7d3f9d7c39f259,trafilatura,2924,0

Good morning. With fall in full swing, it seems like a good time to do a gut check on the state of the American consumer. I pored through financial results reported over the last two weeks by a variety of big retailers and found a mixed bag. Though there are pockets of optimism, it’s clear that consumers are worried. The big wild card going into the fall will be the full impact of tariffs, expected to be felt acutely in the second half of the year. Indeed, Best Buy had a strong second quarter but did not raise its full-year guidance during its late August earnings call because of the tariff uncertainty. Many companies rushed their buying in the spring before tariffs came into effect, but that can only shield them for so long. Here’s what some prominent CEOs are seeing.
Michael Bender, interim CEO of Kohl’s: “Consumers continue to be pressured and are being choiceful with their purchases … Lower to middle-income customers continue to prioritize value and are trading down into lower opening price point products.”
Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General: “Seeking value, we’re seeing that in all cohorts of customers, meaning our core customer, mid- and high-end customers, all of them.”
Ted Decker, CEO of Home Depot: “The No. 1 reason for deferring the large project is general economic uncertainty.”
Corie Barry, CEO of Best Buy: “We have seen both breadth and depth of promotions higher than last year and we assume that will continue. Customers continued to be resilient but deal-focused… In the current environment, customers continue to be thoughtful about big-ticket purchases and are willing to spend on high price point products when they need to or when there is technology innovation.”
Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart: “As we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.”
Robert Ball, CFO of Abercrombie & Fitch: “Our customer doesn’t come to us for price. We’re not necessarily going to chase traffic and conversion through price … We’ve seen tariffs 1.0. We’ve seen the pandemic. We’ve seen inflation, cotton spikes, freight rate spikes, you name it, and those are just a couple of examples. ”Many retailers have managed all the noise and macro angst capably, posting strong sales results for the first half of 2025. Walmart, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General, Dick’s Sporting Goods and Costco to name just a few. But one thing’s for sure: When consumers get nervous, CEOs should be nervous too.—Phil Wahba

Economic data releases and earnings
Kraft Heinz (KHC) is splitting up. Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) is unraveling into a coffee company and a separate beverage company. And Elliott Management is agitating to shake up PepsiCo (PEP).
While the maneuverings in the food world each have their own stories and contours, what the developments have in common is a struggle to keep up with shifting consumer preferences.
Shoppers are drifting to cheaper grocery store brands after years of higher prices. And a heightened aversion to processed foods has pressured iconic brands, as has the MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) movement. Where food executives used to lean on synergies and combinations, the strategy of the day appears to be price consciousness and product focus.
""Food stocks have just not really done well this year,"" Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez said in a live Yahoo Finance appearance. Snack foods in particular have taken a hit as the explosion of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs has led people away from food products, she noted.
But if weakening demand for marquee brands is at the heart of the problem, how can companies manage and market their way out of it? And can corporate reengineering even keep people interested in the engineered American staples?
Creating narrower, more thematically focused operations is one way to tackle the problem of shifting tastes. But there are other considerations alongside catering to health-conscious consumers that can move a ticker.
In explaining the Kraft Heinz breakup, the company said the two entities will be better positioned to focus on what they do best, investing in individual brands and lessening the complexity of their large array of food products. The grocery staples business, for instance, will center on a smaller geography, while the sauces and spreads unit will look to expand internationally.
Keurig Dr Pepper offered a similar justification for its unwinding, which will also involve the acquisition of the parent company of Peet's Coffee for $18 billion. Two entities, each optimized for their business, will be able to chase opportunities, the company said, like energy drinks for the cold beverage unit and growth outside the US for the coffee business.
Breakups aren't always the answer, either.
With PepsiCo, Elliot Management stopped short of calling for a food and beverage split. Instead, the activist investor encouraged Pepsi to cull its weakest products and lay out specific plans for a turnaround, among other recommendations. Elliot said Pepsi's shares could rise more than 50% if it follows through on a turnaround. Shares of Pepsi are roughly flat for the year, while rival Coca-Cola (KO) is up close to 11%.",05028179b62abc895cf653b431dbd54c,trafilatura,2916,0

Jeans rarely make Wall Street headlines, but the denim feud between American Eagle and Gap has investors paying attention.
In late July, American Eagle rolled out its Sydney Sweeney campaign with the tagline “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.” The ad went viral, but not in the way the company hoped. Critics slammed it as “rage-bait,” sparking backlash over its racially-charged undertones.

For a moment, Wall Street didn’t care. Shares surged as much as 24% — the biggest percentage gain in 25 years. But the boost was fleeting. According to Bloomberg Second Measure, sales slid year over year, dropping from 17.5% the week of July 20 to nearly 11% by July 27. Online traffic also dipped.
Gap, meanwhile, leaned into nostalgia. Its “Better in Denim” campaign tapped into Y2K vibes, featuring girl group KATSEYE with Kelis, singing “Milkshake.” The campaign clicked with consumers, sending engagement soaring and giving shares a 4% lift in August.
Ad campaigns can move the needle in the short term, but building an investment strategy around them is like buying jeans for the logo instead of the fit — flashy now, disappointing later.
When controversy meets the bottom line
For denim retailers, 2025 has been more about headlines than hard numbers.
American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) has had a rough run, with shares down about 25.9% since the start of the year. A pre-earnings rally lifted the stock to $12.55 in mid-May, but momentum stalled when the company pulled its outlook and posted a deeper-than-expected loss. Shares fell below $11 before inching back to $12.85 by August 29.
That rebound lined up with the company’s Sydney Sweeney campaign — a pop culture play that put American Eagle back in the spotlight. But analysts caution it may not translate into lasting gains.
""Near term, there is risk that the recent Sydney Sweeney campaign added momentum,"" Bank of America analysts wrote. ""However, we do not assign a high likelihood that momentum from this campaign can fully inflect the business over the long run.""
The controversy hasn’t helped. Allegations by critics surfaced that the “Sydney Sweeney’s got great genes” campaign carried undertones linked to eugenics, a discredited genetic theory often invoked by white supremacists. Sweeney also came under scrutiny for being a registered Republican, drawing attention from President Donald Trump.",58f52f212e5bd2b51401a96f7cce21f1,trafilatura,2914,0

But 2 Obstacles Remain That Could Derail It.
Key Points
-
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently said in a speech that the Fed may soon adjust its policy stance.
-
The labor market has slowed a bit in recent months, while inflation has remained above the Fed's preferred 2% rate.
-
There has been great debate over whether it's prudent for the Fed to cut rates in September.
After Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave what many considered to be a dovish speech at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole Symposium, the stock market was off to the races, as the odds for an interest rate cut at the Fed's upcoming September meeting climbed significantly.
However, traders betting on changes to the federal funds rate have changed their opinion often in recent months, and I think there is the potential for upcoming economic indicators to throw another curveball.
While the stock market thinks a rate cut is in the bag in September, two obstacles remain that could derail that.
Critical economic data will come out before the Fed's meeting
The Fed will begin its September meeting on Sept. 16 and conclude on Sept. 17 with its decision to either cut rates or leave them unchanged. The Fed's dual mandate is to maintain stable prices and achieve maximum employment, two policies that are increasingly at odds with one another.
For several years, the Fed has been dealing with a historically strong labor market, at least as far as the data goes, and extremely high inflation. One of the most intense rate-hiking campaigns in 40 years, which began in 2022, has helped the Fed rein in inflation. In the July report, the Consumer Price Index showed a 2.7% increase year-over-year, while core inflation, stripping out more volatile energy and food prices, was up 3.1%.
Meanwhile, the labor market has started to show signs of slowing, with the economy only adding 73,000 jobs in July and significant downward revisions to previous job numbers. Powell and the Fed have expressed concern about the labor market, which is the main case for the Fed to resume its rate-cutting campaign, which officially kicked off last year. However, with inflation still well above the Fed's 2% preferred target, that could make the case for the Fed to leave rates unchanged. At all costs, Powell and the Fed want to avoid a stagflationary scenario in which unemployment rises and inflation remains high.
Investors cheered the July CPI report, which came in slightly below consensus. However, the Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose 0.9% in July from the prior month, well above consensus and the highest increase experienced since 2022. That indicated to some that companies are absorbing higher costs from President Donald Trump's tariffs, which may eventually funnel down to the consumer.",3ea495902ce621dc57876bd46c76ba1b,trafilatura,2856,0

Strategy disclosed on Tuesday in its latest Form 8-K filing that the firm acquired 4,048 Bitcoin at an aggregate purchase price of $449.3 million, or an average of $110,981 per Bitcoin.
With this latest buy, Strategy now holds an eye-popping 636,505 Bitcoin. The aggregate purchase price for the company’s holdings stands at $46.95 billion, with an average cost basis of $73,765 per Bitcoin.
Expanding Holdings
These numbers show the firm’s long-standing conviction in Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Strategy has consistently funneled capital from equity raises into digital asset purchases, positioning itself as a bellwether for institutional adoption of cryptocurrency.
In addition to its SEC filings, Strategy maintains a public dashboard on its website. The platform provides real-time updates on Bitcoin acquisitions, securities market prices, and other key performance metrics.
Corporate Bitcoin Developer
By combining traditional capital market instruments with aggressive digital asset purchases, Strategy Inc. continues to blur the line between Wall Street and crypto. Its sustained accumulation shows not just corporate confidence in Bitcoin, but also its determination to define a new standard for treasury management in the digital age.
The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company continues to utilize its at-the-market (ATM) offerings to strengthen its capital base.
Between August 26 and September 1, the company sold shares across several preferred stock classes and its Class A common stock, generating net proceeds of $471.8 million. Among the offerings, the sale of 1.24 million shares of common stock brought in the largest contribution at $425.3 million.
Institutional Strategy and Market Impact
Strategy’s aggressive buying has made it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, but buying no longer moves the market. Corporate treasurer Shirish Jajodia recently said that BTC purchases are done through over-the-counter (OTC) deals, which minimize the price impact.
“Bitcoin’s daily trading volume is $50 billion,” Jajodia said. “Even if you buy $1 billion over a few days, it doesn’t move the market much.”
Institutional buying plays a different role in Bitcoin’s cycle. These holdings reduce long-term supply and indirectly strengthen the floor price. But short-term price moves are driven by traders, speculation, and broader macroeconomic forces.
Despite Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases, the company’s stock has been volatile. Strategy shares are trading at $334.41, up 11.47% year-to-date. The stock has a market cap of $96.02 billion, with a 52-week range between $113.69 and $543.00.

Handed down by Judge Amit Mehta in Washington on Tuesday, the ruling allows Google to retain its browser while prohibiting it from entering exclusive contracts for its product suite across Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, and its Gemini AI app.
“For years, Google accounted for approximately 90 percent of all search queries in the U.S., and Google used anticompetitive tactics to maintain and extend its monopolies in search and search advertising,” the U.S. Department of Justice wrote in a statement.
Google entered into “a series of exclusionary agreements” that “locked up” how ordinary users accessed and searched online, with the company requiring itself to be the “preset default general search engine on billions of mobile devices and computers,” the DOJ wrote.
The tech company used its stature to buy “preferential treatment” for its search engine and created a “self-reinforcing cycle of monopolization,” the department added.
Judge Mehta’s order specifically requires Google to share portions of its search index and user-interaction data with qualified competitors and to offer syndication of search and text ads, according to multiple reports, though a copy of the order has not surfaced at the time of writing.
Decrypt has reached out to Google for comment.
Google Gemini and Elon Musk's Grok Are Gaining on ChatGPT
Still in play
The case began in 2020 and was joined by nearly every U.S. state and territory. In 2024, the court ruled that Google unlawfully monopolized search in violation of the Sherman Act, which deters companies from monopolizing markets or conspiring to restrict competition.
The ruling comes as Google builds its own layer-1 blockchain and faces rising competition from AI-enabled browsers developed by companies such as Perplexity and OpenAI.
Analysts note that while the remedies impose new obligations, Google’s stature in the tech industry may prove more resilient to dislodgement.
While Google’s Chrome browser retains “its distribution advantage and ecosystem integration,” data sharing could “enable competitors to build better targeting features,” Ryan Yoon, senior analyst at Tiger Research, told Decrypt.
Still, Google’s “core moat” in search and vertical integration “remains intact” to an extent where “meaningful market share shifts seem unlikely,” Yoon added.
Google’s broader moves into crypto and AI suggest it is positioning for regulated, enterprise-focused infrastructure where “compliance matters more than decentralization,” while betting on “superior data integration” against its AI browser competitors, even if those “could erode their search monopoly,” Yoon said.",5b46d7c94ac297fa9802b6a5ed52378f,trafilatura,2847,0

Key Points
-
Nvidia expanded its primary product reach from a niche industry to common use.
-
Nvidia shareholders have had to hold through several gloomy periods.
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the top-performing stocks over the past decade. It transformed relatively small amounts into mini-fortunes, although investors have had to stomach a lot of large moves along the way.
There are numerous lessons that investors can learn from Nvidia's rise from a known computer equipment company to the world's largest business. Furthermore, there's still upside in the stock thanks to the massive artificial intelligence (AI) tailwind it currently enjoys. Nvidia is an excellent stock to study to help identify the next big thing, because if you can identify the next Nvidia, you'll be an incredibly successful investor.
Nvidia's climb has been a roller-coaster ride
A decade ago, Nvidia was just an $11 billion company. So its rise from that relatively small starting point to a $4 trillion behemoth is nothing short of impressive.
If you invested $10,000 in Nvidia a decade ago, that investment would now be worth around $3.2 million today.
That's an incredible run, but to achieve those returns, you'd have to stomach some hefty drops due to the business that Nvidia is in.
Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs). These devices were originally designed to process gaming workloads, although their use has expanded to areas such as drug discovery, engineering simulations, and cryptocurrency mining.
GPUs were the best general-purpose computing options available a decade ago to process arduous workloads, which should have been investors' first clue as to why Nvidia could be a massive growth machine. The company had a product that was specialized in one industry, but could easily be adapted to others. If you asked someone a decade ago if computing power needs would be greater in the future than they were then, the answer would have been an obvious ""yes.""
However, the rise wasn't all smooth. Nvidia's GPUs were widely deployed to take advantage of a booming cryptocurrency market in 2018 and 2021; however, when those markets crashed in the following years, it was a bad time to own Nvidia shares. The stock fell more than 50% on two occasions, which investors would have needed to hold through to capture all the gains.
However, if you held on through those tumultuous times, you would have been rewarded with an investment in a company at the center of the biggest computing need in human history: artificial intelligence. Computing demand for AI is unlike anything investors have ever seen, and with Nvidia's GPUs being the primary computing muscle behind this trend, its business benefited greatly.",ff5d6c01fd7e5d48a2b10c1c1b7eb616,trafilatura,2845,0

One major convenience retailer announced the departure of its top financial exec while another launched a search for its first chief information officer. Several companies also welcomed new vice presidents in a variety of departments.
Below are the major moves we covered in August. And, in case you missed it, here’s our executive roundup from July.
7-Eleven names new chief of staff, demand chain leader
7-Eleven named Dave Strachan as vice president and chief of staff to CEO Joseph DePinto and Joshua Dolan as senior vice president of demand chain.
Strachan, who also held the chief of staff role between 2016 and 2021, returned to the post after former chief of staff Kristen Cook resigned at the end of July. He first joined 7-Eleven in 2009 as a business consultant and went on to hold numerous positions over the next decade and a half. His most recent position was SVP of fresh foods, a role he resigned from in October 2024 to attend to family matters.
Dolan joins 7-Eleven from logistics giant GXO Logistics, where he was president of its consumer products division for the Americas and Asia Pacific for nearly two years. Prior to GXO, Dolan spent about four years as SVP of supply chain for healthcare company Cardinal Health. He has also worked in numerous director and VP-level supply chain and logistics roles with Dick’s Sporting Goods, Target and Amazon.
In his new position, Dolan is responsible for “expanding and optimizing 7-Eleven’s enterprise-wide logistics capabilities and improving execution,” according to his company bio.
Arko CFO, foodservice SVP both step down
Robert Giammatteo will step down as CFO of Arko Corp. on Oct. 10.
He joined Arko in January 2024, replacing Don Bassell, who retired after nearly 20 years. Before being named to that position, Giammatteo spent four years as executive vice president, CFO and chief transformation officer for GetGo Cafe + Market, the former c-store arm of grocer Giant Eagle and now a division of Alimentation Couche-Tard.
His career has also included finance roles with fashion retail companies Ascena Retail Group, VF Corporation and Limited Brands, as well as more than four years with General Motors’ OnStar.
Representatives from Arko have not shared succession plans for the role.
Arko also lost Richard Guidry, who left his role as senior vice president of food and beverage at c-store arm GPM Investments. Guidry headed the retailer’s food and beverage department while it developed Fas Craves, its proprietary foodservice program.

The report stressed that Europe needs to deliver credible reforms to support the euro's role as a global currency and that competing against the dollar would not be easy.
Here are the ING report's key findings:
WHAT THE REPORT SAYS
Although the euro's share of global FX reserves held steady in Q1 at around 20%, year-on-year trends are positive and smaller reserve managers are emerging as new sources of demand for the euro.
The euro's share of SWIFT international payments has stagnated so far this year but trade deals between the EU and countries such as India could see the currency used more in invoicing.
And there has been some notable bond sales in euros by emerging markets, while foreign investors are playing an important role in buying additional bonds released into the market by the ECB's pull-back from bond-buying programs.
WHY IT’S IMPORTANT
The dollar's role as the world's No.1 reserve currency has been called into question this year by heightened policy uncertainty under U.S. President Donald Trump.
With the deepest and most liquid capital markets globally, the dollar is unlikely to be replaced anytime soon.
However, there is debate about who could benefit as sentiment towards U.S. markets turns, and the euro is a key contender.
KEY QUOTE
""It will rest on European politicians to make the euro zone an attractive investment environment and for euro-denominated assets to earn their fair share of global capital.""
""Now is an exceptional opportunity, but Christine Lagarde and Mario Draghi still have some work to do to convince European governments to think more boldly,"" ING said.
CONTEXT
Lagarde said in May that there was an opening for a 'global euro moment,' and the currency could become a viable alternative if governments strengthen the bloc's financial and security architecture.
Mario Draghi, a former ECB chief and Italian prime minister, urged the EU in a 2024 report to forge a more coordinated industrial policy, make more rapid decisions and pursue massive investments to keep pace with the U.S. and China.
BY THE NUMBERS
Foreign investors bought around 186 billion euros worth of euro debt and roughly 46 billion euros of stocks between May and June, reinforcing support for the euro, ING said.
Around 22% of euro zone government bonds are foreign-held – well below the 34% share for U.S. Treasuries – but the rise from 19% since the start of quantitative tightening shows foreigners absorbing bond sales and helping to contain a rise in yields, it added.

Filed in a New York federal court, both sides agreed to drop the case with prejudice, meaning it is officially over and cannot be reopened. The details of the agreement are staying private, but the message is clear: both companies are ready to move on.
NFTs Were the Spark That Lit the Fuse
The fight started when StockX launched “Vault” NFTs tied to physical sneakers. These tokens showed Nike shoes, complete with logos, which Nike claimed could mislead customers into thinking there was some kind of partnership. There wasn’t.
That alone stirred enough legal tension, but Nike then added more fire by accusing StockX of selling fake shoes. The company said that some sneakers StockX authenticated as legit were actually counterfeit. In early 2025, a judge agreed that StockX was responsible in a few of those cases, and a full jury trial was supposed to happen in October. That trial is now off the table thanks to this new settlement.

A Clear Decision Instead of a Messy Trial
Rather than take this all the way through a public courtroom battle, both sides have chosen a cleaner path forward. This move avoids a long, public legal brawl and brings a bit of clarity to how brands want their trademarks treated in the world of NFTs. It also saves both companies time and probably a lot of money.
What This Tells Us About NFTs and Brand Boundaries
The entire case raised big questions about how NFTs work when they’re tied to physical goods. Are they just digital receipts, or do they represent something more? The court didn’t give a final ruling on that, but the pressure from this case showed that brands care a lot about how their logos and products appear in digital spaces. This settlement sends a message: tread carefully when blending real-world brands with blockchain tokens.

Platforms Will Likely Think Twice Going Forward
With this chapter closed, a new level of awareness has emerged for platforms creating NFTs tied to physical products. The rules are still forming, but this was a wake-up call. If you’re using someone else’s brand to add value to your digital asset, you need to be very clear about rights, partnerships, and how it’s all framed. Otherwise, you might find yourself in court for years.
Where Things Go from Here
Nike and StockX are both major names in their industries. Ending this fight without a verdict lets them both reset and focus on what’s next. For everyone else watching, especially in the NFT and streetwear scenes, this story becomes part of a growing playbook on what not to do when mixing blockchain and big brands. It’s a quiet ending, but one that will probably echo across the space for a while.",6087d73c14f5a2ce84896d6b68df2963,trafilatura,2813,0

The deal, structured as a stock purchase agreement, is expected to close in October.
“As part of its business strategy, Coincheck Group is actively exploring potential opportunities to make acquisitions and strategic investments both inside and outside of Japan,” the company said in a statement.
Coincheck declined to disclose the value to the deal, which the exchange told Decrypt was its first acquisition in Europe. “We continue to evaluate opportunities in Europe and globally and consider Aplo to be an initial step leading to additional transactions in the European Market in the near term,” a spokesperson said, adding that, “We believe there are meaningful synergies with Aplo’s capabilities and Coincheck’s platform and opportunities in Japan as well as opportunities that we are currently evaluating in Europe.”
Founded in 2014, Coincheck has grown into Japan’s most downloaded crypto trading app and listed its shares on the Nasdaq in 2024. The exchange, which suffered a $534 million hack in 2018, has since rebounded, reporting a 15% increase in customer assets in its most recent annual financial report to ¥859.2 billion ($5.7 billion), alongside a 44% jump in trading volume to ¥337.5 billion ($2.25 billion).
Crypto industry consolidation
Coincheck’s planned purchase is part of a wider spree of consolidation across the global digital asset industry as regulatory clarity and institutional adoption continue to rise.
Coinbase completed its $2.9 billion acquisition of derivatives exchange Deribit last month, as well as Liquifi in July. Over the last few months, Ripple also bought Galaxy-backed stablecoin issuer Rail for $200 million, and Citi-backed Talos struck a $100 million deal for analytics firm Coin Metrics.

That said, not every attempt has succeeded. Bitcoin miner Core Scientific’s biggest shareholder recently blocked a proposed $9 billion takeover by CoreWeave.
For Coincheck, acquiring Aplo is intended to accelerate the French firm’s product roadmap, broadening financing solutions such as cross-margining and deferred settlement, expanding liquidity access across jurisdictions and supporting banks interested in deploying Aplo’s platform for their own customers.
Aplo, founded in 2019, has built a trading application and infrastructure serving over 60 institutional clients. It is registered with France’s financial regulator AMF and is pursuing a full license under the European Union’s crypto framework, MiCA. All four founders will remain with the firm after the deal closes.",66fbc0930cb5a485b2f1c2f198dd5e8e,trafilatura,2808,0

Despite the evolving economic landscape which has significantly impacted the global chemical and textile manufacturing industries, Xu Yalin, DyStar Group’s managing director and president, said the company “remains committed to driving sustainability and innovation, advancing environmental responsibility, and optimizing our global manufacturing footprint.”

New Report: Decoupling Growth from Volume in Fashion's Waste Crisis
Part of this commitment is a target to lower the company’s environmental footprint by 30 percent per ton of products by 2025, using 2011 as the baseline year.
This target includes reduction in energy usage, water consumption, raw material utilization, GHG emissions, waste output, and wastewater generation across all DyStar-owned or operated facilities.
The company, which generated $751.59 million in revenue in 2024, successfully achieved its target levels for GHG emissions intensity, water consumption intensity and wastewater production intensity in 2024.
During the period, DyStar achieved a 44 percent reduction in emission intensity through several initiatives ranging from LED lighting upgrades and better equipment insulation to moving high-energy production to more energy-efficient units in other countries.
The company achieved a 58 percent reduction in water intensity, mainly driven by process optimization, increase of recovery of used water and advanced cleaning technologies.
Approximately 2 percent of the company’s total water consumption during the period was reused and steps are being put in place to undertake a water risk assessment in fiscal year 2025 at production sites with water consumption limits.
However, DyStar continues to be challenged by waste production, which increased 61 percent in 2024. The firm said recent operational shifts have led to variations in our metrics, particularly for waste intensity.
“While this is not reflective of our long-term goals, these changes have highlighted key areas for innovation and improvement to be designed and implemented,” DyStar stated.
In 2024, all new suppliers underwent EGS screening according to Dystar’s supply chain policy and all suppliers were accessed for environmental impacts. DyStar’s production plants consumed 70,760 tonnes of raw materials and intermediates in 2024. Renewable materials accounted for 14.47 percent of that consumption.",944717a765b52e0556a981312d22cc36,trafilatura,2808,0

U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday that 11 people were killed aboard the boat that had departed Venezuela, which is located near Trinidad and Tobago.
“I, along with most of the country, am happy that the U.S. naval deployment is having success in their mission,” Persad-Bissessar said in a statement late Tuesday. “The pain and suffering the cartels have inflicted on our nation is immense. I have no sympathy for traffickers; the U.S. military should kill them all violently.”
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that the drugs aboard the vessel were likely headed to Trinidad or elsewhere in the Caribbean.
Persad-Bissessar said that restricting illegal guns, drugs and human trafficking would decrease violence in the Caribbean region and the twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago, which has imposed two state of emergencies in recent months.
“Our country has been ravaged by bloody violence and addiction because of the greed of the cartels,” Persad-Bissessar said. “The slaughter of our people is fueled by evil cartel traffickers.”
US action under scrutiny
Other Caribbean leaders were more reserved in their remarks.
Barbadian Foreign Minister Kerrie Symmonds told The Associated Press on Wednesday that members of Caricom, a regional trade bloc, sent a letter to Rubio asking for an open line of communication on developments, saying they want to avoid being surprised by any U.S. moves against Venezuela.
“What we want really...is a structure where we would be able to have shared information affecting U.S. assets in the region, establishing channels of communication and, importantly where possible, some consultation to maintain practical cooperation for continued mutual confidence and avoidance of misunderstandings,"" he said.
Symmonds also said that depending on Rubio's response, both sides could arrange a face-to-face meeting to discuss fears that the region’s long-desired designation as a zone of peace is maintained.
“What effectively we are trying to do is to work through the diplomatic channels of making sure that there are no surprises,” Symmonds said.
On Wednesday, Rubio defended the strike and warned that such operations “will happen again.”
Meanwhile, Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday questioned the U.S. operation, saying that it's possible to conduct maritime interdiction of drug shipments without attacking a vessel's occupants. He said that Colombia typically captures them, since those transporting the drugs “are not the big drug traffickers,” but rather, “very poor young people” from the region.",d1c07819c1debe7a65be176fca516e2e,trafilatura,2805,0

Trump’s Cryptocurrency Wealth
Most of Trump’s cryptocurrency-related wealth is held by the publicly traded (Nasdaq: DJT) Trump Media and Technology Group. The company was recently valued at $2.3 billion, with a significant portion of its value tied to Bitcoin. Trump has also earned millions of dollars in cryptocurrency via other ventures, such as the meme coin $TRUMP and the decentralized entity World Liberty Financial.

Pros of Cryptocurrency Investing
There are a few reasons why Trump and other investors put a significant amount of money into cryptocurrency, including:
-
Huge growth potential: Currently priced at over $119,000, Bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed in the past five years, according to Coinbase.
-
Decentralization: You don’t have to deal with a third-party financial institution.
-
Trade availability: Unlike the stock market, cryptocurrency exchanges don’t close for nights, weekends or holidays.
Cons of Cryptocurrency Investing
On the other hand, there are a few reasons why some investors avoid putting their money into cryptocurrency, such as:
-
Extreme volatility: There have been several major drops in value within the last 15 or so years.
-
Security issues: While improvements have been made recently, people remember headlines about scams and account hacks from the not-too-distant past.
-
Little regulation: While Trump is pushing for the United States to become a global leader in cryptocurrency, the industry is still in its infancy and subject to few pieces of legislation.
-
Limited acceptance: While more companies are accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment, its adoption is not yet widespread.
Is Cryptocurrency Investing Right for You?
If you’re comfortable with the potential risks involved, you may want to consider investing in cryptocurrency. However, it’s probably wise to limit your cryptocurrency holdings to a small percentage of your portfolio. You may also want to diversify your cryptocurrency investments by purchasing different coins.
If you’re concerned with the security of cryptocurrency exchanges, you might want to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that include cryptocurrency. That way, you can gain exposure to the asset class with less potential risk.",2aef82a99d280f7f4e6a943eb7a42a3a,trafilatura,2798,0

Refinancing can look like an easy fix for overwhelming debt. You roll everything into one monthly payment, often at a lower interest rate than credit cards. But whether it’s the best move depends on your financial situation.
Take Ankit, a 45-year-old with a 20-year $200,000 mortgage at 3.5% interest, and $150,000 in additional debts from credit cards and a HELOC. He has about $250,000 in a 401(k), but feels stuck, and his retirement savings are stalled while debt payments eat up his budget. He’s considering refinancing his mortgage to wipe the slate clean, but will that actually help? Let’s break down the numbers.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP
How refinancing can restructure your debt
On paper, refinancing looks like a way to simplify Ankit’s situation. By rolling his $150,000 in credit card and HELOC debt into his $200,000 mortgage, he’d owe one monthly payment instead of juggling several.
While the benefits of refinancing may be attractive, it has downsides, too.
A refinance can cost between five and seven percent of the value of your home, as the process requires an application fee, an appraisal and a title search, just like with your original mortgage. According to Construction Coverage, only 16.3 out of 1,000 mortgages were refinanced in the U.S. per year.
For Ankit, the new mortgage would come with today’s rates, around 6.7%, compared with the 3.5% he currently pays.
That change is huge. His mortgage payment would jump from about $1,125 a month to about $2,400. Over time, he’d also end up paying much more interest on the entire $350,000 balance, not just the new debt.
Would it still be cheaper? In some ways, yes:
Credit cards often carry interest rates of 20% or higher, and even a HELOC could charge 8% to 10% in today’s market. Refinancing at 6.7% would lower those interest costs.
But the price of that lower rate on the consumer debt is giving up the 3.5% mortgage and paying almost double or triple his current housing cost every month.
In other words, refinancing would save him interest compared with keeping high-rate credit card balances, but it would also strain his cash flow and make his home far more expensive to carry. For someone already struggling to pay down debt, that’s a risky tradeoff.",31dcbb92d23bd88e2483f6637d3585f6,trafilatura,2792,0

By Doyinsola Oladipo
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Frontier Airlines is seeking to lure premium flyers of other airlines, who may feel dissatisfied with their current loyalty perks, by offering new travel incentives, according to a top executive of the ultra-low-cost carrier.
Frontier is betting that limited-time offers like companion travel certificates and instant elite gold status for $69 will attract frequent flyers and gold- and silver-status flyers of competitors' airlines to its loyalty program.
U.S. carriers have been looking to differentiate themselves among premium travelers as strong demand from higher-income Americans in 2025 has helped airlines offset a pullback in spending by price-sensitive customers.
The company is rolling out the new perks at a time when value is top-of-mind for travelers as some have grown weary of changes to longstanding services and loyalty programs such as Southwest Airlines' move to end its free-baggage policy.
""There's a lot of product services and loyalty programs that people are disenfranchised with right now,"" Bobby Schroeter, Frontier's chief commercial officer, told Reuters.
The company said on Tuesday it will offer flyers an all-you-can-fly annual pass for about $300, slashing the price in half. Shares of the carrier rose 14% on Tuesday after the announcement, underscoring investor bets that Spirit's second bankruptcy filing could reshape the U.S. budget airline landscape and give Frontier a competitive edge.
""We looked at it and said we should be providing more value in our programs that will translate to better experiences for our customers and actually more opportunity on our side as well, financially.""
Frontier plans to double its loyalty revenue to $6 per passenger by the end of 2026 and $10 by the end of 2028. The company believes an opportunity exists to take share from other carriers like legacy carrier programs that earn $30 to $40 per passenger, Schroeter added.
In late August, the company said that for a limited time it will offer its credit card holders companion passes starting at $3,000 in everyday spending and will match up to 1 million combined miles from multiple airlines.
“We are going to get customers that are coming in that may not have otherwise come in before because they see the value,” Schroeter said, adding the company anticipates the average income level of its customer base rising as a result.
The Denver-based carrier also said it will offer travelers who are members of Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Spirit Airlines or Alaska Airlines' loyalty programs instant Elite Gold Status with Frontier for $69 until December 2026, which includes a free carry-on bag, priority boarding and complementary upgrades to premium seating.",27ff9d66851e1c2f5d4f3e404efece3b,trafilatura,2791,0

It highlighted the necessity for asset managers and owners to employ a comprehensive approach in their reporting practices, focusing on the actions taken and the results achieved.
In its response, ACCA has called for the FRC to provide more detailed guidance in several key areas. This includes the need for specific examples that reflect the changing business landscape, particularly regarding new employment practices.
Furthermore, the ACCA encourages signatories to clarify how they incorporate environmental and societal factors into their investment strategies and engagement efforts.
ACCA noted that such transparency would assist asset managers and owners in grasping the long-term sustainable value for their clients and beneficiaries, thereby fostering greater trust and accountability in the industry.
ACCA Policy and Insights director Mike Suffield said: “We strongly support the draft guideline’s focus on demonstrating the actual outcome of stewardship activities.
“That is why we support the creation of tailored guidance to help signatories to the Code to disclose and explain how effective they are in achieving investment goals.”
While the updated definition of stewardship underscores the creation of long-term sustainable value, ACCA has urged the FRC to place additional focus on the broader environmental and societal challenges that are currently prevalent.
Additionally, ACCA has identified fraud as a significant area requiring attention within the code, especially in light of the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act’s “failure to prevent” offence, set to take effect on 1 September 2025.
ACCA Risk Management and Corporate Governance head Rachael Johnson said: “We encourage the FRC to address the role of stewardship concerning fraud risk oversight and prevention, given today's accelerating threats and their devastating effects on the economy and society at large.
“Board members and investors have crucial roles to play in identifying cultural, governance, and control weaknesses that enable the systemic nature of fraud.”

The addition of these firms will bring an excess of $214bn in client assets under Corient's management and extend its operational footprint into Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
The combined group will manage around $430bn in client’s assets for ultra-high-net-worth wealth families and institutions.
The deals, which are being funded through equity contributions, are slated for completion in the first half of 2026.
Corient's model, which includes ownership and operation by more than 260 Partners, will now be applied to the newly acquired international entities.
Stonehage Fleming, with assets exceeding $175bn and a presence in 13 jurisdictions, provides specialised services such as cross-border structuring, wealth and investment management and succession planning.
Stanhope Capital, established by Daniel Pinto in 2004, manages nearly $40bn in assets and offers a suite of services including wealth management and merchant banking.
Included in the deal is Stanhope Capital's subsidiary, FWM Holdings, which operates FFT Wealth Management, a firm servicing UHNW families both in the US and internationally.
Post-acquisition, the combined entity will continue operations globally under the Corient brand.
Giuseppe Ciucci of Stonehage Fleming will take on the role of partner and chairman, while Stanhope Capital's Daniel Pinto will become partner and CEO of Corient's international business.
Stuart Parkinson, CEO of Stonehage Fleming, will assume the position of partner and president of the international division.
These leaders, along with their executive teams, will join the global Board of Directors at Corient and become equity stakeholders.
Corient CEO and partner Kurt MacAlpine said: “With this expansion, Corient becomes the world’s largest independent advisory firm focused on the holistic needs of ultra-high-net-worth and high-net-worth clients. This combination of three storied firms creates a truly global wealth manager and multi-family office with formidable resources and deep expertise in serving the world’s wealthiest individuals and families.""
MacAlpine added: “By integrating the strengths of each organisation, Corient will be able to deliver seamless, end-to-end service to clients anywhere in the world – in a way that doesn’t exist today.
“Furthermore, our advantage extends beyond capabilities to how we deliver them. Under our international partnership, which will consist of more than 300 firm owners aligned under one vision, we’re building a new type of wealth management firm, one that is global, collaborative and evolving to meet the dynamic needs of sophisticated clients.”",63b1e747ae6ea0e8acf57d9102b66394,trafilatura,2748,0

Are advisors ready?
Generative AI, which creates content by finding patterns in existing data, has been making headlines in the RIA world for its ability to transcribe client meetings, summarize emails and even give financial advice. But one area where it may cause the most disruption in the near future is marketing. AI marketing companies for financial advisors have sprung up left and right, from FINNY AI — which automates the work of reaching out to new clients — to Catchlight, which gathers data on promising prospects and advises on next steps. Experts say the influx is only going to accelerate.
“Expect more, especially because it’s getting harder to point out where AI starts and stops when it comes to its place in the modern workflow,” said Angel Gonzalez, chief marketing officer at Snappy Kraken. “It’s touching everything.”

Sloppy (AI) Joe
The latest AI marketing product to join the fray comes from the software platform Advisor CRM. Its new tools scrape the internet for an advisor’s data before drafting emails, social media posts and other materials in their personal communication style. Advisor CRM partner Leibel Sternbach estimates that roughly four in five advisors are still familiarizing themselves with AI generally and aren’t yet sure how to use it in their daily lives — something he thinks AI-driven marketing can change. “How does the advisor communicate? What is their tone? What are the types of things that they like to talk about? What are the things they downplay?” he said. “All of that goes into your marketing.”
Questions aside, advisors are drinking the AI juice. According to a recent Advisor360° survey:
-
In 2025, 85% of advisors called generative AI a help to their practice, up from 64% in 2024.
-
Three out of four advisors surveyed said they’ve enjoyed “immediate benefits” from using generative AI.
Not all AI companies are created equal, however. Used correctly, AI tools can ease advisors’ workloads by reducing the time and effort required to recruit new clients and keep existing ones. But without careful management and tool selection, AI can damage their image with sloppy craftsmanship that makes the sender appear out of touch, uninterested or even incompetent. Gonzalez warns of “slop” — generic AI output that risks alienating clients. Winning products, he said, will deliver tangible business outcomes: “What good is simply having content written that sounds like you if it’s not integrated with your [customer relationship management software], or connected with your marketing tools in ways that save time?”",f3ba6c5b0215919e309923f52d3d6f50,trafilatura,2742,0

A promising new term —“mature blockchain” — has entered the regulatory discourse via the CLARITY Act, a bipartisan legislative proposal aimed at providing much-needed regulatory certainty around digital assets in the U.S. Among other things, it defines a “mature blockchain” as one that is sufficiently decentralized and not reliant on any single person or entity to operate.
This makes decentralization a critical legal distinction, and may also determine whether an asset on a given network should be treated as a security.
However, fitting the definition of decentralized doesn’t mean a blockchain is ready for global scale or real-world adoption. To bring blockchain technology into mainstream, real-world use, maturity must mean more than just decentralization: it must also mean operational readiness, i.e. the ability of a network to deliver performance, reliability, and scalability under these conditions. Decentralization is and must remain a foundational pillar of blockchain. It ensures resilience, neutrality, and censorship resistance. But decentralization alone is not enough. A blockchain that is highly decentralized but cannot reliably scale, or routinely suffers downtime, or finalizes transactions only after minutes of uncertainty, will struggle to support the kinds of applications (payments, identity verification, tokenized assets) that the world is ready for.
Some blockchains today, like Ethereum and Cardano, are still working through what could be called growing pains. Their engineering teams are focused on solving base-layer challenges: scaling past double-digit transactions per second, reducing finality times from minutes to seconds, stabilizing consensus mechanisms, or addressing uptime reliability. These challenges are real, and the work is important. But they also signal that the network is still in its developmental phase, not yet ready to support high-stakes, production-grade use.
By contrast, a handful of blockchains, like Solana and Algorand, have already moved past these foundational hurdles. They’ve demonstrated the ability to deliver high throughput, low latency, sub-three-second finality, and virtually zero downtime. These networks aren’t scrambling to stabilize. They’re focused on simplifying the user experience, onboarding non-Web3 developers, integrating with decentralized identity frameworks, and supporting regulated use cases like payments, tokenization, and even AI-agent transactions.
This shift (from survival to usability) is the true marker of a mature blockchain. It’s what signals readiness not just to regulators, but to developers, enterprises, and end users.",bd825f81888703412f26e850eb41a59b,trafilatura,2715,0

Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey told a caller on his Sunday show that living in a mobile home may offer temporary relief after hardship, but it is no path to long-term financial stability.
Divorced Father Shares Mobile Home Struggles And Financial Progress
The caller, a 35-year-old divorced father earning $86,000 a year, explained that he lives with his children in a mobile home gifted by his parents and placed on land owned by his aunt.
He admitted feeling ashamed of the arrangement despite having no housing payments.
Ramsey acknowledged the caller's struggles, saying, ""Hey, you've been through hell and you needed a soft spot to land on. That doesn't mean we want to stay there.""

The father shared that he had maxed out his 401(k) and Roth IRA, saved $22,000, and carried only one debt a $15,000 truck loan.
Ramsey told him to pay off the truck immediately, build an emergency fund, and temporarily pause retirement contributions in order to save for a down payment on a house.
""There is nothing snobbish about telling you not to do mobile homes,"" Ramsey said. ""A mobile home is like a car you sleep in. It goes down in value. Buy something that goes up in value.""
Ramsey's Advice Spanned Divorce Settlements, Student Loans And Business Leadership
In May, Ramsey cautioned divorcing men against signing away home ownership through a quitclaim deed without addressing the mortgage.
He said many attorneys overlooked the risk of leaving the husband legally tied to debt despite no longer owning the property. ""Most divorce attorneys make a huge legal error. I'm calling you boys and girls out,"" Ramsey said.

Cole will now oversee divisions including poultry, beef and pork along with prepared foods and the meat giant's international operations.
The appointment was announced yesterday (2 September) alongside the departure of Brady Stewart, Tyson Foods' chief supply chain officer.
Stewart has left the company for “certain actions” that the company said “violated the Tyson Foods code of conduct”.
In February, Tyson Foods had promoted Cole and Stewart to new positions within the company.
Cole took on the role of group president of poultry, succeeding Wes Morris.
Stewart, meanwhile, had his responsibilities expanded to include the oversight of the prepared foods segment, in addition to his role as group president of beef, pork, and chief supply chain officer.
Following Stewart's departure, Cole will continue to report directly to Donnie King, Tyson Foods president and CEO.
Furthermore, the supply chain, food safety, health and safety, as well as environmental, and transport functions will now report directly to King.
It marks the first time since 2021 that Tyson Foods has had a COO, with King having moved from the COO position to the CEO role back then.
Commenting on the changes, King said: “We have strong momentum as we head into our new fiscal year, and we remain committed to executing our long-term strategy and operating the company guided by our culture and core values. I am confident that under Devin’s leadership our business will continue to thrive.”
Tyson Foods stated it will provide further updates on its leadership and organisational changes before the start of its 2026 fiscal year on 28 September.
Last June, John R. Tyson, the company's former CFO, left the business after being suspended for a driving while intoxicated offence.
Tyson, who initially pleaded not guilty, later admitted to the charge. Despite this, Tyson was appointed as a director of the company in May.
In its financial results for the third quarter ending 28 June, Tyson Foods reported sales of $13.88bn, reflecting a 4% increase compared to the same period the previous year.
However, operating income declined 23.8% to $260m, influenced by a goodwill impairment charge of $343m. Consequently, net income dropped sharply by 64.8% to $69m from $196m in the same quarter the previous year.
For the first nine months of 2025, Tyson Foods' total sales reached $40.58bn, marking a 2.1% increase from the same period in 2024. Operating income rose by 6.3% to $940m and the net income saw a decrease of 2% to $449m.",1747bc08b8617c44eb0485a0859d77da,trafilatura,2693,0

In a statement issued just after 19:00 CET today (1 September), the world’s largest food group said Freixe had left the business with immediate effect.
Freixe, a company veteran who had worked at Nestlé for almost 40 years, was named CEO in August last year, taking the helm the following month.
The KitKat and Maggi maker said the relationship breached its “code of business conduct”.
Chairman Paul Bulcke said: “This was a necessary decision. Nestlé's values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestlé.”
The Swiss giant has appointed Philipp Navratil, the CEO of Nestlé’s coffee business Nespresso, as its new chief executive.
Navratil has worked at Nestlé since 2001, holding roles in Central America before becoming the SVP of the company’s coffee strategic business unit in 2020.
Bulcke, who Nestlé announced in June is set to step down as chairman next year, said: “Philipp is recognised for his impressive track record of achieving results in challenging environments. Renowned for his dynamic presence, he inspires teams and leads with a collaborative, inclusive management style. The board is confident that he will drive our growth plans forward and accelerate efficiency efforts. We are not changing course on strategy and we will not lose pace on performance.”
Navratil added: “I fully embrace the company's strategic direction, as well as the action plan in place to drive Nestlé's performance. I look forward to working closely with the entire leadership of the company, in alignment with the board, chairman Paul Bulcke and chairman-designate Pablo Isla, to accelerate execution and to drive the value creation plan with intensity.”
Nestlé announced in June Bulcke would not stand for re-election as chairman at the company’s next AGM in April.
Bulcke has worked for the group for more than 40 years, including nine as CEO up to 2016 before he was succeeded by Mark Schneider.
Freixe replaced Schneider a year ago.

-
The company is susceptible to the matter for two reasons.
-
There's no guarantee of a production hike, let alone of its leading to a lower oil price.
Shares in APA Corporation (NASDAQ: APA) were lower by 4.2% at 11 a.m. ET today. The decline comes after news reports that a group of eight OPEC+ members will meet on Sunday and will consider raising oil production. These countries, which include energy giants Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, and Kuwait are reportedly looking at raising oil production on top of the increases started in April.
While it may seem counterproductive for OPEC+ to raise production, thereby hurting prices, it makes sense given that lower-cost OPEC+ producers want to regain market share from higher-cost producers.
What it means to APA Corporation
Two things make APA sensitive to an OPEC+ production increase. First, it's a focused exploration and production company. It doesn't have the downstream operations of a company like Chevron, which can better manage a period of lower oil prices. Second, its exposure to higher-cost producing assets in the US -- 62% of production was from the US in 2024 -- means it's less able to cope with lower oil prices.
On the last earnings call, APA President Stephen Riney discussed the company's breakeven oil price (the price a developer needs to cover costs and obligations), saying, ""In the Permian, we are running on average in the low 40s across the entire Permian in terms of a WTI breakeven oil price. In Midland Basin, we're running in the high 30s. And in the Delaware Basin, we're in the low 50s.""
With the price of oil currently below $64 a barrel, investors are concerned about a potential decline that could hurt APA's prospects. Still, at this point, there's no guarantee that OPEC+ will raise production, and if it does, there's no guarantee the price of oil will decline.

The move will increase DJH's turnover to £61.5m ($82.4m), with the firm's revenues in the North West expected to reach more than £24m.
The transition of the acquired offices to the DJH brand will consolidate the company's presence in the region, complementing its existing offices in Altrincham, Bury, Chester, Manchester, and Nantwich.
The current leadership teams at the acquired offices will remain in place.
Liverpool's operations will continue under the guidance of Mike Forshaw and Tim Cherry, while Stuart Penny and Vikki Wynne will manage the Wirral office.
Steve Greensill will retain his directorial position in Chester city, with Joe Walters joining as a newly promoted director.
Director of Haines Watts’ Liverpool team Mike Forshaw said: “Following significant changes within the Haines Watts network, joining DJH was an obvious strategic decision.
“We were looking for a platform that shares our values and can provide the stability and enhanced resources that will support our valued clients now and in the future.
“DJH's strong regional presence and comprehensive support infrastructure makes it the perfect partner for our continued growth.”
The acquisition will allow DJH to extend a range of specialised services to its new client base, including estate planning, capital allowances, R&D tax credits, corporate finance, and HR consultancy, among others.
DJH CEO Scott Heath stated: “This acquisition aligns perfectly with our strategy of expanding our presence in key regional markets through partnerships with high-quality, client-focused practices.
“The Chester city, Liverpool and Wirral teams bring excellent local market knowledge and strong client relationships that complement our existing North West operations beautifully.”

More than half of U.S. adults have been living paycheck to paycheck for over a year — and don’t hold out much hope for financial improvement in the future, according to a new report from Ramsey Solutions.
The report, entitled The State of Personal Finance in America (Q2 2025), reveals that while fewer households are struggling to pay bills (with 43% finding it tough, the lowest percentage in two years), the majority are experiencing paycheck-to-paycheck anxiety.

Dave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP
A full 52% of the 1,017 U.S. adults who responded to the study report being stuck in survival mode, burdened by high costs, stagnant wages and mounting distrust in government economic policy. Sadly, this figure has barely budged in more than a year.
Paycheck-to-paycheck fatigue
The situation is definitely more dire for some. One in three adults (33%) described themselves as “struggling” or “in crisis” financially.
Generationally, Gen Z appears to be under the most pressure, with 55% struggling to pay bills and 53% having trouble making rent.
Overall, just 25% of U.S. adults surveyed considered themselves better off financially than they were a year ago.

This persistent gloom isn’t unique to Ramsey’s findings. A Gallup reports a record-high 53% of Americans believe their finances are deteriorating.
A recent Pew Research Center survey shows that roughly 28% of U.S. adults expect their financial situation to get worse within a year — up from just 16% in 2024.
Likewise, a mid‑2025 TransUnion survey found that 27% of U.S. consumers are pessimistic about their household finances over the next 12 months.
Here are some of the factors contributing to Americans’ financial anxiety.
Tariffs, Inflation and a Confidence Gap
Policy uncertainty is weighing on Americans’ wallets and their outlook. The Ramsey report shows that 66% of U.S. adults believe tariffs are hurting their finances, with many blaming rising consumer costs on ongoing trade disputes.
Support for tariffs dropped to 40%, down five points from the previous quarter.",27f734aca2b9627e1a562f8755395495,trafilatura,2679,0

(NASDAQ:TGTX) shares advanced Wednesday after the biopharmaceutical company announced the completion of a $100 million share repurchase program and unveiled plans for an additional $100 million buyback authorization.
Trading volume reached 1.78 million shares, compared with an average of 2.06 million, according to Benzinga Pro.
The company said it repurchased roughly 3.5 million shares under the initial program, paying an average price of $28.55 per share.

Building on that move, the Board of Directors approved a new authorization that will allow the repurchase of another $100 million in common stock.
The announcement comes as the company continues to emphasize the commercial opportunity of Briumvi, its multiple sclerosis therapy, which management has positioned as a key growth driver.
Michael S. Weiss, Chairman and CEO of TG Therapeutics, stated, “In the month of August, we were able to repurchase approximately $78 million of TG stock at what we believe were highly attractive prices.”
“In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized a new $100 million repurchase program, underscoring our continued commitment to delivering value to shareholders and reflecting our conviction that current market prices do not adequately reflect the multibillion-dollar potential of Briumvi or the long-term growth prospects of TG Therapeutics,” he added.
TGTX Stock Prediction For 2025
Equity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for the share price trajectory.
Some investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at TG Therapeutics, an investor could make an assessment about a stock’s long-term prospects using a moving average and trend line.
If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line.
For TG Therapeutics, the 200-day moving average sits at $34.39, according to Benzinga Pro, which is above the current price of $31.29. For more information on charts and trend lines, see the description here.
Traders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.",687dc70c63c711f4b1714eb5d96b4188,trafilatura,2667,0

-
Opendoor's business of buying and selling homes is proving highly unprofitable.
-
Airbnb can keep growing revenue and expand its margin as it grows around the globe.
-
Lululemon should see a comeback as it steadily takes market share in apparel and athleisure.
Investors are falling in love with Opendoor Technologies (NASDAQ: OPEN). But should they be? The stock has soared 500% in the last three months even though the business has extremely low gross margins and has never generated a profit while taking on a lot of debt to grow. A poorly thought out business model is going to hold back the iBuying business, regardless of how vocal shareholders are.
Instead of buying Opendoor stock, investors should look for businesses that are already profitable and have a history of revenue growth. Here's why Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) are two better buys for your portfolio than Opendoor today.
Airbnb's steady growth and profits
As one of the largest travel platforms in the world, Airbnb has turned its disruptive home-sharing lodging innovation into a mainstream phenomenon. The concept has become prevalent in English-speaking markets as well as France, which drive the majority of bookings for Airbnb.
Now, over the next few years, the company wants to make Airbnb travel more prevalent in other popular vacation destinations such as Japan or Brazil. Last quarter, nights booked in both these regions grew around 15%-20% (management did not give out precise figures), which outpaced overall bookings growth.
Global expansion can help Airbnb's revenue steadily grow in the coming years. Last quarter, revenue was up 13% to $3.1 billion, with a net income of $642 million for a 21% profit margin. Airbnb is reinvesting much of its core profits to expand globally but also add on new features to the service such as Experiences and Services. These are new product categories that can help drive more spending from tourists on the Airbnb platform.
While these products have long-term potential, Airbnb's profit margin may be compressed in the interim as it invests to build all the digital infrastructure to manage them, as well as market them.
Airbnb has strong unit economics that should allow its net income margin to expand much higher over the next decade although it is already a profitable business (unlike Opendoor Technologies). Today, Airbnb's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is 31, which looks expensive on its face. However, through steady revenue growth and profit margin expansion, this P/E ratio can come down quickly over the next five to 10 years. This makes Airbnb stock an easy buy-and-hold today.",9fcaf24bc90d3a6a793e24d760b2156e,trafilatura,2666,0

The updated proposal from Italy's BMPS now includes a cash payment of €0.90 per share, complementing the previously declared share exchange offer.
Citing a source familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that the Mediobanca board is scheduled to convene tomorrow (4 September), to consider the improved proposal.
Mediobanca has consistently opposed the MPS takeover bid, labelling the price as “totally inadequate”.
The cash component in the revised offer represents a financial commitment of approximately €750m ($873.6m) from BMPS.
This adjustment to the offer was approved by the BMPS board, under the leadership of Chairman Nicola Maione, with the aim of enhancing the appeal of the bid.
In a statement, BMPS said: “The board of directors firmly believes that the increase in the consideration represents a further and concrete evidence of the industrial value of the transaction and the offeror’s attention on the market, with the aim of maximising acceptance of the Offer and accelerating the value creation.
“The board of directors also confirmed BMPS’s unchanged financial objectives, aimed at maintaining a solid capital position and one of the highest dividend policies in the sector, in the belief that all stakeholders will appreciate BMPS’ commitment and its expected results.”
The total compensation for each Mediobanca share now comprises 2.533 newly issued BMPS shares, along with the €0.90 cash addition.
BMPS has also removed the prior requirement for acquiring at least 66.7% of Mediobanca's voting shares but has upheld a minimum acceptance threshold of 35%, below which the offer will not be pursued.
The offer evaluates Mediobanca shares at €16.334 each, reflecting an 11.4% premium compared to the share price as of 23 January 2025.
BMPS said the valuation includes the cash incentive and is calculated based on its share price of €6.093 on the specified reference date.
The deadline for accepting the offer is set for 8 September 2025.
A Milan-based trader informed the publication that the revised bid was anticipated, and the market assumes the success of the deal as a given.
In a recent development, Mediobanca's shareholders rejected the bank's proposed €6.3bn acquisition of Banca Generali, which was a setback in its efforts to fend off the hostile takeover by the state-supported BMPS.

The move further strengthens Clyde & Co’s presence in Europe.
SLA represents domestic and international insurance companies and their insureds, specialising in advisory services, coverage disputes, directors and officers (D&O) liability, fire and building damage, personal injury, policy drafting and professional liability.
The company also has experience in Dutch civil court litigation, arbitration and disciplinary tribunals.
The leadership team at the new Rotterdam office will include Wence Rupert, Peter Knijp and Frits van der Woude. They will be supported by four senior lawyers, ten additional lawyers, and six support staff from SLA.
Rupert, who joined Stadermann in 2003, is known for his specialisation in liability and insurance law, while Knijp has expertise in liability, insurance and personal injury law.
Van der Woude, who joins from Kennedy Van der Laan, has 20 years of experience in insurance and liability law.
Clyde & Co CEO Matthew Kelsall said: ""Rotterdam's strategic location, its role as a major trading and logistics hub and the historic base of operation of both national and international insurance companies and even the (former) insurance bourse make it an ideal base for us to serve our clients in the region.
“We are excited to bring our expertise to the Netherlands and look forward to building strong relationships with our clients here.""
The law firm's European presence has steadily expanded since the opening of its first office in Paris in 1992. Currently, it has nine offices and nearly 200 lawyers across multiple countries.
This expansion is part of Clyde & Co's broader strategy to enhance its global footprint, with recent office openings in Accra, Boston, Cairo, Chile, Colombia, Dallas, Kumasi, Milan and Warsaw.
Earlier this year, the firm merged with Tillman Batchelor in Dallas, reinforcing its North American insurance practice.

Beijing-based Meituan, the long-standing leader of China's food delivery market, on Monday released and open-sourced its own LLM, called LongCat-Flash-Chat, via artificial intelligence developer platforms Hugging Face and GitHub, as well as the model's official website.
According to the model's technical report, LongCat-Flash-Chat features 560 billion total parameters - the variables used to define and manipulate the input and output of models - and the so-called Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. MoE architecture divides the model into separate sub-networks, or ""experts"", that specialise in a subset of the input data to jointly perform a task.

In technical benchmark comparisons cited in the report, LongCat-Flash-Chat was shown to be on par with the performance of DeepSeek's V3.1, Alibaba Cloud's Qwen3 family and Moonshot AI's Kimi K2, as well as US models like Anthropic's Claude Sonnet and Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash. Alibaba Cloud is the AI and cloud computing unit of Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post.
Meituan's foray into open-source models reflects its efforts to establish a viable AI business since acquiring Light Year, which was established by a co-founder of the food delivery services giant.
It also showed how Chinese AI companies are continuing to narrow the gap with their US peers through the open-source approach, which makes the source code of AI models available for third-party developers to use, modify and distribute.

Over the years, Eubanks has led regional operations nationwide, integrated major acquisitions and helped scale a complex property management platform, according to the release. She has expanded services, strengthened operational consistency and helped position the business for long-term growth.
“Our success starts at the site level, and my focus will be making sure our teams have what they need to deliver for residents every day,” Eubanks said in the news release.
Clow will work closely with Faith to grow Greystar’s U.S. property management business, whether through organic growth or merger and acquisition activities. He will also continue to drive revenue growth for the organization with a focus on Greystar’s client portfolio.
“This is about leaning into both of their strengths,” a Greystar spokesperson told Multifamily Dive in an email. “Toni is stepping into a well-earned U.S. leadership role, and Mike continues to be a major force shaping the business here and abroad.”
Livingstone, who joined Greystar in 1999, has been an architect of Greystar’s property management platform. The firm, which is the U.S.’s largest owner and operator of apartments, manages more than 1 million units and beds globally.
In his new capacity as senior advisor, Livingstone will focus on long-term strategic initiatives and innovation-driven projects to support the firm’s global growth.",ffce1d4232feb0b36672724f810895a8,trafilatura,2646,0

A U.S. federal judge ruled that Google will not have to divest Chrome.
-
The judge also said that Google can continue to pay Apple to make Chrome its default browser on many of its devices.
-
However, Google can no longer do exclusive contracts and will need to provide more data to the public.
Both Class A and C shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) popped about 8.4%, as of 10:48 a.m. ET today, after a federal judge ruled that the conglomerate will not have to divest its massive Chrome search business.
A big win for big tech
In 2023, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a landmark lawsuit against Google for monopolistic practices in the search engine space, specifically related to its digital advertising practices. Last year, a federal judge sided with the DOJ and found that Google had run an illegal monopoly. The DOJ then requested that a judge require Google to divest its Chrome browser, a big driver of the company's search business that makes up more than half of the company's total revenue.
While many believed this was unlikely to happen, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta made it official yesterday, ruling that Google will not have to divest Chrome. Furthermore, Google can keep paying large partners like Apple to feature it as the default search engine on web browsers like Safari. However, Mehta also ruled that Google cannot propose exclusive contracts that prevent competitors from being able to fairly compete in the space. Google will also have to share some data that will supposedly help competitors get on more of an even playing field.
""This is a monster win for Cupertino and for Google its a home run ruling that removes a huge overhang on the stock,"" Wedbush's Global Head of Tech Research Dan Ives in a recent research note, according to CNBC.
A catalyst for the cheapest Mag Seven name
This year, Alphabet has traded at the cheapest valuation in the ""Magnificent Seven,"" largely due to the DOJ's lawsuit and other issues with the search business including how artificial intelligence chatbots might disrupt the business.
But within the massive tech conglomerate are several incredibly fast-growing and strong businesses like Waymo, YouTube, Google Cloud, and even a chip business. Even after the nice move today, investors can still buy the stock.

The ruling, by District of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta, means Google will still pay Apple an estimated $20 billion per year for making Google the default search option in its Safari browser and across its Siri and other services.
Apple's stock price rose more than 2.5% in early trading Wednesday to around $236 a share.
As part of the ruling, Google will be limited to one-year agreements, allowing Apple to potentially renegotiate the terms of its revenue-sharing deals. Google also can't force companies to keep competing apps and services off their devices, though Apple already provides access to Google Gemini rival ChatGPT via its Apple Intelligence platform.
Google previously stated it would appeal Mehta's initial ruling that found the company operated as an illegal monopolist. Either way, though, Apple is back on solid footing after years of uncertainty surrounding its Google deal.
Cash from the agreement is accounted for as part of Apple's Services business. In 2024, Apple's Services segment brought in $96.2 billion. At $20 billion per year, Google's revenue-sharing agreement made up some 20.8% of Services revenue.
It's important to note that the $20 billion figure is an estimate for 2022 found in the antitrust court documents and could be higher for subsequent years.
BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in an investor note Tuesday that the ruling is a win for Apple and raised the firm's price target on the iPhone maker's stock from $250 to $260.
""While details and nuances of the ruling and their implication on Apple are still to be determined, and Google has the option of appealing this decision, in our opinion, we do not see an immediate material change to the current Apple-Google relationship and payment structure,"" Mohan added.
Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring noted in his own research note that Mehta's ruling could even benefit Apple in the long run and should end prior industry suggestions that the company needed to buy a generative AI search engine.
""Google's payments to Apple can continue (with conditions), Apple can now renegotiate default payment rates annually to try and better monetize search across all traditional, and new AI-powered, search partners, and Apple has the choice — but not the requirement — to introduce a choice screen and collect new fees from search partners, if they so choose,"" Woodring wrote.",310bcb52e6a49d4150a80bd50e3283a0,trafilatura,2643,0

The bridge loan from Taurus will fund critical early works and infrastructure for the project.
This follows the release of positive feasibility study results, accelerating the project finance process.
Lifezone Metals CEO Chris Showalter announced that the company’s fully owned subsidiary, Kabanga Nickel, finalised the bridge loan with Taurus Mining Finance Fund No. 2.
The initial $20m tranche was disbursed on 29 August 2025, with future funds contingent on achieving certain project milestones.
This follows an announcement in August regarding Lifezone Metals securing the bridge loan facility.
The loan incurs a yearly interest charge of 9.25% on the amounts utilised, repayable every three months, and includes both arrangement and commitment charges.
Lifezone Metals took ownership of the Kabanga Nickel Project in the north-western region of Tanzania in 2021.
The Kabanga project is set to be an integrated operation comprising mining to metal production. It will supply global markets with high-purity nickel, copper and cobalt suitable for battery manufacturing.
Lifezone Metals is actively pursuing multi-source financing, led by Société Générale's debt team, for the Kabanga Nickel Project.
The company is in advanced talks with potential partners and investors to secure long-term financial support for the project's progression.
Additionally, the company has received several non-binding offers for potential transactions involving the Kabanga Nickel Project.
Standard Chartered Bank, acting as a financial advisor, is assisting Lifezone Metals in evaluating these strategic alternatives and offers.
While Lifezone Metals has not yet finalised any agreements, the strategic investment process is ongoing.
There is no certainty that these discussions will result in a transaction, as the company is not obligated to proceed with any offers currently on the table.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta for the District of Columbia gave his answers in a highly watched decision that spared the online behemoth from selling its Chrome browser but placed other limits on the search giant.
Google's parent company, Alphabet, after dodging the most severe penalties, saw its stock surge 9% on Wednesday.
“It's overall a win for Google,” said Yory Wurmser, a principal analyst at EMarketer. “It's probably about the best it could have expected, given that they were found guilty.”
Advocacy groups and some tech companies expressed disappointment about the ruling, stating that it didn’t go far enough.
The judge said in his decision that forcing Google to divest Chrome is a “poor fit for this case” and would be “incredibly messy and highly risky” because the web browser isn’t a stand-alone business and is tied to the tech company’s other systems.
But some of the remedies the judge cleared, such as requiring Google to share some of its search data with certain rivals, could open the door to more competition, some experts said.
Google's dominance grew after it struck exclusive agreements with Apple, Samsung, AT&T and others to be the default search engine on web browsers and mobile devices. As Google became more popular, it gathered a trove of valuable data, which in turn helped improve the quality of its search results.
“Making data available to competitors would narrow the scale gap created by Google’s exclusive distribution agreements and, in turn, the quality gap that followed,” the judge wrote.
Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said in a statement that the company is worried about “how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy” and is closely reviewing the decision.
The U.S. Department of Justice, which filed the antitrust lawsuit against Google in 2020, alleging the company illegally operated as a monopoly, said the remedies mark “an important step forward in the Department of Justice’s ongoing fight to protect American consumers.”

The weekend’s muted activity gave way to heightened market interest as DOGE closed August at $0.21.
Derivative data reinforces the recovery in traction as Coinglass reported that DOGE futures volumes jumped 119% to $5.36 billion, while open interest fell 4.7% to $3.24 billion.
The decline in open interest suggests strategic reshuffling, particularly from bullish traders who closed $7.61 million in long contracts, compared with just $2.41 million in shorts.
In the derivatives market, Coinglass data further confirms the resurgent Dogecoin market interest. As seen above, DOGE futures trading volumes rose 119% to $5.36 billion, though open interest dipped 4.7% to $3.24 billion.
This suggests aggressive position reshuffling rather than complete capitulation as liquidation heatmaps show that short-sellers remained dominant on Monday, with $262 million in leverage, overshadowing $172 million in long exposure.
However, a crucial detail stands out as the largest concentration of leverage is clustered at $0.21, where bull traders deployed $42 million in longs over the past week.
This level has emerged as a critical support zone for Dogecoin price action as Bitcoin led crypto market-wide corrections in the last week of August. If sustained, this base could provide the momentum for a decisive upward move heading into September.
Dogecoin Price Forecast: Analyst Predicts 900% Rally
Prominent market analyst DogeLord told his 12,500 followers on Sunday that a “propulsion candle” looks imminent, hinting that September could emerge as a major breakout month for Dogecoin price.
His long-term chart projection places Dogecoin on the cusp of a move that could propel prices back to all-time highs, signaling that sustained hold above $0.21 could fuel a rally to the $0.34 resistance zone, with further breakout towards the current global peaks near $0.75.
Beyond that, the chart projects a possible retest of prior all-time highs above $2, implying a rally of up to 850% from DOGE’s current price levels.
On the downside, failure to maintain the $0.21 support could expose DOGE to downside risk toward $0.17, with stronger support at $0.13. A break below those levels would likely delay any bullish momentum until another bull cycle kicks off.
With traders heavily clustered at $0.21, the coming weeks will test whether bulls can convert leveraged positioning into a September breakout, or if short sellers will press for further correction.",d48886656082ada2426ca37d8d2fd1ce,trafilatura,2617,0

Sanctions by the United States, which the Venezuelan government has characterized as ""economic war,"" prevent many business transactions, forcing companies seeking to buy raw materials from abroad to exchange local bolivars for dollars that are generated by the oil trade and foreign card transactions and are injected into exchanges by the central bank.
But oil revenue has taken a hit in recent months.
Though the United States Treasury Department last month issued a new, restricted license to Chevron allowing it to export oil after a three-month pause, the license blocks any payments to the government, reducing the quantity of dollars available for exchange.
In response, the Venezuelan government has since June allowed the use of more USDT, a digital currency also known as Tether, whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar and designed to maintain a stable value, according to the private and financial sector sources, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions.
The use of digital currencies helps keep the economy operating amid the sanctions, including domestic production of basic goods such as food.
""When one operation closes, others open,"" said one business person about the use of crypto.
Another source estimated the use of crypto will grow.
State-run oil company PDVSA has since last year been slowly increasing its digital currency usage and moving sales to USDT, sources told Reuters last year.
Tether did not respond to a request for comment, but said last year it respects the U.S. Treasury's list of sanctioned entities.
Neither the Ministry of Communications nor the central bank responded to questions, but Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said during an August meeting with business people that ""non-traditional mechanisms of management in the exchange market"" were being implemented, without providing more details.
The sources said a limited number of banks sell the cryptocurrencies, usually USDT, to some businesses in exchange for bolivars. The businesses must have a digital wallet approved by the authorities and receive the value of the transaction there.
Businesses are then free to either sell the crypto or use it to pay domestic or international providers.
There are no official figures for crypto sales, but local analyst firm Ecoanalitica has estimated that $119 million in cryptocurrencies were sold to the private sector in July.",b5e641c9c7c40d095d9bba684aa2efc5,trafilatura,2614,0

According to a Tuesday announcement, the investment added 312.5 million TRX tokens, priced around $0.3372, to Tron Inc.’s treasury. CEO Rich Miller said the move cements the firm as the largest publicly listed holder of TRX.
Bravemorning, which now controls 86.6% of Tron Inc., has invested a total of $210 million to date.
A Theme-Park Souvenir Firm Turned TRX Treasury Vehicle
Tron Inc., which only months ago was better known for selling theme park souvenirs under the SRM Entertainment brand, went public in June through a reverse merger. That deal injected $100 million in equity and included preferred shares and warrants valued at $210 million.
Crucially, it also brought on Tron founder Justin Sun as an adviser and established the company’s pivot into the crypto space.
Since then, Tron Inc. has filed to register up to $1 billion in securities, with plans to issue stock, debt, and other financial instruments “from time to time.” According to regulatory filings, proceeds will be used primarily to accumulate more TRX tokens and pursue income-generating strategies tied to its holdings.
The company’s strategy bears a resemblance to Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy playbook, which turned corporate cash reserves into a Bitcoin treasury. The difference is that Tron Inc. is building around TRX, a token with lower liquidity and a narrower investor base.
In its filing, Tron Inc. warned that “a decline in TRX prices or waning investor interest” could impact its ability to raise capital, highlighting the risks associated with heavily betting on a single digital asset.
However, the company structure has raised governance questions. While Tron founder Justin Sun has no formal role, his father, Weike Sun, chairs the board. Other board members include a Tron DAO adviser and the lead developer of Tronscan, a block explorer for the network.
Complicating matters further, the $100 million in TRX used to fund the reverse merger was held by a Hong Kong trust, where one of Tron Inc.’s directors also serves, indicating potential entanglement between the company and the broader Tron ecosystem.
Despite concerns, Tron Inc.’s stock has been on a tear since its rebrand and move to Web3. Shares have surged by more than 1,128% over the past six months, according to Google Finance.

Today, three names stand out for different reasons. MemeCore continues to rise on meme-driven enthusiasm. OKB benefits from its position as one of the most established exchange tokens. Ethena is finding traction through the growth of its synthetic dollar system.
The combination illustrates how altseason can be shaped by very different drivers. Community energy, exchange economics, and alternative stablecoin structures are all drawing attention. These tokens do not share the same purpose or design, yet each gathers interest through clear channels connecting to active users.
MemeCore (M): Community Token Moves Past $1
MemeCore is trading near $1.02, giving it a market capitalization of about $1.05 billion. According to CoinMarketCap, the circulating supply stands at just above 1 billion tokens, with daily turnover near $200 million. The price has climbed more than 140% over the past week and is once again approaching the August peak of $1.06.
Momentum has been driven by concentrated community campaigns, renewed influencer promotion, and liquidity maintained across multiple exchanges. The project positions itself as more than a single meme coin, with an ecosystem intended to support additional launches.
This framework helps explain why trading interest has returned so quickly, making MemeCore one of the clearest community-driven beneficiaries of this altcoin season.
OKB: Exchange Utility and Scarcity
OKB is priced around $178.9, with a market capitalization of nearly $3.7 billion. Circulating and maximum supply are fixed at 21 million tokens, which sets it apart from many other exchange-linked assets. The token has risen by roughly 6% in the past day.
OKB Price (Source: CoinMarketCap)
OKB’s demand is tied to the OKX trading platform, where holders receive fee discounts, staking opportunities, and access to exclusive launches. Buyback and burn programs further reduce supply over time.
The most recent move coincided with technical signs showing OKB trading above longer-term averages, prompting traders to add exposure. This mixture of exchange loyalty and managed scarcity has kept OKB resilient during altcoin rotations.
Ethena (ENA): Synthetic Dollar Adoption Lifts Token
Ethena is trading near $0.73, with a market capitalization of about $4.8 billion and a circulating supply of around 6.6 billion tokens. Daily turnover is close to $700 million, reflecting broad participation. ENA has gained about 7% in the past day and around 20% during the past week.",07979491a982405bbd3855773f1b147d,trafilatura,2609,0

It offers a range of financial products and services, including investment banking, securities trading, wealth management, and investment management services to corporations, governments, financial institutions, and individuals.
Companies valued at $200 billion or more are typically classified as “mega-cap stocks,” and MS fits the label perfectly, with its market cap exceeding this threshold, underscoring its size, influence, and dominance within the capital markets industry. The company's risk management discipline, strong brand reputation, and diversified revenue streams give it resilience across market cycles, making it one of the most trusted names in global finance.

This investment banking giant touched its 52-week high of $150.75 in the last trading session. MS has surged 17.4% over the past three months, outperforming the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLF) 6.2% rise during the same time frame.
In the longer term, MS has soared 47.2% over the past 52 weeks, considerably outpacing XLF's 20.2% uptick over the same time period. Moreover, on a YTD basis, shares of MS are up 19.7%, compared to XLF’s 11.7% rise.
To confirm its bullish trend, MS has been trading above its 200-day and 50-day moving averages since early May.
On Jul. 16, Morgan Stanley reported its Q2 earnings results. The company’s revenues came in at $16.8 billion, up 11.8% from the year-ago quarter and 5.5% above the consensus estimates. Moreover, on the earnings front, its net income per share of $2.13 increased 17% year-over-year, handily exceeding analyst estimates by 10.4%. Yet, its shares plunged 1.3% after the earnings release, highlighting a cautious investor sentiment despite the solid performance.
MS has lagged behind its rival, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS), which gained 48.1% over the past 52 weeks and 30.2% on a YTD basis.
Considering MS’ recent outperformance, analysts remain moderately optimistic about its prospects. The stock has a consensus rating of ""Moderate Buy” from the 25 analysts covering it. While the company is trading above its mean price target of $145.26, its Street-high price target of $160 suggests a 6.3% premium to its current price levels.

Shares of the Chinese e-commerce giant peaked in 2020.
-
The stock's cheap valuation now makes it a potential buy.
It's been a tough few years for Alibaba Group (NYSE: BABA) investors. Shares have heavily underperformed the market since 2020. Yet sales have continued to rise. Looking back at the company's financial history reveals a peculiar picture. It's not hard to see why some investors think this former growth darling is now a value stock.
Not everything peaked in 2020 for Alibaba
During the COVID-19 pandemic's height, e-commerce sales spiked, directly benefiting the sales and net income for major retailers like Alibaba. That year, for example, the company generated a staggering $74 billion in sales during its Singles Day event -- nearly double the $38 billion brought in the year before.
In the years that followed, however, the company faced antitrust investigations, leading to a $2.8 billion fine. Meanwhile, outspoken founder Jack Ma garnered increased scrutiny from regulators and Chinese party officials.
While growth since 2020 has undoubtedly been tepid, Alibaba's sales have continued to grow. Its net income is only 26% below its 2020 highs. The stock price, meanwhile, is more than 60% below its pandemic highs. That has brought the company's price-to-earnings ratio down to just 15.6 -- roughly half what the S&P 500 trades at overall.
What's the future for Alibaba? Sales are expected to grow by 6% this year, with another 8% growth expected the following year. Earnings per share, meanwhile, are expected to hit $62.47 this year, growing to $75.19 next year. Clearly, analysts remain fairly optimistic about the company's financial situation.
After Alibaba's stock price peaked in 2020, the company's growth prospects reset sharply. But with shares trading at just 15.6 times earnings despite expectations for rising sales and earnings, shares seem appealing for contrarian investors looking to add beaten-down stocks to their portfolio.

Elliott Investment Management has confirmed that it will take a $4 billion position in the soda and snack giant, individuals with knowledge of the situation told Yahoo Finance.
PepsiCo stock jumped 3% during morning trading. The investment comes at a challenging time for PepsiCo, whose stock has slipped over 2% year to date and is off over 13% in the past 12 months, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 9% gain.
""PepsiCo finds itself at a critical inflection point. The Company has an opportunity — and an obligation — to improve financial performance and regain its position as an industry leader,"" Elliot wrote in a letter to PepsiCo.
Making the necessary changes could open a ""path to more than 50% stock-price increase from today's depressed levels,"" the letter said. The firm wrote that it wants to help the company sharpen its focus, drive innovation, boost efficiency, and unlock value in its already leading brands.
The activist is known for pushing major strategic changes at companies where it sees untapped potential or underperformance, including Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Starbucks (SBUX).
This isn't PepsiCo's first clash with an activist investor. In 2015, it reached a truce after a years-long fight with billionaire investor Nelson Peltz.
Elliott's arrival could act as a catalyst. PepsiCo has been grappling with softening demand across its drinks and snacks divisions. In beverages, PepsiCo has steadily lost ground to Coca-Cola (KO) and Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP).
As consumers increasingly turn to alternatives like flavored waters, energy drinks, and zero-sugar options, PepsiCo has adapted by investing in brands like Bubly and Celsius. But its core soda business continues to face headwinds.
In food, PepsiCo's once-resilient snacks portfolio, which includes brands like Lay's, Doritos, and Cheetos, is also under pressure. Higher prices, tariffs, and shifting consumer preferences toward health have made it harder for the company to maintain momentum.
Elliot said in its letter to PepsiCo that its ""problems are within its power to address."" The firm's sizable stake suggests it sees room for deeper moves to boost profitability and reignite growth.
Wall Street remains cautious.
""Better-than-feared,"" Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein wrote, pointing to PepsiCo's ability to flex its ""productivity muscle"" through cost savings and automation. Evercore raised its price target to $150 from $140 but kept an In Line rating, signaling the stock is unlikely to outperform without clear US growth.",54cd85392c8bef82dbcef066a8129e26,trafilatura,2596,0

Investors should watch critical support levels on Alphabet's chart near $192 and $151.
Alphabet (GOOGL) shares jumped Wednesday after a federal judge ruled Google doesn't have to sell its flagship Chrome browser, alleviating worries it could be forced to break up its business.
The stock was up over 8% in recent trading near $229, leaving it on track to close at a record high after climbing as high as $230.86 shortly after the open.
Heading into Wednesday's session, Alphabet shares had gained about 12% since the start of the year, though they trailed returns of top-performing Magnificent Seven stocks over the same period amid antitrust concerns and worries about AI-driven disruption.
Below, we take a closer look at Alphabet’s weekly chart and apply technical analysis to point out price levels worth watching.
Right-Angled Broadening Formation Breakout
Alphabet shares have oscillated in a right-angled broadening formation since March, with the price recently rallying toward the pattern’s upper trendline.
However, the stock broke out to an all-time high after Wednesday’s open, potentially setting the stage for a continuation of the longer-term uptrend.
The relative strength index confirms strong price momentum, though a move into overbought territory would increase the chances for near-term profit taking.
Let’s use prior price action to consider how a longer-term trend may play out on Alphabet’s chart and also identify two support levels worth monitoring during possible retracements in the stock.
Uptrend Analysis
Investors can forecast how the stock’s current move higher may evolve by using bars pattern analysis, a study that uses prior price bars to project future directional movements.
When applying the technique to Alphabet’s chart, we extract the stock’s trending move higher from the March 2020 pandemic low to the November 2021 high and overlay it from this year’s April low. The analysis forecasts a target of around $395 and indicates the bullish period could last until December next year if price action rhymes with the prior move.",1d3f5938570536fe718ba232db250a0d,trafilatura,2595,0

Bitcoin could be gearing up for a massive move up, according to Eric Peters, investment chief and CEO at Coinbase's (NASDAQ:COIN) Coinbase Asset Management unit.
Peters said in an Aug. 25 “Bankless” podcast episode that the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin, had a 25% chance of experiencing a “South Sea bubble-type move” when asked how high cryptocurrency assets can actually go.

Vacancy Rates Below 5% and $2.3B in Unmet Demand — How Everyday Investors Can Access America's Industrial Boom
The South Sea Bubble refers to a significant financial collapse that occurred in the 18th century, involving British joint stock firm South Sea Company. The company had a monopoly on supplying slaves to Spanish plantations in the Americas, promising huge profits and high returns. But when the trade failed to take off it turned to fraudulently inflating its valuation to keep the ruse going and for while it worked. The growth of the company’s stock triggered a speculative frenzy that peaked in 1720. The company’s stock soared over 680% within the year before crashing over 80% as the bubble eventually burst.
Peters said that Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market could experience a similar rally as barriers to entry for big institutions disappear and passive flows increase due to the limited supply.

“Everything else that humans have ever invested in, if the price goes up, you create more of it,” he said. “You don’t create more Bitcoin. I mean, you’re creating a little bit, but there’s no big supply response. The rate of mining creation is not going up because the price doubles or triples or quadruples. It just doesn’t go up. You have to just get people who currently own it to sell it at a higher price. So, you could see some type of massive move.”
Beyond the potential of a South Sea Bubble-type run-up, Peters also said that he believed there was another 25% probability that Bitcoin would swing wildly between $50,000, $75,000 and $250,000 over the next five years. And beyond this, he said that there was perhaps another 25% possibility that Bitcoin would trade even lower over the next five years.
“I don’t know,” he said. “It would probably be [sic] hostile administration. Some things really went wrong that I can’t foresee right now.”",568e1a093b22826583df2b8c71280e8b,trafilatura,2581,0

(NYSE:CRM) will release earnings results for the second quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday, Sept. 3.
Analysts expect quarterly earnings at $2.78 per share, up from $2.56 per share in the year-ago period. Salesforce projects to report quarterly revenue of $10.14 billion, compared to $9.32 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The San Francisco, California-based company beat analyst estimates for revenue in the first quarter and has beaten estimates in eight of the last 10 quarters overall.
Some investors may be eyeing potential gains from Salesforce's annual dividend yield of 0.66%. That’s a semi-annual dividend amount of 42 cents per share ($1.66 a year).
So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?
To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $913,836 or around 3,614 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $182,818 or around 723 shares.
To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.66 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.66 = 3,614 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.66 = 723 shares ($100 per month).
Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.
How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.
For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).
Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.
CRM Price Action: Shares of Salesforce fell 1.3% to close at $252.86 on Tuesday.

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Cramer’s thoughts about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) have been interesting to say the least since the firm’s latest earnings report. These results saw the shares struggle in the aftermath as cloud computing growth (read: AI) disappointed investors. Immediately after the report, Cramer criticized Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) for choosing to focus on performance and cost by relying on its in-house Trainium AI chips instead of offering cloud computing customers NVIDIA’s GPUs. However, later on, the CNBC TV host changed his opinion and asserted that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy was right to focus on cost and performance instead of performance only. He described the firm’s GPU approach with these remarks as well:
[AMZN]”Like take the case of Amazon. Amazon’s trying to figure out the return of investment. And I think that they may think maybe that’s [NVIDIA GPUs] not great as what they do when they do this Trainium. Which is their own chip.”

While Cramer has dithered about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s cloud business, he is still a fan of the eCommerce business as he recently remarked:
“Today, we had a giant run in Amazon, up almost 3%. Why? It’s a follow on move from yesterday’s announcement that the company will be moving to same-day grocery delivery, which the analysts wrote about overnight. Now this is an incredibly disruptive initiative that was basically ignored yesterday. Given that delivery is free with Amazon Prime, it could spell real problems for Instacart, perhaps even DoorDash and Uber. Just as importantly, this announcement changed the narrative about Amazon. You see, for the past two weeks, the story of Amazon was about how its AWS business had fallen behind Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure, its principal competitors, because it’s using its own slower chips instead of buying them from NVIDIA. It was a very damning storyline. This week, though, we remember that Amazon’s also a retailer, arguably the best retailer in the world. That’s rational, not frothy.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The Michael Saylor-led firm recently acquired 4,048 Bitcoin for $449.3 million. This sums up its total holdings to 636,505 BTC, now worth over $69 billion.
Strategy Expands Bitcoin Holdings to 636,505 BTC
On September 2, Strategy submitted an 8-K filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
In the document, it pointed out that it had completed the acquisition of 4,048 Bitcoin between August 26 and September 1, 2025.
Each BTC was bought at an average price of $110,981.
The firm used proceeds from at-the-market sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual Strike preferred stock, STRK, perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF, and perpetual Stride preferred stock, STRD, to achieve the purchase.
It offloaded 1,237,000 MSTR shares for $425.3 million. It still has $16.31 billion remaining for issue and sale under that ATM program.
Then, the firm sold 199,509 STRK shares for approximately $19 million, with $20.39 billion remaining, 237,931 STRF shares for $26.5 million, with $1.8 billion remaining, and 12,973 STRD shares for $1 million, with $4.17 billion remaining.
As a result of the latest purchase, the firm now holds 636,505 BTC. At the current value of $108,826.97 per Bitcoin, this entire holding is worth $69.3 billion.
Each BTC was acquired at an average price of $73,765 per Bitcoin for a total cost of around $47 billion. Saylor, the company’s founder, noted that this includes fees and expenses.
Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio accounts for more than 3% of the flagship cryptocurrency’s total 21 million supply.
Also, it suggests that the company holds around $23 billion of paper gains. In the long run, the company is aiming to hold 7% of the total BTC supply.
Strategy Remains Committed to Its Bitcoin Accumulation Playbook
Meanwhile, Michael Saylor has hinted at the possibility of another Bitcoin acquisition. He shared an update on the company’s BTC acquisition tracker on Sunday, stating, “Bitcoin is still on sale.”
Generally, there has been a decline in the frequency of Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases, unlike in the past.
The reason for this slowdown is not known, but nothing has been said about offloading its current stash. Only last week, Strategy announced that it had bought 3,081 BTC for $357 million.
This initially took its total holdings to 632,457 BTC before it hit its current level. In this case, it paid an average of $115,829 per coin.",82a980188af81181aa7cf3fc568fff51,trafilatura,2566,0

The longtime car rental company will sell used vehicles on Amazon's website.
-
The deal offers the potential to greatly expand Hertz's used car sales business.
Hertz Global (NASDAQ: HTZ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently announced a deal in which the former will sell used cars on the latter's website. Investors clearly believe the deal will help Hertz's business. They sent the share price up 12.5%, from $5.20 to $5.85, from Aug. 19 through Aug. 27.
What has investors so excited? And, more importantly, is the deal a long-term value-creating opportunity for Hertz? It's time to look closer at the deal and Hertz's fundamentals.
Deal details
Hertz will list its used vehicles for sale on the Amazon Autos website. However, it's only a test right now, and it's being rolled out in the metro areas of Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle. Car buyers can go on the site and browse used vehicles to purchase. Once they find something and complete the purchase, the new car owner can pick up the vehicle at various Hertz locations.
The benefits to Amazon Auto, which launched less than a year ago, are clear. The site previously offered car buyers with limited options. Under this arrangement, Amazon will greatly expand the number of listings across many more brands.
How does Hertz benefit?
If car buyers are willing to shop online for used cars, they'll get an easier and more convenient process with a broad selection of automobiles. That could expand Hertz's car sales.
Currently, Hertz sells its rental fleet cars through company-operated U.S. retail locations. This also produces other revenue, such as from selling warranties and providing financing. It's unclear how many used vehicles Hertz sells, however. The company has mentioned that it sells thousands, but that makes it challenging to pinpoint the impact on Hertz's cash flow.
Still, if the arrangement with Amazon proves mutually beneficial, Hertz will be able to scale the used car business and diversify its revenue stream. It's also a step toward executing CEO Gil West's plan to expand its retail business and raise awareness of the Hertz used car brand
Should you buy Hertz's stock?
Hertz operates two segments: Americas RAC and international RAC. Each division rents vehicles and sells services like insurance and satellite radio. Right now, Hertz's core rental business has been struggling, with shrinking sales and declining profitability. The company's total second-quarter revenue dropped 7% to $2.2 billion, and it lost $104 million after adjusting for certain items.",1f4c0402238cd8e7270de59dd51f8ff3,trafilatura,2562,0

The company has launched Medá, a regulated Electronic Payment Funds Institution (IFPE) designed to provide fiat deposit and withdrawal services for Mexican users.
Medá will operate independently while remaining under the Binance corporate umbrella, and is subject to supervision by Mexican financial authorities to ensure compliance with local regulations.
Binance Brings Regulated Peso Services to Mexican Market
The investment will be distributed over the next four years and is part of Binance’s strategy to position Mexico as a fintech leader in Latin America. Medá’s services will allow users to access, send, and utilize Mexican pesos in transactions within the Binance ecosystem.
Binance highlights that the market is highly concentrated and expects Medá to become an essential alternative for processing financial transactions in Mexican pesos, potentially providing more competition and delivering higher-quality financial technology services at lower costs for Mexican consumers, according to their website. Medá will join the competition for the Mexican market, where one of the largest LATAM companies, Bitso, currently holds the majority of the market share.
Medá Achieves Key Regulatory Approval as Independent Entity
By operating as an independent vertical, Medá is set to advance fintech innovation, compliance, and user trust while promoting healthy development between traditional finance and digital assets.
Guilherme Nazar, Binance’s Regional Vice President for Latin America, stated that Medá’s launch represents a critical regulatory milestone for the group, which has already secured licenses and permits in 22 jurisdictions worldwide, including France, Italy, Spain, Japan, Brazil, and Argentina.

LLB has opted to close its business locations in these two sites, after two decades in the Middle East.
The referral encompasses assets potentially worth CHF 1bn ($1.25bn).
Rothschild will assume control of LLB's Dubai office, with approximately 20 LLB employees transitioning to Rothschild.
This will increase the size of Rothschild & Co’s Middle East wealth management team, headed by Sascha Benz, to approximately 25 people.
Rothschild said that the deal will facilitate market reach and the delivery of a more range of services in both public and private markets, including corporate advisory.
Rothschild & Co executive chairman Alexandre de Rothschild said: ""In recent years, we have experienced continuous strong growth in our global Wealth Management and Middle East businesses.
“The onboarding of LLB's business in the UAE is an excellent fit and further supports our strategy across one of our key global business pillars and fastest growing regions. This represents our high conviction in the UAE’s potential, given the increasing concentration of both regional and global wealth here.""
LLB interim Group CEO Christoph Reich stated: ""We successfully expanded our presence in the Middle East in recent years with commitment and passion. For strategic reasons, we will focus on supporting our international clients in future at our business locations in Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Austria and Germany.
“We have therefore decided to offer our clients and employees in the Middle East new growth opportunities on a sustained basis through an outstanding partner. International private banking business is and remains an important strategic pillar for the LLB Group.""

Fundamentally, FCOJ prices are rising due to declining global orange supplies due to the citrus greening disease in Florida and drought in Brazil. Despite a long-term decline in overall orange juice consumption, the significant decrease in orange supply has been unable to meet the reduced demand.
A move in November FCOJ futures prices above chart resistance at $2.60 would give the bulls more power, suggesting more price upside, and it would also become a buying opportunity. The upside price objective would be $3.1000, or above. Technical support, for which to place a protective sell stop just below, is located at $2.4000.

Trading commodity futures and options is not for everyone. IT IS A VOLATILE, COMPLEX AND RISKY BUSINESS.

You should understand commodity futures and options contracts and your obligations in entering into those contracts. You should understand your exposure to risk and other aspects of trading by thoroughly reviewing the risk disclosure documents your broker is required to give you.

His elevation to chair is seen as a strategic move to bolster Frasers Group's ongoing expansion and market consolidation efforts.
Thompson joined the board as a non-executive director in June last year. He has experience in corporate governance and large-scale project management fields.
Sir Jon Thompson said: ""I am very much looking forward to working alongside Board colleagues, the Group Executive Team and the wider company to continue Fraser Group's evolution.

Despite an influx of new orders, U.S. manufacturing activity was relatively flat in August compared to the previous month as tariff uncertainty loomed, according to the Institute for Supply Management’s latest Purchasing Managers’ Index.
ISM’s index registered 48.7% in August, up 0.7 percentage points compared to July. A PMI index below 50% shows an industry in contraction.
Production fell 3.6 percentage points to 47.8% compared to July’s results, nearly wiping out the gains from new orders in August.
This is the first time that new orders, which increased 4.3 percentage points to 51.4%, have expanded in the past six months, said Susan Spence, chair of ISM’s Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, during a call Tuesday. However, three of the four main demand indicators — new export orders, backlog of orders and customers’ inventories — were in contraction.
Spence was optimistic about inventories recovering, saying “at some point customers have to reorder.” Unfortunately, she said, production is down as manufacturers continue to navigate employment and pricing challenges.
“We believe that we're not going to see a big turnaround until we have tariff deals set and not changing,” Spence said.
Approximately 69% of manufacturing gross domestic product is in contraction, she added.
On the call, Spence noted that 89% of ISM’s monthly surveyed participants are citing tariffs as a “worrisome issue.” In general, Spence said that for every positive comment, there are 15 negative ones. While some companies struggle with hiring, Spence said more comments are coming in that suggest employers are not replacing people who have either left or been laid off, or closing factories.
Uncertainty is ratcheting up as U.S. judges mull over whether the Trump administration’s tariffs are even legal. A federal appeals court on Aug. 29 ruled the president’s broad use of emergency powers to impose broad tariffs was illegal, but delayed any action until mid-October to allow time for a review by the Supreme Court.
“The pressure is on these guys to try to figure out what their input price is going to be, so their companies can figure out, ‘Do we absorb it? Do we pass it along? What does it do to our profit margin?,’” Spence said. “Not knowing what the courts will do, or even if the court does one thing, we've got a Supreme Court now that will rule in.”",ab0058b324cc316229574dbeaedc79a6,trafilatura,2515,0

MU stock has been trading above its 200-day moving averages since early May.
Micron reported a strong fiscal Q3 2025 report on Jun. 25 that beat Wall Street expectations, with revenue surging 37% year-over-year to $9.3 billion and adjusted EPS jumping 208% to $1.91. The surge was driven by explosive demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI accelerators, with HBM revenue growing 50% quarter-over-quarter and overall data center revenue more than doubling year-over-year. Investor optimism was further fueled by strong forward guidance, including Q4 revenue projected at $10.4 billion - $11 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.35 - $2.65.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -A rising group of artificial intelligence companies stand to gain from an antitrust ruling on Tuesday that ordered Alphabet's Google to share its invaluable search data with competitors.
Matching Google's (GOOG) heft, though, will take time and huge resources, with no guarantees that any rival product will win as many users, experts said.
While Google was spared the devastating outcome of having to sell its popular Chrome browser and Android operating system, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's ruling was a nod to regulators' efforts to level the playing field for companies who have invested billions to boost their AI business.
""The emergence of GenAI changed the course of this case,"" Mehta wrote in his ruling.
He said that tens of millions of people use generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude to gather information that they previously sought through internet search. While these chatbots are not yet close to replacing traditional search, the industry expects that developers will continue to add features to GenAI products to perform more like Google Search, he said.
The data-sharing requirement does not alter Google's existing means of distribution, allowing the company to continue to pay the likes of Apple (AAPL) to make its search engine the default option. However, it lowers the barrier for competitors to develop and distribute their own alternatives to Google Search, experts said.
These AI products, some say, pose a bigger threat to Google than the antitrust case. But development will take time and resources, giving Alphabet investors a measure of confidence in the near term.
MASSIVE CAPITAL NEEDED
The current slate of AI search engines and browsers has not made a material dent in Google's market share. While ChatGPT, OpenAI's (OPAI.PVT) popular AI chatbot, has outpaced Google's offering, Gemini, in terms of users, Google has sought to counteract the effect through features like AI Overviews and AI Mode to keep users on its search engine.
""It takes effort for competitors to rely on the syndication and indexes that Google can provide to build a consumer facing experience,"" said Deepak Mathivanan, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald. ""And it would take a longer period of time for consumers to also embrace these new experiences.""
Indexing is how Google discovers, analyzes and stores website pages in its vast database for relevant search results, while propagating the reach of a website through republishing content.",fb6f00272f454d054c189030527ca929,trafilatura,2513,0

Cost-cutting and AI could boost Amazon's long-term profitability.
-
Super Micro's stock is too cheap to ignore.
A new month brings new challenges and opportunities. The S&P 500 is already up nearly 9% year to date. And investors are left wondering how much steam is left in the generative AI boom after a report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) suggested many corporations are struggling to implement the technology profitably.
Let's discuss why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) could be great ways to bet on the AI opportunity in September, while potentially minimizing the risk of downside.
1. Amazon
Amazon is no stranger to unexpected transformations. Investors who bought shares in the early 2000s thought they were betting on an online bookstore. Since then, Amazon has transformed into a general-purpose e-commerce and cloud computing leader, creating trillions in shareholder value in the process. The company's latest pivots to AI and robotics could create even more value through cost-cutting and efficiency.
Amazon has a two-pronged AI strategy. On one side, it ""rents out"" AI computing power through its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). On the other side, it is incorporating the technology throughout its operations.
According to CEO Andy Jassey, AI will help Amazon ""shrink"" its corporate workforce by replacing positions with generative tools and agents. For investors, this likely means more value will trickle down to the company's bottom line, even if topline growth is modest or flat. Amazon is also investing in automation across its warehouses with a jaw-dropping 1 million robots used across its global operations, allowing it to slow hiring and replace human labor.
So far, Amazon's cost-cutting efforts are bearing fruit. While second-quarter net sales increased 13% year over year to $167.7 billion, operating profits soared 31% to $19.2 billion. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 35, the stock looks reasonably priced compared to its long-term potential for continued bottom-line improvement.
2. Super Micro Computer
It's been three years since ChatGPT sparked the generative AI boom. And that has been plenty of time for leaders like Nvidia to quickly add billions to their market capitalizations by serving the industry's hardware needs. However, no one wants to buy at the top of a mountain. And Super Micro serves as a much cheaper alternative for investors who missed the boat.",db4b9718aa396d1ae09495ee7885a5c0,trafilatura,2512,0

Through its principal subsidiary, Union Pacific Railroad Company, it provides rail transportation services across 23 U.S. states, connecting key Pacific and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern gateways.
Companies valued at $10 billion or more are generally considered ""large-cap"" stocks, and Union Pacific fits this criterion perfectly. It serves a wide range of industries, transporting agricultural products, automotive goods, chemicals, coal, industrial products, and intermodal containers. Union Pacific also links with Canada’s rail systems and uniquely serves all six major gateways to Mexico.

Despite this, shares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based company have declined 13.4% from its 52-week high of $258.07. UNP stock has risen marginally over the past three months, underperforming the Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) 11.9% increase over the same time frame.
In the longer term, Union Pacific stock is down nearly 2% on a YTD basis, lagging behind NASX’s 11.1% gain. Moreover, shares of the railroad have decreased 11.5% over the past 52 weeks, compared to NASX’s 22.2% return over the same time frame.
Despite few fluctuations, UNP stock has been trading mostly below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since early March.
Despite reporting better-than-expected Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $3.03, Union Pacific’s stock fell 4.5% on Jul. 24 because revenue of $6.15 billion was essentially flat and slightly below the consensus. Investors were also concerned that the adjusted operating ratio deteriorated by 230 basis points year-over-year to 58.1%, signaling weaker efficiency despite higher coal, grain, and chemical shipments.
In contrast, rival Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC) has outpaced UNP stock. Shares of Norfolk Southern have soared 19.3% on a YTD basis and 11.9% over the past 52 weeks.
Despite the stock’s underperformance, analysts remain moderately optimistic on Union Pacific. The stock has a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy” from 25 analysts in coverage, and the mean price target of $261.09 is a premium of 16.8% to current levels.

Altcoins Season and Gold Correlation
Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe cites an interesting correlation between altcoin season and gold. He noted that gold acts as a risk indicator, with investors hesitant to take on risk while gold prices climb.
Van de Poppe added that the market is at a pivotal point and expects that once gold reaches a short-term peak, altcoins could see a strong upward move.
On several instances earlier, Poppe cited the correlation between altcoins and Gold, noting.
During September, gold has maintained a steady return of 8%. Only one altcoin, Ethereum, has outperformed it with 15% gains. Overall, Ethereum has largely driven the altcoin market rally.
Bitcoin macro strategy platform “ecoinometrics” noted that gold led in overall returns in August, while Bitcoin ended the month with 15% negative returns.
What Happens to Altcoins in September?
With expectations of the Fed rate cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting on September 17, investors are on the edge, waiting for a major liquidity boost in the market. With Bitcoin dominance sinking, optimism among analysts remains high.
Analyst Crypto Patel says the altcoin rally is just beginning. According to Patel, the “real exit zone” for altcoins will come when Bitcoin dominance falls to 45%-40%.
Until then, investors could see 5x or higher gains on strong, high-potential altcoins. He urged traders to stay alert and well-positioned for the ongoing market move.
Similarly, crypto commentator 0xNobler noted that every major altcoin season in the past two cycles has historically started in September, producing exceptional returns for low cap altcoin gems with 1000x potential.
The pattern, repeating roughly every four years, saw altcoins surge up to 100x in 2017-2018 and selected low-cap assets deliver 125x returns during the 2021 cycle.
With Bitcoin consolidating and market liquidity shifting, Nobler suggests the market may be entering what he calls Altcoin Season 3.0.

Mercer Global Advisors, one of the nation’s largest and most acquisitive registered investment advisors with $81 billion in assets, has acquired two RIA firms, one with a footprint in Idaho and California and a tax-focused firm based in Central Oregon.
West Oak Capital, an Eagle, Idaho-headquartered firm, brings about $500 million in client assets across 100 families. The firm has an additional office in Westlake Village, Calif. The RIA was founded in 2003 by Byron Snider, president of West Oak, and his wife, Lisa Snider.
“Joining forces with Mercer Advisors allows us to broaden what we can offer to our clients and their families,” said Byron Snider. “We’ll gain access to additional resources, technology and infrastructure that will elevate our service model while maintaining the personal touch our clients have always valued.”
West Oak also includes Senior Partner Jerry Clebanoff, Senior Vice President Tony G. Somoza, Director of Operations Darin P. White, Portfolio Manager Jonathan Howard, and two operations staff.
Mercer also announced its acquisition of Eagle Wealth Management, a Bend, Ore.-based RIA with $350 million in assets across 300 clients. The acquisition also includes Eagle Wealth Accounting, a CPA firm.
The 10-person firm was founded in 2008 by husband-and-wife Chad and Cami Staskal. It builds upon Mercer’s presence in Bend, which the firm established earlier this year when it added advisors Dave Stuehling and John Swanson, each with their own distinct practices.
This follows news last month that Mercer purchased Family Wealth Planning Group, a Naples, Fla.-based wealth management firm with $1.2 billion in client assets. That deal represented Mercer’s third $1 billion-plus transaction in as many months.
Mercer launched its M&A strategy in 2016, with the acquisitions of Tufton Capital Management, a $810 million AUM RIA in Hunt Valley, Md., and Lewis Wealth Management, a Denver-based RIA with about $75 million in AUM. The RIA surpassed 100 acquisitions in May.
Mercer also recently announced that more than half (674) of its 1,300 employees are now equity owners in the RIA. That’s up tenfold from 2018, when there were fewer than 70 employee shareholders.
Mercer is majority owned by Oak Hill Capital, Genstar Capital, Altas Partners and GIC, a global institutional investor.",40379ceb3a86038632cc2a5884ed4ef0,trafilatura,2431,0

Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG) is another embattled consumer packaged goods company. Its shares have lost 32% year-to-date as the firm struggles with disappointing earnings. Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG)’s stock has touched decade lows this year, with a notable dip coming in July after the firm’s fiscal fourth quarter earnings missed analyst revenue and earnings estimates. Cramer’s previous comment about the firm pointed out that inflation, margins, and tin cans are driving its woes. This time he discussed Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG) in the context of low demand from young people:
“If you go, if you stroll the grocery store which you have to do, you see the Craft, and you see the Jello, and the Oscar Mayers, and they’re all in the middle, with the exception of Lunchables which is the end cap. I don’t see anything here. . . .People don’t go to the middle of the store anymore. Cause it’s canned. Even Conagra they thought that refrigerated that the younger people would want that. They don’t want it either. They want the clean and pure.

Previously, Cramer discussed Conagra Brands, Inc. (NYSE:CAG)’s business in detail. Here is what he said:
“Very tough, very tough situation. Conagra’s got 7% inflation. They got problem with tin cans. They can’t, it’s killing them… The margins aren’t that good. The brands aren’t enabling them to be able to take any price. I have to tell you, the one thing that was important was that, on the conference call, they did say that they think they have no problem paying the dividend. A company that has to answer about whether it has a problem paying the dividend or not is a company that I say [don’t buy, don’t buy, don’t buy].”

A sleepy start to a data-heavy week will get its first test when an inflation report for the euro zone comes out during European hours, while investor focus will also be on Nestle after the Kitkat maker abruptly dismissed its CEO.
Euro zone inflation is likely to have remained stable at 2.0% in August, showed economist estimates compiled by Reuters. Data from Germany, France, Italy and Spain last week indicated inflation stayed close to the European Central Bank's target.
The ECB left its key interest rate at 2% at its July policy meeting and market watchers expect it to do so again this month before discussion about further cuts resume in the autumn.
NESTLE UPHEAVAL
Nestle dismissed Laurent Freixe exactly a year after becoming CEO for not disclosing a romantic relationship with a subordinate.
The dismissal also came a year after predecessor Mark Schneider's sudden departure, and two and a half months after longstanding chair Paul Bulcke announced he would step down in 2026, amounting to one of the most turbulent periods in the food giant's history.
Nestle's stock price has fallen more than 17% over the past 12 months, versus a 5% gain in the pan-European STOXX 600. Watch out for fireworks at the open.
RATE-CUT WAGERS
Meanwhile, the broader market struggled for direction as investors geared up for a U.S. jobs report on Friday that will influence the Federal Reserve's near-term policy path. Investors broadly expect a 25 basis-point cut at its September meeting.
Relentless attacks on the Fed from President Donald Trump have also kept investors wary, with Trump's efforts to fire Governor Lisa Cook raising the prospect of him making more dovish appointments at the central bank.
Comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stoked further concern about the Fed's independence and credibility.
""The Fed should be independent. The Fed is independent, but I, I also think that they've made a lot of mistakes,"" Bessent said in an interview.
The dollar has remained under pressure on rate-cut wagers, propelling gold to break above $3,500 an ounce to a record high. The metal is up 33% this year after gaining 27% last year.

But according to Grant Cardone, there’s one threat that could quietly sabotage your future: taxes.
Find Out: Here’s Why You Might Want To Invest Your Retirement Savings in a Roth 401(k)

Here’s why the private equity fund manager and real estate investor believes that taxes can easily derail your retirement plans.
Why Future Tax Rates Could Crush Your Nest Egg
Many of us plan for retirement under the assumption that tax rates will be close to what they are right now, but Cardone — who recently launched the 10X Wealth Plan, a personalized financial coaching program — said this is an assumption we should not be making.
“Everybody assumes their retirement account’s going to handle them, but they don’t know what their tax [burden will be] when they’re 73 years old,” he told GOBankingRates. “In the year 2061, you have no clue what the taxes will be. Taxes could be 90%, which means is 90% of your retirement withdrawal will go to the federal government.”

Spending Is Optional — Taxes Aren’t, Cardone Warned
Cardone believes that taxes are such a threat to your retirement because they’re an expense that’s out of your control.
“Expenditures are a choice,” he said. “Taxes are a mandate. I don’t have a choice, and I don’t control how much it is. That pair of shoes, I could buy them or not buy them. The withholding tax, I cannot [control].”
If tax rates increase, even those who planned ahead and have millions of dollars saved may not be able to have a secure retirement.
“At 73 years old, you’re forced by the IRS to withdraw 4%, so for every million dollars [you have in retirement savings], you’re required to pull out $40,000 a year,” Cardone said. “If that’s taxed at 60%, you don’t have enough money to go to the retirement house.”
Given Cardone’s warning, you shouldn’t just plan for what you can control — you also need to prepare for what you can’t. That means building income streams that are tax-advantaged or tax-free, and staying flexible as laws change.

Weight loss drug giant Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)’s shares have lost 5.9% year-to-date as investors have questioned the firm’s weight loss drug trials. Cramer has been a fan of the firm throughout this year despite the share price woes. This time, he discussed Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) after the firm’s latest orforglipron drug trial shared results of the treatment in patients with weight complications and diabetes:
“One of my favorite executives is David Ricks, from Eli Lilly. He came on after that last trial and that was the, a trial for weight loss, obviously, August 7th 2025, he said look, our stock shouldn’t be down that much. There’s a lot more things in the pipeline. He then bought 1,632 shares at 645, August 12th. . . well of course, the new trial, another trial came out today, August 26th, same kind, the misinformation on this thing is so [inaudible] that you gotta listen. This trial attained to, said the population was adults with obesity or overweight and type two. That’s important, the ‘and.’ Okay. Previous one was just without diabetes. They have similar results. . . no, if you include people who have diabetes it’s much harder to lose weight. So this trial is dramatic. Because if you exclude that population and you take a pill, and you’re heavy? You’re going to lose a huge amount of weight. This is a gigantic win. Is it worth 31? No, it’s probably worth maybe 80, 90. It’s that it was apples to oranges, and the apples to oranges is a tougher group of people to lose weight. David Ricks is so good. And I wish he’d come on our show. Because he could have explained very quickly. Please, there are many more pill studies.”

Crypto firms like Bullish (NYSE: BLSH) have had a blockbuster moment by making a Wall Street debut this year. Now, crypto exchange Gemini seems to ride this optimism further.
Gemini to Offer 16.6 Million Shares for US IPO
According to a Form S-1 registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), crypto exchange Gemini will offer 16,666,667 shares of Class A common stock for its US IPO. Gemini has applied to list its Class A shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GEMI.
As part of the US IPO plan, Gemini would be selling 16.67 million shares at $17 to $19 each. Thus, it aims to raise up to $317 million if priced at the top of the range.
If successful, Gemini would become the third publicly traded digital asset exchange in the US, following Bullish (BLSH), which had a strong debut earlier this year, and Coinbase (COIN), the largest listed US crypto exchange. Speaking to Reuters, Bo Pei, analyst at US Tiger Securities, said:
“After Circle and Bullish’s successful IPOs, alongside a strong overall market and higher crypto prices, it does feel like an opportune time for crypto-related companies to consider going public.”
Top Banks to Act as Bookrunners for the Exchange
As per the official press release, top banking institutions like Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Citigroup will serve as lead bookrunners, joined by Morgan Stanley and Cantor as co-lead bookrunners.
So far, the crypto exchange hasn’t had a very good relationship with traditional banks like JPMorgan. Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, recently criticized JPMorgan, accusing the banking giant of blocking the exchange from its onboarding process following his public remarks against the bank’s new data policy.
According to its filing, Gemini reported a net loss of $282.5 million on $68.6 million in total revenue for the six months ending June 30. The firm provides a cryptocurrency exchange, a USD-backed stablecoin, crypto staking and custody services, as well as a credit card offering rewards in crypto.

(NASDAQ:MRVL) is a Must-Watch AI Stock on Wall Street. On August 29, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis lowered the price target on the stock to $122.00 (from $133.00) while maintaining an Outperform rating.
The rating update follows Marvell’s quarterly earnings report that met expectations and earnings per share guidance which was slightly above consensus for the October quarter.
Regardless, Marvell’s shares fell after hours because of its outlook for Custom AI revenue, which the firm estimates, will decline by 18% in the October quarter. This projection has surprised investors amid the strong Cloud CapEx environment.
A financial adviser looking over a portfolio of securities and stocks.
“While MRVL posted a JulQ meet and an OctQ EPS outlook that is $0.01 above consensus, its stock traded down by 11% in aftermarket trading after providing an outlook for its Custom AI revs to decline QQ in the OctQ, we estimate by 18%. The 18% decline is disappointing against the backdrop of the strongest Cloud CapEx environment on record, however, we think it’s worth considering that 1) MRVL’s custom compute business is nascent with a concentrated customer base, which can be lumpy, and 2) we model that custom IA business to revert back to the trendline in the Jan-26Q. We believe that the company has about 20 custom design wins, which will ramp over the next 1-to-2 years, and the company reiterated its plan to grow its DC share to 20% of a $94bn TAM in CY28.”
The firm believes that the stock may fall flat in the near-term as investors wait out to see how the custom chip business is doing. However, a P/E ratio of 21 seems attractive for an AI chip company with “a number of irons in the AI fire”.
Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) engages in the development and production of semiconductors, focusing heavily on data centers.
While we acknowledge the potential of MRVL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

According to a report from Capital Brief, the proposed cuts may involve approximately 2,000 roles in the retail sector, with an additional 3,000 positions targeted across other divisions, reported Bloomberg.
The final decision regarding the exact number of job losses has yet to be confirmed.
The bank has not provided a comment in response to inquiries regarding the potential layoffs.
Recently, Matos faced criticism after automated notifications about job cuts were sent to employees before they received personal communication, prompting an apology and a commitment to expedite the planned layoffs.
Matos has indicated that a key element of his strategy for revitalising the bank involves enhancing its corporate culture and risk management practices.
In light of increased capital requirements imposed by Australian banking regulators earlier this year, ANZ has engaged McKinsey & Co. to conduct a thorough review of its operations.
The Finance Sector Union has expressed concerns about the pace of the restructuring process undertaken by the Melbourne-based bank.
As per the latest annual report, ANZ employs approximately 42,000 individuals, with around 10,800 of those working within the retail division.
In June this year, ANZ Bank extended its contract with Knosys for the KnowledgeIQ (KIQ) enterprise solution for an additional year, valued at over $1.9m.
This extension serves as an interim measure while the bank negotiates a new three-year agreement, which is anticipated to include a transition to Knosys' cloud-based KIQ service.

In a filing Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company said it plans to offer roughly 34.3 million ordinary shares at a price ranging between $35 and $37, raising as much as $1.27 billion in an offering led by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley.
The IPO has been a long time coming. Klarna had been one of big winners of the early pandemic era’s online shopping boom, reportedly reaching a peak valuation of $45.6 billion in 2021, only to see that figure significantly reduced after stay-at-home restrictions were lifted and the world opened back up again.
At its current target price, the company would have a valuation of roughly $14 billion, Reuters reports.
Klarna intends to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol KLAR. No listing date was mentioned in the filing. A spokesperson for Klarna declined to comment.
High-profile tech IPOs are a thing this year
Earlier this year, Klarna reportedly put its IPO on hold in the wake of economic uncertainty brought on by President Trump’s tariff regime.
But since then, a number of well-known tech companies have gone public with marked success, including stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group, design software startup Figma, and crypto exchange Bullish.
Despite those and other listings making headlines over the last few months, the global tech IPO market has remained muted. Proceeds from tech IPOs generated $6.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025, compared to $34.9 billion for the same period in 2021, according to data from CB Insights.
Founded in 2005, Klarna said it generated revenue of $2.8 billion last year, eking out a net profit of $21 million. That’s compared to revenue of $2.3 billion and a net loss of $244 million the year before.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most important companies in the world, particularly during today’s AI race. The firm’s importance stems from the fact that it holds the lion’s share in the leading-edge chip fabrication market and is a key NVIDIA GPU supplier. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s shares have gained 14.5% year-to-date, and Cramer’s previous comments about the firm have called the stock a proxy for NVIDIA. This time, he discussed Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)’s balance sheet in the context of Intel receiving funds from the US government:
“TSM’s balance sheet is better than the US government’s. What a balance sheet. They don’t need it. Look if the government’s gonna, if there’s a Chinese problem where they are about to like shell Taiwan, they’re gonna need government help. Taiwan Semi did not need the money.”

“Dell reported a solid qtr with revenue of $29.8B, 2% above our $29.1B est as AI Server rev of $8.2B drove the upside relative to our $7.0B est.

",2025-09-03 23:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Few stocks capture the imagination of traders like Palantir (PLTR). After a staggering run — up nearly 400% in the past year — the artificial intelligence (AI) software stock has recently pulled back sharply, correcting by 20% from its mid-August highs.
Now, the big question on every investor’s mind is whether it’s too late to buy PLTR – or if this AI defense stock could still be a long-term 10-bagger.
More News from Barchart
In a recent live webinar on momentum trading, John Rowland, CMT, posed this exact question to Jim Van Meerten, the author of Barchart’s popular Chart of the Day newsletter and creator of Barchart’s go-to chart templates.
Key Technical Indicators to Watch on Palantir
Here’s how Jim & John analyzed the PLTR technical setup as of Aug. 13, right around the time shares were peaking:
-
RSI (Relative Strength Index): Palantir was firmly in overbought territory — though that’s not automatically a sell signal on its own.
-
Bollinger Bands: Palantir was riding outside the bands, but widening bands show strong continuation. However, it’s not necessarily a point where new money wants to come rushing in.
-
MACD: Supported the bullish momentum, though stretched.
Below is a look at PLTR as of today. The stock has corrected its overbought condition, based on the RSI around 39. Plus, shares are not only back within their Bollinger Bands, they’re also pinned below the central 20-day moving average. If this correction is similar to the one PLTR experienced in March, the current MACD reading suggests bearish momentum could be exhausted soon.
Jim’s Take on PLTR’s “10-Bagger Potential”
Jim makes an important point: 10-baggers don’t happen in a year; they’re built over three to five years. Despite the sharp rally and high-volatility pullback, Palantir may still have room to keep rising exponentially from here.
That doesn’t mean “blindly hold.” Instead:
-
Use stop-losses based on your personal risk tolerance (“your tolerance for pain”).
-
Watch for technical signals like a Bollinger Band reversion or a MACD reversal before adding exposure (or panic selling).
-
Recognize that after such a run, “new money may not want to chase” — but long-term holders can still benefit if PLTR keeps its trajectory.",f1bbd5454a64a4f5e64caabc00e57239,trafilatura,2233,0

On August 28, Craig-Hallum analyst Richard Shannon raised the price target on the stock to $245.00 (from $195.00) while maintaining a Buy rating.
Despite a stock dip post-earnings, Craig-Hallum cited robust AI demand trends for the AI chipmaker. The question, however, is whether this robust demand will sustain over the next few years.
According to the firm, agentic and reasoning systems may lead the robust demand trend to continue, requiring much more compute needs than previous generations. However, the slowing pace of foundational models such as GPT-5 may lead the trend to slow down.
The firm believes Nvidia remains well-positioned regardless.
“However, the strongest evidence is the capex spending plans by the four leading HSDCs, along with the position that the risk of underinvesting in AI is higher than overinvesting. Until this changes, we see a robust environment for NVDA in which to participate, which the company sees at $3-4T through decade’s end. We also see NVDA’s system-level offerings, particularly on the networking level (NVLink and NCCL are critical enablers), creating enormous performance differentiators that are unlikely to be approached any time soon. Thus, we maintain our positive view on medium-term Datacenter growth for NVDA at strong margins. With the stock trading in the low 30’s EV/EPS, and a view that earnings growth can continue at least in this range, we still think the stock should be owned. We maintain our Buy rating while increasing our price target to $245.”

The investor presented PepsiCo's board with a plan that it said could lift the shares by 50%.
PepsiCo (PEP) was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Tuesday morning when activist investor Elliott Investment Management announced it has taken a large stake in the soft drink and snack giant, and is pushing for changes to lift the stock price.
Elliott explained that it has acquired a $4 billion stake in Pepsi, and sent a presentation and letter to the board that set out a ""unique opportunity to re-accelerate growth and boost financial performance through greater focus, improved operations, strategic reinvestment and enhanced accountability.""
The investor argued that the company's recent performance ""has been marked by a series of strategic and operational challenges,"" adding that those have led to ""poor financial results, sharp stock-price underperformance and a highly dislocated valuation.""
Elliott said its proposals could boost the share price by ""more than 50%,"" and it wants to collaborate with management to ""return PepsiCo to its rightful place as a market-leading consumer packaged goods (CPG) powerhouse with superior results and impact.""

Wednesday's gain added $234 billion to the company's market cap. Apple closed 3.81% higher, adding $130 billion to its cap.
The U.S. Department of Justice had proposed a sort of breakup of Google, which included divesting its Chrome browser, in an antitrust case that began in September 2023.
While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the DOJ.
Google will not have to divest Chrome. The company can also still make payments to companies to preload products, but it cannot have exclusive contracts that condition payments or licensing.
That means Google will still be able to pay Apple the billions of dollars it does to be the default search engine on iPhones.
""This is a monster win for Cupertino and for Google its a home run ruling that removes a huge overhang on the stock,"" Daniel Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, said in a note on Tuesday referring to Apple's headquarters in California.
Google has been facing rising competition to its core search business from the likes of Perplexity and OpenAI. But the company has so far fended off challenges with its advertising business still growing.
Google has pinned its hopes of becoming a major artificial intelligence player on Gemini, its suite of AI models and the chatbot that goes by the same name.
""Following today's announcement, we are increasingly constructive in the longer-term durability of Google's Search business and are raising our estimates accordingly,"" Ives said, adding that he now has a new price target of $245 for Alphabet's stock.
The ruling also means Google will not have to divest the Android operating system that it develops.
Android is seen as a key tool for Google to increase the number of users for Gemini given that around 70% of smartphones globally run the operating system, giving the U.S. technology giant an existing base of users.

The granddaughter of L'Oréal's founder is $24 billion richer this year after the beauty stock surged.
-
Françoise Bettencourt Meyers has overtaken the likes of Mukesh Ambani to rank 18th on the rich list.
-
She's worth $98 billion, making her the second-richest woman after Walmart heiress Alice Walton.
A 72-year-old French beauty heiress has grown about $24 billion richer this year — and is now wealthier than Asia's richest person.
Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, the granddaughter of L'Oréal founder Eugène Schueller, has seen her net worth surge by 32% over the last eight months to around $98 billion, as of Monday.
That reflects a 17% jump in L'Oréal stock this year to nearly $400, which has boosted the value of Bettencourt Meyers' 35% stake in the parent company of Maybelline, Lancôme, and Redken.
Bettencourt Meyers was the sixth-biggest wealth gainer this year on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index at Friday's close, outpacing Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Pop Mart CEO Wang Ning, and SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, who were up between $17 billion and $21 billion since the start of January.
She ranked 18th on the rich list, one spot ahead of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, worth nearly $97 billion. But she was still three spots behind Alice Walton, the Walmart heiress with a $118 billion fortune who replaced her as the world's richest woman last year.
Bettencourt Meyers inherited her L'Oréal stake after her mother, Lilian, died in 2017 and became the first woman to achieve a $100 billion net worth in late 2023. However, a sharp decline in the cosmetics company's stock last year meant she started 2025 with less than $75 billion.
In April, she retired from L'Oréal's board of directors after 28 years. One of her two sons, Jean-Victor Meyers, succeeded her as vice chair.
L'Oréal shares have leapt this year after the company reported strong first-half growth with like-for-like revenues up 3%, and higher sales across its four product categories and in four out of five territories.
JPMorgan also upgraded the stock in late July from ""underweight"" to ""neutral,"" citing its brightening growth outlook.

There's a 90% chance the Federal Open Markets Committee will cut the federal funds target rate by 25 basis points from its current 4.25%-4.50% range, according to the CME FedWatch tool. A shift toward easier policy could spark renewed demand for leverage, pushing futures premiums higher and breathing life back into a trade that has remained subdued throughout 2025.
Invest in Gold
The basis trade involves buying bitcoin in the spot market or through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) while selling futures (or vice versa) to profit from the price difference. The goal is to capture the spread as it narrows toward expiry, while limiting exposure to bitcoin’s price volatility.
With fed funds still just above 4%, an 8% basis — the annualized return on the basis trade — may not look attractive until rate cuts begin to accelerate. Investors are likely to want lower rates to incentivize them to go into the basis trade rather than just holding cash.
On CME, bitcoin futures open interest has slumped from more than 212,000 BTC at the start of the year to around 130,000 BTC, according to Glassnode data. This is roughly the level seen when spot bitcoin ETFs launched in January 2024.
The annualized basis has stayed below 10% all year, according to Velo data, a striking contrast with the 20% seen toward the end of last year. The weakness reflects both market and macro forces: tighter funding conditions, ETF inflows slowing after 2024’s boom and a rotation of risk appetite out of bitcoin.
Bitcoin’s compressed trading range has reinforced the trend. Implied volatility, a gauge of expected price swings, is at just 40 after hitting a record low of 35 last week, Glassnode data shows. With volatility suppressed and institutional leverage light, futures premiums have remained capped.
If the Fed cuts rates, liquidity conditions could ease, boosting demand for risk assets. That in turn may lift CME futures open interest and revive the basis trade after a year of stagnation.",2b464dc6741c9e27b6d3e147a2f7f8e9,trafilatura,2197,0

Running from 2–4 September 2025, the event showcases innovations and trends shaping the Middle East and Africa (MEA) markets.
Industry growth and investment
The MEA region's paper and pulp industry reached a market value of approximately $22.8 billion in 2023, reflecting a 9% increase from 2021.
With a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5% from 2024 to 2031, the sector is experiencing significant expansion, driven by rising consumer demand and increased investments.
Industry players have committed over $2 billion in recent years to meet this demand and embrace sustainability across the value chain.
Sustainability and regulatory support
Governments in the MEA region are actively supporting sustainability initiatives through national green economy programmes and legislation aimed at reducing single-use plastics.
This regulatory environment is encouraging businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices and technologies, aligning with the growing consumer preference for environmentally responsible products.
Diverse industry sectors represented
Paper Arabia 2025 brings together a wide array of sectors within the paper industry, including food and beverage packaging, personal care and cosmetics, household products, and healthcare and pharmaceuticals.
The exhibition serves as a comprehensive platform for industry stakeholders to explore new technologies, forge business partnerships, and gain insights into market trends and innovations.

The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was down 8 basis points to 4.891%. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury was more than 7 basis points lower at 4.205%. One basis point equals 0.01% and prices move inversely to yields.
The move lower in yields comes after the Labor Department's closely watched Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey revealed that available positions in July came in at 7.18 million, below the 7.4 million that economists polled by Dow Jones had forecast.
Earlier Wednesday, tariff uncertainty and threats to the Federal Reserve's independence had led the 30-year yield to briefly top the 5% mark overnight before retreating. The long-bond yield was last at 5% in July.
U.S. bond yields spiked on Tuesday as traders reacted to a Friday ruling from the federal appeals court that most of President Donald Trump's new tariffs on imports are illegal. The ruling could force Washington to refund billions of dollars raised from the levies.
""Concerns around Fed independence also contributed to the bond market moves,"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said in a note on Wednesday morning.
Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook has been making headlines in recent days as she attempts to have a judge temporarily block Trump from firing her from her position. On Tuesday, her lawyer hit back at the president's reasoning for dismissing her, while almost 600 economists signed an open letter warning that her potential firing threatened the Fed's independence from government.
Investors are worried that Trump's attempted takeover of the Fed could lower short-term rates, but raise longer rates as investors worry about the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility.
Outside of the United States, global government bonds sold off as jitters around government deficits and interest rates rippled through markets.
Looming over the bond market is Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show the unemployment rate ticking higher to 4.3% and 75,000 jobs created for August, according to economists polled by Dow Jones.

Mineralys surged to a new all-time high on Tuesday, as investors gobbled up shares after one of its counterparts posted positive trial results for its aldosterone synthase inhibitor (ASI), with optimism spilling over to its stock.
At intra-day trading, Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MLYS) surged by as high as 95 percent to hit its highest 52-week price of $30.14, before paring gains to end the day just up by 86.43 percent at $28.86 apiece.

Over the weekend, AstraZeneca said that its experimental drug called Baxdrostat showed positive results for treating patients with hard-to-control high blood pressure.
During the phase 3 trial, AstraZeneca said that the drug candidate significantly dropped enrolled patients’ systolic blood pressure by 15 mmHg on average, as compared with the placebo, which lowered blood pressure by 9-10 mmHg.
The results spilled over to Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MLYS), which is also underway with its own study of its ASI called Lorundrostat.
In another development, Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:MLYS) commenced on the same day a $175 million follow-on offering to raise funds for the clinical development, research and development, manufacturing, and pre-commercialization activities of Lorundrostat.
According to the company, it also granted a 30-day option to its underwriters to purchase an additional $26.25 million of its common shares at the public offering price.

The firm said that Alibaba may lose more money than previously anticipated in its quick commerce business in the September quarter. However, they believe these losses will halve into the December quarter as the company shifts its focus to high quality users, reduce subsidies, and improve rider efficiency.
The firm revised its profit forecasts due to bigger quick commerce losses, which was partly offset by international ecommerce. It also lifted its SOTP-based 12-month target prices to US$163/HK$158 (from US$147/HK$142) on higher cloud valuation and lowered SOTP discount.

-
Whales accumulated about 340M XRP (~$960M) over the last two weeks. This offsets broader selling pressure and shows longer-horizon conviction.
-
September is often a weak month for crypto. Macro uncertainty around central bank policy and growth outlook continues to pressure risk assets.
-
On-chain and trading activity stayed elevated. Early in the session volumes ran well above normal, then cooled as the day progressed. The pattern matches institutional-led buying in the open and retail-driven trading into the close.
Price Action
-
Window: Sept. 1, 14:00 → Sept. 2, 13:00 (24h).
-
Range: $2.70–$2.83, about a 4% swing. Price tagged $2.71 around 21:00 before rebounding to highs near $2.83.
-
Volume: Surged to 101.36M and 93.66M in bursts, compared with a 24h average of 65.49M. Weekly pace was about 19% higher than average.
-
Levels: A base formed at $2.70–$2.72. Repeated rejection near $2.83 capped the upside. The session ended consolidating just under resistance.
Technical Analysis
-
Support: $2.70–$2.72 with volume-backed demand. Secondary levels at $2.65 and $2.50 if stress builds.
-
Resistance: $2.83 near term. Above that, $3.00 psychological and $3.30 structural breakout levels.
-
Momentum: RSI in the mid-50s, showing neutral-to-bullish conditions.
-
MACD: Histogram is converging toward a bullish crossover. This would confirm constructive momentum if volumes remain high.
-
Patterns: A symmetrical triangle is forming under $3.00. A sustained move above $3.30 could target $4.00 and beyond. Intraday higher lows point to continued accumulation.
-
Flows: Early heavy prints suggest institutional buying. Later fades show retail profit-taking under resistance.
What Traders Are Watching
-
A breakout above $2.83 and then $3.00. A clean close through $3.30 is needed for upside extension.
-
Whether $2.70–$2.72 support holds. A close below this range shifts focus to $2.50.
-
Confirmation from RSI moving above 60 with a MACD cross on rising volume.
-

This scam has been successful in draining the bank accounts of a significant number of Americans, especially those approaching their retirement years.
The “Phantom Hacker” scam operates in three distinct phases, each meticulously designed to manipulate victims into granting access to their financial assets. The FBI stated in a news release that victims often lose their entire banking, savings, retirement, or investment accounts under the pretense of ‘protecting' their assets.

The scammers exploit the personal interests of the victims, usually obtained from their social media posts. Aaron Rose, security architect manager at cybersecurity firm Check Point Software, told Nexstar, “Criminals use personal interests to make their criminal actions appear authentic which decreases the chances of being caught.”
Since 2024, this scam has been used to siphon off over $1 billion in funds, with the majority of victims being at least 60 years old, as per FBI data. The scam involves complex operations that include multiple impersonators, spoofed phone numbers, and coordinated follow-ups.

In the scam, the fraudsters impersonate tech support personnel from a legitimate company, contact the victim, and instruct them to download a program that grants them access to the victim's computer. The scammer then suggests the victim open financial accounts to look for unauthorized charges, reports the outlet.
The next phase begins when another scammer, posing as an employee of a well-known financial institution, calls the victim to inform them that their account has been hacked. The scammer then assists in transferring funds to a third-party such as the Federal Reserve or a U.S. government agency.",1e3c993bcba35c31bb1963444539ec67,trafilatura,2048,0

""Our results are absolutely fantastic and our guidance is also, you know, is always appropriately conservative,"" Benioff said.
The enterprise software company posted its quarterly results Wednesday after close. Although the company shared disappointing guidance, it managed to beat estimates for earnings and revenue. The stock dipped more than 5% in extended trading.
Salesforce has lagged behind its peers this year as investors worry about the company's revenue growth, which has stalled in the single digits since the middle of last year, CNBC reported. The stock is down over 23% year-to-date.
Benioff said Salesforce's customers are pleased with its artificial intelligence agent product, which he said is not just ""repackaged ChatGPT,"" but technology that is ""giving them the ability to fundamentally transform their business.""
Salesforce has also reshaped its own business with AI agents, according to Benioff. He said the company has ""reduced the number of heads we have in service and support because we have supplemented that with agents.""
Benioff said Salesforce has seen success with its biggest customer, the U.S. government. He said the outfit does business with the Department of Defense and managed to beat out Palantir in a deal with the the army.
""We had a tremendous success against Palantir, because, by the way, our prices are just so much lower,"" Benioff said. ""We're offering a very competitive product as a much lower cost,"" he continued.

-
Campbell's exceeded earnings estimates as consumers do more cooking at home.
-
The maker of soups and sauces got a boost from higher prices.
-
Campbell's said its product portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from consumers being cautious about their spending on food.
More people are cooking at home. That's been good for Campbell's bottom line.
The Campbell's Co. (CPB) CEO Mick Beekhuizen said in prepared remarks Wednesday that over the past few quarters, the company has seen that ""consumers remain cautious and intentional with their spending,"" and that they ""continue to seek value in a variety of ways, such as cooking at home—a behavior that fuels growth in our Meals & Beverages business.""
Campbell's Co. (CPB) shares advanced more than 5% in recent trading as the soup and sauces maker beat profit forecasts as more people bought food to cook at home.
The company posted fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.62, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $0.57. Sales rose 1% year-over-year to $2.32 billion, basically in line with forecasts.
Campbell’s benefited from a 2% increase in prices, helping to offset a 4% decline in volume/mix.
Meals & Beverages unit sales were comparable to a year ago, although organic sales were down 3%, mainly because of lower demand for its Rao's pasta sauces and U.S. soup. Snacks division sales gained 2%, but organic sales also fell, losing 2% on ""declines in third-party partner and contract brands and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels.""
The company explained that consumers ""continue to be increasingly deliberate in their food choices with a focus on premiumization, flavor exploration, health and wellness and cooking at home."" It noted that because of that, Campbell’s is ""well positioned to capitalize on these trends.""
Despite today's gains, Campbell's shares have lost more than 20% of their value this year.

QXO Inc. bounced back by 4.97 percent on Tuesday to close at $21.13 apiece as investors cheered an investment firm’s bullish rating and higher price target on expectations that it could grow into a $50-billion revenue company.
In a market note, Morgan Stanley assigned an “overweight” rating and a price target of $35 on shares of QXO, Inc. (NYSE:QXO), saying that the latter, as an emerging building products distributor, could bolster its way beyond $50 billion in terms of revenues amid rosy prospects for the US industrial distribution sector, thanks to a highly fragmented industry where no player has a dominant market share.
According to Morgan Stanley, the industrial distribution sector is a highly fragmented industry where no player currently holds a significant market share. With many small players incapable of investing in technology-driven solutions, this could spark opportunities for larger players such as QXO, Inc. (NYSE:QXO) to scale up and become more efficient.
“Investments in efficiency not only lower the distributor’s cost to serve but these solutions also improve customer profitability which then pushes more wallet share back to said distributor—this is the flywheel,” it said.
In other developments, QXO, Inc. (NYSE:QXO) could also benefit from a widely expected interest rate cut by making loans for home-buying much cheaper.

Choice Hotels International has tapped McDonald’s executive Joshua Sloser as chief commercial officer, the company announced Tuesday.
In his new role, Sloser is tasked with developing and implementing Choice’s commercial strategy as well as overseeing the company’s digital channels, revenue management, third-party distribution and customer service. Sloser will report directly to Choice President and CEO Patrick Pacious.
Sloser joins Choice from McDonald’s, where he served as global senior vice president of customer and commercial innovation. At the fast food giant, Sloser oversaw food concepts, technology and operational processes across 40,000 restaurants worldwide, per Choice.
Prior to his stint at McDonald's, Sloser spent nearly a decade at Choice competitor Hilton, holding multiple executive roles including vice president of digital product and innovation, according to his LinkedIn.
Sloser comes aboard as Choice capitalizes on “strong international momentum,” Pacious said in a statement. During the company’s second-quarter earnings, Choice announced plans to accelerate growth in Canada, specifically, through its July acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Choice Hotels Canada.
“As we accelerate our global expansion and deepen customer engagement, Joshua’s proven ability to drive innovation, lead cross-functional teams, and deliver measurable commercial outcomes will be instrumental,” Pacious said.
Sloser fills a spot left vacant by Choice’s former chief commercial officer, Robert McDowell, who departed in January to pursue other opportunities, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Other hospitality companies to recently name new chief commercial officers include Marriott International, Remington Hospitality and Aimbridge Hospitality. Several notable hospitality executive moves happened in the second quarter.",da325bbc41f1c669eee5374b3725a4c1,trafilatura,2021,0

OnePay Wireless will be available starting Wednesday in the OnePay app, according to Gigs, the mobile services startup that partnered with the company.
The plan costs $35 a month for unlimited 5G data, talk and text on the AT&T network, Gigs said. The plans are activated in-app with a few clicks and don't require credit checks or activation fees, the startup said.
OnePay, created by Walmart in 2021 alongside venture firm Ribbit Capital, has methodically built out its offerings in a bid to become an American super app akin to overseas offerings like WeChat or Alipay. OnePay services include credit and debit cards, high-yield savings accounts, buy now, pay later loans, and a digital wallet with peer-to-peer payments.
The OnePay-Gigs partnership is the latest example of a fintech firm adding wireless connectivity to its product set; Klarna and Nubank have made similar announcements.
OnePay confirmed the launch and declined to comment further.
Gigs CEO Hermann Frank said that embedding wireless plans into fintech services can lower AT&T's customer acquisition costs — savings which can be shared with end users.
""The average consumer largely overpays for their phone bill,"" Frank said. ""We can now offer a product at a price point that is about half what the typical consumer pays right now, with all the modern features that you require.""

Following strong Q2 earnings, analysts are reiterating their Buy rating on the stock.
UWM Holdings Corporation (NYSE:UWMC) is the publicly traded indirect parent of United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), which is one of the largest wholesale mortgage lenders in the U.S. The Michigan-based company, founded in 1986, offers a range of residential mortgage loans through a network of independent mortgage brokers.
On August 7, 2025, the company reported its second-quarter earnings, highlighting $39.7 billion of production, a 20% increase from the previous year’s Q2. With it, the company marks its best quarter since 2021. It also claimed heavy investment in AI technology, such as their AI-based underwriting system BOLT, which is used for improving loan processing efficiency. The positive outlook for the company is also notably influenced by the company’s intention to bring service in-house, which is expected to have a positive impact on its financials from 2026 onwards.
Following these developments, various analysts, including Barclays and BTIG, reiterated their Buy rating on the stock, signaling strong confidence in its growth prospects. However, the stock is expected to face a fall in price, with a 1-year median target set at -10.63%.
With shares priced at $5.58 as of August 28, 2025, UWM Holdings Corporation (NYSE:UWMC) provides investors a 7.17% yield, balancing affordability with reliable income.

In intra-day trading, IREN Ltd. (NASDAQ:IREN) soared to its highest 52-week record of $29.85 before paring gains to end the day just up by 9.93 percent at $29.11 apiece.
Last week, IREN Ltd. (NASDAQ:IREN) said it was recently named a Preferred Partner by technology giant Nvidia Corp., marking a vote of confidence among investors.

Total revenues expanded by 167.6 percent to $501 million from $187.2 million year-on-year, with Bitcoin mining contributing the largest chunk, at $484.6 million, or 163 percent higher than the $184.1 million a year ago.
Revenues from AI cloud services, on the other hand, surged by 429 percent to $16.4 million from $3.1 million in the same comparable period.

With a strong portfolio spanning conventional and unconventional plays, oil sands, and LNG developments, the company operates across North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.
Companies valued at more than $10 billion are generally considered “large-cap” stocks, and ConocoPhillips fits this criterion perfectly. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, ConocoPhillips is recognized as the world’s largest independent exploration and production company by proved reserves and production.

However, shares of ConocoPhillips have dipped 14.5% from its 52-week high of $116.08. Over the past three months, the stock has risen 14.5%, which outpaced the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLE) increase of 8.6% during the same period.
In the long term, COP stock is up marginally on a YTD basis, lagging behind XLE’s 4.7% gain. Moreover, shares of the energy company have decreased 12.8% over the past 52 weeks, compared to XLE’s 1.7% decline over the same time frame.
COP stock has been trading mostly below its 200-day moving average since last year. Nevertheless, the stock has climbed above its 50-day moving average since early June.
Despite reporting Q2 2025 stronger-than-expected adjusted EPS of $1.42, ConocoPhillips shares fell marginally on Aug. 7 as revenue of $14.7 billion came in below forecasts. Investors were also cautious as the company’s realized prices dropped 19% year-over-year to $45.77 per BOE, reflecting weaker crude markets despite higher production. Additionally, guidance for Q3 output of 2.33 MMBOED - 2.37 MMBOED signaled a sequential dip from Q2’s 2.39 MMBOED, tempering the upbeat earnings surprise.

At intra-day trading, Air Lease Corp. (NYSE:AL) rallied to as high as $64.30 before paring gains to end the day just up by 6.76 percent at $64.28 apiece.
This followed news that it signed a definitive agreement with a new Ireland-based holding company for the sale of its outstanding and issued shares.

Under the terms, each shareholder holding each Class A common share will be able to receive $65 in cash payment, marking a 7-percent premium over the company’s closing price of $60.66 on August 28, 2025; a 14-percent premium over the volume weighted average price (VWAP) during the 30-day period ending August 29; and 31 percent over the VWAP over the last 12 months.
The total, $28.2 billion, included debt obligations to be assumed or refinanced net of cash. Excluding the latter, the acquisition price would amount to $7.4 billion.
Air Lease Corp. (NYSE:AL) said it expected to close the transaction by the first half of 2026.

The transaction involved the sale of 175 million pre-funded warrants at $1 each. More than 80 investors participated, including big-name digital asset firms Pantera, GSR and FalconX. Proceeds will be used to acquire DOGE for CleanCore’s treasury and support corporate operations.
The offering is scheduled to close September 4, pending regulatory approvals.
The company's stock dropped around 60% following the news.
The initiative to make DOGE the firm's primary treasury reserve asset was also backed by the Dogecoin Foundation and House of Doge, the foundation's corporate arm, the press release said.
With the deal, the firm also announced to name Alex Spiro, partner at the New York office of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan who represented clients including Elon Musk, as chairman of the board effective immediately, confirming a Fortune report last week. Dogecoin Foundation director Timothy Stebbing joined the board, while Marco Margiotta, CEO of House of Doge, will take on the role of chief investment officer. The House of Doge and digital asset investment manager 21Shares will advise CleanCore on treasury management.
CleanCore is the latest entrant to an increasingly crowded field of public firms pivoting to establish cryptocurrency treasuries. These firms raise funds on capital markets to accumulate digital assets like bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and (SOL). Some firms are moving out to risk curve to incorporate smaller, more volatile altcoins.
The company said it aims to anchor DOGE as a legitimate asset for payments and tokenization, moving beyond its meme origins. CleanCore also said it may pursue staking-like yield features with exchanges to generate returns on its holdings.

The token initially slipped from $0.22 down to support at $0.21, weighed by a surge in liquidation volumes that spiked above 79 million. However, as selling pressure subsided, HBAR mounted a recovery, closing the session back near the $0.22 level.
Market activity suggested that bearish momentum lost steam once the $0.21 level was tested, with declining volumes on the rebound signaling a potential shift toward sustained upward momentum.
The trading action underscores a near-term technical structure where resilience at key support levels has kept bullish prospects intact.
The emphasis on real-world applications is positioning Hedera and other enterprise-focused blockchains at the forefront of investor attention. Alongside Hedera, projects such as Kaspa and Remittix are building momentum by targeting scalability and cross-border payments, respectively.
With payments innovation resurging as a driver of crypto adoption, Hedera’s corporate alliances and technological architecture put it in a strong position to benefit from the market’s pivot toward utility-driven blockchain infrastructure.

Fintech firm Klarna and its backers are raising as much as $1.27 billion from an initial public offering, as the buy now, pay later (BNPL) company makes a renewed attempt to go public in New York.
Klarna paused its planned IPO days after President Donald Trump's sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement disrupted markets in early April. It had the previous month filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, applying to list on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol ""KLAR.""
The Swedish fintech said on Tuesday it was aiming to price the sale of a total of 34.3 million shares at between $35 and $37 each.
The IPO is coming to a market that has been booming, with shares of design software platform Figma (FIG) more than tripling on its debut at the end of July and shares of Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH) soaring on their debut last month. U.S. IPO volumes so far this year have reached $41.58 billion, according to Dealogic data, the highest since the same period in 2021, when it hit a record $229.51 billion.
Still, Klarna's valuations have dropped in recent years. Klarna said it was valued at $6.7 billion in July 2022, down sharply from $45.6 billion barely a year earlier, and is now worth between $12.5 billion and $14 billion, according to the Financial Times.

As companies move to focus on sustainability in their supply chains amid disruptions, only 12% of nearly 700 of the world’s largest companies have at least one change goal focused on people, according to a study released last week by the World Resources Institute.
Additionally, only 3% have goals related to investing in worker skills, the study said.
The people-centered goals mentioned by WRI vary widely, from better safety training to upskilling programs focused on career development.
“Right now, most large companies are overlooking the needs of the people essential to transforming their supply chains,” Eliot Metzger, WRI’s director of sustainable business and innovation, said in a statement. “This not only undermines companies’ sustainability targets but also the stability of their supply chains and their reputation.”
People are at the core of what changes need to be made for broader sustainability, WRI emphasized. “Unless large companies recognize and address what those suppliers and their workers need, they will struggle to make the changes necessary for cleaner, more resilient supply chains.”
This pattern is reflected in HR concerns more broadly, according to HR Dive’s Identity of HR survey. While organizations struggle to find people with the right skills, training keeps moving lower and lower on the priority list — a particular problem for employers who can’t afford to “buy” such talent in an extremely competitive market.

According to Kevin O’Leary, even middle-class Americans can retire with over $1 million — if they follow one key strategy.

Here’s the wealth-building tip O’Leary gives to anyone who wants to retire with a sizable nest egg.
Start Early and Stay Disciplined
The earlier you start saving for retirement, the easier it will be to reach your retirement savings goals — even if you earn a middle-class salary.
“If you start now and you’re 26 or 27 years old, and you only make the average salary your whole life, you’ll still retire with close to $1.5 million in an investment account that you can live off,” O’Leary told GOBankingRates while discussing his partnership with HelloPrenup, an online prenuptial agreement platform.
The key? Save 15% of your income consistently and invest it wisely.
“That’s the discipline,” O’Leary said. “That is what it’s all about.”

Track Your Progress To Stay Motivated
O’Leary also recommended tracking your net worth regularly to stay motivated.
“You can see your net worth going up over time,” he said. “You say, ‘Wow, last week I made X dollars.’ The market goes up and down, but over time, it continues to grow.”
Building this habit early, he said, makes it easier to stick with your plan long-term. Even if you’re starting later in life, it’s never too late to build wealth — but the earlier you start, the more time your money has to grow.

(NASDAQ:ADBE) is a Must-Watch AI Stocks on Wall Street. On September 1, Rothschild Redburn analyst Omar Sheikh reiterated a Sell rating on the stock with a $280.00 price target.
The firm said that it spent the last few days testing the released preview of Google’s Nano Banana image editing model. Their takeaway is that it has the potential to seriously challenge Adobe Photoshop, impacting Adobe’s ability to gain new customers and raise prices.
Both Nano Banana and Runway’s Aleph have been leveraging generative AI for their tools, demonstrating the fast pace of improvement. Newer and more disruptive models could emerge within months, putting a question mark on Adobe’s competitive moat.
“We spent the last few days testing the recently released preview of Google’s Nano Banana image editing model. We believe it will disrupt Photoshop, one of Adobe’s most widely-used applications, adding to ongoing pressure on the company’s seat growth and pricing power. Nano Banana and Runway’s Aleph demonstrate the leap forward in the performance of genAI tools in recent months, and the pace of improvement is a key concern: image and video generation models with fully editable outputs look increasingly likely to emerge within months, which we argue will call into question the durability of Adobe’s moat. We reiterate our Sell rating.”

Media, entertainment, and telecommunications giant Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)’s shares have lost 9.2% year-to-date as the firm continues to struggle in the hot broadband market. Two major catalysts for the stock this year have been the firm’s and peer Charter Communications’ earnings. Both these results indicated that the due continued to lose broadband consumers. Cramer has previously wondered whether Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) would have been better off had it focused on cybersecurity instead. Here are his latest thoughts about the firm:
” [inaudible] a piece this morning about how Comcast had a positive catalyst watch. Yeah they did this post with a positive catalyst watch. Yeah with a 39 dollar price target.

Previously, Cramer discussed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)’s valuation:
“Okay so, I’m just gonna go there. Comcast sells 7.8 time forward earnings. So you have to go very far to find companies with that low multiple. Their multiple is lower than Ford Motor, okay. Their multiple is, only GM, that I have found is a lower multiple. So what do you make of that?”

The company–a merger deal between energy infrastructure firm Hut 8 and the Trump-brothers American Data Centers–went live on public markets following the completion of its stock-for-stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining.
ABTC climbed over 80% in early morning hours, leading to multiple trading halts on the stock, per Nasdaq.

American Bitcoin aims to be an institutional-grade bitcoin accumulation platform through both purchases of bitcoin and its bitcoin mining business. The firm bought 1,726 bitcoin in Q2 2025 after raising $215 million in private placements.
“Today, American Bitcoin becomes a premier public vehicle for investors seeking scalable, singular exposure to the defining asset class of our time,” said Eric Trump, Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, in the company release.
Through its partnership with Hut 8 (HUT), ABTC hosts ASICs previously owned by Hut 8 at Hut 8 facilities. As of Q2’s end, American Bitcoin had 9.3 EH/s online, with another ~14-15 EH/s soon to come from a purchase option for direct-to-chip liquid-cooled, server-rack Antminers that Bitmain deployed with Hut 8 at its Vega, Texas site. American Bitcoin says that splitting infrastructure, operations, and hardware ownership drives SG&A efficiency and leaves more capital for the company’s bitcoin accumulation.

Ninety years after its debut in York, England, KitKat is Nestlé’s top confectionery brand by both revenue and brand value, with more than 5 billion bars sold annually globally. For operators, global scale matters: KitKat is a brand that consumers already trust, making it a strong fit for vending machines and micro markets.
The classic four-finger bar has evolved to include more than 300 flavor variations, including matcha, sake and wasabi. KitKat has also collaborated with popular Nestlé brands such as Nescafé to create the KitKat Nescafé Mocha. In addition, the brand has introduced alternative formats such as ice cream, spreads, and a recently launched KitKat tablet — a sharing-sized bar — to the European market, continuing to innovate around consumer snacking moments.
Why convenience services operators should care about KitKat:
- High turnover brand: KitKat’s broad appeal supports reliable sell-through in vending and micro markets
- Flexible formats: From single bars to shareable formats, KitKat’s product mix allows operators to stock items for different dayparts and price points.
- Marketing muscle: Nestlé’s ongoing investment in the brand ensures consumer demand stays strong.
“Effective marketing with a consistent message is crucial for continuously winning over consumers across geographies,” said Rouven Lochmüller, KitKat global brand manager, in a release. “Global campaigns such as the recently launched ‘Break Better’ campaign, which encourages people to have better breaks, are another example of how the ‘have a break’ positioning has remained the cornerstone of the brand, even as it adapts to present-day culture.”",8d48d69084d61f3c07f4e060e978cd44,trafilatura,1706,0

The company and some of its shareholders are together selling approximately 34.3 million shares between $35 and $37 each, the company said in an update to its registration statement on Tuesday. Klarna would receive proceeds from about 5.6 million shares, while its shareholders are offloading nearly 29 million shares.
The company plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “KLAR.”
Klarna has long been expected to go public thanks to the massive success of its BNPL lending model in the wake of the post-pandemic boom: Six years after launching in the U.S., the company hit a valuation of more than $45 billion in 2021. However, the company has been putting off its IPO plans as the market turned at the end of the ZIRP era, its price tag declining by 85% to $6.5 billion when the 2021 venture capital valuation bubble burst.
Still, Klarna’s been growing well: Its revenue rose 54% to $823 million in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, thanks to a 14% increase in its gross merchandise value to $6.9 billion. The company’s bottom line is still in the red with net loss coming in at $53 million, though that’s 42% less than its net loss of $92 million a year earlier.

C3 AI reported $70.3 million in revenue for the quarter, down from $87.2 million during the same period last year. The company's GAAP net loss widened to an 86-cent loss from a 50-cent loss a year ago.
Ehikian is a long-time tech executive who built two companies that were both acquired by Salesforce, C3 AI said. C3 AI said Ehikian assumed the new role on Sept. 1.
C3 AI kicked off a search for a new chief executive in July after its former CEO, Thomas Siebel revealed that he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease earlier this year that resulted in ""significant visual impairment.""
""C3 AI is one of the most important companies in the AI landscape and enterprise software, with a platform and applications that are unmatched,"" Ehikian said. ""I am confident that we will be able to capture an increasing share of the immense market opportunity in Enterprise AI.""
The company has had a rocky few months since Siebel's diagnosis.
Shares plunged in August after C3 AI announced disappointing preliminary financial results and a restructuring of its global sales and services organization.
Siebel said in an August statement that sales results during the quarter were ""completely unacceptable."" He attributed the performance to the ""disruptive effect"" of the reorganization, as well as his ongoing health issues.",8c25adba82ffef732a8814c2d4397080,trafilatura,1522,0

Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is a distressed alcoholic beverages stock whose shares have lost 27% year-to-date as they struggle to recover from their 17% fall in January after the firm’s fiscal third quarter earnings. Cramer has discussed the stock several times this year as he continues to remain skeptical of the beer industry. This time, he and co-host David Faber discussed Bank of America downgrading Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) to Underperform:
“Okay, look, here’s a stock that’s been horrendous, I don’t know if we have a chart. . .oh, look at that. It’s been terrible, right here and I’m not saying they’re wrong. Bank of America goes to a Sell because they think numbers are gonna come down again. So we got to go over this.
While we acknowledge the potential of STZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s shares have gained 20% year-to-date, primarily on the back of a 26% jump in August. The stock has performed well recently as investors become slightly more certain about the firm’s future after the Trump administration’s decision to convert $8.9 billion of the firm’s CHIPS Act grants into equity. Cramer discussed the investment:

The overall market capitalization of tokenized gold topped $2.57 billion, CoinGecko data shows, as the two leading offerings, Tether's XAUT and Paxos' PAXG tokens, saw sizable inflows recently. Both tokens's are designed to track the price of gold and are backed by physical bars held in vaults.
XAUT (XAUT), issued by the firm that's behind the USDT stablecoin, saw a $437 million jump in its supply to a record $1.3 billion, per CoinGecko. Tether's Treasury minted 129,000 tokens in early August on the Ethereum network, blockchain data by Etherscan shows.
PAXG (PAXG), the gold-backed token of U.S.-based stablecoin firm Paxos, swelled to a record market size of $983 million, DefiLlama data shows. That's been fueled by $141.5 million net inflows into the token since June.
Gold currently traded at around $3,470, just shy of the April 22 peak hit amidst the tariff tantrum.
The precious metal, which is widely considered as a safe haven asset during times of uncertainty, has been resurging lately, driven by a steepening U.S. Treasury yield curve.

Cramer’s remarks about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) were interesting since they were made before the firm’s second-quarter earnings release. The shares have lost 4% since the earnings, as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s data center revenue missed analyst estimates and uncertainty persisted about the China GPU sales. However, ahead of the earnings, Cramer warned that the China sales debate was noise and investors should focus on GPU profitability for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s customers instead:

Last week's buys were made for just under $450 million, or an average cost of $110,981 each. They were funded mostly through sales of common stock, with sales of the company's various preferred shares making up the rest.
The common stock sales have been somewhat controversial of late as Saylor and team not long ago promised to never issue shares when the stock's mNAV — the ratio of the stock valuation compared to value of bitcoin holdings — fell below 2.5x.
The rough ride for the stock of late though, has brought the mNAV to the 1.5x area. With apparently just modest demand for preferred stock and none for convertible debt, the company — if it wanted to continue to make sizable bitcoin purchases — had little choice but to scrap the mNAV 2.5x promise.
The problem with sales of common stock at such a modest premium to mNAV, say the naysayers, is that the issuance risks being dilutive to existing shareholders.
The company's bitcoin holdings are worth just under $70 billion at bitcoin's current price of $109,400.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter.
Claire’s has drastically scaled back its store closure plans, according to revised documents filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware last week. The tween accessories retailer now expects to shutter 291 locations, including namesake and Icing stores, down from at least 700 announced last month.
The company was also mulling liquidation, which would have entailed shuttering its entire 1,500-store fleet in North America. The about-face follows an offer last month from private equity firm Ames Watson to acquire the mall-based chain for $140 million, including $104 million in cash. That deal awaits court approval and has yet to close.
Claire’s filed for bankruptcy in early August, its second Chapter 11 filing in less than a decade. At that time, it seemed unlikely that the company would find a buyer.
Tariffs appear to have been the final straw for a retailer already battling a surge in competition, a mound of debt and lingering macroeconomic and supply chain effects from the pandemic.

Gilead said on Wednesday its investments through 2030 will create more than 3,000 direct and indirect jobs, and $43 billion in value to the U.S. economy.

Invest in Gold
The system is designed to make gold easier to trade and use, including as collateral in financial markets and allow easy and secure transfer of gold interests between parties.
Currently, gold is traded either as allocated gold, gold which involves direct ownership of specific physical bars but is operationally complex, or unallocated gold, which has higher liquidity and lower costs but may expose investors to the credit risk of the institution where the account is held.
The move follows industry consultations and builds on recent reviews by the Financial Markets Standards Board.
