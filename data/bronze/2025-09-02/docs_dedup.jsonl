Email pr@fool.com\nFull Conference Call Transcript\nJK Symancyk: Thanks, Rob. And good morning, everyone. Before I get into prepared remarks, I'd like to quickly thank our team. Our outperformance again this quarter is a reflection of your commitment to the customer as we continue in the early stages of our grow brand love strategy. Thank you for your hard work in driving consistent performance this year, and let's continue the momentum into the holiday season. There are three key takeaways I'd like to leave you with today. First, we delivered another quarter of positive same-store sales and earnings ahead of our expectations. And including August, we've delivered eight consecutive months of positive comps.\nSecond, we continue to make early progress on our grow brand love strategy through distinct merchandise, enhanced marketing, and unique experiences. As well as attracting key leaders to advance our growth agenda. And third, we are fully prepared and well-positioned for holiday. As we enter our most critical season with momentum, and clear strategic focus. Turning to the quarter, we delivered same-store sales of 2%, ahead of our expectations driven by our early prioritization of the three largest brands: Kay, Zales, and Jared. Which delivered a combined same-store sales growth of approximately 5% in back-to-back quarters. At the category level, our early efforts to focus on fashion drove a 2% comp growth.\nAdditionally, services continue to deliver, posting a high single-digit comp growth this quarter. Fashion is important to us both due to the size of the category as well as building customer relevance across categories. We are focused on delivering fashion pieces across key price points to reach more customers, including an expanded assortment of lab-grown diamonds, or LGD. Fashion pieces. LGD fashion accelerated versus the prior quarter growing to approximately 14% penetration of fashion sales. This continued momentum on strategic imperatives bolsters our confidence for the holiday season this year, which I'll touch more on shortly. Before that, I'd like to update our progress on grow brand love go-to-market strategy, via three key levers: Merchandise, marketing, and customer experience.\nWithin merchandise, we've developed distinct assortments that include new collections. At Jared, our assortment work is furthest along in its differentiation. Highlighted by collections like Unspoken and Shy Creation. We are expanding our unspoken line ahead of holiday based on strong customer response to the initial assortment. This collection reflects the rarity and uniqueness of natural center stone diamond pieces at a wide range of price points. Shy Creation, another collection we're expanding this holiday, elevates the trend of layering or stacking multiple pieces to create a bigger and more styled look.\nAt Kay, our sentimental gifting brand, we're introducing more milestone gifting pieces at key price points as well as items at a price that are designed to serve value-oriented customers without relying on promotions. At Zales, we're focused on breadth and depth of self-purchase fashion. Our assortment offers a range of price points intended to target jewelry boxes essentials as well as fueling the stacking trend. Turning to marketing. Our go-to-market strategy is now focused on maximizing performance across a more full-funnel approach. Building off the momentum we delivered in the first quarter, our three largest brands drove a more than 40% increase in impressions on a mid-single-digit increase in media spend in the second quarter.\nWe're also adjusting where we spend. With a more than 20% increase in social media channel buys to last year with social media now representing more than a quarter of our total marketing spend. We are bringing brand messaging to more relevant channels that deliver the best reach. We also continue to refine the messaging within each brand. For example, we launched our Love Highway campaign in Jared this quarter. Moving away from the long-standing \"he went to Jared\" mentality, Love Highway is a campaign that targets affluent couples navigating life's roads together. This campaign represents a new way for Jared to go to market.\nJK Symancyk: Utilizing a popular social media influencer Taylor Hill, in this example, to drive traffic and awareness. Highlighting the early effectiveness of this type of campaign, social media impressions for Jared this quarter were nearly double to what they were last year. At Kay, we're early into modernizing the brand. Leading these efforts will be our new Kay and Peoples brand president, Julie Jocham. Julie comes most recently from Helzberg Diamonds where she was the president and chief brand merchant officer. And previously was the chief merchandising officer at Blue Nile.\nHer deep experience in the jewelry industry both as a merchant and a brand leader will be important to refresh Kay to a more modern experience to attract the next generation of customers and increase repeat purchases from existing customers. As part of our modernization efforts, Kaye's primary marketing objective is to drive emotional connection with customers. Including connection with an expanded audience allowing the brand to reduce reliance on promotion over time. One recent example is naming Teddy Swims as chief love. Appealing to a broader audience, the campaign has already driven more than 2 billion impressions since launch.\nWhile these are examples of early progress in marketing, I'm excited to welcome Lisa Lache as our new chief marketing officer. Lisa previously oversaw digital and brand marketing for the Crocs footwear brands. She brings over two decades of experience in transforming and building brands. Further, she has a strong track record of digital and social marketing excellence. Lisa will lead our team to drive brand relevance through strategic partnerships, and activate channel strategies to build loyalty with existing customers while attracting new ones to engage with our brands. She will also collaborate with the brand teams to develop creative content and storytelling to drive consideration while delivering the benefits of scale in marketing.\nThe customer experience is the third lever of our go-to-market strategy, and the one that will take more time to fully achieve. Our goal is to create unique experiences at each of our brands that enhance the overall omnichannel model integrating the brand experience from digital to physical down remerchandising the cases. Our recent reorganization has placed store operations including the store experience, directly under our brand leaders. Giving them both the opportunity and the responsibility to create unique customer experiences over time. We're early into this process, but some recent examples of the type of changes will be tested and potentially implementing include store formats designed to drive self-purchase and milestone gifting, more self-directed browsing, and more interactive experiences.\nWe're furthest along in this process at Jared, where we've been enhancing the shopping and checkout experience. In stores, our presentation is aligned to recent campaigns. Integrating marketing alongside the collections. This delivers styling suggestions to customers and provides them clearer illustration of how pieces can complement their personal jewelry collection. Further, Jared has completely upgraded their packaging, which is often the first impression among important moments for our customers. This is a reflection of the end-to-end upgrade of brand touch points that are reinforcing Jared's elevated position of inspired luxury within our portfolio.\nConsumers are responding to this change in the shopping experience as reflected by the fact that Jared had the best year-on-year improvement to in-store sales conversion across our portfolio this quarter. Before handing things over to Joan, I'd like to detail our thoughts around navigating the back half of the year. We believe we are well-positioned to enter the holiday season with the right at the right price points and the right marketing campaigns. All this to bridge the gap in holiday results last year. We believe the consumer will still seek to celebrate this holiday season and we'll leverage our marketing and brand experience to amplify that at the right time.\nWithin fashion, we are significantly bolstering our LGD, men's, and other trending category assortments in the key gifting price points of $200 to $500, as well as higher penetration in LGD fashion across all price points. For example, we expect the number of LGD fashion pieces on hand at price points below $1,000 to be up at least threefold from last year with even higher growth below $500. We see our customer willing to spend as long as the assortment is compelling and delivers on their expectations of value. We believe our assortment is well-positioned to deliver against that backdrop. We are navigating a dynamic tariff environment to deliver for our customers and our shareholders.\nWe are working with our vendors to land the inventory at the best time to minimize tariffs and maximize holiday availability. We're also working to reduce the impact of tariffs through discussions with suppliers to maximize domestic production, optimize country of origin, and by value engineering pieces that deliver on customer expectations at the right price points. Finally, the team is actively evaluating ways to optimize our production as we begin to place orders into the coming year. In summary today, my key takeaways are first, we once again delivered positive same-store sales and earnings ahead of our expectations with eight consecutive months of positive same-store sales through August.\nSecond, we continue to make early progress on our grow brand love strategy through distinct merchandise, enhanced marketing, and unique experiences. And third, we're confident in our ability to navigate the second half as we prepare for our most important season. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Joan.\nJoan Hilson: Thanks, JK, and good morning, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was over $1.5 billion with comp growth of 2%. Led by growth in fashion and services. Fashion delivered a 2% comp growth, driven by continued acceleration of LGD product performance. Particularly at key gifting price points. Bridal comps were roughly flat with our three largest brands delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth, led by AUR expansion on relatively flat units. Services grew over 7% in the quarter, led by higher attachment rates of extended service agreements. July was our best month of the quarter despite the toughest comparable within the quarter and was flat on a two-year stack.\nMerchandise AUR increased roughly 9% with fashion up more than 12% and bridal up 4%. This is a consistent result benefiting from our bridal assortment strategy. Which has generated AUR growth for the third consecutive quarter. We've seen price stabilization in both loose LGD and natural over the last six months. With natural even rebounding across carat sizes. The fashion AUR improvement reflects the strength of our LGD fashion assortment, which carries a more than three times AUR premium to other fashion pieces as well as higher gold prices. With respect to units, we saw a decline of 7%.\nLargely in Banter, which has been more impacted by gold prices and brand-specific assortment strategy to move away from some low-price promotional items. Now moving on to gross margin. We delivered a rate expansion of 60 basis points to last year, which included gross merchandise margin expansion of 30 basis points. This reflects continued progress of our refined promotional and assortment architecture strategies. Which added approximately 80 basis points of expansion. Growth in services also added roughly 20 basis points of expansion.\nThe expansion in merchandise margin rate was partially offset by a 70 basis point negative impact from an increase in the wholesaling of loose stones and the write-down of some discontinued product based on a comprehensive assessment of items below cost. As a reminder, wholesaling of loose stones carries a lower margin but is important to our inventory turn and newness capacity. We also saw 30 basis points of gross margin leverage on fixed costs from a 2% comp. Our SG&A rate improved 50 basis points to last year, driven by reorganization cost savings and disciplined expense management.\nWe do not expect SG&A leverage to extend to the back half of the year due to the reset of incentive comp, which is overweighted to the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income grew more than 20% to $85 million for the quarter, driven by positive same-store sales gross margin expansion, and leverage in SG&A. Adjusted EPS was $1.61, which was 29% above last year on higher income and a lower share count partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory ended the quarter at $2 billion nearly flat to last year, despite a more than 30% increase in gold cost.\nCash ended the quarter at $281 million with total liquidity of more than $1.4 billion. Free cash flow for the quarter of more than $60 million improved by nearly $50 million over the prior year, and improved by more than $15 million year to date. We repurchased approximately $32 million shares in the quarter, or nearly 0.5 million shares bringing our year-to-date repurchases to roughly $150 million or 6% of shares outstanding. Our remaining repurchase authorization is approximately $570 million. Recall that our approach to capital allocation includes prioritizing investment in organic growth maintaining a conservative balance sheet, and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nTo this end, our organic investments remain on track this year to a range of $145 to $160 million in capital investments and is more heavily weighted to our real estate strategy. Before moving on, I'd like to provide an update on our digital brands. We continue to remain positive with the progress we're seeing in Blue Nile. While the second quarter includes the temporary impact from shifting to a U.S.-based marketing team, as well as pricing resets that required promotional cool down. The brand returned to positive comps in July and delivered a 25% increase in fashion revenue in the second quarter. We believe Blue Nile will further benefit from a more product assortment and further price point distinction.\nWe continue to evaluate the positioning of James Allen within our portfolio. The brand's performance this quarter impacted total company comps by 120 basis points a modest improvement from the first quarter. Based on testing to date, we believe the James Allen customer will respond well to faster ship options and more finished jewelry offerings in fashion basics. We expect James Allen's impact to same-store sales for the balance of the year to moderate to a range of 60 to 90 basis points. Turning to guidance, We expect total sales for the third quarter in the range of $1.34 billion to $1.38 billion with same-store sales in the range of down 1.25% to up 1.25%.\nWe expect gross margin rate to be up modestly in the quarter, on continued merchandise margin expansion. We also expect some deleverage in SG&A in the quarter, including and incentive comp resets, change management costs related to our reorganization, And shifting some marketing spend out of Q4 and back into Q3. Recall last year, we shifted some marketing out of Q3 until after the election in battleground states to avoid paying premium rates. We expect adjusted operating income between 3 and $17 million in the quarter. For the year, we are raising our guidance range reflecting results in the first half of the year. Our third quarter expectations and the current tariff landscape.\nWe now expect total sales in the range of approximately $6.67 billion to $6.82 billion with same-store sales in the range of down 0.75% to an increase of 1.75%. The lower half of our sales guide continues to provide flexibility in the fourth quarter for a measured consumer environment. The implied two-year stack in the second half of the year is in line or slightly more conservative at the high end of guide than what we have seen over the last two months. We are raising our adjusted operating income expectation to a range of 445 to $515 million. We continue to expect gross merchandise margin expansion for the year inclusive of the impact of tariff.\nWith regards to tariffs, India currently represents roughly half of our finished merchandise purchases and have seen the tariff increase from 10% to 50% in the last five weeks. Inclusive of the incremental 25% Russian trade penalty. To minimize the penalty, we will leverage existing inventories shift some production to other countries, evaluate pricing and promotions, as well as utilize bonded warehouses. If the penalty were to remain in effect for the balance of the year, we expect adjusted operating income in the middle to lower end of the range. Conversely, if the tariff penalty is removed in the next two months, we expect adjusted operating income in the upper half of the range.\nAlso working to offset higher tariffs, we're in the early stages of rolling out our refined promotional strategy to other brands. Reflecting the success we've seen to date at Jared. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to be flat or slightly higher year over year at the high end of our guidance range. Recall that our outlook also includes an incentive compensation reset within SG&A. We are raising our adjusted EPS guide today by approximately 3% at the midpoint to a range of $8.04 to $9.57 per diluted share. Inclusive of share repurchase to date.\nBefore we turn to Q&A, I'd like to thank the team for the agility in navigating the impact of tariffs all while embracing the strategic changes within our organization, and delivering a consistent positive performance for our business. Operator, let's now go to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. You will hear a prompt that your hand has been raised. Should you wish to decline from the polling process, please press star followed by the two. If you are using a speakerphone, please lift a handset before pressing any keys. Your first question comes from Paul Lejuez with Citibank. Your line is now open.\nPaul Lejuez: Hey. Thanks, guys. Can you talk about the drivers of AUR in both bridal and fashion in terms of how much is being driven by mix versus pricing actions? And then how do you expect that to change if at all, in the second half?\nJK Symancyk: Yeah. Paul, good morning. Thanks for being on the call. Really, you know, there's a couple of things going on. I'd say mix is largely the driver of it. We'll focus on fashion first. I think there's two dynamics there. When you look at the introduction of lab-grown diamonds into the mix, that really does expand the AUR. It's an expansion of the category overall, and so it's not even really trade up. It's about, you know, stretching what you know, the category of fashion looks like for us. And with that, we see continued expansion in AUR. And, you know, have modeled it accordingly. From a bridal perspective, similar. Mix is really driving it.\nYou know, in whether that be on the lab side or the natural side, candidly. I mean, we've seen some stabilization in lab and natural markets of late, which I think, you know, bolsters what the bottom side has been, and that action that we've talked about, I think, on previous calls of how customers are really looking for opportunities to trade up continues to be something that we see playing out.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And then just on the tariffs specifically India, is there, as you think about the impact on this year, versus next year, how are you thinking about the potential wraparound into the '6? Would you expect to be able to mitigate the pressures if they stayed at, you know, this 50% rate? Just trying to understand how much is you know, how much you've been benefiting from using existing inventory versus does this just kind of, you know, create an issue for you next year?\nJK Symancyk: Yeah. I think, well, we not given any guidance for next year, obviously, but you know, as we look at it, mean, it's the same set of tools that we have. I think the benefit of thinking about next year is you've got a little bit more run time to be able to mitigate, particularly as you start thinking about some of the design elements at play and any of the country of origin movements that are part of our strategy, including even some onshoring of production to The US. Obviously, there's a lot of moving parts in the tariff landscape right now, and I'm really proud of what our team has done.\nWe've been able to maintain guide, you know, throughout the year, and even with this incremental 25% penalty to stay within guide and also be able to pull some levers that ultimately are gonna create value for our customers and for shareholders. By hitting the right price points as we go into the holiday. We, you know, we expect to be able to continue to do that. You know, Valentine's is really right around the corner. So as we're looking at holiday merchandise, we really sort of lump the two together. Beyond that, I mean, you know, I what I would tell you is we're gonna continue to exercise the same set of tools.\nI think this is a race where the finish line has moved around quite a bit, but it's a set of muscles that we have because of our you know, we've operated in a commodity-based environment that's had a lot of moving parts before, and we've got great partnerships with our suppliers and really leading supply chain capabilities within the industry and the balance sheet to be able to manage it. So I think we're as well-positioned as we can be, and we're also, you know, doing our best to even exercise, you know, some tactics to be able to create the flexibility if things continue to be dynamic.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. Thank you. Good luck.\nJK Symancyk: Yeah. Appreciate it. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good morning. Can you give us an update on the bridal business? What are plans to try to get the unit velocity moving again and anything specific planned for marketing into the holiday season for bridal?\nJoan Hilson: Yeah. So, we're really pleased, Lorraine, with how bridal has been performing within our three largest brands and really working through the impact that James Allen is having on the bridal business. So, overall, as we just focus on the three largest, we're seeing AUR, be a strength, particularly over the last three quarters. It's remained, you know, relatively consistent. The unit growth, we see the opportunity to continue to trade up into higher carat weights.\nYou know, JK we saw stabilization in, you know, retail pricing, and we've seen an increase in natural, particularly in some of the core larger carat weights, so we think that is you know, a positive, for us from an AUR perspective, and then from a unit perspective, where we've really fortified some of the lower price points within our assortment and continuing to drive that. And, you know, Kay Zales and Jared is a critical focus. And then if you kinda look at that sweet spot between 2 and $5,000, We see opportunity, particularly as we see the stabilization and even the increase on natural diamond pricing.\nSo we believe that the trend of bridal we are we are, you know, on pace you know, currently with what we're seeing in the market. And in the largest brands, you know, even slightly ahead. So positive signs for us as we, you know, lean into the critical fourth quarter for bridal.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. And then one of the items you mentioned on your list of mitigating factors was testing pricing. Just curious if you have any test complete and what the customer reaction has been to price increases in either fashion or bridal?\nJoan Hilson: Yeah. You know, it's been a really, you know, company-wide effort across, you know, our largest bay brands, and then, you know, we're rolling it out, you know, as we move the back half of the year. But Jared, as we've mentioned, you know, saw a reduction of discounting, you know, 20% to 30% over the half of the year. With that under our belt, we've been able to apply that to Kay and Zales. And the three brands are posting up a mid-single-digit comp. So seeing that the customer response to those changes has been good. What I'd like to share, though, is that it's not so much just retail price change per se.\nIt's really lower discounting, but also fewer promotion days. And on promotion just going less deep, if you will. So we're seeing that, you know, we weren't getting paid for some of the pricing that we had in the past. And so we've, you know, removed some of the days and leaned out some of the price the discounts, and it was a good result. We did mention, Lorraine, that in during the quarter, we had pricing and promotion cool down. So we can reset price. We do expect some of that as we roll out to the other brands. To occur in the back half of the year.\nAnd really, we'll take action in other areas of the business to mitigate some of the impact of that cool down. But it's really been a strong effort across the brand and one that is embraced and, frankly, has served us well timing-wise for the impact of the tariff decisions that have, you know, impacted our business.\nJK Symancyk: Yeah. And I think that's spot on. The only thing I would add to it to maybe help dimensionalize it a little more is with we've had pretty significant reset in assortments, particularly in fashion category. And with that level of newness, you know, we've we really have had the opportunity to focus on design and, you know, where we're buying, who we're buying from, leveraging those partnerships, to be able to marry design with the, you know, the sourcing capability to maintain key price points for our customers. And I think you know, what we're finding is, they understand the commodity market.\nThey certainly understand when gold prices move and they see value associated with that, But the ability to really adjust our assortment architecture overall and supplement with newness you know, means we're landing new merchandise at the right price points and have been able to do that with the tariff landscape in mind so that we're well-positioned going into the holiday.\nJoan Hilson: Yeah. I think the only thing I'd add to that, JK, is that it's been a selective for existing SKUs, it's been a selective price increase. And it's been, you know, somewhat modest mid-single digits. On applicable SKUs. So it's something that we've really been able to manage strategically with our promotional cadence and the depth of discounting as well. So I think all in all, it was a cohesive strategy around pricing and promotion for the business.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Randy Konik with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nRandy Konik: I guess, JK, when you look at the fashion AUR, nice improvement there. Is there any kind of feel for what the headroom looks like in that category? Because it you're talking about significant amount of increase in the number of LGD fashion pieces to drive up, you know, drive up obviously at purchase activity demand and could also drive up AUR. So just any kind of feel to dimensionalize where is AUR now in fashion and what the headroom could be would be super helpful. Thanks.\nJK Symancyk: Yeah. I think it's a great question, Randy. I know, I think there's still runway there. You know, both, you know, we do wanna be mindful that we're thinking about how to drive, you know, some unit growth along the way. Although, you know, today, a lot of our unit performance is tied to gold, and, you know, that tends to fluctuate as gold prices fluctuate. So as we look at lab-grown you know, our LTD fashion, you know, proliferation, it is, you know, generally much higher price point than what our existing assortment was, and we are you know, we're setting at, I think the number is about 14% penetration overall.\nAnd so that would tell you that there's still, you know, quite a bit of room there for us to continue to grow and expand the category. And I think, you know, how that plays out in terms of AUR itself is it's also a function of what we're doing to grow some of our base categories like gold. But, you know, at the end of the day, I think we're you know, we still see runway there and feel like there's an opportunity for us to continue to grow market share in fashion, particularly as we expand into that side of the category.\nJoan Hilson: Yeah. The only thing I'd add there is that you that fashion the fashion penetration that JK stated is double what it was last year at this time. Yeah. So to your point, Randy, there's and JK's continued growth, The other add-on would be that we don't expect a pullback in AUR at the time, citing the higher gold prices, this LGD penned growth, our lower level of promotions and the tariffs. So we expect AUR to continue.\nRandy Konik: Great. And then, you know, when you look at the success of an improved momentum of Jared, Zales, and Kay, You gave us some problems that were very important around the other banners that are getting, I guess, less worse. Right? Blue Nile turned, Games Island Impact Looks like it's gonna be less worse going forward. And I think banter hurt the units as well. Are we looking at perhaps, let's say, two quarters out, three quarters out before we kinda we can lap a lot of this non-K, Zales, Jared, items of these other banners and start to kind of those start to kinda become more neutral impact to both AUR units and comp. Yeah.\nHow do you see that? That'd be really helpful. Just dimensionalize that. And then Joan, just on the CapEx cycle, you I believe you reiterated the CapEx guidance for the year. Just high level, is that a kind of is that, like, a normalized type of number as we just think about you know, the future without giving guidance? Just kinda just kinda get a sense of where we are in the CapEx cycle just for go forward free cash flow purposes. Thanks.\nJoan Hilson: You want to take CapEx first, and I'll go back to Sure. So the $145 to $160, Randy, is, you know, as I said, was heavily weighted to real estate. I think it's you know, as we look forward into our real estate strategy and we continue on the grow brand love from banners to brands. Our real estate strategy and in-store experience will continue. To follow that strategy as a run rate. We really haven't assessed what that brand strategy would mean to our CapEx guidance like into the following year. But I wouldn't expect it to be markedly different at this time.\nAnd as you know, our capital allocation priority is to organically invest number one, in our business. And so it will follow the strategy, and, but I wouldn't see it as being, you know, materially different than where we are today.\nJK Symancyk: Thank you. And I would just let me take you the first part of your question, Randy. As far as the other brands are concerned, I yeah. I mean, we're focused on what we do to drive improvement there. I would say, you know, we've been very clear about the focus on KZLs and Jared given the size, I you know, it's it's it's hard to be healthy if the core is not healthy. And so, you know, I'm really pleased with the way that we've put the energy there, and I think it's absolutely the right thing to build momentum in the business.\nIt also, you know, to Joan's point, whether it's how we think about promo or what we're looking at in terms of assortment, it informs the decisions that we feel like are critical to help drive the other brands. And, you know, within each, there's a little bit different story. Blue now continues to build momentum, and I think that you know, that is very much about distinguishing you know, its brand positioning and really, you know, moving back up a bit to where, you know, it has held the greatest strength.\nIt also has an opportunity as it relates to fashion, very similar to KZLs Jared, and that's, I think, you know, that similarity is part of why it's moving faster along with you know, within that team, the focus on it as really the bellwether of the digital brands. James Allen, we've, you know, we've got some work to do strategically. We have some work around price and promotion positioning within the marketplace. We also have some work around speed to market relative to, you know, customization or the assembly customization that's really the hallmark of what James Allen does. And the team is working hard to reposition and relaunch with those, improvements in place.\nAnd I think know, I think we'll, you know, then we'll be able to measure you know, what it takes to win that business back from a customer standpoint and or what are the right decisions that we should be making moving forward with James Allen. Know, the other businesses, we don't talk a lot about. Peoples has been a really strong business in Canada. You know, we don't talk about it quite as much, and I probably owe a big thanks to our people's team in Canada. They're small but mighty, and if you look at their business on a two-year stack basis, it's probably the healthiest in the company. Growing share and really leading well.\nUK, we don't talk a lot about for some of the same reasons. It's been relatively healthy and I think they're some market share dynamics that are unique to The UK market that present some opportunities for us moving forward. And, you know, But it's not a big source of investment or a big source of capital, and so it's probably gonna be something that we dimensionalize a lot.\nAnd then, you know, I think Diamonds Direct is a really good business that you know, like a lot of like a lot of businesses that are, you know, sort of founder-led, you know, hit a growth stage where, you really have to look at operating model and what it means to go from being, you know, smaller regional, you know, founder-led business to something that is of larger scale. And so you know, we that's work that's in front of us. The team is galvanized around that. And I do think that, you know, as we tackle that, then, yeah, to your point, those things, I wouldn't use the word less worse.\nI think, you know, our goal is to improve. You know, improve them and create some tailwind behind those businesses and, you know, make them stronger parts of the portfolio, but it's gonna come with the gravitational pull and the weight of having core brands like Kay's Ale's and Jared that really do drive performance for us. The only one I didn't mention is Banter. I think Banter is a good business. You know, it's got some you know, it's very different from the rest of our business. Just given lower price point, heavy reliance on gold, kiosk business. And so there's some unique dynamics there, but it's know, it's it's it's actually, you know, sort of holding its own.\nAnd, I mean so again, not a high source of capital or investment moving forward, but something that you know, that we'll continue to manage as well. So thanks for the question.\nRandy Konik: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nRobert: Hey. This is Robert on for Ike. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about three q guide, because it seems like it's a little below two q run rate. Has something softened or you're seeing some earlier demand pull forward? And also, you talk a little bit about your holiday comp plan? Thank you.\nJoan Hilson: So I'll take the three q guide. You know, the guide the performance that we saw in the second quarter you know, we saw momentum continue into the third quarter. We're pleased with that the momentum was on a positive two-year, but the positive two-year stack. So, you know, the guide itself is relatively measured, and we feel that we're pleased with how the business performed, and the guide itself just takes into account the many factors that we face in the third quarter. So happy with the top line momentum. We'll see a little bit of what we continue to see gross margin expansion with some deleverage. In SG&A. So really relative to some incentive you know, cost reset.\nSo we are and that's the underpinning of the three guide. I think as we look at the full year, we've raised our full-year guidance same-store sales with an increase in operating income, less so on the low end given the impact of tariffs and so forth, which we've discussed. But the same-store sales itself is a slight decline, if you will, in the applying guide for 4Q. And it's really all around the idea of this measured consumer environment and what and being somewhat conservative to, you know, what we've seen happen in the business just knowing, the backdrop of the business.\nBut overall, we've raised our guide reflecting what we've seen in the second our expectations for the third quarter. And then just remaining somewhat measured in the fourth quarter for holiday.\nJK Symancyk: Yeah. And I think I'm sorry. Go ahead, Robert. I didn't mean to cut you off.\nRobert: Oh, no. Go ahead. What were you gonna say?\nJK Symancyk: No. I was just gonna say as far as holiday comp plan, I you know, we believe we're well-positioned to maximize the holiday season. I think Joan touched on it. There's a lot of moving parts in the environment right now, but we've know, we've seen our customer be resilient. You know, the this we largely set in what is you know, a planned and emotional purchase, and those drivers, you know, are fairly timeless, resilient, and we're seeing customers respond to that in the marketplace. I think we've also taken the right steps given, you know, maybe where we didn't deliver as strongly last year, are better positioned within key price points.\nYou know, we called it out in the script, but LGD fashion is three x. The inventory level or ownership levels below a thousand dollars and even greater below $500 and we've put a particular focus on that 250 to $500 price point because that's really critical, especially as you get into those last ten days.\nSo you know, I think we're very well-positioned to be able to maximize that and it's not just the ownership level, but when you look at the level of newness, that allocation of inventory is much more on trend and better positioned relative to what I think customers are looking for and, you know, we'll be there ready for them because I think they'll still shop for the holiday.\nThe only other thing I'd add to it is, you know, from a marketing perspective, very focused on maximizing that investment in full-funnel marketing across the year to really pulse demand during those last key time periods, and we'll continue to build upon the impression expansion that we've seen over the course of the year to best position ourselves to maximize the holiday season.\nRobert: Great. Thanks. One other follow-up on that. Can you talk about how your lab business did in the second quarter? And how comps and margins are doing in it?\nJoan Hilson: The lab-grown diamond business. Yeah. What we've, you know, said about fashion, Robert, is that you know, it has a 14% penetration rate in fashion, and it's doubled what it was last year. Margins are, quite nice. They're up somewhat in with respect to the lab-grown fashion performance. And, you know, frankly, we're seeing as we said in bridal, we're seeing the stabilization of pricing in lab-grown and, you know, just conversely on natural, it's actually up. So we're seeing a nice AUR movement in both of those businesses, and the penetration to an earlier point is we see runway for that to continue to grow in fashion.\nRobert: Great. Benjie, I'll pass along. Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMauricio Serna: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I'd like to maybe ask on you could elaborate on your third-quarter performance quarter to date, you know, like, how does that look versus what you were seeing at the end of in July, which you pointed was, like, your strongest month? And then you just help us to also think about, like, the compares for the third quarter. I think I recall, like, last year, like, August was actually, like, the strongest month of the quarter that if I'm correct. Just trying to understand, like, what does that imply for, like, the guidance for the sales guidance for Q3? Thank you.\nJoan Hilson: Yeah. For Q3, we exited the quarter nicely as we mentioned. July was our toughest comp, and we exited it nicely on a positive comp, highest comp in the month in the quarter, in the second quarter. The comp has been fairly consistent across the last several months as we look into August. We like what we're seeing, and it's a positive comp trend for us. The only caveat I'd share with you is that we'll have some further pricing resets and cool downs that will experience in the third quarter as we prepare for the critical fourth quarter.\nBut overall, top-line trends have held and believe that the team has done a nice job in setting architecture as we land new product. Throughout the quarter.\nMauricio Serna: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on guidance for, you know, the updated guidance for the year. You give us a sense of how much pressure from tariffs you're expecting in Q4 when you're thinking about, like, the high end and the low end of the guide?\nJoan Hilson: Yeah. So, Mauricio, as we think about the guidance range for operating income, you know, what we've said that is if the Russian remains, we are on the Indian imports, we expect to be in the middle to lower end of our EBIT range. But if it's removed, we would expect to be in the upper half of the guidance range. So that's the dimension that we've put within our range. And so we were able to evaluate to the discussion earlier, evaluate and opportunities to offset as much of the of the tariff and mitigate as much of the tariff as we key on.\nWith, you know, country of origin and the and, you know, pricing and promotion and so forth. And I believe that the teams have the right pricing in place for holiday. And so that's why we were able to stay within that guidance range.\nMauricio Serna: And just one point of clarification. For the high end of the guide, when you say they remove, like, the Russian penalty, does this mean, like, the tariff is 25% or 10% on?\nJoan Hilson: Yes. Exactly. That the reciprocal tariffs remain intact, but the penalty if that is removed, we would expect to be in the higher in the high end of the range.\nMauricio Serna: I'm sorry. What would be that part? So 25%?\nJoan Hilson: Yes. For India. So and with the Russian penalty, it's 50%. So we would expect to be in the upper half of the range. If that penalty would be removed.\nMauricio Serna: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Your line is now open.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the progress. As you think about the learnings from the fourth quarter of applied to this year, I remember last year, some of it was not having enough of the right inventory at the price points 200 to $500, Obviously, a growth and lab-grown fashion diamonds. How do you think of the playbook for holiday this year And what is marketing spend going to look like this year versus last year? Thank you.\nJK Symancyk: Sure. Good morning, Dana. Thanks for the question. You know, I the we feel good about the holiday. You know, we've kept our eye on the ball relative to those assortment gaps from last year. And you know, have really invested to make sure that we are covering the right price points. Lab-grown diamond fashion is a big part of that because of the on-trend nature and customer relevance of it, particularly in the fashion category. We you know, we've tripled our ownership of Lab Grown Diamond Fashion below a thousand dollars. Have, you know, bigger increases below $500 and with particular focus on that 250 to $500 price point.\nYou know, we've also looked at what's the, you know, within existing SKUs, what's the content of the assortment look like relative to trend? You know, it was we sold through the on-trend merchandise we had last year. We did you know, have other merchandise, but it was dated and, you know, we've worked hard coming out of last year and into the first part of this year to be clean from an inventory perspective and then make the assortment adjustments And, you know, depending on the brand, you're looking at you know, as much as 40 to 50% of an assortment shift, you know, particularly within those price points.\nSo it's not just about the depth of ownership that was a big opportunity last year, but the content within it. Is something that we've been mindful of, particularly as we've tried to web the assortment changes to the brand positioning for each. And so you know, within k, that means really doubling down on milestone gifting as the big driver of assortment differentiation along with men's. With Zales, it really is about more on-trend fashion assortment with particular on self-expression, and stacking is a big part of that trend.\nWithin Jared, you really have both of those trends at play, at a more elevated price point for a more discerning higher-end customer who, you know, likely has the essentials in their jewelry box already and are looking to add to their And so I think the focus that our teams have brought to the table particularly in this environment where, you know, we've worked on shifting the long-term strategy and have made an awful lot of changes to our operating model, but to balance that with driving performance the near term, I'm really pleased with where we are, you know, despite maybe all the external noise that's going on, in the environment, I think our team is really well-positioned and is navigating this dynamic environment well on behalf of our customers who I think will reward us, but also, you know, the impact that it can have on shareholders.\nDana Telsey: Two quick follow-ups. JK, is the team fully built out now? Any other holes that you're seeking to fill? And then on square footage, Joan, I think it's now down 1%. Previously, it was down 1% to flat. Anything to take away there? Thank you.\nJK Symancyk: Sure. Let me take the first part of that question, Dana. Yeah. You know, I'm really pleased with the leadership team and the way that you know, we've come together. I think the mix of experience, both Signet experience as well as industry experience and the diversity of thought that we've added to the team. Just makes us stronger, and I think we're well-positioned. We do have one leadership position that we are still interviewing for. It's a technology leader for the organization. I think that's gonna be the last critical piece for us to fill. But you know, as I alluded in the last calls, know, that process is ongoing.\nWe're getting close to a final decision there and just like with the addition of Julie and Lisa and the elevation of Stacy. You know, I'm confident that we'll add strength to the team, not only with the expertise in the area that we're looking for, but also that someone who's gonna be additive to culture and really be aligned with, you know, our purpose and our strategy in a way that's that can be a catalyst moving forward. So stay tuned, but we team is largely set to the point of your question more succinctly, and I'm excited about how well everybody's working together and our alignment on the strategy moving forward.\nJoan Hilson: And to answer your question on square footage, it's really just refinement of our store closure plan for the balance of the year, so nothing more to take. From that then, but just a refinement.\nDana Telsey: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, should you have a question, please press 1. Your next question comes from Jim Sanderson with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.\nJim Sanderson: Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to the fashion category for the quarter. Did Could you provide us with the unit decline was for the quarter?\nJoan Hilson: Yeah. The decline in the unit performance. Sorry, JK. Was down high single digit in the fashion category. And what you should take from that, Jim, is that the gold pricing in banter had slowed the units there, which is typically what we see over time. Then the change in the promotional item strategy particularly in sales, which was a decision to move away from some of those lower price points and one that we would expect to continue. In the back half of the year.\nSo pleased with the overall Fashion performance and the refinement of strategy and the gold prices it was generally the external commodity gold pricing was really the impact that we saw in the banter brand.\nJim Sanderson: Okay. And in the bridal category, as far as your outlook for the fiscal year, do you expect the units in bridal to remain relatively flat? Or do you anticipate some pickup or momentum heading into the back half of the year for units, not AUR?\nJoan Hilson: Yeah. We it's relatively flat. To you know, on the higher end, Jim might be at, like, up a low single-digit level, but it's that's where that's the guidance, and it's it's really may remain unchanged from where we were last quarter in terms of our outlook view.\nJim Sanderson: Okay. And then one follow-up question more broadly on your assortment changes. Where do you think lab-grown diamond assortment mix will land as you build up the kind of value fashion assortments going forward? I think you said it was 7%. Now up to 14% of sales mix. What's the right mix for the assortment you have in mind?\nJK Symancyk: Yeah. Joe, I appreciate the question. We haven't really given a penetration target in part because you know, it's a function of both numerator and denominator and, you know, we'd like to grow both. You know? So I'm probably not gonna give you a target there. I do think we're you know, when you look at our penetration from a share perspective, it's still relatively low in fact. And when you look at the growth that's driving the category, lab-grown diamonds are really the impetus for that. And, you know, I'll underscore the point around category expansion. These are not replacements for something that exists today.\nYou know, largely the customer that is buying something like a lab-grown diamond tennis bracelet, for example, is not a core traditionalist that is choosing between a natural diamond or a lab-grown diamond. This is really about expansion of consumption overall for much of where that growth is. So we still feel like there's runway there from a penetration standpoint. It is I think, you know, it's gonna take a little bit of dimensionalizing and we'll probably answer this question on future calls because, you know, a lot of a lot of our fashion unit performance has been, you know, disproportionately grown, you know, through a brand like Banter at a much lower price point.\nAnd as we move in, to what is really on-trend fashion, it will you know, it will juice AUR, if you will, but it's almost apples and oranges because you're adding to the category and I think we're gonna you know, questions like yours in terms of how do you flip to a model is probably gonna be something we'll talk about for a little bit as we find what the baseline for this can be. But still expect a lot of growth there.\nAnd, you know, interestingly, you know, as we routinize it, particularly in those core brands of ours, we're seeing, you know, overall balance across, you know, sort of AUR and unit growth, especially in Kay and Jared.\nJim Sanderson: Okay. Okay. Just one last follow-up question on marketing spending. I think this quarter, you reported spending was a little bit higher than revenue growth Is that the trend we should look at for the back half of the year?\nJK Symancyk: No. Not as necessarily. I mean, I you know, we haven't really changed our budget for the year. What we have done is you know, feed it if we I mean, we're very focused on a performance standpoint. We were up know, we were up 4% in spend. But if you know, if we can see that pulls through and we're gonna grow you know, profit based on that investment, then you know, I think we're I think we're you know, we've got our you know, feet on the gas and the brake appropriately there, and I would call it neutral overall.\nJim Sanderson: Alright. Thank you very much.\nJK Symancyk: Yeah. Appreciate the question.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to JK Symancyk for closing remarks.\nJK Symancyk: Thank you, and thank you everybody for joining us today.

We're laser-focused on holiday preparations and we look forward to sharing further results with you in December.

He's enforced strict cost discipline, down to monitoring how employees' company-issued phone use is work-related. He's updated performance metrics and pay structures. He's sent the vast majority of corporate employees back to the office five days a week. He's created a \"bureaucracy mailbox,\" to which employees are encouraged to flag unnecessary processes or rules that could be streamlined or eliminated; Amazon says the initiative has already led to 375 changes.\nFor Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos four years ago, the goal has been to restore the urgency and discipline that once defined Amazon's DNA and had begun to atrophy, following a period of stratospheric growth and then massive losses as the bottom fell out of the pandemic-era boom.\nIt's about getting Amazon back to what made it so successful in the first place.\nAs Jassy explained at an internal all-hands earlier this year, a record of which was obtained by Business Insider: \"We want to operate the world's largest startup at our size — that has not been done before. It is hard to do, but it is doable.\"\nBy many measures, the reset is working. Amazon's stock is up more than 30% over the past year, outperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Amazon's profit per employee rose to $44,100 last year — more than five times the 2022 figure.\n\"During the pandemic, I think creativity suffered to some extent, and for sure the cohesive culture that was peculiar to Amazon also suffered,\" Babak Parviz, a former Amazon vice president who is now running his own AI healthcare startup NewDays, told Business Insider. \"Andy is rightfully focusing on making sure that the Amazon culture is maintained and thriving, and it doesn't dissipate away.\"\nAnd under Jassy's leadership, Amazon has been at the forefront of corporate America's cultural shift. Meta, Google, and Microsoft have all tightened their performance expectations, though their return to the office mandates are still less strict than Amazon's. Old guard companies like AT&T have similarly taken a stricter stance on office culture.\nAs Jassy enters his fifth year leading Amazon, his leadership has been defined less by any single product or splashy hire, but rather by his revamp of Amazon's culture as he tries to recapture Bezos' \"always Day 1\" mindset and position the tech giant to thrive.\nA close reading of that effort — Jassy's hardline approach to employee management and of his laser focus on a more nimble, do-more-with-less culture — has created a playbook that leaders of companies large and small could study, even if not everyone would embrace his approach.\nAmazon's return to a hardcore mindset was born out of a growing concern among Jassy and his top brass that the tech giant's famously scrappy, ruthlessly efficient culture had taken a hit during the company's years of explosive growth, according to people familiar with their thinking.\nLayers of bureaucracy, which had settled like sediment as the company continued to grow, were slowing things down, struggling initiatives needed to be streamlined, and a flexible work-from-home policy meant that a lot of employees who'd joined during and after the pandemic had never been properly integrated into Amazon's way of doing things.\nJassy zeroed in on the need to focus on culture early on in his tenure as CEO. But it was a few years before he and his senior leadership were able to do much about it, according to Drew Herdener, the company's senior vice president of communications and corporate responsibility.\nBack in the summer of 2021, when Jassy replaced founder Jeff Bezos and became Amazon's second-ever CEO, the tech giant was expanding at a breakneck pace. A hiring spree of historic proportions had minted Amazon as the second biggest private employer in the US, after Walmart. The company was also on track to eclipse Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside China, with a delivery network to rival UPS.\nOver the next three years, Amazon went on a rollercoaster of devastating losses and extraordinary gains.\nIn late 2022, as the bottom fell out of the pandemic boom, Amazon became the first company to shed $1 trillion in market value — a figure just shy of the entire value of Alphabet, Google's parent company. Senior executives had been leaving in droves, and an internal report at the time, seen by Business Insider, bluntly warned that Amazon's public image was \"in need of immediate, significant repair.\"\nMichael Batnick, director of research at Ritholtz Wealth Management, even floated the idea on CNBC that Bezos might need to return as CEO \"to steady the ship.\"\nBut by the summer of 2024, Amazon had laid off nearly 30,000 employees, streamlined its cost structure, and downsized a number of projects, including its moonshot lab Grand Challenge. Amazon had not only stemmed its losses but surpassed a $2 trillion market cap, and Jassy was being credited with an extraordinary turnaround.\nOnce the dust had settled, there was a sense that Amazon would need to better integrate the surge of new hires from the early days of the pandemic into Amazon's corporate culture.\nOne former executive noted that maintaining Amazon's famed memo-writing culture was especially challenging for new hires more accustomed to PowerPoint presentations. Many also struggled to fully embrace the company's Leadership Principles, which are deeply embedded in how Amazon operates. Productivity slipped, and as Jassy puts it, \"riffing\" on new ideas got harder with remote work. While it reached record profits, Amazon grappled with the layers of bureaucracy and the growing perception of falling behind in AI.\n\"It was more difficult to make sure that the new employees really understood what the culture was, just because it was growing so fast.\" Parviz said.\nBy last fall, Jassy was pressing that culture reset and his war on Amazon's bureaucracy into full throttle.\nA glimpse into Amazon's more disciplined, hardcore culture came in July, when an Amazon advertising director sent senior managers a sharply worded email titled \"Raising Our Leadership Standard.\"\nAmazon wanted to see \"higher productivity\" and \"more competitive leadership roles,\" he wrote, according to the email obtained by Business Insider. \"I need every leader on this team to step into the arena and commit to this higher standard. If they can't or won't, I need them to leave ASAP.\"\nAmazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that the email is \"unrelated to or reflective of Andy's strengthening our culture and teams initiative.\" Instead, Amazon's culture has always been \"performance-driven and fast-paced\" and the company is \"getting back to our roots,\" the spokesperson said.\nIn staff meetings, company executives hammer home the importance of frugality, making it a recurring theme in internal discussions and decision-making.\n\"We want owners,\" Jassy said at a company staff meeting earlier this year, a record of which was obtained by Business Insider. \"What would I do if this was my money?\"\nThe best leaders, Jassy stressed, are those who \"get the most done with the least amount of resources required to do the job.\"\nAmazon has also revamped its compensation system to reward high performers more directly. The new structure puts greater emphasis on an employee's performance history, with those earning top marks for four consecutive years now eligible for pay increases that exceed the standard compensation bands.\nJassy's latest push has been to reinforce Amazon's operating DNA, which centers on the company's Leadership Principles — the 16 core values that shape decision-making at every level and are deeply embedded in how Amazon operates.\nThis year, the company formally incorporated adherence to those principles into performance reviews for the first time, tying them directly to pay and promotions. That followed a new video series Jassy launched last year, breaking down each principle, from \"Customer Obsession\" and \"Frugality\" to \"Disagree and Commit.\"\n\"I've been at Amazon now for 27 years, and I can tell you that I still consider myself a student of our Leadership Principles,\" Jassy wrote in a note announcing the launch of an internal video series explaining his take on each LP. \"I work hard at it every day.\"\nComplaints have also come from middle-managers, who say they're now spending far more time overseeing ever-larger teams, leading to longer hours and a drop in personal productivity.\nJunior leaders say that major decisions are made by a tight-knit group of top Amazon leaders and that they are often kept out of the loop. Last year, for example, when Jassy announced a full five-day return-to-office mandate and a push to slim down middle management, multiple VPs told Business Insider that they learned about the changes from news reports.\n\"It's unsentimental,\" a former executive told Business Insider. \"If numbers don't work, they just move on.\"\nEmployees, meanwhile, complain that cost-cutting has veered into micromanagement.\nAt AWS, some employees now report what percentage of their phone use is work-related, with the $50 monthly reimbursement adjusted proportionally. In retail, employees have complained they must now seek approval for business trips by outlining expected goals and projected returns. They also need to break down expenses by meal to give more details about their spending.\nMany Amazon employees say they fear for their job security — especially after Jassy's recent prediction that \"efficiency gains\" accomplished with AI would lead to an even smaller white-collar workforce. \"It's just really hard for people to show up at work and be all-in knowing tomorrow might be the last day at work,\" a current Amazon executive told Business Insider.\nAI is already being jammed into every corner of the business, adding to the pressure, employees say. Some teams now track performance by how frequently staff use AI tools, while others treat having an AI project as little more than a box to tick. Several employees describe the result as \"AI fatigue.\"\nOther Amazonians Business Insider spoke to give Jassy credit for being personable and operating with a more people-focused leadership style. One former executive recalled Jassy taking time during meetings to get to know him personally, a gesture that earned his respect.\n\"That level of care to make it more humane is a tremendous motivator,\" the person said.\nJassy's cost discipline also reflects a deeper shift in Amazon's philosophy. Unlike Bezos, who spread bets widely across hundreds of projects — from satellite internet to healthcare moonshots — Jassy prefers to concentrate on a few dozen initiatives he considers big bets, according to people familiar with his work.\n\"Jassy wants to focus on things that Amazon is uniquely positioned to do a good job on,\" one former VP said.\nAmazon's CEO has grown skeptical of an internal metric known as downstream impact, or DSI, the same former VP said. This measure attempts to estimate a project's lifetime value using imprecise indicators, such as how Alexa might indirectly boost the number of shoppers on Amazon. The voice assistant, once a flagship product, was among the first units to be downsized under Jassy due to its mounting losses and the team's failure to build a sustainable business model.\nIn recent years, Jassy has shown particular support for high-margin businesses such as cloud computing and advertising, this person added. Under his leadership, Amazon introduced ads to its video streaming service and ramped up investment in cloud data centers.\nAmazon's spokesperson told Business Insider that the company is \"pursuing as many if not more projects in more focused areas,\" and the pace of innovation is only accelerating under Jassy. The leadership team is improving its \"analysis of DSI\" and has no plans to stop measuring it, the spokesperson added.\nStill, with so much focus on cost cutting, there's mounting worry among Amazon's rank and file that Amazon is not doing enough to appeal to top talent and position itself as a great place to work.

(\"Zentek\" or the \"Company\") (Nasdaq:ZTEK)(TSX-V:ZEN), an intellectual property technology development and commercialization company, is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Albany Graphite Corp. (\"AGC\") has been awarded a grant of $500,000 from the Ontario Government's Critical Minerals Innovation Fund (\"CMIF\") for its Albany Graphite Purification and Anode Material Development Project.\nHighlights\n-\nGrant Award: AGC has been awarded $500,000 from Ontario's CMIF\n-\nProject Collaboration: AGC will be collaborating with five highly reputable North American companies and NRCan\n-\nFunding Contributions: AGC will contribute $314,500 to the project, and Natural Resources Canada (\"NRCan\") will provide $200,000 of in-kind support\n-\nProject Goals: The project aims to produce approximately 5-6 tonnes of flotation concentrate (~85%). Concurrently, testwork will also involve purification with NRCan's newly developed electrothermal fluidized bed reactor (\"FBR\") (and suitability testing of previous samples of ultra-high purity Albany graphite for lithium-ion battery (anode and cathode additive) and nuclear applications\n-\nRecent Achievements: Zentek achieved a preliminary, proof-of-concept five-nines purity directly from the Albany graphite deposit flotation concentrate\nWith electric vehicle batteries requiring up to 125 kg of graphite per vehicle, graphite is a key mineral identified in Ontario's Critical Minerals Strategy 2022-2027. Unlike other critical minerals, the value of graphite varies widely based on its specific use cases, which require different purity, crystallinity, shape, and flake size thresholds. CMIF provides funding to projects that help strengthen Ontario's critical minerals sector. AGC will contribute $314,500 to the project and is also collaborating with NRCan CanmetENERGY's G3M project to include purification testing of Albany Graphite in their custom-built electrothermal \"FBR\". NRCan CanmetENERGY will provide $200,000 of in-kind support (technical expertise, specialized equipment and custom testwork).\nThe project will entail the production of approximately 5-6 tonnes of flotation concentrate (~85%) from the 110-tonne bulk sample that was collected in 2019. Concurrently, testwork will also involve purification testwork via NRCan's newly developed Canadian FBR, and suitability testing of ultra-high purity Albany graphite samples for lithium-ion battery (anode and cathode additive) and nuclear applications.\nOn January 8, 2025, Zentek announced that AGC had achieved a preliminary, proof-of-concept five-nines purity of 99.9991% directly from a larger sample of the remaining 2017 Albany graphite deposit flotation concentrate utilizing an operational FBR. AGC supplied a one-kilogram sample of the homogenized bulk flotation concentrate to a highly reputable North American manufacturing company specializing in industrial graphite and carbon materials. A platinum crucible Loss on Ignition analysis on a sample of the purified material indicated an ash content of 0.0009 wt.% corresponding to a purity of 99.9991 wt.%. Notably, the manufacturing company reported that the Albany material was easily purified to an ultra-high purity level without the use of chlorine gas or any other halogen gases that are commonly used for graphite purification when 5N nuclear purity levels need to be achieved.\nAdditionally, as part of the purification work above, the Albany feed material was characterized with an elemental analysis (59 elements) to identify the impurity elements. In its report, the manufacturing company noted that the feed material contained concentrations of Rare Earth Elements (\"REEs\") and other potential elements of value that could be recovered as part of the thermal purification process. Impurity elements, including the REEs, that were removed from the graphite during the purification process are routinely collected and concentrated in a scrubber that handles all the FBR exhaust products. This scrubber material could be a potential by-product.\nNext Steps\nBeyond this CMIF funded testwork, the bulk sample beneficiation will permit purification scaleup testwork using continuous feed reactors. This process will result in the subsequent production of larger volumes of ultra-high purity Albany graphite material which will be supplied to OEMs and end users for assessment and qualification in applications such as energy storage, clean energy, nuclear, advanced materials and other potential high-value uses. The results from these activities will inform project valuation and supply essential engineering data for potential future NI 43-101 technical studies, including an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment and subsequent Pre-Feasibility Study\nWith significant investment being made in the North American battery supply chain, and growing demand for finished anode material, the Company is exploring both graphite production from the Albany deposit and processing the graphite to produce a battery ready anode material.\nThe CEO of Zentek and Albany Graphite Corp., Greg Fenton commented: \"We are thrilled to be working with the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development Job Creation and Trade on this project. The CMIF grant will enable AGC to build on its recent purification successes and produce additional flotation concentrate that will be used for subsequent purification and anode development testwork, and produce marketing samples of ultra-high purity graphite samples for third-party evaluation in advanced material applications.\"\n\"The unique nature of the Albany deposit has created a competitive advantage for Zentek and its partners. In addition, we are pursuing the value-add processing component of the anode supply chain to create a vertically integrated, anode solution. Based on the previous successes AGC anticipates the project will help to further de-risk the Albany project and enhance its investment potential.\"\nMr. Peter Wood, P.Eng., P.Geo., Vice President, Development of AGC, a \"Qualified Person\" under NI 43-101, has approved the technical information contained in this news release.\nAbout the Ontario Critical Minerals Innovation Fund (\"CMIF\") Program\nThe CMIF is dedicated to building a stronger Ontario by supporting the mining industry through research, development, and the commercialization of innovative technologies, processes, and solutions for the critical minerals supply chain.

Billions of dollars in trade duties may potentially need to be refunded to businesses as trade deals struck by the White House with other nations are thrown into question. But for now, the underlying stance within the shipping industry and supply chain has not changed, according to logistics professionals, with the court decision — a stay is in place until October 14 — contributing to the uncertainty that has dogged business decision making throughout 2025.\n\"Right now, we have not heard anything much or seen any changes,\" said Paul Brashier, vice president of global supply chain for ITS Logistics.\nWith the tariffs still imposed until October 14 and the expected appeal by the Trump administration, shippers are sitting tight. \"Most shippers are awaiting the appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and its final decision. There has been a lot of frontloading as well so impact for now should be minimal,\" he said, referring to the period early this year when imports surged as businesses loaded up on inventory to avoid tariff effective dates.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday he believes the Supreme Court will uphold Trump's use of a 1977 emergency powers law to impose the tariffs on trading partners, and the administration has a backup plan if it does not. Later in the day, President Trump said he would ask the Supreme Court for an \"expedited ruling.\"\nMike Short, president of global forwarding at C.H. Robinson, said his company has received calls from multiple customers reaching out for clarity on the likelihood of this going to the Supreme Court, if they'll uphold the ruling, and what the refund process could look like.\n\"This decision concerns reciprocal tariffs on goods from most countries, in addition to drug-related tariffs affecting imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. These tariffs account for the lion's share of the duty outlay for many of our customers, so despite no immediate change, they're eager to know and plan for the 'what ifs,'\" said Short.\nJosh Teitelbaum, senior counsel of Akin and a former U.S. Commerce official, said it is advising companies to stay the course. \"Companies should not be shifting their sourcing based on what they think the Supreme Court will say, it's just too uncertain,\" said Teitelbaum. \"If the Court says the President exceeded his authority, he will very likely impose new tariffs under different authorities, which have their own requirements and limitations on what the rate may be and how long it can stay in place,\" he added.\nAlan Baer, CEO of OL USA, said companies are dealing with a lot of mixed signals as product ordered and arriving in October is already on the water.\nIn addition to an expected White House appeal to the Supreme Court, Baer noted that Trump could also go to the Senate, which might provide him with special powers for the next 6 to 9 months to enact tariffs, with an end date prior to the Nov. 26 elections. Or, the administration could focus more on a \"slew of commodity-specific tariffs like the steel and aluminum.\"\n\"I don't see the White House giving up on collecting the $30 billion-plus in taxes,\" he said, referring to how much the federal government has been collecting per month from the trade duties.\n\"Most companies will remain cautious with their forward ordering unless they see demand picking up,\" Baer added.\nSo far this fiscal year, the U.S. has generated $142 billion in tariff revenue, according to the most recent Treasury Department data.\nHow tariff refunds would work\nShort said if the Supreme Court reviews the case and upholds the lower courts' decision, it remains unclear whether their ruling will specify retroactive refunds of duties already paid or only prevent tariffs from being applied to future shipments. If the ruling does address refunds, these may occur in one of two ways: either Customs will process the refunds automatically, or brokers will need to undertake additional work to secure them, according to Short. \"In the latter scenario, the workload for our customs teams would double overnight and be met with importers very eager to get those dollars back,\" he said.\nIf tariffs do need to be refunded, Dan Anthony, President of Trade Partnership Worldwide, says the process would only be as difficult as the administration chooses to make it.\n\"Blanket refunds are fairly straightforward: all affected imports have an IEEPA-specific code and related tariff amount that should allow for automated refunds of payments,\" Anthony said. \"An individual request process would make it infinitely more complex. But any sympathy should be for the importers forced to jump through hoops, not government agencies that created work for themselves in an effort to keep illegal tariffs paid by Americans,\" he said.\nNevertheless, the breadth of the global trade war is immense. Tariffs on more than 90 countries and all of the products exported into the United States are in effect. The U.S. Customs Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) provides duty rates for virtually every existing product.\nThe Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) contains over 11,000 eight-digit subheadings, according to Michael Lowell, partner and chair of the global regulatory enforcement group for Reed Smith, and only about 5% of those are exempt from the reciprocal tariffs. Every HTSUS code is subject to the \"fentanyl\" tariffs on Canadian-, Chinese-, and Mexican-origin goods, unless the product is eligible for duty-free treatment under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\nLowell added the Section 232 tariffs are more targeted.\n\"There may be 800 or so codes targeted by the Section 232 tariffs, but they also cover a wide range of products beyond just what an importer may think of as aluminum, copper, or steel products,\" he said.\nFelicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection and senior director for geo-commerce in APCO's Center for Trade, Investment and Market Access, said that in the short-term, refunding the tariffs would be an enormous challenge for the administration, but doable.\n\"It's not something that could be done overnight, but I think they could put processes and resources in place to do manage it over time,\" said Pullam. \"The funds that CBP collects from tariffs goes into the U.S. Treasury – they are not earmarked for anything,\" she said. If they had to be refunded, it would contribute to the U.S. budget deficit and overall debt, \"just like most other kinds of federal spending,\" she said.\nSmall businesses that use a third party (e.g. UPS, FedEx, DHL, brokers) as the importer of record would face additional challenges. In these cases, the U.S. government would refund the third party, which must then create a process for refunding customers, according to Anthony. \"This can lead to significant delays for actual importers even if the government process goes off without a hitch,\" he said.\nAppealing trade duties, but not counting on the courts for now\nTariff experts said that shippers have 314 days from the time their freight is processed through U.S. Customs to file an appeal. Lowell said with the frontloading of product ahead of the tariffs starting back in February, the window for companies to appeal any tariffs is the end of December.\nIn the event the Supreme Court does receive the case and rules the tariffs are illegal, Pullam says the longer the IEEPA tariffs are collected, the greater the issue if the government must pay them back. \"For that reason, since these tariffs have always been considered legally risky, it might be in the best interest of the country and of the Trump administration to switch over to other types of tariffs sooner, rather than later,\" she said.\nBut she does not think a loss in court would undo any of the trade deals. \"The deals are mostly frameworks and are not formalized treaties. Negotiations are still ongoing,\" Pullam said. Additionally, the administration has already prepared to roll out tariff alternatives quickly if IEEPA tariffs are overturned. \"We would just lose federal revenue and move onto another stage of the negotiations,\" she added.\nIf the government does need to repay importers, it cannot undo the other impacts of the tariffs, like lost business. But Pullam says more extreme fears about the impact of court decisions do not concern her. \"It will not sink the economy. Claims to the contrary sound more like desperation,\" she said.\nShort said companies also need to keep in mind that regardless of the outcome of those court proceedings, it's clear that tariff and trade disruptions are far from over.\n\"The reality is tariff volatility has become the new normal. Multiple Section 232 investigations are active — spanning sectors such as lumber, pharmaceuticals, furniture, aerospace, trucks and truck parts, seafood, and critical minerals. As we saw with copper in July, these investigations can swiftly lead to new tariffs. The steel and aluminum tariff had 700 product categories added to it as well,\" he said.\nLowell said the court decision has only increased uncertainty for importers.\n\"At a practical level, nothing is new today compared to this time last week. But we're still seeing a flurry of questions indicating the ruling is creating internal questions for businesses,\" he said. \"Most of those questions assume the tariffs are here to stay. No one seems to be counting on the courts to save them from tariffs,\" he added.","content_hash":"f7cc6139a38b55a1ff50ff074ab20254","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":9589,"method_rank":0}

","published_at":"2025-09-02T14:15:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"Nestlé’s reputation as one of the consumer goods sector’s dependable names has taken a knock over the last couple of years and a second change at the top in 12 months – this time for personal reasons – has left industry watchers uncertain what lies ahead for the world’s largest food maker.\nTo say Nestlé’s dismissal of CEO – and company veteran Laurent Freixe – for an “undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate” took the market by surprise is something of an understatement.\nIn part, the reaction can be explained by the fact Freixe, with almost 40 years at Nestlé, was, when he took the helm a year ago, seen as a safe pair of hands who could rejuvenate a business that had seen sales growth slow and, to some, become less focused and a little bloated.\n“Laurent Freixe’s departure … has left us shocked,” RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones said yesterday (1 September). “When he took over as CEO just over a year ago following Mark Schneider's ejection from the role, we thought of him as a Nestlé lifer who would restore the company’s reputation of slightly boring predictability. How wrong we were.”\nSchneider’s departure, announced last August, may itself have raised eyebrows – at the time, one analyst described the move as “abrupt” – but Freixe was seen as the right successor to improve Nestlé’s execution and breathe fresh life into sales.\nHowever, the company’s results for the second quarter of this year were seen as a disappointment, with underlying sales declining when the market was expecting growth.\nPerhaps Nestlé’s share price has been the clearest sign investors hadn’t been impressed with the progress made under Freixe. Up to the close of trading yesterday, just hours before the company’s surprise announcement, shares in Nestlé had fallen almost 17% in the last 12 months.\nNestlé had started receiving anonymous reports via staff-disclosure channels in May. The company held an internal investigation during which Freixe denied the relationship. The Nestlé board then decided to open an “external investigation with the support of independent outside counsel, which had a wider remit”, a spokesperson says. The result was Freixe’s departure. The relationship breached Nestlé’s “code of business conduct”, the company said yesterday.\n“This was a necessary decision,” chairman Paul Bulcke said. “Nestlé’s values and governance are strong foundations of our company. I thank Laurent for his years of service at Nestlé.”\nNestlé’s new CEO\nThere will be plenty of speculation about whether Nestlé should've appointed Freixe in the first place. Inside Paradeplatzclaims Freixe had had a relationship with another Nestlé employee when he led the company's business in Hungary. The relationship is said to have led to the pair getting married.\nThere will also be questions about the efficacy of Nestlé's investigations into the claims about the latest relationship once it received tip-offs earlier this year.\nNevertheless, for industry watchers and investors, the big questions centre on what the tumult at the top of Nestlé means for the company's direction. There are differing views about what could come next.\nThe KitKat and Maggi maker has appointed Philipp Navratil, the CEO of Nestlé’s coffee business Nespresso, as its new chief executive.\nNavratil has worked at Nestlé since 2001, holding roles in Central America before becoming the SVP of the company’s coffee strategic business unit in 2020.\nBernstein analyst Callum Elliott said today the appointment also came as “something of a surprise to us”, pointing to the fact Navratil was running Nestlé’s coffee business in Mexico as recently as 2020.\n“We expect that investors will question the appointment of another Nestlé insider and perhaps also the seemingly rapid timescale of his appointment which presumably implies that no extensive external search was undertaken,” Elliott added.\nThe speed of events would make the lack of a wide-ranging outside search understandable, although some may argue a board should always maintain a list of possible candidates for chief executive.\nIn yesterday’s statement, Bulcke – who himself is set to leave Nestlé next year – was keen to underline Navratil’s credentials. “Philipp is recognised for his impressive track record of achieving results in challenging environments. Renowned for his dynamic presence, he inspires teams and leads with a collaborative, inclusive management style,” he said.\nHow might Nestlé’s strategy change?\nIn April next year, Nestlé is also set to have a new chairman. Three months ago, the Nescafé and Perrier manufacturer said Bulcke would not stand for re-election as chairman at the company’s next AGM in April. Bulcke has worked for the group for more than 40 years, including nine as CEO up to 2016 before he was succeeded by Mark Schneider.\nNestlé vice chair Pablo Isla, a member of the board since 2018, has been lined up to succeed Bulcke. Isla is best known for his 17 years at Inditex, with six as CEO at the multinational fashion group and then another 11 also as chairman.\nIn yesterday’s statement, Navratil indicated he would push on with Nestlé’s strategy as it stands. Last year, Freixe said the company would look to “invest for growth”, focus on “big bets” and “fix rather than sell” most of its under-performing businesses.\nIt’s just months since Freixe’s own review, which, alongside the talk of investing to accelerate sales, did see Nestlé cut its medium-term outlook for organic growth.\n“I fully embrace the company’s strategic direction, as well as the action plan in place to drive Nestlé's performance,” Navratil said. “I look forward to working closely with the entire leadership of the company, in alignment with the board, chairman Paul Bulcke and chairman-designate Pablo Isla, to accelerate execution and to drive the value creation plan with intensity.”\nRBC’s Jones believes “no big change in strategy seems likely in the short term” adding: “We don’t know the new CEO, Philipp Navratil. His background seems to have been largely in coffee and he is relatively young by the traditional standards of senior Nestlé managers at Nestlé: according to Google he was born in 1976. In the circumstances, it’s hard to argue if the board has decided on a different approach.”\nJefferies analyst David Hayes says some Nestlé investors may be concerned Navratil will look to conduct another review of the group so soon after Freixe led the last reassessment.\n“While he has already outlined his support of the current plans laid out, we assume he will look to take ownership of his own agenda – and direct reports – in time,” Hayes said.\n“That could see another review of investment plans and margin targets and portfolio assessment. In the meantime, that uncertainty and the lack of consistency at the top of the company are likely to be unhelpful to the share price for now, we think.”\nAt the time of writing (13:47 CEST), Nestlé’s share price is down 0.94% on the day, suggesting, overall, a muted market response to last night’s announcement.\nBaader Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx posits that a “positive” way to look at the change at the top of Nestlé is the installation of a new CEO and chairman could spark much-needed change at the business.\nHe argues “a more severe pruning of the portfolio” at Nestlé is necessary. “I think many of the categories that are under-performing at the moment and have been under-performing various times over the last ten years should probably no longer be part of Nestlé,” von Arx says, pointing to assets including frozen foods and the company’s chocolate business in Europe “excluding KitKat”.\nHe adds: “Then Nestlé should focus on categories where, product-wise, it can really make a difference, where it can charge a premium price, where it can generate an EBIT margin between 15 and 20% and not continue to struggle fighting in categories where there is significant competition from private label, where there's a lack of differentiation in product and where size alone does not guarantee a sustainable business model anymore.”\n\"No more “boring” Nestlé – what next after shock CEO sacking?\" was originally created and published by Just Food, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\nSaudi Arabia Automotive Aftermarket Trends, Competition, Forecast & Opportunities, 2030F - Rising Vehicle Ownership, Popular Vehicle Customization Trends, and a Digital Retail Shift Drive Growth\nThe Saudi Arabia Automotive Aftermarket was valued at USD 6.7 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 9.5 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 6.50%.\nThe Saudi Arabian automotive aftermarket industry is experiencing significant growth, driven by a variety of factors. One of the main drivers is the increasing number of vehicles on the road, as the country continues to see a rise in car ownership due to economic development and growing disposable incomes. As the number of vehicles expands, the demand for replacement parts, maintenance services, and customization options grows steadily.\nThe popularity of vehicle customization, especially among younger consumers who prefer unique modifications, is further boosting the demand for aftermarket products. Technological advancements in the automotive industry, such as the adoption of electric vehicles and smart car systems, are also contributing to a shift in aftermarket services, creating opportunities for new products and services tailored to modern vehicles. In alignment with Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia has invested over USD 5 billion in developing local automotive manufacturing capabilities. This includes partnerships with global manufacturers like Lucid Motors and Hyundai, aiming to produce over 300,000 vehicles annually by 2025. Such investments not only enhance domestic production but also stimulate the demand for aftermarket components, as a growing vehicle base requires maintenance and parts replacement.\nThe automotive aftermarket is undergoing dynamic trends, particularly with the rise of digitalization and e-commerce platforms. Consumers are increasingly turning to online marketplaces to purchase parts, accessories, and services, which is reshaping the retail landscape. The shift towards online platforms allows consumers to compare prices, access a wider range of products, and enjoy the convenience of doorstep delivery. In response, businesses are adapting by enhancing their digital presence, offering seamless online shopping experiences, and using digital tools to better manage inventory and customer relationships.\nMoreover, the growing awareness of the benefits of preventive maintenance and the increasing adoption of advanced automotive technologies have encouraged consumers to invest in high-quality aftermarket products to enhance vehicle performance and longevity. The Saudi government is significantly investing in local automotive production to reduce dependency on imports and stimulate economic growth. In 2024, over 1,300 industrial licenses were awarded, attracting investments exceeding USD 13.3 billion. This initiative is part of the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP), aiming to increase the number of factories to about 36,000 by 2035 and tripling the industrial GDP.\nMarket Drivers\nGrowth in Vehicle Ownership\nThe growing number of vehicles on the road is one of the most significant drivers of the automotive aftermarket in Saudi Arabia. As more individuals and families acquire vehicles, whether due to rising incomes, favorable financing options, or a shift towards personal mobility, the need for aftermarket products and services naturally increases. More vehicles require regular maintenance, replacement parts, and customization, leading to a higher demand for aftermarket services. This trend is expected to continue as the automotive market in Saudi Arabia grows, thus fueling further demand for aftermarket solutions.\nCustomization is a rising trend among Saudi consumers, especially the younger demographic. Vehicle owners increasingly seek ways to personalize their vehicles to reflect their lifestyle, taste, and identity. From performance upgrades to cosmetic enhancements like body kits, custom wheels, and interiors, aftermarket businesses are seeing a growing demand for these products. The desire for unique and individualized vehicles is driving growth in the sector, offering businesses lucrative opportunities to cater to these specific needs with diverse products and services.\nKey Market Challenges\nSkilled Labor Shortage\nThe automotive aftermarket industry in Saudi Arabia faces a significant challenge with the shortage of skilled labor. As vehicles become more technologically advanced, there is an increasing demand for technicians who can handle complex systems such as ADAS, electric drivetrains, and diagnostics. However, there is a gap between the demand for such skilled professionals and the availability of adequately trained workers. The scarcity of specialized technicians poses a challenge for businesses aiming to provide high-quality services and meet the evolving needs of consumers.\nKey Market Trends\nDigital Transformation in Retail\nOne of the most significant trends in Saudi Arabia's automotive aftermarket is the digital transformation of retail and sales channels. Consumers are increasingly turning to online platforms to purchase automotive parts and accessories, and e-commerce is gaining momentum. Retailers are investing in user-friendly websites, mobile apps, and digital marketing to engage customers. This shift to digital platforms not only offers convenience but also enables consumers to compare prices, read reviews, and access a wider range of products than what traditional brick-and-mortar stores offer. The integration of advanced technologies into vehicles, such as autonomous driving features and electric powertrains, is influencing the aftermarket sector.\nAs these new technologies become more common, demand for specialized aftermarket products, such as software for diagnostics, calibration, and parts specific to electric and autonomous vehicles, is expected to rise. E-commerce in Saudi Arabia is experiencing rapid growth, with projections indicating it will account for 46% of the retail sector by 2030. As of the fourth quarter of 2024, the Kingdom had 40,953 registered e-commerce businesses, marking a 10% year-on-year increase.\nKey Attributes:\nReport Scope\nKey Market Players:\nPetromin Corporation\nAljomaih Automotive\nAbdul Latif Jameel Motors\nAl Rajhi Takaful\nBahri & Mazroei Group\nCeer Motors\nACDelco (General Motors)\nMann+Hummel\nBosch Automotive Aftermarket\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Automotive Trading Group\nSaudi Arabia Automotive Aftermarket, By Vehicle Type:\nTwo-Wheelers\nCommercial Vehicle\nPassenger Cars\nSaudi Arabia Automotive Aftermarket, By Component:\nTires\nBody & Mechanical parts\nBatteries\nAccessories & Vehicle Care Products\nLubricants\nSaudi Arabia Automotive Aftermarket, By Sales Channel:\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com ResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Apple stock rose almost 3% Wednesday.\nThe Justice Department had pushed for a forced sale of the company's search business and for the judge to order an end to multibillion-dollar contracts that have all but assured Google's market dominance, moves the judge denied to make.\n\"Plaintiffs have not shown that their behavioral remedies will be ineffective without the immediate divestiture of Chrome,\" Mehta said.\nThe court's task, Mehta said, is to discern between conduct that maintains a monopoly through anticompetitive acts as distinct from conduct that fuels a monopoly's growth as a consequence of a superior product.\n\"After two complete trials, this court cannot find that Google's market dominance is sufficiently attributable to its illegal conduct to justify divestiture,\" the judge said of Chrome, adding that such \"radical structural relief\" would require a more heightened causal connection.\nJudge Mehta also declined to grant the DOJ's request for a contingent divestment of Google's Android operating system, writing that the government \"did not present any evidence to justify a contingent structural remedy.\"\nThroughout the decision, the judge noted the rise of search competition posed by generative AI, which he said presents \"strong reasons not to jolt the system and to allow market forces to do the work.\"\nWhile Google will be able to keep Chrome and Android, as well as continue making payments to distribution partners, the company also has to make a number of changes.\nThe search giant is barred from entering exclusive contracts related to the distribution of Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant, or Gemini. Google also can't condition the licensing of its Play Store or any other Google app on the distribution or preloading of other Google services or condition receiving revenue-sharing payments from one Google app on the placement of another app.\nGoogle will also be required to provide \"Qualified Competitors\" with certain search index and user-interaction data, as well as search and search text ads syndication services.\nThe decision is one of two major antitrust lawsuits that Google lost to the Justice Department and US states in the past year.\nThe DOJ and a group of states prevailed over Google in August last year in two consolidated cases that alleged the tech giant abused its dominance in online search.\n\"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" Mehta wrote in his ruling on the antitrust claims.\nGoogle was defeated by the DOJ and 35 states, along with Guam, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, in another antitrust case decided in April. That case, which alleged that Google unfairly held on to its market dominance in search engine advertising and search engine text advertising, is pending in Alexandria, Va., and set to begin its remedies phase in September.\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president for regulatory affairs, said in a response to the decision that because competition for the way people find information remains intense, Google continues to strongly disagree with the court's decision to hold it liable for monopolizing search.\n\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals. We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we’re reviewing the decision closely,\" Mulholland said.\nThe search giant argued at trial that it gained its search dominance not by securing exclusive contracts, but by offering \"the best\" search engine on the market. Google claimed that despite holding monopolies in the search markets, its contracts neither violated antitrust laws nor harmed competition.\nThe judge's ruling in that case also held that Google violated antitrust law in the market for \"general search text\" ads, which appear at the top of search results pages.\nFor Google, the judge's decision affects a huge profit engine. In 2024, Google's search engine advertising business generated more than $198 billion in revenue, accounting for 56.6% of parent company Alphabet's total revenue.\nThe figure handily exceeds Google's search engine advertising revenue in 2023, which totaled $175 billion, despite its antitrust defeat and a shift in online searches to artificial intelligence-based chatbots.\nAs of June 2023, Google controlled 91% of the global search engine market across all computing platforms and 87% in the US, according to Statcounter. On mobile, Google's market share was even higher at 95%.\nMore recent data from Statcounter from July 2025 showed Google's global share of the search engine market dropped to 89.5%, dipping below 90% for the first time since 2015. Statcounter does not benchmark traditional search engine traffic against newer search techniques using chatbots. According to the data, Google ceded traffic to traditional search engine competitors Bing and Yandex.\nThe judge's decision in the search case came after a two-month trial in 2023 that included testimony from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, as well as executives from search market rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and DuckDuckGo.\nThe DOJ and states' claims were handled together because of their nearly identical allegations that said Google held on to its monopoly by paying companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Mozilla to make Google the default search provider on mobile phones, tablets, and browsers.\nAt the time of the lawsuit, Google held a 90% share in online search.\nGoogle's disputed behavior revolves around contracts it entered with manufacturers of computer and mobile devices, as well as with browser services, browser developers, and wireless carriers.\nThese contracts, the government claimed, violated antitrust laws because they made Google the mandatory default search provider.\nCompanies that agreed to those exclusive contracts have included Apple, LG, Samsung, AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Mozilla. Those deals are why smartphones from manufacturers including Samsung, one of the world's largest smartphone makers, come preloaded with Google's various apps.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The $50,000 limit allowed Reflect to jumpstart its early projects. Co-owner Christy Silva told CNBC her company plans to continue using the interest-free financing option to scale the business. \"A lot of their stuff is more expensive. But it's the convenience of them delivering it, accounting for what's there, and the ability to schedule with them. They're super helpful,\" Silva said in an interview, adding that SRS' Roof Hub customer relationship management platform provides a friendly user experience. Reflect is one of the professionals utilizing the SRS trade credit program, which allows contractors to buy supplies and pay for them later. SRS is now part of Home Depot , which last summer completed its more than $18 billion acquisition of the network of independent distributors serving roofers, landscapers, and pool contractors. It's the crown jewel of the home improvement giant's new push to grab a bigger share of pro contractors, as well as the \"complex pro\" customer base — those working on multi-phase, high-dollar sign projects. \"The hidden gem of this SRS deal was trade credit,\" according to Mizuho analyst David Bellinger. The trade credit puts Home Depot in a position to act as an \"advisor plus financier for these projects,\" Bellinger said. \"That's something they never had, and this is just a huge unlock to get that bigger customer now.\" Sure enough, on its fiscal second-quarter earnings call earlier last month, Home Depot management expressed satisfaction with the surge in trade-credit business from the SRS acquisition. \"Today, we have several thousand pros with a trade credit account, and we've seen a double-digit lift in their spend across channels once these pros started using their trade credits,\" said Ann-Marie Campbell, a senior executive VP of U.S. stores and operations. \"We want our pros to be able to transact with our stores seamlessly, including checking and using the available credit on their account while they're shopping in our stores,\" Campbell added. She said that trade credit customers should be able to make in-store purchases at Home Depot locations using trade credit later this year. Looking to expand its trade credit and distribution footprint, Home Depot announced in June a more than $4 billion bid to buy GMS, which would become part of the SRS division and add a complementary network of drywall, ceilings, and steel framing suppliers. Last week, the deal cleared the Canadian Competition Bureau, the last antitrust regulator that needed to sign off. To be sure, Home Depot has been catering to pros long before the SRS acquisition. Already in place were several pro-targeted offerings, including loyalty programs, business tools, and distribution and fulfillment centers. SRS and eventually GMS promise to super-charge them. According to Home Depot's 2024 annual report , SRS from deal completion through the end of last year contributed $6.4 billion of net sales to Home Depot's top line. \"The increase in net sales for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by SRS,\" the annual report said. Home Depot's fiscal 2024 revenue increased 4.5% year-over-year to $159.5 billion. Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail told CNBC on earnings day, Aug. 19, that the company's sales are about 55% pro and about 45% DIY customers. In the company's fiscal second quarter, which ended Feb. 2, McPhail said both categories saw increases \"relatively in line with one another.\" He did not elaborate further. Leaning into pro makes sense because DIY depends more heavily on housing turnover. People move, and they want to fix up their houses. Residential real estate sales, however, have been stagnant under the weight of high home prices and elevated mortgage rates. Home building isn't lighting the world on fire either — but at least, contractors are steadier customers. HD YTD mountain Home Depot YTD Shares of Home Depot have certainly caught a bid since the middle of June, with a rally accelerating as expectations increased for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut later this month. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled on Friday, Aug. 22, touching off a market surge that also saw Home Depot stock increase 3.8% on the session. For the month of August, Home Depot stock has gained 10.7%. Shares were down slightly on Tuesday. The question is: Will bond yields drop if central bankers start cutting rates again? Last year, the Fed cut rates three times, and bond yields, which drive all kinds of customer loans, did not drop appreciably. That kept shorter-duration home equity loans and longer-duration mortgages elevated. Jim Cramer said on CNBC last week that a boost in renovations depends on cheaper home equity loans, and a boost in housing turnover depends on cheaper mortgage rates. Bellinger said that both Home Depot and its biggest competitor, Lowe's , have clearly identified a sizable upside opportunity with pro contractors. In fact, Lowe's on Aug. 20 delivered an even better quarter than Home Depot and announced an $8.8 billion deal to buy Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of drywall, insulation, and other interior building products for large residential and commercial professionals. Foundation's business is similar to Home Depot's SRS. Last year, Home Depot executives pinpointed the total addressable market for pros to be worth roughly $250 billion. \"That's where the real growth is in this whole category. You get that do-it-yourself business, it's always good. It's not going anywhere. But it just seems like this pro and complex pro is where you're getting this high single-digit annual revenue growth,\" Bellinger said. If all goes to plan at Home Depot, Bellinger said, \"The complex pro that they're going after with these bigger deals [GMS included], that should be a good chunk of the business in 10 years. It may be that 10% to 20% of their business is this really giant, heavy spending complex pro.\" (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long HD. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

(NVDA) or Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) stumbles. The dominance also leads to portfolio risks, with diversification suffering. For others, the worries are overblown, gains have historically been powered by a small group of megacaps, and this is simply tech’s latest time to shine.\nThe debate is becoming more urgent as Nividia, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. (META) account for more than 30% of the benchmark index, more than three times their weighting from a decade ago. Gains for Nividia, Microsoft and Meta alone account for about 270 points of the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) 579-point advance in 2025, or nearly half of this year’s 9.8% rally.\nFor Scott Chronert, Citi Research’s managing director, the concentration is a badge of honor, well-deserved for a group that continues to deliver unparalleled growth in sales and earnings. The five biggest — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet and Amazon — increased profits by 26% in the second quarter, compared with estimates for 15%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. The S&P 500 as a whole saw earnings rise by 11% from a year ago.\nThe biggest tech companies have “earned” their weightings as a function of growth metrics, Chronert said. To him, valuations aren’t stretched based on the profit forecasts that they have consistently been able to meet. On a price\/earnings to growth basis, no cause for alarm exists, he said.\n“The PEG ratio for the Mag 7 is not materially different than for the rest of the market,” Chronert said. Valuation isn’t an issue, he adds, “so long as earnings growth expectations are met or beat” — a bar he conceded could be getting harder to surpass as targets swell.\nStill, there are reasons why the tech megacap domination is likely to persist without incident. They generate vast amount of cash in good economic times and bad, making them growth and defensive plays at the same time. They also stand to get outsize benefits from recent Trump administration policy changes, including carve outs from some of the more punitive trade policies.\nEven with ample cause to expect the cohort to continue to dominate the market, their outsize weighting in the S&P 500 leaves investors with a potentially uncomfortable concentration in their portfolios. Nvidia by itself is nearly 8% of the index.\n“Page one in your finance textbook says that you should diversify your investments, and the reality is today that you are not diversified if you are invested in the S&P 500,” Apollo Chief Economist Torsten Slok said. Nvidia has the biggest weight of any individual stock since data began in 1981, according to Slok.\nIt’s a risk that hedge funds have been taking steps to avoid, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis of 13F filings after the second quarter. Among institutional investors, Nvidia was the most under-owned large cap technology stock relative to its index weighting, the firm said, by 2.41 percentage points. Microsoft was under-owned by 2.39 percentage points and Apple at 1.66, the data showed. The five biggest came in at the widest discrepancy to the index weighting in at least 16 years.\nEmily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investments, says she has a “love-hate relationship” with the market concentration.\n“It is made up of very high-quality companies with little resemblance to 2000 (they have strong earnings growth and balance sheets), but we recognize having a few stocks represent of the largest asset classes (U.S. equities) in a portfolio is placing way too many eggs in one basket,” she said.\nRoland suggests looking at US mid-cap stocks as a “compliment,” as they “offer cheaper valuations, sector diversification, and have exposure to the capex industrial boom that is happening across the country.”\nHistory offers some guidance for how difficult it can be to assess the market in times of tight concentration. Take Apple. It held the crown of the world’s most valuable company for much of the past decade, climbing more than 1,600% from the end of 2011 through the end of 2024. Not owning it, or being underweight would have left an investor trailing most benchmarks.\nThen there are the instances when market dominance turned into a wipeout, most obviously during the dot-com meltdown, but also in the 1960s and 1970s, reminds Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.\nHe recalls the “Nifty 50” or “One Decision” stocks — “a sainted few that you could safely buy and hold forever,” he said. “Those included bulletproof names like Kodak, Polaroid, Kresge (KMart), JC Penney — all veterans of bankruptcy court years later.”\nAnalysis by Furey Research Partners found peaks in the weightings of the top-five companies were associated with future market “leadership changes,” indicating investors may be in store for more rotation, potentially toward lagging small cap stocks.\n“The lesson is that technology marches on. IBM was one of those stocks, and while it is around all-time highs, it has long been surpassed by the current tech winners. Intel was THE semiconductor stock, while PCs with AMD chips were considered budget alternatives. Look at them now,” Sosnick said.\nTech Chart of the Day\nThe Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) Index rallied for a fifth consecutive month in August.

The other, currently called North American Grocery Co., will include slower-selling brands like Maxwell House, Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The official names of the two companies will be released later.\nKraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split. It expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.\nWhen the company formed in 2015, it wanted to capitalize on its massive scale. But shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking out healthier options.\nKraft Heinz and other food producers have tried to follow those trends. In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks. But the company continued to struggle.\nKraft Heinz's net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.\n“Kraft Heinz’s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,” Executive Chairman Miguel Patricio said in a statement.\nThe path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.\n3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International — a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes — and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It’s known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.\nThe deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz’s new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.\nAt the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought for a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.\nIn 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.\nAt the time, the prevailing attitude was that the bigger the conglomerate, the more companies would save through sharing services like accounting, said Russell Zwanka, an associate professor of food marketing at Western Michigan University.\nBut even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid. The push to remove artificial flavors and dyes added further costs.\n“The customer has become much more diligent in what they’re buying, and so it’s making it more difficult to allocate your resources properly,” Zwanka said.\nKraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart’s Great Value brand is 98 cents.\nIn 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion. Many investors blamed the company’s leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.\nBuffett told CNBC Tuesday that he’s disappointed that Kraft Heinz decided to go forwarded with the split, which will cost the company $300 million and take a year to complete. He's also frustrated that shareholders won’t get a vote on the move.\nBerkshire has held onto its massive 27% Kraft Heinz stake, making it the company's largest shareholder, even as stock price fell roughly 70% since the merger. Buffett has acknowledged in the past that Berkshire overpaid for the investment. Berkshire took a $3.76 billion write-down on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz in the second quarter of this year.\n“It certainly didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don’t think taking them apart will fix it,” Buffett said to CNBC. The Associated Press left messages seeking comment Tuesday with Buffett and 3G.\nZwanka said the split likely won't impact consumers. He thinks individual brands like Oscar Mayer will be bought by other companies.\n“These brands have survived over 100 years and they will continue to survive,\" he said. “You just have to find a company willing to invest the resources in either maintaining a mature category until your competitors drop off or growing a growth category like Philly Cream Cheese and all the Heinz brands.”\nKellogg Co. provided the blueprint when it split into two companies in 2023, Zwanka said. Last year, Mars bought one of the companies, dubbed Kellanova, which owned snack brands like Pringles. Italian confectioner Ferrero announced in July that it planned to buy WK Kellogg, the cereal company.\nOther food companies are following in its footsteps. Late last month, Keurig Dr Pepper said it would buy the owner of Peet’s Coffee and then split itself in two, with one company selling coffee and the other selling cold beverages. Keurig and Dr Pepper merged in 2018.\nZwanka said his biggest concern is for Kraft Heinz's 36,000 employees, who now face more than a year of uncertainty before the split is finalized.\n“The brands will survive. You just hope the people will move with the brands,” he said.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said that its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.\nKraft Heinz has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh.\nKraft Heinz shares fell nearly 7% Tuesday to close at $26.02 per share.\n___\nDurbin reported from Detroit.

In the latest indication of ascent for the Harvard Business School graduate and ex-Goldman Sachs banker, he became a director earlier this year for one of Mousse’s main holding entities, occupying a role vacated following the death of longtime Chanel executive Michael Rena, according to registry filings.\nHe’s also the son of Charles Heilbronn, founder of Mousse and the firm’s chairman since 1991. Charles is a half brother of Alain and Gerard Wertheimer, third-generation heirs to the Chanel fortune.\nThe Wertheimers are grandsons of one of the original business partners of Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel who started the fashion house in 1910. They shared the same mother as Charles, Eliane Heilbronn, who was considered the empire’s matriarch until she died last year. Her sons are all in their 70s.\nA representative for Mousse declined to comment.\nThe Wertheimers, credited with owning equal shares of closely-held Chanel, each have a net worth of about $45 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Their fortune has largely held up in the post-pandemic era, even as a downturn in luxury goods hit rivals including LVMH, led by Bernard Arnault, and Kering SA, controlled by the Pinault family.\nArthur Heilbronn’s rise gives some indication of the succession plans of the media-shy extended family, which has long sought to keep its wealth out of the public eye. Gerard Wertheimer’s son David has started a private equity venture, though there’s no indication that other children of the two heirs are involved with Mousse.\n“They feel less like a family office and more like a private endowment for a luxury empire,” Marc Debois, founder of FO-Next, an advisory firm for family offices, said of Mousse. Among its peers, “what puts them in the true top 1% isn’t size; it’s time; dividend-fed, multi-cycle patience.”\nAt least one-fifth of individuals among the world’s 500 biggest fortunes now have a family office that help to oversee wealth totaling more than $4 trillion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nA recent survey of 317 family office clients at UBS Group AG found just over half of them have a succession plan in place, with those in the US and Southeast Asia most likely to have made those arrangements.\n“It’s a huge topic,” Eric Landolt, UBS Group AG’s global head of family advisory, said on succession plans for family offices. “It’s something that comes up in almost every discussion.”\nHeilbronn joined Mousse as a director in 2019, moving to managing director a few years later, according to his LinkedIn profile. He’s currently co-head of private equity and venture direct investing with another managing director, Paul Yun. He was named to the supervisory board of Rothschild & Co. after Mousse Partners made one of its most high-profile investments to date by joining two other French dynasties in 2023 to help take the bank private. He’s also a director of Almacantar, a London-based real estate firm behind large-scale projects in the English capital.\nChanel’s ultimate holding company is the Wertheimers’ Cayman Islands-based Mousse Investments Ltd., which doesn’t reveal financial numbers. Mousse Partners is the investment division and also has offices in Beijing and Hong Kong.\nMousse Investments describes itself as having a “broad range of asset classes in public and private markets” in addition to Chanel. While Mousse doesn’t disclose how much money it controls, some companies have named Mousse Partners as a participant in deals or as a shareholder. That points to investments in stocks, real estate, credit and private equity.\nMousse Partners employs more than three dozen people worldwide and counts former banking analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. among its employees. Suzi Kwon Cohen joined as chief investment officer almost a decade ago after leading North America private equity for Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, putting her among the top female executives in the historically male-dominated family office space.\nOver the years, Mousse Partners has backed a wide range of startups including mental health provider Brightside Health, digital advertising firm Brandtech Group, biotechnology company Evolved by Nature, food company Harmless Harvest and health-care provider Thirty Madison. Last year Mousse joined the billionaire L’Oreal SA heiress investing in high-end clothing brand The Row.\nNot all bets have proved lucrative. Beautycounter failed last year while a pair of Mousse’s public holdings are languishing. The family office has a roughly 8% stake in listed French digital entertainment company NetGem SA and 5.7% in hair products maker Olaplex Holdings Inc. Both companies’ share prices collapsed from their initial public offering levels and haven’t recovered.\nMousse has also been invested for decades in France’s publishing and audiovisual industry through Media-Participations, which owns a range of book publishing, specialized media, cartoon and comic businesses.\nThe family behind Chanel, a maker of $970 sunglasses, $6,500 handbags and $23,400 J12 watches, has joined other French luxury billionaires with media holdings at home. Bernard Arnault owns newspapers Les Echos and Le Parisien along with the glossy weekly Paris Match. The Pinault clan owns magazines Le Point and Point de Vue.\nWhile Mousse isn’t involved in Chanel’s operations, both companies have offices in a glass tower just south of Central Park in Manhattan that’s famed for its pricey rents and list of major financial tenants. Both Arthur and Charles Heilbronn listed their workplace address at that New York premises on Manhattan’s “Billionaires Row,” where Alain Wertheimer has also long-held an office.\nBehind closed doors on that street, the next steps in the succession plans for Mousse Partners may already be taking shape, though it’s unlikely anyone in the dynasty behind Chanel will comment publicly on the matter.\n“We’re a very discreet family,” Gerard Wertheimer once said in 2001. “We never talk.”\n--With assistance from Julius Domoney.\n(Updates with quote and extra position in 13th and 14th paragraphs, respectively.)","content_hash":"0a6a32f685986e07ed718c513037596b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6503,"method_rank":0}

","published_at":"2025-09-02T17:45:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"\"Dogs of the Dow\" is a classic investment strategy. The idea is to find top-tier companies whose stocks are trading at unusually low prices, presumably for temporary reasons.\nLow stock prices have the opposite effect on dividend yields, especially among stocks with long operating histories and rich cash flows. So, the quick and easy way to find these proven winners under price-slashing pressure is to start with the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) components and sort them by their dividend yield. Buying the top results sets your portfolio up to benefit as the struggling giants get back on their feet.\nNow, the Dogs of the Dow model isn't perfect. Besides short-lived discounts on top stocks, it also finds some slow-moving cash machines whose dividend yields simply stay generous for years. In fact, that's how I would classify all three of the Dow's top dividend yields today.\n1. Verizon: 6.2% dividend yield\nGenerous dividends are not unusual in the telecommunications industry. Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) is a shining example, with an average yield of 5.2% over the last decade. To put this lofty payout in perspective, the average Dow yield was 1.5% over the same period.\nBut the current 6.2% yield is even greater. As of Sept. 1, Verizon's stock has lagged behind the broader stock market in the last five years, posting a negative return of 25.4% over that period. With Verizon's dividends reinvested in my shares of the stock, you'd have a total return of 0.1% instead.\nVerizon is still the king of the wireless hill, with 146.1 million retail connections (combining prepaid and contract-bound smartphones, tablets, and Internet of Things devices into a single metric). Runner-up T-Mobile US(NASDAQ: TMUS) sports 132.8 million total customers and AT&T(NYSE: T) pulls into third place, with 118.2 million total mobility subscribers.\nT-Mobile keeps stealing customers from its older and larger mega-rivals. T-Mobile's subscriber count rose 5.5% year over year, well ahead of 2.3% for AT&T and 1.2% in Verizon's reports.\nSo Verizon's stock has been lagging for good reason. Subscriber growth is a crucial element of this industry's financial results, and Verizon isn't keeping up with the Joneses.\nThat said, Verizon is an efficient cash machine with a shareholder-friendly dividend policy. You could adopt the Dogs of the Dow philosophy and buy Verizon stock, hoping for a turnaround with greater growth someday. Or, you could simply accept Verizon's modest growth and negative stock returns in exchange for a top-notch dividend yield. Income investors love Verizon's reliable dividend checks.\n2. Chevron: 4.3% dividend yield\nEnergy stocks also tend to pay above-average dividends. Chevron(NYSE: CVX) has averaged a 4.2% yield over the last 10 years, and its yield sits exactly on this long-term average level today.\nThe giant oil and gas producer expects fossil fuels to stay in the \"mix\" of energy sources in the long run, as the global energy demand keeps increasing. Planning ahead for a more eco-friendly future, Chevron is developing renewable alternatives like biodiesel, hydrogen fuel cells, and recycled oil.\nSo Chevron is doing what it can to stay relevant in a rapidly changing energy market. The results are a mixed bag so far, with lower revenues and free cash flows since the inflation panic of 2022.\nI appreciate Chevron's research efforts, but the company still looks strikes me as an obsolete business in the long run. Verizon will pretty much always have plenty of wireless customers to fight for, while Chevron's core business is fading out.\nGranted, Chevron will stay firmly profitable for years to come, and maybe even decades. And who knows -- maybe the company comes up with the perfect fuel cell or biodiesel technology eventually. Still, I'd much rather park my cash in Verizon's higher-yielding dividend garage in the long run.\n3. Merck: 3.7% dividend yield\nRounding out the Dow's top three dividend yields today is pharmaceutical developer Merck(NYSE: MRK). This is the closest thing to a classic Dogs of the Dow investment at the moment, as Merck's stock price took a 29% cut over the last year.\nMerck's best-selling cancer treatment Keytruda has been around since 2008, and its key patents start to expire in 2028. Facing a revenue-crushing inrush of biosimilars, Merck is reformulating Keytruda with less-invasive injection options. Falling off the patent cliff will undoubtedly lower Keytruda's financial contributions, even if Merck's subcutaneous injections are more convenient.\nRemember, patient preferences never tell the whole story. For example, my insurance company was quick to embrace generic options when Teva Pharmaceutical Industries(NYSE: TEVA) lost its patent protection for my multiple sclerosis treatment, Copaxone. Teva's freshly patented reformulation with fewer injections per week didn't really matter -- shifting insurance coverage sent me to the generic version by Viatris(NASDAQ: VTRS) right away.\nI don't know if the same scenario will play out around the Keytruda patent expiration, but I've seen the pharma industry's patent drama in action. Merck faces significant financial issues here.\nThen again, the Keytruda expiration isn't Merck's first rodeo, and the company always has a plethora of potential blockbusters under development. All things considered, Merck's stock could be a solid Dogs of the Dow investment in September.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Merck right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Merck, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Merck wasn’t one of them.

Whether he will be allowed to continue to pursue the policy or not, his actions have already had an impact on domestic businesses, with the likes of Home Depot and AriZona Iced Tea just two examples of companies that have reluctantly conceded they may have to raise prices for consumers to cushion the impact of the rising import costs of essential materials.\nBeyond the United States, Trump’s brazen approach has already stoked anti-American consumer sentiment, notably in Canada and India, where shoppers have expressed their disapproval of his trade policies, rhetoric or conduct in office more generally, by boycotting U.S.-made goods in favor of local brands.\nHere are some of the brands who have already expressed their disquiet about the state of play.\nLevi’s\nThe British arm of Levi’s, the iconic U.S. jeans brands, is the latest company to warn that the “risk of rising anti-Americanism as a consequence of the Trump tariffs and governmental policies” could lead to “consumer preferences possibly shifting away from U.S. products and brands [and] increasing the willingness to substitute and buy national\/European products.”\nThe company operates an estimated 3,400 stores across 120 countries and expressed the fear in its accounts forecast for the year to December, suggesting that anti-Trump feeling could have a detrimental impact on its overseas sales.\nThe U.K. subsidiary of the New York-listed retailer also revealed it had shed more than 200 jobs last year as a consequence of a rise to the minimum wage “putting pressure” on its costs, describing its store traffic as “flattish overall.”\nJack Daniel’s\nLeanne Cunningham, CFO for Brown-Forman, the parent company behind Jack Daniel's whisky and Woodford Reserve bourbon, reported a 62 percent decline in sales in Canada during an earnings call in late August as the country’s rejection of U.S. spirits continues to bite.\n“American spirits products have been off the shelf in Canada for months,” she said. “This had a significant impact on our first quarter of fiscal 2026, which will impact our full fiscal year results.”\nOn the same call, CEO Lawson Whiting said Trump’s tariffs and deeply-unpopular “51st state” rhetoric had conspired to create “significant headwinds.”\nCanadian stores have cleared bottles of imported American beers, spirits and wines from their shelves and replaced them with domestic alternatives in opposition to Trump, hurting those sectors and California vintners in particular, while the locals are reportedly also using the “Maple Scan” app on their phones to determine the point of origin of products before they purchase them.\nApple, McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Amazon\nA similar strain of anti-American sentiment has erupted in India in response to Trump placing a huge 50 percent tariff on the country’s exported goods last month, a measure undertaken to punish New Delhi for continuing to purchase Russian oil rather than join the international boycott in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.\nAlthough it is too soon to measure the market impact of the president’s actions, which came despite his past warm relations with Narendra Modi, some of the U.S.’s most famous brands from Pepsi and Coca-Cola to Amazon, Apple, Meta, Domino’s, McDonald’s and Starbuck’s have faced boycott calls, according to Reuters.\nManish Chowdhary, co-founder of India’s Wow Skin Science, recently issued a video message on LinkedIn urging Indians to make buying locally “a global obsession” and said: “We have lined up for products from thousands of miles away. We have proudly spent on brands that we don’t own, while our own makers fight for attention in their own country.”\nRahm Shastry, CEO of India’s DriveU, wrote in a post on the same platform: “India should have its own home-grown Twitter\/Google\/YouTube\/WhatsApp\/FB – like China has.”\nAshwani Mahajan, co-convenor of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch group said: “People are now looking at Indian products. It will take some time to fructify. This is a call for nationalism, patriotism.”\nTesla\nConsumers in both the U.S. and Europe reacted angrily to Elon Musk’s support for Trump in last year’s election and over his subsequent role as a White House adviser, even vandalising Tesla cars and dealerships in protest before the relationship between the two billionaires exploded so dramatically in June.\nMusk has continued to count the cost of his dalliance in right-wing politics and Tesla has borne the brunt of public disapproval, with sales of its electric cars falling in Europe throughout the calendar year.\nTesla sales halved in the U.K. in July, with just 987 models registered compared to 2,642 in July 2024, a 60 percent slide. The company’s total sales in Britain are down 7 percent for the year so far, according to data from the main industry body.\nJim Beam and Maker’s Mark\nTakeshi Niinami, Chairman and CEO of the Japanese drinks corporation behind Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark, gave an interview to Bloomberg TV in April in which he warned that Japanese companies could be deterred from investing in the U.S. as a result of Trump’s tariffs.\n“It is not going to be very attractive,” Niinami said. “The U.S. is still a key country, but we have to have a broader portfolio of investment.”\nHe cautioned that a protectionist U.S. would lead Japan, China and India to turn away and become the flagbears for free trade in the Asia-Pacific region.","content_hash":"ec6cda68ba25ebcca74c545268e5ee9f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6450,"method_rank":0}

It’s already pushing up yields on longer-dated bonds and traders are positioning for volatility in the euro swaps market, which the funds use for hedging. Things could become more extreme at the turn of the year, when a large tranche of funds are set to transition, due to lower liquidity at that time.\nThe Dutch central bank warned earlier this year of a risk to financial stability, and the complexity of the underlying mechanics means it’s hard to get a grasp on the extent of any disruption.\nAsset managers including BlackRock Inc. and Aviva Investors are recommending caution when it comes to the long-end of the yield curve, favoring shorter-dated tenors. For others, including JPMorgan Asset Management, the issue is helping to make US Treasuries look more attractive than European government bonds.\n“There are so many unknowns and moving parts,” said Ales Koutny, head of international rates at Vanguard. “Everybody knows that the event is there, but nobody knows what the final outcome is going to be. Everybody’s just trying their best to position for it.”\nThe revamp is intended to help cope with an aging population and changing labor market.\nWhile the Netherlands accounts for just 7% of the euro-area economy, the pension system is an outsize market player. It has more than half of all pension savings in the bloc, according to European Central Bank data. Its European bond holdings total almost €300 billion.\nVolatility\nIn recent weeks, a gauge of future volatility in 30-year euro swaps has picked up, which ING Group NV strategists say is partly down to the transition. The shift is also affecting euro funding costs.\nThese ripples stem from changes in the way Dutch retirement funds protect their portfolios against fluctuations in interest rates. Until now, they’ve relied heavily on long-dated swaps to ensure they have enough cash to pay pensioners down the line, irrespective of what happens to borrowing costs.\nUnder the switch to so-called life-cycle investing, younger workers will be more heavily invested in riskier assets like stocks, with less need for these long-dated hedges. Older members’ savings will be skewed toward safer securities like bonds, but the corresponding hedges will also shorten.\nAbout 36 funds are scheduled to switch to the new system on Jan. 1, with the rest following in tranches every six months until January 2028. With the first big wave seeking to unwind their hedges en masse at a time when liquidity is typically poor, investment banks and brokers may struggle to match up sellers and buyers, gumming up the system.\nThe supply-demand imbalance for longer-dated swaps is already significant. With a pipeline of pension funds needing to unwind swap positions, market players such as hedge funds seeking to profit could let this play out before stepping in to take the other side of the trade. That could lead to a rapid steepening in the curve, said Rohan Khanna, head of European Rates Research at Barclays Plc.\nHow it unfolds in January is “anybody’s guess, but the nervousness is going to be very high,” Khanna said. “The market can become illiquid or jumpy in such situations.”\nComplicating preparations is a political crisis in The Netherlands, where there will be a snap election after the collapse this summer of both the government and a caretaker administration that followed it. Among those that quit was Social Affairs Minister Eddy van Hijum, who was in charge of the transition.\nHe was expected to give pension funds an extra year to reduce their interest-rate hedges once they’ve transitioned. That plan is unlikely to be affected, though a parliamentary debate on pensions scheduled for this week might be postponed, a spokesperson for the ministry said.\nDebt Demand\nThere’s also a question over what this turn-of-the-year move will do to demand for long-dated debt, with January typically one of the busiest periods for new bond sales.\nYields on German and French 30-year debt have risen for the past four months and are trading close to multi-year highs as fiscal tensions ramp up. France has been thrust into yet another political crisis over its budget, and the government may be toppled this month.\nABN Amro estimates that the pension sector's largest exposures are in German, French and Dutch debt, and the drop in demand may put pressure on governments to switch toward shorter maturities, according to strategists including Sonia Renoult.\nThat could leave them more exposed to interest-rate volatility as they are forced into refinancing their debt more frequently.\nThe Dutch yield curve between 10- and 30-year maturities has already steepened nearly 50 basis points this year, the most among its EU peers.\nInvestors like Steve Ryder, who helps run €8.3 billion in fixed income assets at Aviva, say they’ll avoid any exposure to longer-dated European bonds at the end of the year, given the likelihood for choppiness.\n“If everyone transitions at the same time it would become a bit of a hot potato for the dealers that have to take on the risk,” he said.\nThere are some mitigating factors. Pension funds may start to unwind long-dated hedges ahead of time, reducing the risk of bottlenecks, if they’re confident they’ve got enough of a buffer to absorb potential losses.\nThere is also the one-year adjustment period the government is granting for hedges. However, the longer pension funds take, the longer they would be over-hedged, which is particularly relevant for younger workers.\nThe Dutch central bank said it will continue to monitor the transition but is confident that the one-year period “provides pension funds with sufficient flexibility to adjust their portfolios in an orderly manner.”\nMany trading desks remain anxious and expect things to move quickly at the turn of the year.\n“We still think the transition will be front-loaded,” said Pierre Hauviller, director of pensions and insurance structuring at Deutsche Bank AG, adding that markets are positioning for this. “Volatility trades in early January are already very crowded.”\n--With assistance from Patrick Van Oosterom.\n(Updates with yield curve steepening in 20th paragraph.)","content_hash":"89d0ada6fe54b5698885489a0b8d7f10","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6447,"method_rank":0}

Hodges, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was quick to sound the alarm, urging unmarried queer couples to \"consider getting married\" before the high court unravels the rights won in the landmark decision.\n\"The Supreme Court will hear a case about gay marriage,\" she said on \"Raging Moderates,\" a podcast hosted by Fox News pundit Jessica Tarlov. \"My prediction is they will do to gay marriage what they did to abortion. They will send it back to the states.\"\nLegal experts note that the recent challenge brought by Davis is in its early stages. The next step would be for the court to choose to review the case among a pool of thousands, a stage at which some 97% of cases are denied, per the Supreme Court code of conduct.\n\"Whether the court will grant review really boils down to whether there are four votes to take up the question,\" Amy Howe writes for SCOTUSblog. \"Moreover, even if there are four justices who might be inclined to do so, they won't want to grant review unless they are confident that there is a fifth vote to overturn Obergefell.\"\nIn short, \"don't freak out just yet,\" says Steve Branton, a certified financial planner who specializes in planning for LGBTQ+ and nontraditional families.\n\"It's still a good time for any couple, whether they're unmarried, domestic partnered, civil union, married, to take a look at their their financial assets, their estate plan, their legal plan, and, if they have children, their custody plan,\" he says, adding that now's a great time to \"make sure everything is in order.\"\nDon't rush to the altar, but be prepared\nEven if Obergefell is overturned, Branton says, queer married couples could still retain some protections under the Respect for Marriage Act. The bipartisan law passed in 2022 requires all states and the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states where such unions are legal.\nShould the Supreme Court reverse course on Obergefell and send marriage equality back to the states, already married couples would retain their rights, as would, theoretically, any couple who got married in a state without a constitutional or legislative ban on same-sex marriage.\n\"Somebody from North Carolina could go across the state line ... and get married and come back, and that marriage should be honored in North Carolina,\" says Branton. \"But the question is, what about the state-level benefits? I don't think anybody knows that just yet.\"\nThat ambiguity is why Clinton and others have urged queer couples to tie the knot ASAP. \"I don't think they'll undo existing marriages, but I fear they will undo the national right,\" she said.\nHelp us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals\nBut marriage is a major financial commitment, Branton says — one that shouldn't be jumped into without careful consideration.\n\"I wouldn't say go out and get married right now, because that's really a complicated decision to make from a financial and legal perspective,\" he says.\nInstead of telling them to rush to the altar, Branton is urging his LGBTQ+ clients to take a wait and see approach while also reviewing their financial documents to make sure everything is airtight. Here's what he says is worth looking at.\nBeneficiary designations\nCertain financial instruments, such as life insurance policies and investing and bank accounts, allow you to designate a beneficiary to receive your assets in the event of your death. It's important to keep your beneficiaries up to date, because failing to do so could mean that your money ends up in the wrong hands. Fail to name anyone, and your loved ones could end up duking it out in court.\n\"People die out of the blue, and you [may not] want your accounts going to somebody like a sibling ... when you have a committed life partner,\" Branton says.\nEstate planning documents\nIn the same vein, having a suite of estate planning documents in place means that you get to decide what happens in the case of your death or incapacitation — not the state. It's a particularly important legal protection to have should things shift in terms of how the government handles non-traditional families, says Branton.\nA simple will designates how you want your assets to be distributed in the event of your death. Documents like powers of attorney and advanced directives (which may go by different names in different states) lay out your wishes and allow you to name a decision-maker should you become incapacitated.\nFamily legal documents\nQueer couples with children face a more complex legal situation than cisgendered, heterosexual couples, Branton says — and things could get even more complicated with same-sex marriage under threat.\n\"It's really important to make sure you have the right legal documents,\" he says.\nThis may include a so-called second-parent adoption, Branton says, which allows the non-biological parent in an LGBTQ+ couple to establish full-parental rights alongside their partner.\nA popular option pre-Obergefell, these documents ensure that queer parents retain their rights in the case of death or divorce and regardless of location. Securing one typically costs around $2,000 to $3,000, depending on home study expenses and legal fees, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Consult an attorney to see if this option makes sense for you and your family.\nOverall, don't panic, says Branton — but be proactive.\n\"We're not saying you should be threatened today about this, but you should still get your house in order, because we live in a country where politically, things can change quickly,\" he says.\nLast chance to save: Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Beyond OPEC+, there have been very few notable market developments as ICE Brent continues to hover slightly above $68 per barrel, with the dearth of news caused by the US Labor Day holiday sapping the market’s risk appetite.\nWhite House Targets Iraqi Oil Tycoon. The US Treasury Department sanctionedWaleed al-Samarra’i, an Iraqi individual who is believed to operate a fleet of vessels (owned via Marshall Islands shell firms) carrying Iranian oil, in the latest round of sanctions against Iran’s oil industry.\nRussia and China Approve Power of Siberia-2.

Chinese iron ore futures rose to ¥772 per metric tonne ($108\/mt) as market participants anticipate regional authorities in Tangshan’s steel hub to lift air quality controls after the country’s WWII commemoration parade is over, greatly boosting demand.\nSudan’s Oil Artery Clots After Drone Barrage. Sudan was forced to shut down its oil production sites in the Heglig basin after a series of drone strikes from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) made safe operations impossible with two impacts this week, shuttering some 30,000 b\/d of output.\nEU Mulls 10-Year Tax Pause on Jet and Shipping. The European Commission proposed a 10-year delay to the introduction of continent-wide taxes on CO2 emitted through aviation and shipping until at least 2035, as EU governments have been resisting any fuel carbon levies up until now.\nSaudi, Iraq Halt Exports to India’s Key Refiner. Both Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL:2222) and Iraqi state oil marketer SOMO have stopped delivering term supplies of crude to India’s Nayara Energy, co-owned by Russia’s Rosneft and under EU sanctions imposed in late July, citing payment difficulties.\nEquinor Comes to the Rescue. Norway’s national energy firm Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) agreed to pump roughly $1 billion into embattled wind developer Orsted (COP:ORSTED) as the Danish company pushes ahead with a $9.4 billion rights issue, under pressure from Trump’s anti-wind policies.\nAfrica’s New Oil Frontier to Auction Blocks. Kenya is planning to offer 10 exploration blocks since it adopted a new petroleum law in 2019, seeking to finally tap into its 1-billion-barrel reserves that remain underdeveloped after UK explorer Tullow Oil halted operations due to security concerns.\nBrazil Wants a Spot at The IEA Table.

Josh — The interest rate on the benchmark 30-year fixed mortgage rate has come down in 9 of the last 12 weeks and regional banks are starting to break through like the Kool-Aid Man. Oh yeah! Over the weekend, the Wall Street Journal took a look at the number of homeowners who could now benefit from a refinancing given that this benchmark rate has fallen to 6.56%. The Journal says , \"More than two million owners could now save money by refinancing…up from 1.7 million at the end of July. If rates keep falling to 6%, nearly six million people would reduce their rate by at least 0.75 percentage points in a refinancing, a common threshold at which homeowners would save enough to justify the associated costs.\" Mortgage refinancings are just one of many things that begin to pick up at the banks when borrowing costs decline. The overall increase in activity from falling rates has historically more than offset the potential for net interest margin (or NIM) to compress, thus making this a positive tradeoff for the banks. And regional bank stocks are now reacting to all the possibilities. Sean's going to give you our regular Monday overview (yes, I know it's Tuesday) of everything happening on the Best Stocks list, and then we'll show you some notable charts. Of the names mentioned, I own JPMorgan at the time of publishing. Sector leaderboard As of Sept. 2, there are 202 names on The Best Stocks in the Market list. Top Sector Ranking: Top industries: Top 5 best stocks by relative strength: Sean — Financials are dominating through Q3 of 2025, with 39 names on the Best Stocks in the Market list. As of Friday's close, 65% of the S & P 500 are above their 50 day moving average, while 75% of S & P financials are above their 50 day moving average, second highest in the S & P behind discretionary stocks at 78%. Similarly, financials have the most 52-week highs out of all sectors at 9% of the sector making a new high over the past year: While the capital markets industry group has been a top 2 or 3 industry on our list all year, the rest of the financial sector is heating up. We now have 7 banks on the list: BAC, C, HBAN, JPM, PNC, TFC, and WFC. The diversified stalwart that is JPM, and its peer group of WFC and C are well known and discussed. One group that's been collectively left behind is the regional banks. Truist is a less-well-known name on the list with an interesting set-up: You can see the stock just broke above its July highs, nearing its pre-liberation day highs. Truist is the third largest regional bank in the S & P 500. At the Liberation-Day lows, the XLF was down 9% in 2025, while the KRE (S & P Regional Banking ETF) was down 19%. The smaller banks were punished because of fears centered around small businesses and their ability to navigate tariffs amid a slowing labor market and a moderately high rate environment. This is the XLF vs the KRE from April 8th: These small banks are slaughtering the low expectations the market set for them. Below is PNC , the largest regional bank in the U.S. by market cap. PNC beat on its top and bottom lines when it reported in July, and guided higher for the current quarter: Most of these financial charts look the same. Breakouts up to or above pre-liberation day highs. The message from the tape is clear: financials aren't just participating in this rally, they're leading it. With breadth, 52-week highs, and breakouts lining up across the group, the market is starting to re-rate these cyclicals, especially the regionals. If the banks and capital markets firms can sustain these moves and take advantage of what could be the beginnings of a non-recessionary cutting cycle, these value plays could be in for more breakouts ahead… Risk management: Josh — I like the KRE names broadly as a sector overweight at the moment. This chart is one of my faves in the group - it's Huntington Bancshares , an Ohio-based regional with a thousand branches that was founded in 1866 and has a long-term chart that looks like this: I don't believe in triple tops. I think this one gets a two-handle in front of it before long. Cautious traders can use the $15.50 to $16 area for risk management. Longer-term investors can just swim naked with a 13 PE ratio and a 3.5% yield. Your risk is recession, same as your risk with everything else. The chart above is showing you that the stock is now emerging from an inverse head and shoulders. An inverse head and shoulders is a classic technical analysis chart pattern that signals a potential trend reversal from bearish to bullish. These are among the more reliable reversal patterns that technicians look at, especially when accompanied by steadily increasing volume as is the case with HBAN. These are the set-ups I dream about.

Ostapenko, the women's world No. 26 from Latvia, pointed a finger and shouted insults at Townsend, who had won the second-round match but was later defeated in a competitive match against Barbora Krejčíková. As the camera panned in for viewers to get a closer look at the confrontation, careful observers could see a Blue Owl patch emblazoned on Townsend's tennis dress.\nThe $284 billion asset management firm, which focuses largely on private credit and real estate, is not exactly the type of household name you might expect to see sponsoring a tennis player.\nTownsend is one of about 100 athletes competing in professional tennis tournaments around the world this year who are backed by Blue Owl. It's part of the firm's strategy to raise brand awareness primarily among high-net-worth individuals, and part of a broader effort to bring alternative asset managers out of obscurity.\n\"This is a premier way to gain visibility with our stakeholders and drive curiosity to help them want to learn more about us,\" said Suzanne Escousse, chief marketing officer at Blue Owl. \"At the end of the day, they need to know who you are to call you when it counts.\"\nBrand awareness is a relatively new concept for the 50-year-old world of alternative assets. Historically, the industry has opted for a much lower profile, shrouded in secrecy. Private equity and credit firms were originally funded by a small group of sophisticated investors. Operating behind closed doors gave them a mystique of exclusivity, reinforcing their scarcity value and prestige.\nBefore the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act in 2012, these firms couldn't solicit outsiders, much less advertise. But the reticence evolved after that rule change and as the industry broadened its shareholder base.\nThere was an onslaught of initial public offerings from many of the big managers before and shortly after the financial crisis, which came with increased disclosure requirements and public market communication necessities. Recall, Blackstone in 2007, KKR in 2010, Apollo Global Management in 2011 and Carlyle in 2012. Blue Owl didn't list until 2021 – formed through a SPAC merger.\nOver the last decade or so, alternative asset managers have been delving into more retail-oriented investor channels — particularly through semi-liquid vehicles at lower price points and with less complexity. Through this year's first quarter, assets in perpetual strategies from the top seven publicly traded managers totaled $1.7 trillion, up 21% year over year and representing 41% of this cohort's total assets under management, according to PitchBook.\nOf course, alternatives firms have to walk a fine line to get their names out there without commoditizing the product. There's a fundamental rub that's talked about in every boardroom, according to a person with knowledge of these conversations, who asked to remain unnamed to speak about private discussions. The firms want to keep their institutional investors happy, while also capturing the growing share of retail investors, the person said, noting the phrase \"velvet rope\" is used constantly.\nBut the broadening of their investor base – from institutional investors to high-net-worth individuals to, eventually, 401(k)s – has ushered alternative asset managers out of the shadows.\n\"The high-net-worth wealth community represents the biggest future opportunity for the private markets firms – that's the 'it girl,'\" said Jennifer Prosek, founder of Prosek Partners, a marketing and communications firm that represents many alternative asset managers. \"Every private markets firm has woken up to the fact that brand differentiation can move the needle.\"\nEscousse joined Blue Owl in 2023 as the firm's first chief marketing officer. Six months into her tenure, she completed a brand pulse survey and found that awareness was low even when compared with competitors, she said.\n\"We started to look for unconventional sponsorship,\" Escousse said. \"We know that if you can align your firm with your stakeholders' passion points, it's more authentic. They're more likely to do business with you.\"\nShe said the financial services industry had been \"over-indexed\" to two sports — tennis and golf. Blue Owl opted to go all in on tennis, beginning with last year's U.S. Open. The strategy involved putting Blue Owl's patch on the opponents of top-seeded players, who are likely to get the most viewership – at a lower price point than a traditional TV ad.\nThe firm's logo was displayed in prime time on Australian world No. 36 Alexei Popyrin, who beat Serbian great Novak Djokovic, currently seventh in the world, at the 2024 U.S. Open. In January, Blue Owl expanded its presence at all Grand Slam tournaments to be the exclusive financial services partner for professional tennis' player patch program. At roughly $20,000 per patch, the program will cost Blue Owl about $2 million this year, in addition to the related marketing the firm does around professional tennis.\nAnd Blue Owl isn't the only alternatives firm diving into consumer marketing.\nLast year, Apollo Global and its retirement services affiliate, Athene, partnered with PGA Tour golfer Patrick Cantlay – the first brand partner for the firms. Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager with more than $1 trillion in AUM, has opted for traditional brand outreach through social media, video, email, events and advertising.\n\"I think there's been a shock by institutions that want to go to retail because the price of admission is high,\" said Prosek. \"It's the emerging market of marketing.\"","content_hash":"18003b88c8d9b809768ea7d2a16306d5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5822,"method_rank":0}

Marc Benioff had finally toppled his mentor, Larry Ellison.\nThat moment is long gone.\nSalesforce's stock price has dropped 25% this year, the worst performance in large-cap tech and the second-steepest decline in the Dow, beating only UnitedHealth. Meanwhile, Oracle has jumped 34%, outperforming most of its peers and well outpacing the major indexes.\nThe two companies that were once about even by valuation are now separated by about $400 billion. Oracle is worth $630 billion, and Salesforce has dropped to $239 billion. Ellison now ranks second behind Elon Musk on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a $278 billion net worth. Benioff sits in 318th place at $10.4 billion.\nInvestors are eager to hear how Benioff plans to right the ship when Salesforce reports quarterly results after the close on Wednesday.\nSales growth has been mired in the single digits for four straight quarters as the company reckons with the challenges of saturation in its key market of customer relationship management software. That streak is expected to continue, with analysts estimating revenue growth of 8.7% to $10.1 billion, according to LSEG.\nDuring the April period, about a quarter of Salesforce's $9.3 billion in subscription and support revenue came from products related to customer service, its biggest category. The company charges for its Service Cloud offering based on the number of agents who use the software.\nWith the rapid rise of artificial intelligence, some analysts predict more inquiries will be handled through automation, posing a risk to Salesforce.\nBenioff is well aware of the challenge. He said in June that AI is already handling about 30% to 50% of the company's work. It's a big reason why Salesforce reportedly slashed 1,000 jobs earlier this year.\nWhen it comes to customers, Salesforce now sells Agentforce, an AI system for answering customer support requests. After becoming available in October, Agentforce was delivering $100 million in annualized revenue, Benioff told analysts on a conference call in May.\n\"It's not significant enough to move the needle on this business, given the scale,\" said Michael Turrin, a Wells Fargo analyst who has a hold recommendation on Salesforce shares.\nThe hope is that customers end up paying more for Agentforce than for Service Cloud, Turrin said.\nThe big difference for Oracle is that it's one of the early beneficiaries of the AI boom. Known primarily for its database software that sits inside big companies and government agencies, Oracle has notched cloud infrastructure commitments from OpenAI and Musk's xAI.\nAgentforce could be Salesforce's window into AI business, if it gains traction.\n\"I think there's been a lot of frustration with Salesforce's share performance, so I think we're at a point where investors are trying to figure out if there's an opportunity for a bit of a rebound here,\" Turrin said.\nLooking for double-digit growth\nInvestors also want to see improvement in current remaining performance obligations at constant currency, a measure of expected revenue over the next year. In May, operating chief Robin Washington said she was expecting that number to be 9% for the August quarter.\n\"The longer that metric stays above 10%, the more confident investors are that this business can sustain a 10% growth profile for at least the next year,\" Turrin said.\nAnalysts expect revenue growth to pick up very slightly in the fiscal third quarter, with consensus estimates currently at 9%, according to LSEG.\nSalesforce declined to comment.\nExpansion could come from outside. In May, Salesforce agreed to buy data management company Informatica for $8 billion. That's by far the largest deal for Salesforce since the $27.1 billion purchase of Slack in 2021. In the interim, Salesforce hadn't spent more than $2.5 billion on M&A, which has been a major growth driver in years past.\nIn late 2022, activist investors started going after Salesforce, dissatisfied with Benioff's high-cost acquisitions, the company's underperforming stock and its expanding workforce. The activists began agitating for a more favorable mix of sales and profit, and Salesforce responded by expanding margins sooner than it had planned.\nOne of the main instigators, Starboard Value, is back for more. In the second quarter, the firm, which first bought Salesforce stock in 2022, boosted its holding by 47%, according to a filing. In October 2024, Starboard's Jeff Smith complimented Salesforce's profitability improvements but said he still believed \"there's a lot more to go.\"\nVulcan Value Partners is a Salesforce shareholder that's comfortable with the software company's plans. After picking up a stake in 2020, Vulcan added 345,000 shares in the second quarter, increasing its total holdings to $300 million.\n\"The thing that we focus on is the value per share of the business,\" said Stephen Simmons, a portfolio manager at the firm. \"That is continuing to grow. There's nothing we're seeing that's saying this company is going away anytime soon.\"\nAnalysts expect earnings per share to increase to $2.78 for the latest quarter, up from $2.56 a year earlier, according to LSEG.\nVulcan sold its Oracle shares in 2020, missing out on a steep rally that followed. Simmons said he'd buy again if the stock becomes discounted.\n\"Funny how things go around and come around,\" Simmons said. \"Benioff starts Salesforce as a cloud-native enterprise company, and Larry's over at Oracle trying to transition his on-prem customers to the cloud.\"\nCorrection: In earlier days, Larry Ellison mentored Marc Benioff. A previous version of this article mischaracterized their professional relationship.","content_hash":"ae28e6dfd3a12634f10bc2f0ab6c34b8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5758,"method_rank":0}

Meanwhile, here are the key takeaways from the SCO summit:\nThawing India-China relations\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first meeting on Chinese soil in seven years, sharing a vision of being partners not rivals.\nThe leaders of the world's two most populous nations — representing some 2.8 billion people — pledged to step up cooperation and work toward resolving their long-running border dispute.\nThe rapprochement comes as both countries face pressure from steep U.S. tariffs. \"Modi and Xi used all the diplomatic words available to signal a new found commitment ... partially motivated by high Trump tariffs on both,\" said Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at Asia Society Policy Institute.\nStill, India remains wary of a flood of cheap Chinese imports threatening its domestic industries and border disputes are far from resolved. China's relationship with Pakistan also remains a sticking point in the New Delhi-Beijing relationship.\n\"Improving trade ties won't be easy,\" Cutler said, noting New Delhi was likely to keep restrictive measures in place after a series of antidumping cases against Chinese imports.\nXi, Putin, Modi troika\nThe summit also captured Xi, Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin holding hands and sharing a good laugh on the sidelines of the SCO, at a time when the U.S. has charged India and China of fueling Moscow's war against Ukraine.\nIndia — long courted by the U.S. as a counterweight to China — has been the target of Trump's steep tariffs, the Kremlin has brushed aside Washington's push for peace in Ukraine, and Beijing continues to spar with the U.S. over trade, technology and geopolitical issues.\nThe symbolism of the three leaders together projects China as an alternative to the U.S. as a partner. Trump is \"breathing new life\" into the summit, giving China a chance to frame its diplomacy as more dependable than Washington's, said Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst at Eurasia Group.\nModi told his Russian counterpart that India and Russia stood side by side even in difficult times after Putin called Modi his \"dear friend,\" describing their relations as \"friendly and trusting.\" Later Monday, Modi posted on X a photo of himself with Putin inside the Russian leader's armored Aurus limousine.\n\"India is using this to opportunistically send a signal indirectly to Washington, that it has strategic options, not only in Beijing, but also in Moscow,\" Chan said.\nFor Russia, the SCO also remains one of the few international platforms where Putin is not on the defensive, underscoring Moscow's enduring ties with influential Asian partners despite Western sanctions.\nAI partnership roadmap\nThe Tianjin Declaration of the SCO Council reaffirmed commitments to strengthen artificial intelligence cooperation, underscoring \"equal rights of all countries to develop and use AI.\"\nThat followed Premier Li Qiang's remarks at another AI conference in Shanghai last month, where he proposed creating an organization to coordinate global efforts to regulate the fast-evolving AI technology.\nThe SCO members, in a joint declaration, pledged to cooperate on reducing risks and improving the security and accountability of AI for the benefits of humanity, while committing to implement a roadmap for joint AI cooperation and development.\nIn a statement following the SCO AI Cooperation Forum held in May, Beijing called on member states to work together in building a collaboration center for AI application, while pledging to promote open-source AI models and share advanced technologies.\n\"Beijing has leaned into 'open-source [large-language-models]' as productivity infrastructure,\" said Paul Triolo, a partner at DGA Group, adding that the challenge lies in \"how or if to regulate the use of open source models across borders.\"\nA new development bank\nSome member states agreed to set up an SCO development bank, what would be a significant step in the bloc's long-standing goal of establishing an alternative payment system that reduces reliance on the U.S. dollar.\nChina is the largest shareholder of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, that was launched in 2014 to fund projects in developing nations as a direct challenge to the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.\nWhile the proposed development bank may fall short of the AIIB's scale, it reflects Xi's ambition to position himself as the 'architect' of a China-led global governance framework, said Steven Okun, chief executive officer of consultancy APAC Advisors.\nBeijing also pledged 2 billion yuan ($280 million) in free aid for member states this year and another 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in loans to the organization's members over the next three years.","content_hash":"acaa740d4277c3c907c0a3c93f2b2d06","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5701,"method_rank":0}

The Swiss consumer staples giant on Monday announced that it had terminated CEO Laurent Freixe with immediate effect, following an internal investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship between him and a direct subordinate that breached company rules. Shares of Nestle were 3.1% lower by 8:21 a.m. in London (3:21 a.m. ET) on Tuesday as investors reacted to the news, which was announced after trading hours the previous day. Freixe has been replaced with veteran Philipp Navratil, who had been serving as CEO of Nestle's Nespresso business. A Nestle spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that Pablo Isla, lead independent director and vice chairman of the firm's board of directors, had been a \"big influence\" on the leadership changes. Isla jointly oversaw the investigation into Freixe's conduct with Nestle Chairman Paul Bulcke, who labeled Freixe's ousting as \"a necessary decision\" in a Monday statement. \"Navratil is clearly a generational shift\/changing of the guard at Nestle,\" a company spokesperson told CNBC on Tuesday. Freixe's ousting is likely to spark some market turbulence for Nestle, as investors grapple with the company's second CEO change in a year's span. Freixe only took the helm in August 2024 after the exit of Mark Schneider, who Reuters reported had been let go. Nestle has been contending with challenges beyond its succession line. The company — which owns more than 2,000 brands globally — has been dealing with slowing sales, U.S. tariffs uncertainty and commodity price headwinds that have already put some pressure on its share price. In the year under Freixe's leadership, Nestle shares have fallen by 17%. NES.N-CH 1Y line Nestle share price Yet analysts are viewing his departure as another \"negative\" development for Nestle stock — and a shock. \"When he took over as CEO just over a year ago following Mark Schneider's ejection from the role, we thought of him as a Nestlé lifer who would restore the company's reputation of slightly boring predictability,\" said RBC Capital Markets analyst James Edwardes Jones in a note to clients on Sept. 1. \"How wrong we were.\" Wall Street analysts also criticized the rapid shift in permanent leadership at Nestle. JPMorgan's Celine Pannuti flagged fresh uncertainty as a result of the company's decision to respond to its investigation findings as \"an emergency,\" rather than conducting a thorough search for a replacement under the leadership of an interim CEO. \"We are disappointed that the new CEO is boxed in for now to follow his predecessor's strategy at a time where the market is doubting the outcome with Nestlé's share valuation at a historical low,\" she said in a Sept. 1 note to clients. \"This new change is likely to keep afloat the question mark about the mid-term direction of the company and keep a lid on the equity story until we hear more about Mr Navratil's plan.\" Navratil's reassurance that the company will not be \"changing course on strategy,\" has yet to allay concerns. \"Investors, we think, will be concerned about Navratil looking to conduct a full review of the group and set his own agenda and targets for the medium term,\" said Jefferies's David Hayes in a note to clients. \"That could see another review of investment plans and margin targets and portfolio assessment.\" Such reviews have led to companies clearing the deck for new CEOs by slashing top and bottom line expectations, leaving stocks vulnerable to steep corrections. Most recently, the abrupt departure of Novo Nordisk's CEO — for unrelated reasons — saw the Danish pharma giant's stock plunge to multi-year lows. Investors in the consumer staples sector have been grappling with a string of abrupt departures of senior executives, leaving the outlook for their stocks in the lurch. \"We can't remember a time when so many individuals left unexpectedly,\" added RBC's Jones. 'Safe as houses' Jon Cox, head of European consumer equities at Kepler Cheuvreux, offered some silver linings. \"I think the positive, clearly, is that they've moved to appoint an insider who has been there for 25 years [and] seems to have a decent execution track record,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday. He argued that an external appointment would have sparked \"a big review,\" followed by a new strategy in 12 to 18 months' time, which could derail the company's existing turnaround plan. \"[Navratil has] said he's committed to the existing strategy — [you] should be able to start seeing delivery on the results, I would hope, from Q3 rather than delaying the whole turnaround.\" Cox noted that Nestle's earnings over the first half of the year had been \"very, very disappointing,\" but said the second six-month stretch should bring some relief to shareholders thanks to the strategy that should now remain in place. \"It's focusing on the core business. It's investing behind the key brands. It's developing new products. It's putting your pricing and the taste profile of the products on a stable footing, and that ultimately will deliver,\" he told CNBC. He added that Nestle expects to return to a minimum organic sales growth of 4% in the short to medium term as a result of its turnaround plans. Organic sales growth at Nestle was up 2.9% year-on-year in the first six months of 2025. \"And [it expects] go back to the Nestle model: 4% to 6% topline growth, margin improvement, a progressive dividend — safe as houses,\" Cox said. \"This is what we want to see Nestle return to.\" — CNBC's Carolin Roth contributed to this article.","content_hash":"fcf42cba1c3387ab87c722c74a0d6e0d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5689,"method_rank":0}

It's emerging in industries that have barely changed in decades -- and are now primed for AI-driven disruption.\nDefense, pharmaceuticals, banking, and healthcare aren't just big markets; they're trillion-dollar pillars of the global economy. The companies bringing AI into these arenas are building moats so wide that Silicon Valley can't cross them.\nThese three stocks are more than AI plays. These pioneers are reshaping the foundations of industries too critical to fail. Here's why these AI stocks belong on a buy-and-hold-forever list.\nThe defense contractor's second act\nPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) spent 20 years becoming indispensable to three-letter agencies before Wall Street noticed. Now its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is doing for corporations what Gotham did for governments -- making sense of chaos.\nQ2 2025 revenue hit $1 billion, up 48% year over year, with U.S. commercial revenue exploding 93% to $306 million. Over 1,000 organizations are running AIP pilots, from Airbus solving supply chain puzzles to hospitals predicting patient surges.\nYes, 243 times forward earnings looks steep. But Palantir generates 46% operating margins, sits on $6 billion in cash and short-term securities, and raised full-year 2025 guidance to $4.14 billion to $4.15 billion. The real moat isn't the technology -- it's the decades of security clearances, the Pentagon integration, and the institutional knowledge that would take competitors 20 years to replicate. When the U.S. military runs your software for mission-critical targeting, switching vendors isn't really an option.\nThe AI drug factory\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX) is using AI to industrialize drug discovery. The company's 65-plus petabytes of biological data -- one of Earth's largest proprietary datasets -- feeds AI models that identify drug candidates in weeks, not years. Partnerships with Roche, Bayer, Sanofi, and Nvidia validate the approach, with Sanofi alone contributing $130 million in up-front and milestone payments to date.\nQ2 2025 revenue of $19.2 million, up 33% year over year, puts the company on a $77 million annual run rate -- but revenue is the wrong metric for a precommercial biotech. What matters: five programs in clinical trials, 10 approaching human studies, and an AI platform generating drug candidates in weeks instead of years. If even one AI-discovered drug reaches blockbuster status, today's valuation becomes a rounding error.\nThe AI bank\nJPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM) isn't just the world's largest bank by assets. It's becoming the blueprint for AI in finance. The firm processes more than 65 million AI-driven transactions daily, spanning everything from fraud detection to algorithmic trading. Its $18 billion annual tech budget dwarfs most fintechs combined, and the payoff is real: AI systems prevented $1.5 billion in fraud losses last year, while new underwriting models now approve loans in seconds instead of days.\nThe bank is also moving up the value chain. IndexGPT, JPMorgan's generative AI advisor, is automating wealth management tasks once handled by junior bankers. On the institutional side, AI engines are reshaping risk management and capital allocation at a scale no start-up can match. Q2 2025 earnings underscored the moat: $15 billion in net income on $45.7 billion in revenue.\nAt just 16 times forward earnings, JPMorgan trades far below the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 22 times multiple, despite being the world's most systemically important bank. Its massive deposit base, regulatory licenses, and global footprint sit behind walls no challenger can breach. CEO Jamie Dimon has called AI \"extraordinary and groundbreaking\" -- and he's backing it up by restructuring the entire bank around it. For investors, JPM isn't just a bank; it's fast becoming the operating system of global finance.\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Every major AI breakthrough -- from ChatGPT to Midjourney to autonomous vehicles -- runs on Nvidia silicon.\nQ2 fiscal 2026 total revenue hit $46.7 billion, up 56% year over year, with data center revenue alone reaching $41.1 billion. The company's Blackwell architecture is already sold out through 2026, with customers including Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) placing orders measured in tens of thousands of units.\nThe moat goes deeper than just fast chips. CUDA, Nvidia's programming platform, has 5 million developers trained on its architecture -- a switching cost measured in years of retraining.

The company's LLaMA models, given away free, have become the Linux of AI -- powering everything from start-up prototypes to enterprise deployments. Meanwhile, Meta's real AI runs behind the scenes, optimizing 3 billion daily users' feeds and delivering ads with surgical precision.\nQ2 2025 revenue jumped 22% to $47.5 billion, with advertising alone generating $46.6 billion. Reality Labs burns over $4 billion quarterly chasing the metaverse, but that's a rounding error against $20 billion in quarterly operating income. The company sits on $47 billion in cash and marketable securities while trading at just 28 times forward earnings -- cheaper than most software companies by a wide margin. Meta's platforms generate billions of new posts, photos, and videos daily -- a proprietary training dataset no competitor can buy at any price.\nThe \"everything store\" for AI\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) plays the ultimate arms dealer strategy -- it doesn't matter whose AI wins, as long as they're all paying AWS to run it. Q2 2025 saw AWS revenue hit $30.9 billion, up 17.5%, capturing 31% of global cloud infrastructure spending. The unit's 32.9% operating margins might be down from its prior peak, but that's because Amazon is aggressively building AI capacity. Its custom Trainium and Inferentia chips offer customers alternatives to Nvidia at 40% lower cost, while Bedrock makes deploying AI models as simple as clicking a button.\nThe bull case is straightforward: Amazon generated $121 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months, giving it unlimited firepower to build AI infrastructure. AWS's $195 billion backlog (up 25% year over year) locks in future revenue with multiyear contracts and massive switching costs. Every AI start-up, enterprise deployment, and government project strengthens the moat.\nAt 34.6 times forward earnings, Amazon trades like the toll road to the AI economy -- and that's precisely what it is.\nThe three pillars of permanent value\nThese aren't speculative AI bets chasing viral adoption. Nvidia dominates the compute layer, controlling more than 90% of the AI training GPU market. Meta owns the consumer layer, with 3 billion users generating unmatched training data for its algorithms.

She told Business Insider, she's focused on \"driving growth holistically\" instead of structuring deals and advising clients.\nWe caught up with her on her career changes, and she shared advice for those considering a big leap. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nBI: What has your career been like since Business Insider featured you on our 2018 rising stars list?\nAA: When I spoke to your colleagues last, I was at Goldman, in leveraged finance and capital markets. I purposefully wanted to be more on the operating side, and I transitioned into a role within the financing division at Goldman — it was essentially a chief of staff for the financing division. And that gave me a perspective on the operating side within the firm.\nFrom there, I was hired by AB InBev to lead their commercial strategy and transformation. And that was essentially my introduction to being on the operating side, leading commercial strategy, leading market build-out. We had a ton of interesting work that we were doing in our beyond beer strategy, doing some interesting acquisitions. And as I was getting deeper into the operating field, I had an inbound from BlackRock to join the Aladdin business, which to me was absolutely fascinating.\nAnd I decided to make that move. Ultimately, what drove me or drew me to BlackRock was its unique position at the intersection of finance, technology, and innovation. I've always been interested in how technology can transform industries. So to me, that was a perfect opportunity to join the fintech world, and I've been here since then. It's been a fun ride.\nThis story is part of a new series catching up with finance pros we once spotlighted as Rising Stars of Wall Street to see where their careers have taken them. See all of our past Rising Stars lists here.\nBI: What core skills from your time at Goldman do you still use today?\nAA: My background in finance has been foundational for my current role, and I even think in my role at AB InBev. So early on, I built deep relationships with institutional clients, which taught me how to understand their needs and different challenges, and to deliver solutions.\nThat sort of client-centric perspective is what I brought with me, and that is essential to creating long-term value. At AB InBev, I had the opportunity to drive commercial strategy and lead those transformational initiatives, so that also gave me the hands-on experience of aligning business priorities and delivering operational execution that I brought here as well.\nI had to learn all about technology, which I haven't done before, but I think some of the foundational skills and being a client-facing executive are something that I'd ultimately apply anywhere.\nBI:You've been tasked, in an operating role, with growing brands that many would consider to be the leaders in their space. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager, while AB InBev is the world's largest brewer. How do you grow established brands while retaining what got them to this point?\nAA: It's easier to do when the organization has foundational cultural values, right? AB InBev is a big conglomerate, but at the same time, it was absolutely flat in terms of structure. I had direct access to Michel Doukeris, who's the CEO of the organization, and direct access to the head of strategy — the organization was so agile and nimble that you were able to make decisions and drive change. Same thing at BlackRock. In order for you to be able to actually impact the organization, impact its growth, impact the strategy, and make the difference that you are there to make, you need to have the proper cultural foundation to be able to actually effectuate that change. Both of the organizations have that.\nBI: You've now worked in different industries, including some known for long hours and grueling schedules. Have you kept a similar routine as far as your day-to-day as you shifted between jobs? Is there something you've kept the same even as your roles have changed?\nAA: I do read during my commute. That's actually probably the only time when I have time to read. So I love when I have like an hour-and-a-half commute, I read both ways or I listen to podcasts, but often I read. I like fiction, I like murder mysteries. That's my time to decompress and release and do something different, because I am kind of on all the time.\nBI: What advice would you give someone who is thinking of making a big career move? Maybe someone who has had some success in their career but is thinking of changing industries or firms, as someone who has taken that leap.\nAA: If I reflect on my journey and look back at my career, the one sort of constant is that I've grown through change. Do not be afraid of change. For me, it's always been important to not become complacent and to continue to feel challenged. It's important to continue pushing yourself.","content_hash":"6058a5d895f10090961c8a548b27376f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5579,"method_rank":0}

That's just a massive number. Cloud computing and other big technology companies continue to race to build out AI capacity, which puts chipmakers in an enviable position.\nNvidia has been the big winner so far, but it's not the only one. Let's look at the three chipmakers set to benefit most from this $3 trillion opportunity.\nNvidia\nNvidia is working at the center of AI. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) went from powering video games to becoming the standard for training large language models, and the company managed to turn that into a wide moat. Its CUDA software platform was the key to this happening. By making it free and getting it into research labs and universities early on, Nvidia ensured that developers learned to program GPUs on CUDA. Once that happened, companies were locked into its software ecosystem.\nNvidia has been just as smart on the networking side as well. Its proprietary NVLink connection allows GPUs to work together as a single unit, a huge benefit with AI workloads. Meanwhile, its acquisition of Mellanox gave it even more strength in networking, ensuring its chips could support increasingly massive AI clusters. The strength of its networking portfolio showed up last quarter, with networking data center revenue nearly doubling to $7.3 billion.\nWith both software and networking advantages, Nvidia is positioned to continue to be the leader in the AI infrastructure buildout. While it may not hold its 90% GPU market share, it's still the company to beat.\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) lives in Nvidia's shadow, but the market is shifting in a way that plays to AMD's strengths. Training dominated the first wave of AI, and Nvidia's CUDA gave it the edge. However, inference is now where demand is growing fastest, and AMD has already won some important business here. Several of the largest AI companies are using its GPUs for inference, and it counts seven of the top 10 AI players as customers.\nAMD is also part of the UALink Consortium, which is trying to build an open interconnect standard to rival Nvidia's NVLink. If that happens, it could give data centers more options for building out clusters and cut into one of Nvidia's advantages. That's still getting started, but it shows how AMD is working with others to narrow Nvidia's moat.\nThe company isn't just about GPUs, either. Its EPYC central processing units (CPUs) is gaining share in data centers, and it still has a strong PC and gaming chip business. AMD doesn't need to overtake Nvidia to win. Just getting a bigger slice of inference demand, while keeping its CPU business growing, can make it one of the bigger long-term beneficiaries of the AI buildout.\nBroadcom\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) has been taking a different approach when it comes to the AI buildout, but it has also seen explosive data center growth. While Nvidia and AMD battle over GPUs, Broadcom built a strong position in the data center networking space. Its Ethernet switches, optical interconnects, and digital signal processors are critical in moving massive amounts of data, and as AI clusters grow in size, networking needs grow right alongside them. That's why its AI networking revenue jumped 70% last quarter.\nHowever, it may have an even bigger opportunity with custom AI chips. Broadcom has long been a leader in the design of application-specific integrated circuits, and it has recently begun working with hyperscalers (companies that operate massive data centers) that want to boost performance and lower costs by developing chips tailored for their AI workloads.\nIt helped Alphabet create its tensor processing units, and now it's working with several other large customers on new designs. Management says the three customers furthest along could each deploy 1 million clusters by its fiscal 2027, which would represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity. That number doesn't even include newer relationships, such as the one it's established with Apple.\nOn top of all that, Broadcom has VMware. The unit is shifting to subscriptions and helping enterprises run AI across hybrid and multicloud environments, providing Broadcom with another avenue of growth. Put everything together, and you have another chip company set to benefit enormously as AI infrastructure spending ramps up.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

With its strong free cash flow and FCF margins, ADBE stock could be worth 36% more at $485 per share. Short-put yields are very high (4%) for less than 1 month.\nADBE closed at $356.70 on Friday, Aug. 29. That is off almost 14% from June 12 ($413.68), when it released fiscal Q2 earnings.\nThe stock appears undervalued here, particularly given its strong profitability and strong free cash flow (FCF) margins.\nStrong and Consistent FCF and FCF Margins\nLast quarter, Adobe Systems reported that revenue grew 10.6% year-over-year (YoY) to $5.873 billion. Most of its revenue comes from subscriptions to its software, so it's very consistent and stable.\nIn addition, its operating cash flow (OCF) increased by 12.9% to $2.19 billion. This means its OCF margin is very high at 37.3% (i.e., $2.19b\/$5.873b).\nSince the company has very little capex spending, often offset by FX changes, its net FCF came in at $2.144 billion. That represents a net FCF margin of 36.51% according to Stock Analysis. This was higher than the 35.77% net FCF margin a year ago.\nThat means that over one-third (36%) of sales go right into Adobe's bank account, with no cash expenses associated with it. The higher FCF margin suggests it is doing a great job of squeezing out more cash from its operations.\nIn fact, over the trailing 12 months (TTM), the average net FCF margin has been 41.75%, according to Stock Analysis. We can use that to help forecast FCF over the next 12 months (NTM) and to set a price target.\nForecasting FCF\nAnalysts expect revenue this fiscal year ending Nov. 2025 to be up 9.6% to $23.57 billion, and next year (Nov. 2026) it's forecasted to rise by 9.4% to $25.79 billion.\nThat implies that over the next 12 months (NTM), the average revenue forecast is $24.68 billion. As a result, FCF could be $10.3 billion, using the TTM FCF margin:\n$24.68b x .4175 = $10.3 billion NTM FCF\nThat would be +30.8% higher than the $7.873 billion in net FCF last year, and even +9.1% higher than the trailing 12 months (TTM) FCF of $9.437 billion. Moreover, in the past 6 months, its net FCF has been $4.6 billion, implying a $9.2 billion run-rate FCF. So, this NTM forecast is $1.1 billion higher, or +12% higher.\nBut this can also be used to help us set an FCF-yield-based price target.\nPrice Targets for ADBE Stock\nFor example, Adobe's market cap has a market capitalization of $151.31 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance. That means that it trades on a FCF yield of about 6%:\n$9.2 billion run rate FCF \/ $151.31 billion mkt cap = 0.0608 = 6.08% FCF yield\nThe market will likely give Adobe stock a much better FCF yield over the next year. That means the FCF yield will fall. One way to understand this is to use a multiple.\nFor example, a 6.08% FCF yield is the same as a 16.45x multiple of FCF (i.e., 1\/0.0608). But if the FCF yield improved to 5%, that means the FCF multiple would be higher at 20x (i.e., 1\/0.05).\nSo, if we assume that the market will value Adobe's NTM FCF forecast at 20x, its market cap will be substantially higher over the next 12 months:\n$10.3b NTM FCF x 20 = $206 billion mkt cap\nThat is +36% higher than today's $151.31 billion market cap. In other words, ADBE stock is worth 36% more:\n$356.70 per share x 1.36 = $485.11 target price\nThis coincides with other analysts' price targets. For example, Yahoo! Finance reports that $480.07 is the average of 39 analysts. However, AnaChart.com reports that 33 analysts have an average of $420.03, which is almost 18% higher than today.\nThe bottom line is that price targets for ADBE stock are significantly higher. One way to play this now is to set a lower buy-in price by shorting out-of-the-money (OTM) puts. Given the high yields this provides, investors can make good income with this play.\nShorting OTM ADBE Put Options\nFor example, look at the Sept. 12 expiry put option chain (which is just after the Sept. 11 expected fiscal Q3 earnings release date). The yield potential is very juicy!\nIt shows that the $350.00 strike price put, almost 2% lower and a good buy-in point, has a midpoint premium of $14.05 per share. That means that it provides a short-seller an immediate short-put yield of 4.0% (i.e., $14.05\/$350.00 = 0.0401).\nThis also provides an even lower breakeven point, should the stock fall to $350 and the investor's account is assigned to buy shares at $350:\nNote that there is a high chance, given the 0.41 delta ratio, that ADBE could fall to $350.00 in the next two weeks. That would mean the investor would effectively have a much lower buy-in point, with much better upside than just buying the stock.\nFor example, at the AnaChart price target average of $420.03 (see above), the investor's potential gain is +25%:\nThis would also be more profitable than just buying ADBE, as long it doesn't drop almost 6% in the next two weeks ahead of earnings, which doesn't seem likely. However, if it does, the investor may have a short-term unrealized capital loss (study Barchart's Option Education Center about the risks).\nThe bottom line here is that shorting OTM puts is a great way to play this undervalued stock.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

He needs to do better M&A and focus more on emerging markets.\"\nFreixe, a 63-year-old Frenchman, was sacked just over a year after his predecessor Mark Schneider was ousted for failing to turn Nestle around.\nThe company also said in June that Paul Bulcke, CEO from 2008 to 2016, will step down as chair in April 2026 and be replaced by Pablo Isla, a former CEO of Spanish fashion retailer Inditex.\nFreixe's dismissal follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate that breached Nestle's code of business conduct, Nestle said late on Monday.\nShares in the maker of Nescafe instant coffee and KitKat chocolate bars closed 0.7% lower in Zurich, paring earlier losses when the stock fell as much as 3.6%.\nSPEAK UP\nThe company said concerns about a possible relationship were first raised by staff via the company's internal reporting channel Speak Up, although an initial investigation was unsubstantiated.\nFreixe initially denied the relationship to the board, a company spokesperson said.\nWhen staff concerns persisted, Nestle ordered an investigation, overseen by Bulcke and Isla, with the support of Swiss lawyers Baer & Karrer, Nestle said.\nThe report was completed in recent days, leading to a board meeting and Freixe's dismissal on Monday.\nFreixe, who spent 39 years with Nestle, will receive no exit package following his departure, the company told Reuters.\nIn a short statement, Bulcke thanked Freixe for his service at Nestle, but said the dismissal was a \"necessary decision\".\nHis removal adds to a list of chief executives forced to resign following investigations into their relationships with colleagues.\nEnergy giant BP's former CEO Bernard Looney and McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook were both removed for failing to disclose relationships.\nSwiss financial news website Inside Paradeplatz reported that Freixe met the woman in 2022, before he became CEO, when he was head of Nestle's Latin America business.\nFreixe was not immediately available to comment when contacted via email. The female subordinate, whose identity has not been made public, left Nestle over the summer, a company spokesperson said.\nSwiss law does not prohibit relationships between senior executives, although most large companies - including Nestle - have internal codes of conduct that require them to be disclosed. If there is a conflict of interest, one of the people has to switch roles.\nAt Nestle, direct reporting relationship between family members, partners and close associates is not allowed, while indirect reporting lines are assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nCorporate governance expert Peter V Kunz, from the University of Bern, said he was not familiar with Nestle's rules, but that requirements at most public companies were broadly similar.\n\"In this respect, Mr Freixe's behaviour – regardless of whether it was legal or not – seems to me to be simply stupid and incomprehensible in this day and age,\" Kunz told Reuters, adding that he did not think investors had grounds for legal action against Nestle.\nSTABILITY SOUGHT\nAs price-sensitive consumers have turned to cheaper alternatives, Nestle's shares, a bedrock of the Swiss stock exchange, have lost almost a third of their value over the past five years, underperforming European peers.\nFreixe's appointment failed to halt the slide, with the company's shares shedding 17% during his leadership, disappointing investors.\nOne top-20 Nestle investor said Freixe had been a disappointment and that bringing in Navratil was an opportunity for a more ambitious overhaul.\nThe new CEO needs to slim down the company, cut costs and above all reduce the headcount, said the investor who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. It was also crucial that the company raise organic growth to boost volumes.\nIn July, Nestle launched a review of its underperforming vitamins business that could lead to the divestment of some brands after first-half sales volumes missed expectations.\nAJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said that the company would likely face a period of uncertainty.\n\"While Navratil is also an internal appointment, he will want to put his own mark on strategy and that suggests the clock could be reset when it comes to the turnaround plan,\" he said.\n(Writing by John Revill, Dave Graham and Louise Heavens; additional reporting by Paolo Laudani; Editing by Andrea Ricci, Muralikumar Anantharaman, Louise Heavens, Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Barbara Lewis)","content_hash":"8763cbd47a22d2d817bccd2608223ff0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5501,"method_rank":0}

If the government overreaches, then [the] lawyer's job is to put the government in the right place,\" he added.\nCook and James are some of the newer names of the lengthy client list Lowell has built over the years.\nJames won a civil fraud case against Trump and his family business in 2023. The penalty in the case — roughly $500 million — was thrown out last month.\nThat same month, the Trump Justice Department launched a federal grand jury investigation into James over alleged \"mortgage fraud.\"\nThe allegations against James were publicly leveled earlier this year by the same Trump ally, Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, who made the claims against Cook.\nLowell, not afraid to serve as the attack dog for his clients, has called the investigation into James \"the most blatant and desperate example of this administration carrying out the president's political retribution campaign.\"\nLowell, 73, has also represented several other high-profile clients during his career, including Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the president's son-in-law and eldest daughter.\nKushner and Ivanka Trump retained Lowell during Trump's first term to represent them in a special counsel probe of Russian interference in the 2016 elections.\nFormer Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., hired Lowell's then-firm to defend him in a 2017 federal bribery case that ended in a mistrial. Menendez was convicted in a separate federal bribery case last year.\nLowell also defended Hunter Biden, who was convicted last year on federal gun related charges, before being pardoned by his father, former President Joe Biden.\nLowell also served as minority counsel to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee during impeachment proceedings against former President Bill Clinton in 1998.\nBut since Trump's return, the bulk of Lowell's clients have been individuals targeted by the Trump administration, giving him a familiar playbook as he takes on the White House in legal filings and in the courtroom.\n\"The difference,\" he says, between the Trump administration and other administrations, is that the Trump White House overreaches \"over and over again.\"\n\"So I guess the bottom line is this is consistent with what I and the people I'm working with have always done. There's just more of it to do,\" Lowell said on NPR's \"Morning Edition\" last month.\nFollowing a familiar strategy in Cook's case as in his others, Lowell quickly filed a lawsuit on her behalf last week after Trump moved to fire her over unsupported allegations of mortgage fraud.\n\"Nothing in these vague, unsubstantiated allegations has any relevance to Gov. Cook's role at the Federal Reserve, and they in no way justify her removal from the Board,\" Lowell said in a statement on Friday, after Pulte filed a second criminal referral against Cook with the Justice Department.\nLowell also sharply criticized the effort during a Friday court hearing on the matter that ended without an immediate decision.\nA question in Cook's case is whether the alleged mortgage fraud is sufficient for Trump to remove Cook \"for cause,\" which is the threshold under the Federal Reserve Act. Pulte first raised and has relentlessly promoted the mortgage fraud allegations.\n\"You can't have Director Pulte's crazy midnight tweets be the cause\" for which Cook is removed, Lowell said during the hearing.\nEarlier this year, Lowell left Winston & Strawn, where he was a partner, and founded his own firm, Lowell & Associates. His boutique firm has quickly developed a roster of clients who have been targets of the Trump administration. Last week, he added former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Susan Monarez, as a client after she was fired from her role for political reasons.\nAnd he appears unlikely to stop taking on the administration anytime soon.\nDuring the recent NPR interview, Lowell compared James' case to George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\" noting \"the famous line about a government that engages in what's called doublespeak.\"\n\"I mean, think about what the president is doing. He has an office in the Department of Justice that is called something about the anti-weaponization office,\" he said, adding that \"they are using that office to weaponize the Justice Department against the president's adversaries.\"\n\"I know we get inured to the excess of authority that is happening in the last six months, but this strikes at such - the heart of the rule of law that people should pay attention,\" he said.","content_hash":"5620825c0df3f64096f7fc30243915c5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5490,"method_rank":0}

The company helps foreign brands — such as Ohio-based food blender seller Vitamix and skincare brand iS Clinical from California — sell online in China and other parts of Asia.\n\"Pickleball's rise in China reflects a broader shift toward active lifestyles and recreational sports participation,\" said Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of WPIC.\nThe racquet sport has been getting a lift from social media influencers and the resurgence of tennis in China, thanks in part to Chinese tennis player Zheng Qinwen winning the country's first Olympic gold medal in tennis singles last summer, Cooke said.\nInterest in tennis and pickleball in China started in 2023, accelerated in 2024 and is \"still doing very well\" this year, said Daniel Zipser, senior partner at McKinsey and leader of its Asia consumer and retail division. \"We're still now in the very strong acceleration growth momentum [period] for racquet sports more broadly.\"\nHe pointed out that locals are not just increasingly picking up the sport, but also watching professional games more.\nDuring the U.S.-based Professional Pickleball Association's (PPA) first \"Hong Kong Open\" competition from Aug. 21 to Aug. 24, \"there was actually a pretty big crowd that came out [to watch the] final gold medal matches,\" said Patrick Yan, founder of The Brine Agency, which represents Asian pickleball players. \"The entire tournament was maxed out and with a waitlist.\"\nYan also noted that the Hong Kong region now has many more pickleball courts compared to only two when he visited in December and January.\nThe Hong Kong Open was part of the inaugural PPA Tour Asia that includes matches in Japan, Malaysia and Vietnam.\nJack Wong of Hong Kong won the men's singles championship, while Roos van Reek of the Netherlands won in women's singles. The PPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether a \"China Slam\" initially set for early October was moving ahead as planned.\nThe PPA held its first U.S. pickleball tournament in Arizona in early 2020. The sport surged in popularity during the pandemic as communities quickly repurposed public spaces into free pickleball courts. Since then, pickleball has been the fastest-growing sport in the United States for four straight years, according to the latest Sports and Fitness Industry Association report in May.\nBusiness angle\nPickleball's recent growth in China has different business implications.\nIn contrast to U.S. suburbs, big Asian cities don't tend to have large neighborhood spaces, Yan pointed out. \"All these courts have to be built by people running businesses. They're operating for profit.... People started seeing it could be a huge profit, all these competing businesses and startups.\"\nHe added that the local pickleball tournament system is run by the national Chinese Tennis Association, making the sport's development \"quite systemized in comparison to other countries where it's local organizations that have to organize and fund everything.\"\nLu Bing, deputy head of the Suzhou Pickleball Association, said he learned about pickleball from an American friend in 2023. Subsequently, the local Shishan sports club that he is general manager of opened several pickleball courts, where hourly fees start at 60 yuan ($8.39). He added that many local schools are also encouraging students to play the sport by repurposing basketball courts and other facilities, he said.\nPart of pickleball's appeal in China is how easy it is for locals to learn the sport — some people still found tennis too hard after a few lessons at the sports club, he added.\nChallenges and opportunities\nWhile Lu said the club is an authorized sales partner for Joola, a U.S. pickleball brand, it's less clear how easily other foreign brands and organizations can immediately tap into the trend.\nDespite China's large potential compared to Vietnam and Malaysia, which are Asia's largest pickleball markets, it can be difficult for foreign businesses to navigate the Asian giant's market due to language barriers and the unique WeChat messaging app-based ecosystem, Yan said.\n\"I know eventually probably some courts will go out of business and some will survive and take over the market in certain areas,\" he said. \"Because it's so early into the market, a lot of people are trying to be the first mover basically.\"\nThe surge of consumer spending on pickleball and other sports in China comes as overall retail sales have been subdued since the pandemic.\nMcKinsey's Zipser said he's \"very confident\" about a pickup in consumption in the second half of this year into 2026, as he thinks consumer spending is now more detached from depressed sentiment.\n\"The last two years the consumer was just waiting for the good old days to be back,\" he said, pointing to hopes for a recovery in the property market and broad double-digit growth.\n\"People now have realized [that's] not going to happen,\" he said. \"They've moved on. They're no longer sitting there. ... Life needs to go on.\"","content_hash":"350ce0f75a19a764eb7fd4ece12d6807","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5350,"method_rank":0}

The remedies would limit any revenue-sharing agreement to one year, according to the Department of Justice.\nApple did not immediately respond for a request for comment.\n\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a blog post. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed its suit against Google in 2020, alleging that Google kept its share of the general search market by erecting strong barriers for challengers, such as its default search deals. The U.S. District Court in Washington ruled last August that Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act. Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of software and services, testified on Google's behalf about potential remedies.\nTuesday's filing was the first time the judge had detailed his proposed remedies.\nAnalysts previously said that it may take years before Apple is forced to make changes in response to a Google suit ruling. Google has said it will appeal the ruling, and analysts say any remedies trial could last for up to two years. Google can also appeal the outcome of the remedies trial, and the Supreme Court can choose take a look at it once appeals are exhausted.\nDefault agreements\nWhile Google contracts with companies such as Samsung and browser-maker Mozilla to be the default search engine on their platforms, the most important and biggest such \"default agreement\" deal is with Apple. Google paid all partners $26 billion in total to be the default search engine in 2021, according to documents discussed in court.\nGoogle paid because it funnels traffic from Apple's 1 billion iPhone users to its search engine, and the revenue is critical for the growth of Apple's services business, which investors love because it is so much more profitable than hardware sales.\nIn addition to the licensing payments, Apple says that it uses Google because it's the best search engine and that its priority is to offer the best tools to its customers.\nApple also has options if it cannot make Google the default search engine. Earlier this year, for example, Apple's Cue said in court as a witness for Google that the iPhone maker is also considering adding AI search engines as options to its software.\n\"Cue's testimony establishes that Google's high revenue share payments deterred Apple from trying to capture for itself all the advertising rents that flow through the Safari browser's default search box,\" the judge wrote in Tuesday's filing.\nApple's revenue from Google is reported in its financials as advertising revenue, which is reported as part of the company's Services business, which also includes AppleCare warranties, cloud services like iCloud, and digital content like apps and Apple Music.\nWATCH: Federal judge rules Google does not have to divest Chrome","content_hash":"17db6fb48f030c809bd7ba4da7e21321","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4754,"method_rank":0}

Those early stumbles may have been a blessing in disguise.\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge ruled against the most severe consequences that were proposed by the U.S. Department of Justice as part of a landmark antitrust case filed in 2020. Google lost the case last year, but the judge decided that the search giant can keep its Chrome browser, defying the government's request.\nThe harshest punishment handed down bars Google from engaging in exclusive contracts that come with payments or licensing. The company must also share search data.\nGoogle's victory, despite its loss at trial, is largely the result of the fiercely competitive AI industry that's taken shape in less than three years. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta wrote in a filing that \"the emergence of GenAI changed the course of this case.\"\n\"Google is still the dominant firm in the relevant product markets,\" Mehta wrote. \"No existing rival has wrested market share from Google. And no new competitor has entered the market. But artificial intelligence technologies, particularly generative AI (\"GenAI\"), may yet prove to be game changers,\"\nTuesday's decision lands nearly a year after Mehta ruled Google illegally held a monopoly in internet search. Shares of Google soared in extended trading.\nMehta dedicated roughly 30 pages of the 226-page filing to explaining generative AI and the market as it exists today. He described the space as \"highly competitive\" and wrote that there have been \"numerous new market entrants\" with access to \"a lot of capital.\"\nIn other words, the AI market has become hugely important and has entirely different competitive dynamics than search, which Google dominates.\nMehta said it will stay that way.\n\"Google cannot use the same anticompetitive playbook for its GenAI products that it used for Search,\" he wrote.\nGoogle and the Justice Department both referenced the significance of AI in their statements on Tuesday.\nLee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post after the ruling that, \"Today's decision recognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information.\"\nMulholland added that the company has \"concerns\" about how the sharing of search data will \"impact our users and their privacy,\" and that the company is reviewing the decision.\nThe DOJ said in its statement that the decision will \"pry open\" the search market after Google's extended stretch of dominance.\n\"The ruling also recognizes the need to prevent Google from using the same anticompetitive tactics for its GenAI products as it used to monopolize the search market, and the remedies will reach GenAI technologies and companies,\" the DOJ said.\nGenerative AI startups are repeatedly mentioned throughout the document.\nOpenAI's name comes up 30 times, Anthropic is named six times and Perplexity shows up in 24 instances. Anthropic and Perplexity had not even been founded when the case was originally filed, as they launched in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nOpenAI had been around for several years, but it was a long way from becoming a household name. Its ChatGPT chatbot was introduced to the public in late 2022, an unveiling that sparked the generative AI boom.\nChatGPT was named 28 times in Tuesday's filing.\n\"Today, tens of millions of people use GenAI chatbots, like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude, to gather information that they previously sought through internet search,\" the filing says.\nThe remedies determination also mentioned Elon Musk's xAI as well as other companies including DuckDuckGo, which has a chat service called Duck.ai, Meta and China's DeepSeek as competitors in the space.\n\"These remedies proceedings thus have been as much about promoting competition among GSEs [general search engines] as ensuring that Google's dominance in search does not carry over into the GenAI space,\" the filing says.\n— CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Federal judge rules Google does not have to divest Chrome","content_hash":"b2ca4111a705c30852c90d33fc4c691a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4194,"method_rank":0}

New tariff drama was setting Wall Street up for a sharply lower open this morning. The S & P 500 finished lower Friday but higher for the fourth straight month. Embarking on the first day of trading in September, historically the worst month of the year, investors now have to deal with the added uncertainty of whether President Donald Trump's tariffs are legal. No need to panic, though. 2. In a showdown almost certainly headed for the Supreme Court, a federal appeals court ruled after Friday's market close that only Congress has the authority to apply sweeping levies. Also pressuring stocks was a big jump in bond yields on the prospect of the U.S. having to refund tariffs collected. Sending back billions of dollars would worsen the nation's already precarious fiscal situation. 3. Kraft Heinz is splitting itself into two companies. One will be focused on grocery stapes including brands such as Lunchables, and the other on sauces and spreads like Philadelphia cream cheese. It's effectively an unwind of the 2015 megamerger. Shares aren't moving much this morning. This breakup had been rumored in the press. 4. Elliott Management has taken a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo , The Wall Street Journal reported , saying it's one of the revered activist firm's biggest positions ever. Shares of the beverage and food maker, which has seen its namesake soda lose market share, are up more than 4% on the news. 5. Melius Research reiterated its buy rating on Club name Broadcom and raised its price target to $335 a share ahead of earnings Thursday night . While analysts said the chipmaker may struggle to raise expectations even further with the print, they believe any weakness should be bought because \"there is such a shortage of this type of leadership outside Nvidia in AI.\" We also own Nvidia for the Club. 6. Walmart was added to Goldman Sachs' conviction buy list, with analysts believing the retail giant should gain market share in this tariff environment. I agree after seeing the dollar store revival. However, I still like Club stocks Costco and TJX Companies as ways to play the value-conscious shopper. 7. The return of the pumpkin spice latte helped drive a \"record-breaking sales week\" at Club name Starbucks' company-operated U.S. stores, CEO Brian Niccol told employees in a message seen by Bloomberg News . We've been patient with this one while Niccol tries to work his magic, and the turn is here. 8. A couple CEO shakeups: Takeshi Niinami resigned as chief of Japanese whiskey maker Suntory amid a police investigation into the possible purchase of an illegal supplement. KitKat maker Nestle removed Laurent Freixe as CEO because he failed to disclose a relationship with a subordinate. 9. Morgan Stanley upgraded Zscaler to an overweight buy from equal weight and raised its price target to $320 from $280. The analysts cited longer-term benefits from the industry shift toward platformization. We own Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike , both of which are further along in offering one-stop shops for clients' cybersecurity needs. 10. UBS upgraded Corning to buy from hold, arguing the company well-known for supplying iPhone glass could see sustainable higher growth thanks to AI-driven fiber optic growth used to connect data centers. The firm took its price target to $84 from $65.

But the advantage of being anchored in traditional, upper-class style is that it tends to transcend time. Many of the attendees at the 2025 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance car show dressed in a manner that may have seemed at least familiar 100 years ago to the original owners of the 1924 Hispano-Suiza that won Best in Show at Pebble this year. Incidentally, Ralph Lauren himself has also won Best in Show twice at the world's most prestigious Concours d'Elegance, with his 1938 Bugatti in 1990 and a 1930 \"Count Trossi\" Mercedes roadster in 1993. Having lasting appeal is good for creating a stable business, and having an affluent customer base helps with margins. Appealing to well-educated and affluent consumers aged 25-54 in urban and suburban areas provides pricing power and economic resilience. Two years ago, while discussing the company's operating results, CEO Patrice Louvet said : \"(The) more value-oriented consumers are a smaller part of our customer base and getting smaller and smaller, as we bring in more higher-value consumers.\" Financially, the company delivered robust fiscal second-quarter results, with revenue reaching $1.72 billion, a 13.7% year-over-year increase and exceeding estimates, alongside adjusted EPS of $3.77, which also beat forecasts. Trailing 12-month revenue grew 9.6%, supported by 69% gross margins, accelerating comparable store sales and wholesale recovery. EPS is projected to rise from $10.31 in FY2024 to $11.92 in FY2025, underscoring earnings momentum. FY2026 Free cash flow yield is expected to be just under 4.7% (RL's fiscal year ends March 31), and the street anticipates more than 13.5% growth in free cash flow for FY2027 ended March 31, 2027. Despite these solid results, RL has actually fallen about 1.9% since its quarterly earnings release on Aug. 7. The issue isn't the company's operating performance; it's the stock performance. RL's total return over the past five years is nearly 337%. At this stage, the company is nearly 50% above its five-year historical earnings multiple. Supported by solid operating performance but suppressed by a well-above-average multiple, one can imagine that RL could be range-bound near-term, particularly before their next quarterly earnings release. Consequently, this could provide an opportunity for a strangle sale. One could collect approximately $7.20 by selling the October 270\/330 strangle, or about 2.4% of the current stock price over the next 6½ weeks, nearly 19.5% annualized with an attractive probability of profit. The risk, of course, is that one could get long the stock at the put strike less the premium collected, a ~ 11.5% discount to the current stock price, or short at the $330 call strike plus the premium collected, or a 13.5% premium to the current price — which is already close to the stock's all-time highs. But a move that substantial seems unlikely in the next six weeks given the stock is already up more than 65% to above average valuations. DISCLOSURES: None.

(ORLY) is a leading retailer of auto parts and accessories, serving both DIY car owners and professional mechanics. Headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, it operates across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Canada, offering an extensive catalog of parts, tools, and maintenance supplies. With strong roots in customer service and reliability, O’Reilly has grown into one of the most recognized names in the automotive retail space. Today, the company carries a market capitalization of $88 billion.\nCompanies worth $10 billion or more are generally classified as “large-cap stocks,” and O’Reilly comfortably sits in that category – it is no accident. The company’s rise is fueled by an expansive product lineup, robust distribution networks, and customer-friendly perks such as battery testing, tool rentals, and fluid recycling. By serving everyone from professional technicians to everyday drivers with equal ease, O’Reilly has built a reputation for reliability and scale. Add in sharp operational efficiency and a vast market reach, and it is clear why the company is a leader in the automotive aftermarket industry.\nO’Reilly’s stock has demonstrated strong and steady performance on Wall Street. On Aug. 7, ORLY touched a 52-week high of $104.86, now just 1.1% off the peak. Over the past three months, shares of the automotive aftermarket retailer surged 15.1%, beating the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 9.3% climb.\nIt is not just the short-term rally that stands out, but the past year tells an even better story, with shares rallying 36.6% against the benchmark’s 15.5% gain. And 2025 has been nothing short of stellar - ORLY stock rose 31.2% year-to-date (YTD), handily outpacing the S&P 500’s 9.8% gains.\nORLY’s bullish momentum is evident as the stock continues to trade confidently above its 200-day moving average. Since early July, it has also held strong above the 50-day mark, signaling sustained investor confidence and steady upward pressure despite minor market fluctuations.\nThis retail stock’s outperformance has had Wall Street sitting up straighter, spilling coffee, and double-checking their screens – it has been that impressive, and O’Reilly Automotive has earned every bit of the applause. A superbly run business, it boasts a wide economic moat, industry-leading profitability, and excellent capital allocation. Its growth story is backed by a resilient business model and steady expansion opportunities, enabling the stock to consistently outperform the benchmark.\nOne of O’Reilly’s biggest tailwinds is America’s aging vehicle fleet. With the average car now 12.8 years old, demand for aftermarket parts is surging. As vehicles age past their warranties, consumers turn to O’Reilly for maintenance and repairs. Add the rising number of cars on the road, and the company’s long-term growth prospects remain robust, with revenue growing and 210 new stores planned for 2025.\nWhat sets O’Reilly apart is its consistency. Whether the economy booms or slumps, demand stays strong. In economic booms, increased driving accelerates wear and tear, and in downturns, consumers delay new purchases but invest in repairs. That stability has powered 32 consecutive years of comparable same-store sales growth, with 2025 set to mark the 33rd. Investors are betting on that reliability - and winning.\nIn the automotive aftermarket race, ORLY continues to edge out rival Advance Auto Parts, Inc. (AAP), even as AAP has rallied 30.8% over the past 52 weeks and 29% YTD.\nAnalysts remain upbeat on O’Reilly Automotive’s momentum, expecting it to regain speed and possibly set fresh highs in the coming months. Overall, ORLY has a “Strong Buy” consensus rating from the 28 analysts covering the stock. The mean price target of $109.50 hints at a potential upside of 5.6% from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

September may be the opposite. The S & P 500 climbed to a fresh record last month, topping 6,500 for the first time. The benchmark posted its fourth straight winning month, rising nearly 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite also reached all-time highs last month. But Tuesday, the first trading day of September, is shaping up to be a tough one, as investors grapple with a laundry list of worries for the month. 1. Possible tariff revenue loss The newest concern on Wall Street comes from Washington, after a federal appeals court ruled Friday that most of President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal. \"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the court said . \"Tariffs are a core Congressional power.\" This is not just a blow to Trump politically. The ruling also raises questions over whether the money already collected from tariffs will have to be returned, potentially worsening the already-fragile U.S. fiscal situation. \"If this ruling is upheld, refunds of existing tariffs are on the table, which could cause a surge in Treasury issuance and yields,\" wrote Ed Mills of Raymond James. 2. Bond yields soaring in U.S. and abroad The U.S. tariff uncertainty drove Treasury yields higher. The 30-year bond yield spiked to 4.99%, near levels not seen since mid-July. The benchmark 10-year note yield traded nearly 8 basis points higher at 4.3%. Rates abroad are also climbing. Concerns over the U.K.'s budget sent the 10-year Gilt yield to its highest level since 1998, according to Deutsche Bank. France's 10-year yield spiked to 3.6%, touching a level not seen in more than a decade, as the country faces a no-confidence vote. Should yields around the world keep moving higher, they could pressure the stock market, making bond income more attractive and raising the cost of capital for business. \"A new wave of sovereign risk is washing over European economies, with the UK and France most vulnerable as they navigate fiscal fragility, political instability and cratering bond market confidence,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist with Yardeni Research. 3. Fed drama Wall Street this month also has to contend with the Trump administration's efforts to oust Lisa Cook from her post as Federal Reserve governor. Cook requested a temporary restraining order to halt Trump from firing her. But a court hearing in Washington, D.C., last week ended without a ruling on the matter . 4. Seasonality and jobs report Investors also have to navigate seasonal headwinds, with a major economic report due out this week. Data from the Stock Trader's Almanac shows the S & P 500 averages a 0.7% decline in September, making it historically the worst month of the year for the benchmark . Over just the past five years, the S & P 500's September performance has been worse, averaging a 4.2% decline in that stretch. \"2H September is the worst two-week period of the year with an average return of -1.38% looking back from 1928,\" traders at Goldman Sachs noted, referring to just the back half of the month. \"However, the first half of September is more moderate with smaller chops which is a trend we believe will dictate this month's early trading due in large part to current positioning.\" On top of that, the August U.S. jobs report is set for release this Friday. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a gain of 75,000 jobs last month, slightly above the 73,000 gain reported for July. However, the number will have to be in the Goldilocks range of not too hot and not cold for the market to like it. If it's too strong, it may tamp down expectations for Fed rate cuts.

The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"\nOne of the key areas of focus was the exclusive contracts Google held for distribution.\nIn his decision Tuesday, Mehta said the company can make payments to preload products, but it cannot have exclusive contracts that condition payments or licensing.\nThe DOJ had asked Google to stop the practice of \"compelled syndication,\" which refers to the practice of making certain deals with companies to ensure its search engine remains the default choice in browsers and smartphones.\n\"The court's ruling today recognizes the need for remedies that will pry open the market for general search services, which has been frozen in place for over a decade,\" the DOJ said in a press release. \"The ruling also recognizes the need to prevent Google from using the same anticompetitive tactics for its GenAI products as it used to monopolize the search market, and the remedies will reach GenAI technologies and companies.\"\nGoogle pays Apple billions of dollars per year to be the default search engine on iPhones. It's lucrative for Apple and a valuable way for Google to get more search volume and users.\nApple stock rose 4% on Tuesday after hours.\n\"Google will not be barred from making payments or offering other consideration to distribution partners for preloading or placement of Google Search, Chrome, or its GenAI products. Cutting off payments from Google almost certainly will impose substantial—in some cases, crippling—downstream harms to distribution partners, related markets, and consumers, which counsels against a broad payment ban.\"\nGoogle was also ordered to loosen its hold on search data.\nDuring the remedies trial in May, the DOJ asked the judge to force Google to share the data it uses for generating search results, such as data about what users click on.\nMehta ruled Tuesday that Google will have to make available certain search index data and user interaction data, though \"not ads data.\"\nGoogle does not have to share or provide access to granular data with advertisers.\nThe court narrowed the datasets Google will be required to share and said they must occur on \"ordinary commercial terms that are consistent with Google's current syndication services.\"","content_hash":"0051c5dc6b968661f33b5e47e668ecfe","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3802,"method_rank":0}

Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. 1. The markets are lower Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling more than 500 points and the S & P 500 down more than 1% to kick off September. Investors are digesting the latest tariff developments and rising Treasury yields. President Donald Trump's aggressive global trade policies took a massive hit after a federal appeals court on Friday night ruled that most of his \"reciprocal\" duties were imposed illegally. \"This is one ugly day,\" Jim Cramer said, but he added that he's not seeing a lot to buy yet. \"My reluctance to buy anything has to do with this is the first really bad down day,\" he said. \"We've got the tariff issue; we've got China, Russia and India getting together. We have some strong economic numbers and we've got [the jobs report] on Friday,\" Jim added. Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysis, also noted that seasonality could be a factor in Tuesday's sell-off because September is historically known as a weaker month for stocks. 2. Salesforce shares are down ahead of Wednesday's earnings after the closing bell. In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley said their channel checks are stable overall but \"slightly uninspiring.\" However, the analysts noted some traction on deals for its important new AI offering known as Agentforce, which is part of why they think Salesforce's topline revenue growth could accelerate in calendar 2026. Analysts raised its price target on Salesforce by $1 to $405. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently said on a podcast that the software provider reduced its headcount in its customer support unit by thousands of people due to the use of AI. \"People are expensive at Salesforce. So, [the layoffs are] not bad. But I have to tell you. I don't think that's what people are in Salesforce for. I think they're in it for growth,\" Jim said. 3. Meanwhile, Starbucks is showing more signs of progress in its turnaround. In a memo to employees seen by Bloomberg News, CEO Brian Niccol said that the coffee chain's fall product launch helped deliver a record breaking sales week across company-operated stores in the U.S., along with strong sales in Canada. \"They're doing some things that will hurt the gross margins, I think, but help the throughput,\" Jim said, referencing a term that describes the number of customers served per hour. \"I do point out that when he says that it's record numbers, it means something's working. Sell that stock at your own peril,\" Jim said. 4. Stocks covered in Tuesday's rapid fire at the end of the video were: Pepsi Co , Constellation Brands , Kraft Heinz , McDonald's , and Lam Research .

But, sadly, you don't have to walk too far in London to see boarded-up pubs as trouble brews for the industry.\nOne pub is set to close every single day in 2025 across Great Britain, according to latest figures from the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA). The industry body, which represents more than 20,000 pubs, estimated that 378 pubs will close this year across England, Wales, and Scotland, which would amount to more than 5,600 direct job losses.\nThis comes amid a challenging backdrop for the industry, with a combination of reduced consumer spending and rising costs.\nIncreases to the minimum wage for workers, National Insurance contributions and business rates payments have contributed in part to some 89,000 job losses in the hospitality sector since the Autumn Budget, according to trade body UKHospitality; that's more than half of all job losses in the U.K. since last October.\nLondon is experiencing a significant number of pub closures.\nTim Skinner, manager at The Devonshire Arms pub near Bond Street in central London, told CNBC that higher costs are having a big impact on his business.\n\"The National Insurance increased directly, the business rates increased directly, and obviously, maintaining the level of VAT where it is means that a business like this needs to find around £30,000 (around $40,000) extra a year just to stay still,\" he said.\nLike many other publicans, Skinner says he's had to pass some of these higher costs on to the consumer. This has led to the average price of a pint of beer surpassing £5 this summer.\n\"We're having to pass some of those costs on to the customers, but we're very mindful of where we sit in the marketplace. It is still very competitive, and we're having to fight for every pound that the customer is willing to spend. So we're trying to make savings where we can, but we're running out of opportunities to do that,\" Skinner added.\nThe British pub sector provides a significant economic contribution to the U.K. through direct revenue, employment, and its extensive supply chain. However, with the industry in decline and numerous closures, the British Beer & Pub Association says the knock-on effects for the U.K. economy will be significant.\n\"From grain to glass, our sector supports over £30 billion being pushed into the economy, £18 billion in taxes, one million jobs,\" Charlie Hall, a spokesman for the BBPA, told CNBC.\nWith more pubs predicted to close this year, that will have \"a massive impact\" on the supply chain, he said, with everyone from hop farmers to glass manufacturers affected by those losses.\nBritish pub landlords warn that urgent action is needed to cut business rates and VAT in the upcoming Autumn Budget. Pubs and breweries are amongst the most heavily taxed business sectors in the U.K.\nMick Howard, operations director of Star Pubs, highlighted a need to reform business rates, cut beer duty and avoid any further rises in National Insurance contributions, to protect the British pub industry. If nothing is done, more pub closures could lie ahead.\n\"We know that consumers are still going to pubs. They might go to pubs at different times. Now, they might go to pubs for different reasons, but they still go and visit their local pub. But without that support, if the costs still going up, the pubs just won't be able to open the doors,\" Howard told CNBC.","content_hash":"57664117463584c2f8a9e243d64e35f8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3428,"method_rank":0}

For the six months ended 2025, Prosper Stars & Stripes returned a net return of (0.8%) compared to (1.8%) for the Russell and +5.9% for the HFRI.

In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2025.\nIn its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, Prosper Stars & Stripes highlighted stocks such as Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR). Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) is a US-based live entertainment and media company. Sphere Entertainment Co.’s (NYSE:SPHR) one-month return was 8.53%, and its shares lost 2.77% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On August 29, 2025, Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) stock closed at $45.31 per share, with a market capitalization of $1.631 billion.\nProsper Stars & Stripes stated the following regarding Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\"Sphere Entertainment Co. (NYSE:SPHR) was the largest detractor in our short portfolio during the second quarter of 2025. The company operates two primary business units: the Sphere entertainment venue in Las Vegas, NV, with a capacity of approximately 17,500, and MSG Networks (“MSGN”), a regional sports network focused on the greater New York City metro area. While the Las Vegas Sphere has garnered rave reviews from fans and stands out as a technological marvel, we believe its unit economics are complex and challenging. The venue's construction cost approximately $2.3 billion, and the development of ‘Postcard from Earth’ alone incurred expenses of around $80 million over nearly 15 months. Given Las Vegas’s intensely competitive entertainment market and heightened economic sensitivity, we believe the path to sustainable profitability is uncertain. MSG Networks, the company’s other major asset, controls content distribution rights to broadcast partners. However, we see the continued unraveling of the traditional cable bundle as placing significant strain on MSGN’s business model. We believe the sustainability of these assets’ value is increasingly doubtful. Additionally, Sphere carries roughly $1.3 billion in debt and is consuming cash at a substantial rate. Moreover, the majority owner, the Dolan family, has a notable history of eroding shareholder value, further amplifying risk. Unfortunately, during the quarter, the company announced a series of debt transactions that the market perceived positively. As a result, we exited our short position in line with our stop-loss framework, preserving capital while remaining cautious on the company’s outlook.\"","content_hash":"6efa571d288c5febbe65578bac2802d0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3178,"method_rank":0}

His pledge comes amid stalling U.S. and European efforts to draw Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin into conceding to bilateral ceasefire talks with his Ukrainian counterpart.\nThe White House has separately piled on indirect pressure on Russia's oil consumers, implementing additional levies on imports of Indian goods it attributed to New Delhi's ongoing purchases of Moscow's crude. India has criticized the impositions as \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"\nIn a further sign of deteriorating relations, U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday doubled down on lambasting Washington's trade ties with India as a \"totally one sided disaster.\"\nCritically, Washington has yet to move against China, the world's largest crude importer and Russia's biggest oil buyer since the introduction of G7 sanctions.

The group, which recently expedited unwinding a 2.2-million-barrels-per-day production cut, is widely seen as unlikely to change course on strategy this week.\n\"We believe, just like the broader market, that the group will leave production levels unchanged for October,\" ING analysts said Tuesday. \"The scale of the surplus through next year means it's unlikely the group will bring additional supply onto the market. The bigger risk is OPEC+ deciding to reinstate supply cuts, given concerns about a surplus.\"\nU.S. rates\nMarket participants are likewise following this week's release of the U.S. August job report, expected to be factored into the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting of Sept. 16-17. The Fed is currently widely expected to lower interest rates at the time, in a move that could echo into a softer greenback and push up demand for U.S.-denominated commodities, such as oil.","content_hash":"0eed051583e2d633e2ba979a24f9746d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3156,"method_rank":0}

And it's inching close to AdImpact's price tag for the 2024 presidential election cycle, which reached $11.2 billion.\n\"We anticipate record spending across all race types due to the highly competitive national environment, with congressional spending specifically set to reach new heights,\" the report said.\nThe race to snag control of Congress this year remains close, as Republicans hope to hold onto their 53-47 majority in the Senate and their 219-212 majority in the House. Key races in battleground states could determine or flip those majorities.\nThis cycle's boost is largely expected to come from the connected TV, or CTV, category, which covers any television that connects to streaming apps and services. That spending will surge to $2.5 billion, AdImpact said, growing by 2% and earning a spot as the fastest-growing media type.\nBroadcast television is forecast to continue to hold the largest share of spending at 49%, and local cable and social media spending are expected to decline slightly, the report said. That comes even as legacy cable TV has been bleeding millions of subscribers each year as streaming takes over as the primary way the world watches television.\n\"With $2.5 billion projected, CTV is now a core marketing strategy for 2026 campaigns, offering advertisers the ability to maximize both efficiency and overall reach,\" said John Link, AdImpact's senior vice president of data.\nThe forms of media vary based on types of elections, though, with down-ballot campaigns more likely to invest in cable and radio than larger races, according to AdImpact.\nThe most spending is expected to be in California, followed by Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina, all of which have highly competitive races this cycle. Advertising on Senate races is projected to reach $2.8 billion, while spending for House races is expected to surpass $2 billion for the first time ever as Republicans aim to hold onto their majority.\nThe midterm season has also already seen a surge in early spending, AdImpact noted. Though the off-year spending typically only amounts to 10% to 15% of total spending, 2025 has already surpassed records, hitting roughly $900 million by Aug. 26. That's 37% higher than the same point in 2023 and 58% higher than 2021.\nThis season's surge comes amid a particularly charged election cycle. Local elections have also garnered national attention and big spending, like the New York City mayoral race between Democratic nominee and state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, which has raked in millions in campaign funds and capitalized on social media ads.","content_hash":"517ae7c0d6832b95e53621f9cafd523a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2980,"method_rank":0}

On Monday, the world’s richest man wrote on social media that about 80% of Tesla’s value would eventually come from its autonomous Optimus bots. Tesla on Monday also released its “Master Plan, Part IV,” which put increased emphasis on physical AI.\nElon Musk’s lofty vision for Tesla includes less attention on electric vehicles and a doubling down on its autonomous robots, even as production for the bots have hit numerous snags.\nThe Tesla CEO said on Monday 80% of Tesla’s value would someday come from Optimus robots, the humanoid bots Musk’s company introduced in 2021, intended to take on the factory tasks that humans find menial and often dangerous. Musk’s forecast of the bots’ success came shortly after Tesla revealed its “Master Plan, Part IV” on Monday, outlining Tesla’s goals for the future.\n“This next chapter in Tesla’s story will help create a world we’ve only just begun to imagine and will do so at a scale that we have yet to see,” the plan said. “We are building the products and services that bring AI into the physical world.”\nInvestment in adding embedded intelligence to specialized bots has been top of mind for tech leaders. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has similarly singled out “physical AI” as the final iteration of AI’s four-part evolution, recently introducing a $3,499 developer kit for robot “brains” that begins shipping this month. Musk’s emphasis on Optimus robots as the future of Tesla is signaling a similar agenda, according to one analyst.\n“Elon is not alone in seeing the big future of robotics and physical AI,” Kevin Cook, senior stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, told Fortune. “He’s been obviously training his Tesla cars for 15 years with AI systems, and so it’s only natural for him to move into other autonomous machines.”\nShifting gears has not been easy for Tesla. The Optimus robots were initially greeted with skepticism from analysts and have continued to encounter obstacles. At the beginning of the year, Musk predicted Tesla would manufacture thousands of Optimus bots in 2025 and said the project could generate more than $10 trillion in revenue in the long term. In April, however, Musk told investors production of the machines was hobbled by President Donald Trump’s trade disputes with China, which hardened export controls on the rare-earth materials necessary to build the motors inside Tesla’s bots. Milan Kovac, who oversaw Tesla’s Optimus development, stepped down from his role in June.\nTesla’s increased focus on growing the company outside its EV production comes as car sales continue to plummet, with deliveries in the European Union plunging 40% in July. The company reported a 13% global sales decline in the first half of 2025, on pace for a second consecutive year of dwindling sales.","content_hash":"f4b54f150c6f9f7f0d8cf9f4bca53aff","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2974,"method_rank":0}

According to Broadwood, STAAR’s board also displayed “intransigence” in relation to Broadwood’s books and record demand, stating it had received no documents since making the request more than three weeks ago.\nSTAAR’s Q1 2025 financials revealed a 45% decline in sales to $42.6m, down from $77.4m in Q1 2024, with the US-based company chiefly attributing the sharp decline to weakened demand in China and additional headwinds due to government initiatives in the country affecting device procurement.\nBroadwood’s primary point of contention relates to the proposed financial terms of Alcon’s acquisition. The shareholder pointed out that Alcon previously offered $55 per share for STAAR when it moved to acquire the company in October 2024 – a price “far above” the current offer of $28 per share.\nAlcon subsequently pulled back from its initial offer after learning that STAAR was facing inventory management challenges, with the revelation giving the Swiss company pause over STAAR’s short-term performance and stability.\nHowever, Broadwood highlighted that these previous challenges had now been addressed, and that STAAR had improved its cost discipline, a resolution Broadwood now expects will lead to a “sharp rebound” in STAAR’s revenue and profits in the coming quarters.\nBolstering these claims, Broadwood also highlighted that the results of a clinical trial [NCT06700460] comparing Alcon’s LASIK platform to STAAR’s EVO Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) for treating astigmatism are soon due for publication. The shareholder said the trial results may have “significant implications” for the competitive positioning of the EVO ICL relative to LASIK, and in turn to STAAR’s “growth prospects and strategic value” to potential acquirers within the ophthalmic products industry.\nThe company said in a statement: “Broadwood is concerned that stockholders are now being asked to accept inferior terms, despite the fact that the challenges that followed Alcon’s initial bid have been substantially resolved.”\nIn closing, Broadwood reiterated that it held “serious concerns” about the overall fairness and integrity of the sales process, stating: “In addition to the insufficient merger consideration, [the factors at hand] lead us to believe that the acquisition is not in the best interest of STAAR’s shareholders. Accordingly, Broadwood intends to vote against the acquisition and asks the board to immediately reconsider its recommendation thereof.”","content_hash":"f44fd8a264c37258bd49a94ea51563d8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2898,"method_rank":0}

With origins dating to 1827, NSC owns and operates a rail network spanning 19,200 route miles and 22 states. From late 2022 through early 2025, the transports industry experienced a freight downturn with a consistent decline in shipment volumes due to destocking and a drop in consumer demand from the pandemic highs. Rail intermodal was hit particularly hard, with 2024 industrywide intermodal volumes down roughly 10% from 2022. However, volumes have begun to recover in 2025, with weekly rail traffic up mid-single digits from a year ago. While concerns remain surrounding the impact of tariffs and global trade fluctuations, NSC should be resilient given its strong presence in the Eastern US connecting 60% of the country’s consumer base and manufacturing base. Importantly, NSC’s operating ratio (OR), a primary measure of rail efficiency, significantly lags that of major peers, with adjusted OR’s in mid- to high 60s versus peers in the low 60s or high 50s percentiles. Increasing efficiency and lowering the OR is a primary goal of Mark George, who took over as CEO in September 2024. Through the implementation of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), Mr. George and his team believe NSC can achieve a low-60s OR in the medium term and a below 60 OR over the longer term.

Rising long-term government bond yields in Britain, France and the United States may reflect debt concerns as we enter the annual budget season and higher oil prices aren’t helping things, but the simultaneous rise of gold and the dollar made less sense.\nThe rise in volatility has knocked back stocks worldwide.\n* Europe was the epicentre of Tuesday's bond jolt, with France's 30-year government bond yields hitting their highest in over 16 years as Prime Minister François Bayrou began talks with political parties in a bid to prevent a government collapse over his budget. Britain's 30-year borrowing costs rose to their highest levels since 1998 and sterling slid more than 1% on Tuesday, with this week's reshuffle of PM Keir Starmer's economic team ahead of the Autumn budget raising questions about the position of Chancellor Rachel Reeves. With Fed independence a key focus in a big week for labor data on Wall Street, U.S. 30-year yields stalked 5% yet again and hit their highest in over a month - sending the 2-to-30-year yield curve to its highest in almost four years.\n* With China's gathering of its Russian, North Korean and Indian allies this week as a backdrop, gold soared to record highs on a heady mix of long-term inflation and government debt concerns - bursting through April's prior peak to top $3,500 per ounce and clocking year-to-date gains of 33%. However, the dollar - unusually in times of stress this year - also surged against the euro, sterling, yen and yuan - with U.S. payrolls eyed, real-time U.S. GDP estimates running at 3.5% for the third quarter and August manufacturing surveys due later.\n* Elsewhere, global stocks were down generally - with Wall Street futures down about 0.5% after a rough session last Friday saw a 1%-plus shakeout in the tech sector. There was also a wave of uncertainty over fresh legal challenges to President Trump's 'reciprocal' tariffs - a ruling that arrived after Friday's closing bell. The tech wobble hit Japanese and South Korean stocks on Monday, but they recovered some of that today.

It’s Satoshi’s,’ Says Bruce Liu as OPCAT_Labs Pushes to Reboot Bitcoin’s Code\nWithout OP_CAT, Bruce Liu says Bitcoin is as \"useful as a jumbo jet without wings\" capable of much more than it’s allowed to do, but stuck on the ground while Ethereum and Solana soar.\nLiu, the founder of OPCAT_Labs, says a single opcode, OP_CAT, could transform Bitcoin from static digital gold into programmable money that rivals other Layer-1 chains.\nOP_CAT is a long-disabled opcode in Bitcoin’s code that, if re-enabled, would allow developers to concatenate data in scripts and unlock a range of new possibilities, from vaults and covenants to decentralized exchanges and zero-knowledge proofs.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain, if OP_CAT was re-enabled, would be as programmable as Ethereum or Solana, said Liu.\n\"OP_CAT is not new code. It was never deleted, just commented out and disabled. We are not adding my opcode or somebody else’s. It’s Satoshi’s,” Liu told CoinDesk during an interview on the sidelines of BTC Asia in Hong Kong.\nBut the push for OP_CAT doesn’t come without friction.\nSatoshi disabled it in 2010 over concerns it could enable denial-of-service attacks. Opponents argue that any new opcode introduces “unknown unknowns,” threatening Bitcoin’s hard-won stability. Others take a philosophical stance: Bitcoin should remain digital gold, rather than chasing Ethereum’s programmability.\nLiu pushes back by appealing to Satoshi Nakamoto’s design.\n“If Bitcoin was only for payments, why did Satoshi include Script at all?” he asked. “OP_CAT isn’t my invention, it’s Satoshi’s code. It was never deleted, only disabled.”\nLiu says OP_CAT would bring Script to life – the basic programming language built into the Bitcoin blockchain – allowing Bitcoin to do more than just payments and enabling features like vaults or even basic DeFi.\nOP_CAT, he said, would unlock more of that potential, letting developers build things like vaults, covenants, or even simple DeFi apps on Bitcoin.\nTo reinforce the point, he points back to Nakamoto’s own explanation of why Script existed in the first place.\nIn a 2010 Bitcointalk post, Nakamoto wrote that Bitcoin’s design was effectively “set in stone” from its first release, so he wanted it to accommodate every type of transaction he could imagine.\nHard-coding each one would have created endless special cases, Satoshi explained, so instead the Bitcoin creator introduced Script as a general solution that let users define their own conditions while nodes only needed to check if those conditions were met.\nAlready, the company launched a fork of Bitcoin in a virtual machine with OP_CAT enabled to demonstrate its potential, complete with SDKs, APIs and a JavaScript-like programming language designed to make building on Bitcoin accessible to Web2 developers.","content_hash":"0d619b3407c93a7986cfe1ad9e4f830a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2820,"method_rank":0}

As of Aug. 15, 2025, Apple stock was priced at $231.59 per share, with Microsoft stock more than double at $520.17 per share.\nOf course, if you’re thinking about investing in one of these companies, stock performance and company stability — especially amid tariffs — is likely a major concern.

As for year-to-date, it noted that Microsoft has gained around 24.4%, while Apple declined roughly 6.7%.\nGiven this, it’s not surprising that ChatGPT touted Microsoft as the better-performing stock.

This includes making major manufacturing investments, supply chain diversification and operational adjustments.\n“Apple has committed a total of $600 billion toward U.S. manufacturing, adding $100 billion most recently, which helped secure exemptions from the new 100% chip tariffs announced by the administration,” the chatbot said. “The stock responded positively, gaining over 5% on the announcement.”\nAdditionally, as part of a strategic supply chain adjustment, Apple is moving production from China to India and Vietnam, ChatGPT said.\nThe company has still managed to deliver impressive financial results, despite taking major tariff-related financial hits. Specifically, tariffs cost Apple around $800 million this quarter — and are expected to reach $1.1 billion next quarter — but the company’s third-quarter revenue reached $94 billion, the chatbot said.","content_hash":"eb5b44eae2a9a92b402eb46cefafa778","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2800,"method_rank":0}

The strategist issued a 2026 S & P 500 year-end target of 7,750, saying the artificial intelligence revolution will drive gains next year as it fundamentally remakes society and the market. \"A Technological Revolution lifting stocks, multiples and society to new heights,\" wrote the head of the equity, derivatives and quantitative strategy team in a Sunday note. Emanuel looked ahead and looked back, pointing to, \"A Structural Tech driven Bull interrupted by a cyclical non-recession Bear Market which regained all-time highs in rapid fashion, with higher highs driven by a Fed cutting rates.\" \"That was the Internet Revolution of the late 1990's,\" he continued. \"And it's also the AI Revolution Bull Market of today.\" The strategist highlighted several positive forces will lift the stock market to his 2026 target. They include the boost the economy will get later this year from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, investors leaving behind peak tariff uncertainty and the growing use of AI in all areas of the economy. Yet, Emanuel has a wide range between his bull and bear cases for 2026. In his bull case, the strategist sees the S & P 500 shooting up to 9,000, or 40% above current levels, creating an AI bubble. In his bear case, he expects the broader index could tumble to 5,000 if stagflation takes holds in the economy. More 'scares' inevitable The strategist also raised his 2025 S & P 500 year-end forecast to 6,250 from 5,600, which had been the lowest current-year target on the Street. Even the new 2025 forecast is below the 2025 CNBC Market Strategist survey consensus target of 6,445. It's also below where the S & P 500 was last trading, around 6,400, suggesting the strategist remains wary of downside risk between now and the end of the year. Investors returning from the holiday weekend are kicking off a seasonally weak month facing a raft of macroeconomic concerns, from the latest developments on trade to the future of Federal Reserve independence. Still, Emanuel urged investors to stay the course even in the event of a correction. The strategist likened the current market to a \"bucking bull,\" one that will try to dislodge traders even as it moves higher. \"Great 'Bucking Bull' Markets Tempt Investors to Sell. Don't Fear a Bull Market Drawdown, Hedge It to Buy It,\" Emanuel wrote. \"'Scares' are a part of innovation-driven Bull markets as their narratives are stress tested in real time, regular -10% or more corrections during the 1990's Dot.Com Boom case in point.\" \"The AI Bull is no different, overcoming concerns over DeepSeek, sheer scale\/implementation, high earnings expectations, and DC Policy volatility,\" he added. \"More 'Scares' are inevitable.\"","content_hash":"eea6e0c8b5e90806d569daf46afe65e1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2773,"method_rank":0}

These systems reduce product losses, cut damage and improve operational efficiency.\nThe market continues to grow at a steady pace. Estimates suggest values of around USD 63 billion in 2023, with forecasts ranging up to USD 108 billion by 2032. Drivers include the boom in e-commerce, the automation of warehouses, and the relentless expansion of international trade.\nPallet packaging matters because it is both reliable and adaptable. As global supply chains face pressure for greater speed and resilience, packaging solutions are evolving to keep up—combining practicality with environmental responsibility.\nMaterials and uses across industries\nWooden pallets remain dominant thanks to their durability and low cost, making them the most widely used worldwide. Plastic pallets, however, are gaining popularity, particularly in food and pharmaceutical sectors where hygiene and reusability are critical.\nTheir compatibility with automated systems further strengthens their appeal. Composite and metal pallets serve more specialised roles in heavy industry and aerospace, where strength and regulation compliance are vital.\nStretch wrapping is one of the most common pallet packaging methods, balancing stability and affordability. These solutions are applied across a wide range of sectors, from consumer goods and retail to automotive and chemicals.\nIn the UK, automation, sustainability initiatives and growing demand for plastic pallets are reshaping how industries approach pallet packaging.\nSustainability and innovation driving the future\nSustainability is the leading force shaping the pallet packaging market. Businesses are cutting waste through recyclable materials and reusable pallet systems, while lightweight engineered designs help reduce carbon emissions by lowering shipping weights.\nInnovations such as paper-based honeycomb pallets demonstrate how eco-friendly alternatives can also bring cost benefits.\nTechnology is equally important. Smart pallets fitted with RFID tags and sensors are giving companies greater visibility over shipments, reducing losses and improving efficiency. As supply chains become more digital, the packaging itself is increasingly part of the data ecosystem.","content_hash":"574e85ba2f40651797d1e62cd3bf241e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2772,"method_rank":0}

The firm has not touched its shares since the 2015 merger that formed the food conglomerate.\nShares of the company were down more than 7% following Buffett's comments.\nBuffett told CNBC's Becky Quick on Tuesday that the merger didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea, but he does not think that taking the company apart will fix its problems.\nGreg Abel, who will take reins at Berkshire Hathaway from Buffett at the end of the year, expressed disappointment to Kraft Heinz, according to Buffett.\nKraft Heinz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Buffett's stance on the deal.\nThe split announced earlier Tuesday once again separates Kraft Heinz into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer, Kraft singles and Lunchables.\nBerkshire Hathaway teamed up with private equity firm 3G Capital in 2015 to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the company struggled.\nThough it holds a roster of iconic brands like Oscar Mayer and Velveeta, Kraft Heinz saw its U.S. sales slip just a few years after the merger. Health-conscious consumers were buying less packaged food and shopping more around the perimeter of the grocery store. Some analysts also blamed the company's slump on cost-cutting measures that kept Kraft Heinz from investing in its brands at a time when they needed it most.\nIn an effort to turn around the business, Kraft Heinz sold off some of its portfolio, like Planters nuts and some of its cheese division. The company has also been investing in some of its brands, like Lunchables and Capri Sun. In May, Kraft Heinz executives said the company was weighing strategic changes and potential transactions.\nLoading chart...\nSince the deal closed in 2015, Kraft Heinz shares had tumbled nearly 70% as of Friday's close, dragging the company's market value down to $33 billion.\nEven as other investors have lost faith in Kraft Heinz, Buffett has stood by the company, although he did tell CNBC after a disastrous quarter in 2019 that Berkshire overpaid for Kraft.\nRegarding Berkshire's future as a Kraft Heinz investor, Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday that Berkshire will do whatever is in the best interest of the firm. If Berkshire is approached to sell its shares, the firm will not accept a block bid unless other shareholders receive the same offer, according to Buffett.","content_hash":"8ea180ad80097c2be3ecc073cae4e698","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2751,"method_rank":0}

Instead of protecting against lost income, your cash cushion should help preserve income, manage liquidity and reduce the risks of market volatility.\nFind Out: Here’s Why You Might Want To Invest Your Retirement Savings in a Roth 401(k)\nRead Next: 10 Used Cars That Will Last Longer Than the Average New Vehicle\nExperts explained how your emergency fund should look at this stage of life and what moves to make.\nThe Purpose of an Emergency Fund Shifts\nWhile the essential goal of an emergency fund is to protect against unexpected expenses, its purpose shifts in retirement, according to Tom Buckingham, a licensed insurance agent, actuary and chief growth officer at Nassau Financial Group in Connecticut.\n“During our working years, the purpose of an emergency fund is to protect against income disruptions such as a job loss or an unexpected expense like a home repair. In retirement, you’re no longer replacing income, you’re preserving it.”\nBe Aware: 6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early\nPredictability Is Key\nRetirees can mistakenly assume they need more cash, but what matters most is the predictability of income, Buckingham said. Younger savers are typically instructed to keep three to six months of expenses for emergencies, but “retirees may benefit from 12 to 24 months in liquid reserves, especially if their income is dependent on market withdrawals,” he explained.\nRetirees with guaranteed lifetime income from annuities or pensions may need less of a buffer.\nCash Is Safe but Not Inflation-Protected\nWhile having a lot of cash on hand may feel safe, it loses value as inflation compounds year after year, Buckingham noted.\nCash also doesn’t offer the same growth opportunities as other investments, according to Curt Scott, president and investment advisor representative at Scott Financial Group.\nHowever, when inflation rises, interest rates on high-yield savings accounts and short-term CDs often increase as well, which can help minimize the impact of inflation on cash, Scott said.\nThink in Terms of Liquidity\nNancy Anderson, regional planning director at Key Private Bank, recommended treating an emergency fund as a dedicated liquidity bucket that replaces a paycheck and helps retirees avoid selling investments during market swings.\nAs she put it, “Having a fully funded liquidity bucket helps the retiree receive an income stream that mimics the paycheck they received while working, without concerns of making withdrawals when there is volatility in the equity markets,” and the approach aims for peace of mind by keeping one to three years’ income set aside with capital preservation in mind.","content_hash":"bb3742e83c5e30466921e5d7117d5f79","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2737,"method_rank":0}

As a result, the company is now 66% on its target of having 30,000 BTC treasury by year-end.\nWhy Is Metaplanet Stock Down Despite Bitcoin Purchases?\nOver the past month, the Metaplanet stock has been moving sideways and is once again testing the support of 830 JPY, after a 5.4% correction. The latest pressure on the stock price comes as the company’s fundraising mechanism comes under strain.\nUnlike other declining stocks with border market weakness, the drop in Metaplanet comes due to an internal funding mechanism, according to the report by Bloomberg. The report explains that the Japanese firm employs a “flywheel model” rising share prices triggered warrants with its financing partner Evo Fund, generating fresh capital that was then used to buy more Bitcoin.\nThis model fueled investor optimism as long as the stock price remained elevated. However, as Metaplanet shares began sliding, the mechanism lost momentum. Since June, Metaplanet’s stock has fallen nearly 54%, causing the premium over its Bitcoin holdings to collapse.\nMetaplanet aims to raise $884 million through overseas share offerings and will seek shareholder approval at its meeting on September 1 to issue up to 555 million preferred shares, potentially generating $3.8 billion to expand its Bitcoin holdings. Eric Trump, who’s leading the Trump family DeFi project World Liberty Financial, has been allocated 3.3 million shares.\nIn June, the firm’s market capitalization was more than eight times the value of its Bitcoin portfolio. Now, it stands at roughly twice that value. The shrinking premium has also amplified concerns over potential shareholder dilution.\nMetaplanet Takes BTC Holdings Above 20,000\nDespite the Metaplanet stock being under pressure, the firm has continued its Bitcoin purchases further. The company’s total Bitcoin portfolio now stands at 20,000 coins, acquired at a cumulative cost of approximately $2 billion.\nFollowing today’s purchase, the Japanese firm overtakes the Bitcoin miner Riot platform in BTC holdings. On the other hand, Bitcoin price has also been under pressure, moving sideways under $108,000, down over 15% from its all-time high levels.\nShort-term Bitcoin price action appears bearish, with the MACD and CRSI indicating oversold conditions and continued downside pressure as recent lows are tested and sellers dominate the market.

McDonald’s same-store sales – or sales at stores open at least a year – grew 2.5% in the April-June period, but that was mostly because of higher prices. Fast food visits by lower-income consumers dropped by double-digit percentages industrywide in the second quarter, McDonald’s said.\n“Today, too often, if you’re that consumer, you’re driving up to the restaurant and you’re seeing combo meals priced over $10,” Kempczinski said during a conference call with investors in August. “That absolutely is shaping value perceptions in a negative way. So we’ve got to get that fixed.”\nMcDonald's job has been made harder by prices that can vary widely around the country. In May 2024, after a post on X about a Big Mac meal in Connecticut that cost $18 went viral, McDonald’s called it an “exception” and noted that franchisees set prices for nearly all U.S. restaurants.\nThe company also blames higher costs. The average price of its menu items rose 40% between 2019 and 2024, McDonald’s said, to account for a 40% increase in the cost of labor, packaging and food.\nBut within a month, McDonald’s introduced a $5 Meal Deal, which combined a McDouble burger or a McChicken sandwich with small fries and a small drink. That deal proved so popular it was extended through this summer.\nIn January, McDonald’s added another promotion, letting customers buy a limited number of items for $1 if they bought one full-priced item. Those deals will remain alongside the Extra Value Menu for now, McDonald's said.","content_hash":"8432165f65e6f3d6854a0d608f4cfa36","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2699,"method_rank":0}

Examples include IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) and D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS). The former's share price is up over 400% and the latter more than 1,000% in the last year through the week ending Aug. 29.\nBut of the businesses racing to produce quantum computers capable of adoption beyond research circles, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stands out. Several factors contribute to its position as a top quantum computing stock to consider right now.\nWhy Nvidia is a compelling quantum computer stock\nNvidia is known as the artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor chip leader. But as it looks toward the future, the company is working to evolve its tech for the quantum era. For example, it's developing a core processing unit that works in a quantum computer.\nIn addition, Nvidia is opening a research center that will house \"the most powerful hardware ever deployed for quantum computing applications,\" according to the company. The center aims to solve challenges inherent in quantum devices, such as their propensity to make computational mistakes.\nBeyond its tech, another factor making Nvidia a compelling quantum computer stock is the company's outstanding financial health. While IonQ and D-Wave aren't profitable, Nvidia's net income was $26.4 billion in its fiscal second quarter (ended July 27), a 59% increase over the previous year. It also generated $13.5 billion in Q2 free cash flow, providing funds to invest in quantum technology.\nMoreover, Nvidia shares possess a superior valuation among quantum computer stocks such as IonQ and D-Wave. This can be seen in the price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of the companies.\nThe chart shows that IonQ and D-Wave's sales multiples skyrocketed over the last year, making Nvidia the lowest among the trio by a wide margin. This suggests IonQ and D-Wave stocks are overpriced.\nWith its better valuation, technological advancements, and strong financial standing, Nvidia emerges as an attractive investment in quantum computing.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.","content_hash":"11e8f96f5bd81bf05e80ddaab864f9b8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2691,"method_rank":0}

In addition to vehicles, the company designs and manufactures diesel engines and other powertrain components, both for its own lineup and for third-party truck and bus makers.\nCompanies valued at $10 billion or more are generally classified as \"large-cap\" stocks, and Paccar falls squarely into this category, with a market capitalization that exceeds this threshold. The company plays a vital role in global commerce, with its Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF trucks recognized worldwide for their quality, durability, and innovation.

Shares of this industrial giant have pulled back almost 15.9% from its 52-week high of $118.81 achieved last December. Over the past three months, the stock has been up roughly 6%, lagging behind the Nasdaq Composite's ($NASX) 11.9% return during the same stretch.\nFocusing on the longer-term performance, we see that PCAR stock has shot up 5.8% over the past year, while the NASX has gained 22.2%. So far this year, the stock has tanked 3.9%, significantly trailing behind the broader index, which has surged 11.1% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.\nPCAR’s stock has struggled to reclaim long-term momentum, holding below its 200-day moving average since mid-March. Yet, shorter-term sentiment has shown signs of improvement, with shares climbing above the 50-day moving average in mid-May and managing to stay there despite some interim volatility.\nInvestor sentiment toward PCAR has been muted amid sector-wide challenges like supply chain pressures and uneven demand, leaving the stock struggling to gain traction. That said, shares jumped 6.1% on Jul. 22 after the company topped expectations in its fiscal 2025 Q2 earnings report.\nEarnings came in at $1.37 per share, above the $1.28 forecast, while revenue of $6.96 billion also edged past estimates of $6.79 billion. Still, the headline beat masked deeper challenges. Sales were down 15.7% from last year, and profits per share fell an even steeper 35.6% year over year, underscoring the company’s struggles.","content_hash":"25d52da08fcbcbca6869c2de8dfd81a0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2684,"method_rank":0}

Plus, the uber-explosive earnings growth for names like Nvidia may soon start to slow, as the company told investors in its recent earnings call.\nSo if you missed their run-ups in the market, you might be feeling like you missed the boat on the AI trade. (To be fair, you probably didn't miss out entirely — these companies have huge exposures in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, meaning most index investors already have some fairly sizeable positions in the AI giants.)\nBut if you're looking for some overlooked AI firms, there are still plenty of opportunities out there, according to Que Nguyen, the CIO at Research Affiliates, and Brian Mulberry, a senior portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\nIn recent interviews with Business Insider, the duo shared some of their preferred non-mega-cap AI stocks right now.\nFor Nguyen's part, she said to look to stocks like Western Digital (WDC), Seagate Technologies (STX), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), and Micron Technology (MU) — all data storage providers.\n\"One of the things that I see is AI is spreading and benefiting an entire ecosystem of technology companies,\" Nguyen said. \"So you look at even boring companies like hard disk companies — in order to have AI you need to be able to store a lot of data and get it quickly, right?\"\n\"None of these companies is nearly as expensive as the Mag 7,\" she continued. \"Don't just stick with the Mag 7, or Nvidia and AMD. Look more broadly — own something diversified. You have no idea where the next killer app is going to come, or where the next big investment theme is going to be.\"\nSome examples of diversified products offering specific AI and tech stocks expsoure include the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ) and the iShares AI Adopters & Applications UCITS ETF (AIAA).\nMeanwhile, Mulberry said he likes stocks like Amphenol (APH) and Emcor (EME).\nBoth are hardware providers, and are raking in money from hyperscalers as they spend hundreds of billions to build out their AI data centers, Mulberry said. Consensus earnings estimates for both firms show growth in the next couple of years, he said.","content_hash":"c0b1a3e5d84f4f04ee568de9e4a1b7d9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2668,"method_rank":0}

Three people who came out of the meeting held in the Shibuya area of central Tokyo said the capital-raising plan was approved.\nMetaplanet declined to comment on Eric Trump's involvement in the meeting, when Reuters contacted the company before the event began.

Citing Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury firm Strategy MSTR.O as an inspiration, founder and chief executive Simon Gerovich liquidated most of Metaplanet's hotel assets, already in the doldrums due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and piled into the cryptocurrency starting in April 2024.\nAt the meeting venue on Monday, it was a festive scene, with people in costumes lined up at the entrance, food trucks assembled, and a K-Pop band due to perform. Media were not allowed to observe the meeting.\nIn the afternoon, Gerovich and Eric Trump took the stage wearing matching Metaplanet jerseys, according to shareholder videos posted on social media.","content_hash":"54b6688537895e25204148b6371fb9ef","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2628,"method_rank":0}

Growth has slowed due to a challenging consumer backdrop and series of PepsiCo-specific issues, while substantial increases in investment spending well beyond the needs of the current demand environment have meaningfully compressed profit margins.”\nThey urged PepsiCo to better “align” PFNA’s costs to the “present volume reality” and streamline the division’s portfolio by offloading “non-core and underperforming assets”.\nPepsiCo has two foods businesses centred on cereals and snacks within PFNA. In 2024, the snacks-focused Frito-Lay North America generated revenues of $24.76bn, with the much smaller Quaker Foods North America bringing in $2.68bn.\nThe Elliott partners said PFNA could be supported by more investment in “proven brands”, improving the “value perception” and pursuing M&A.\nThe letter added: “Greater strategic focus, faster organic growth and meaningful profit-margin expansion would warrant a valuation in line with peers, the market and PepsiCo’s own history, representing a path to more than 50% stock-price increase from today's depressed levels.","content_hash":"497547f28f73f52c387d691874941c41","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2610,"method_rank":0}

For the six months ended 2025, Prosper Stars & Stripes returned a net return of (0.8%) compared to (1.8%) for the Russell and +5.9% for the HFRI.

(NASDAQ:AZTA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:\n\"Azenta, Inc. (NASDAQ:AZTA) was the second-best contributor in our short book during the second quarter of 2025. The company operates in the life sciences sector, with a particular focus on sample management solutions (around 48% of FY24 sales) and multiomics (approximately 39% of FY24 sales). Azenta serves pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, research hospitals, and government institutions. One of our preferred financial measures of business quality is operating profits (EBIT margins). Typically, we expect life science companies to have EBIT margins exceeding 15%. Azenta, on the other hand, has EBIT margins under 7%, which raised a red flag for us. Additionally, the life sciences industry is currently facing pressure from reduced spending at the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), a challenging biotech funding environment, weakness in China, and uncertainties around the effectiveness of newer modalities such as mRNA and cell and gene therapies (“CGTs”). When Azenta’s stock price declined by about 40%, we took our gains and exited the short position.\"","content_hash":"5cc301492aa9626bd0ca0f293ebc60f0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2579,"method_rank":0}

(Revenues in the first half rose 8 percent.)\nRambourg noted his forecast of “sequential improvement” is also supported by “a less punishing basis of comparison in Japan,” a favorable basis of comparison in Europe after the Paris Olympic Games in 2024 boosted spending and a recovery in U.S. equity markets after the panic selloff in early April.","content_hash":"4d379363060d496c80a312aa932758a4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2579,"method_rank":0}

Admittedly, it took time for the company to find its stride, but its voice-commanded AI products have won over clients and investors alike.\nConsequently, its stock has shot significantly higher over the last three years. If one had invested $10,000 in the company before the current run-up in the stock price, they are likely happy with their returns today.\nSoundHound AI's growth over the last three years\nA $10,000 investment in SoundHound AI three years ago would be worth nearly $44,200 today.\nThe rising stock price is easy to understand when examining the financials. In the first half of 2025, revenue increased by nearly $72 million, a 186% year-over-year increase.\nUnfortunately, other financial metrics point to some red flags. The company's operating expenses far outpace its revenue. For this year, SoundHound cashed in on a $145 million change in the fair value of contingent acquisition liabilities.\nThis resulted in $55 million in net income during the first half of the year. Without that one-time benefit, SoundHound would have had a significant net loss.\nAnother potential worry is its size. If multitrillion-dollar enterprises such as Apple or Google's parent company, Alphabet, decide to more actively compete, it is unclear how SoundHound might find the resources to take on those tech giants, considering its $5.3 billion market cap.\nWorse, the market cap might overestimate its value. Amid the run-up in the stock price, SoundHound AI sells at a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 38, well above the S&P 500 index average of 3.3. At that valuation, SoundHound's stock price could crater if investors start to doubt its business model.\nUltimately, SoundHound AI and its investors have benefited from a massive share-price gain over the last three years. However, with all its current challenges, investors should not expect a similar rise over the next three years, if it makes gains at all.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

The futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1% higher.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify imposing sharply higher import taxes on almost every country on earth.\nThe ruling largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York. But the 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, allowing the administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nEuropean markets opened higher, with Germany's DAX up 0.5% to 24,018.29 and the CAC 40 in Paris rising 0.4% to 7,735.88.\nBritain's FTSE 100 added 0.3% to 9,212.78.\nIn Asian trading, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 2.2% to 25,617.42, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.5% to 3,875.53.\nE-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding's shares traded in Hong Kong rocketed 19% higher after the company reported strong growth in its cloud computing segment and other areas including “instant commerce,” or hyper-fast deliveries at low prices.

The survey is on a scale of 0 to 100 where 50 marks the cutoff for expansion.\nAnother, private sector survey called the RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI showed the general PMI at 50.5 last month, up from 49.4 in July. Averaging the two surveys yields a PMI of 49.9, suggesting some resilience in the manufacturing sector despite U.S. tariffs of over 50% on Chinese goods, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a commentary.\nChina and the U.S. are still negotiating over a broad trade agreement.\n“The PMIs suggest that China’s economy accelerated last month, thanks to faster growth across manufacturing and services.

Constellation on Tuesday cut its comparable earnings per share outlook for its fiscal 2026 to a range of $11.30 to $11.60, down from $12.60 to $12.90.\nThe stock fell more than 6% Tuesday, briefly hitting a 52-week low.

Newlands added that high-end beer sales for the population were \"more pronounced than general market declines.\"\nThe brewer previously said the pullback was caused by Hispanic consumers' concerns about President Donald Trump's immigration policies and potential job losses. Constellation has said Hispanic consumers in the U.S. account for about half of its beer sales.\nThe company has made strides to make up for its losses. In April, it announced it was repositioning its portfolio by divesting \"mainstream\" wines.

There's also a 3.8% surcharge for higher earners, which brings the total to 23.8% for some investors.\nFor 2025, you qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains rate if your taxable income is $48,350 or less for single filers, or $96,700 or less for married couples filing jointly.\nYou calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income. However, if you sell investments, those gains count toward taxable income for the bracket.\nStill, with a higher standard deduction, a temporary $6,000 deduction for older Americans, and other tax breaks added via Trump's legislation, more investors could fall into the 0% bracket for 2025, experts say.\nUse the 0% bracket for 'tax-gain harvesting'\nOne benefit of the 0% long-term capital gains bracket is a strategy known as \"tax-gain harvesting,\" or strategically selling profitable brokerage account assets during lower-income years.\nIt's the \"perfect window to trim concentrated positions or rebalance portfolios tax-free,\" said Jared Gagne, a CFP and private wealth manager at Claro Advisors in Boston.\nOthers use the 0% capital gains bracket to sell investments and quickly rebuy to \"reset their cost basis,\" or the asset's original purchase price, according to CFP Andrew Herzog, associate wealth manager at The Watchman Group in Plano, Texas.\nIncreasing your cost basis decreases your profit, which could lead to future tax savings, he said.\nOf course, you need to consider how these strategies fit into your broader financial plan, including legacy goals, experts say.\nFor example, if you're planning for adult children to inherit profitable assets from your brokerage account, they would already receive a \"stepped-up basis,\" based on the market value on your date of death.","content_hash":"f008713440c2a90124a4bdd6ab27e907","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2536,"method_rank":0}

The latest run has been fueled by expectations the US central bank will lower rates this month, after Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautiously opened the door to a reduction. A key US jobs report this Friday is likely to add to signs of an increasingly subdued labor market — supporting the case for rate cuts. That has boosted the allure of precious metals, which don’t pay interest.\n“Investors adding to gold allocations, especially as Fed rate cuts loom, are pushing prices higher,” UBS Group AG strategist Joni Teves said. “Our base case is that gold continues to make new highs over the coming quarters. A lower interest rate environment, softer economic data and continued elevated macro uncertainty and geopolitical risks boost gold’s role as a portfolio diversifier.”\nBoth gold and silver have more than doubled over the past three years, with mounting risks in the spheres of geopolitics, the economy, and global trade driving increased demand for the time-honored haven assets. An escalation in President Donald Trump’s attacks against the Fed this year has become the latest cause for investor alarm, with concerns over the central bank’s independence threatening to erode confidence in the US.\nMarkets are now waiting for a landmark ruling on whether Trump has legitimate grounds to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank. If deemed legal, the move would allow the president to replace her with a dovish-leaning official. Separately, a federal appeals court said late Friday that Trump’s global tariffs were illegally imposed under an emergency law, increasing uncertainty for American importers while potentially delaying the economic dividends promised by the administration.","content_hash":"921484bd2d068d23337cab1807cc8ac8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2534,"method_rank":0}

Tesla registrations were down 50% in the Netherlands and 4.4% in Italy.\nNorway, where Tesla has deep roots and virtually all new car sales are electric, saw a 21.3% jump in registrations for the U.S. EV maker.

Over the past three months, its shares have gained a meager 1.7%. It is down 20.4% from its 52-week high of $163.93, which it had reached in February this year. Over the same period, the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DOWI) has gained 7.9%, indicating that Airbnb is underperforming the broader market.\nOn a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Airbnb’s stock has declined marginally, while over the past 52 weeks, it has gained 11.1%. In contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 7.1% and 10.8% over the same periods, respectively.\nAirbnb’s slowdown has been evident in its technical setup, with the stock trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages since early March this year. Despite a few short-lived rebounds in between, it has struggled to break above these levels, underscoring the persistence of its bearish trend.\nAirbnb’s growth story appears to be losing momentum, which is dampening its stock performance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the company’s revenue increased by 12.7% year-over-year to $3.10 billion, while its EPS grew 19.8% from the prior year’s period to $1.03.\nHowever, Airbnb also provided weak Q3 revenue guidance of $4.02 to $4.10 billion. This indicates an approximate 8% YOY growth, which is a decline from the growth the company reported in the second quarter. The company’s management certainly wants growth to accelerate. However, for that to happen, it needs a concrete roadmap and plans.","content_hash":"58eed9cf04d98a9cc601f056362ff8e9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2468,"method_rank":0}

Its services have been used by employees at OpenAI, Eventbrite Inc., SoundCloud Ltd. and other tech firms, according to Statsig’s website.

He’ll report to Fidji Simo, the former Instacart head who recently took over as CEO of that division. In a statement, Simo said Raji would help companies and developers use OpenAI’s technology to build “safe applications that empower people.”\nOpenAI has been more aggressive this year in pursuing big-ticket acquisitions, fueled in part by its soaring valuation. In March, OpenAI said it had finalized a deal to raise $40 billion in funding at a $300 billion valuation, including the money raised. Now, the company is in talks to let current and former employees sell shares at a $500 billion valuation, Bloomberg News has reported.\nIn July, OpenAI closed a $6.5 billion all-stock deal to buy an AI device startup co-founded by Apple Inc.’s former design chief Jony Ive. OpenAI also agreed to buy AI coding startup Windsurf for about $3 billion, but the deal fell through.\nThe Statsig acquisition is pending regulatory review.\nIn addition to Raji, OpenAI is making several other changes to its leadership team. Kevin Weil, OpenAI’s chief product officer, is taking on a new role as vice president of a new team called AI for Science, the spokesperson said.

HPQ stock gained 4.6% on Thursday, Aug. 28, which helped it bridge its year-to-date losses to 12.3%. In this article, we’ll look at the key takeaways from HP’s fiscal Q3 2025 earnings and examine whether the stock is a buy.\nKey Takeaways from HP’s Earnings\nHP reported net revenues of $13.9 billion in the quarter, up 3.1% from the corresponding quarter last year, and representing the fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS), however, fell 10.7% to $0.75 in the quarter. It generated free cash flows of $1.5 billion in the quarter, of which it returned $400 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nNvidia Could Give This Under-the-Radar AI Stock a Major Boost\n-\nSnowflake is On a Tear - Its Massive Free Cash Flow Could Push SNOW Even Higher\nThe buyback activity was tepid by historical standards as the company prioritized deleveraging since its leverage multiples ran up slightly above its target range. Notably, HP is committed to returning all of its free cash flow to investors through dividends and buybacks as long as its gross debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) multiple is below 2x, and it does not see other opportunities that promise a higher return on investment.\nHP’s Printing Business Continues to Decline\nHP is actually a mix of two businesses – PC and printing. While the PC industry is still growing, the print business has been in a structural decline. However, the print business boasts of high margins and is a key driver of the company’s profitability. The company’s Personal Systems segment, which sells PCs, posted revenues of $9.9 billion in the fiscal third quarter, 6% higher than the corresponding quarter last year, while its Printing net revenues fell 4% to $4 billion. The situation is not expected to flip anytime soon, and HP expects the print market to fall by low single digits in 2025 and 2026 while projecting growth in the PC segment.\nIn terms of margins, the Personal Systems segment had an operating margin of 5.4%, less than a third of the 17.3% that the Printing segment posted.\nWall Street analysts have been bearish on HP for quite some time now, and it has a consensus rating of “Hold” while its mean target price of $27.26 is lower than current price levels.","content_hash":"b207f98260da2312028e58a61352d5b6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2450,"method_rank":0}

Every month, the bank refreshes its analyst focus list, which includes top ideas from JPMorgan analysts aligned with growth, income, value and short investment strategies. The bank's changes come after stocks notched a solid performance in August , which is a historically weak month for the major benchmarks. Lifting investors' spirits heading into September is optimism that the Federal Reserve will finally begin to cut rates at its meeting this month. The CME FedWatch Tool shows the market has now priced in a nearly 90% chance of this happening. Additions over the past four weeks to JPMorgan's focus list included ACV Auctions , Cellebrite , McCormick , PTC Therapeutics and Armstrong World Industries . On the other hand, the bank removed Roivant , BellRing Brands , Edgewise Therapeutics and Carlisle from its basket. Biopharma stock PTC Therapeutics has surged 16% this year. JPMorgan's $68 price target is about 38% higher than where shares closed Friday. In May, Bank of America upgraded the stock to a buy rating from neutral, citing the launch of the company's new program focused on phenylketonuria, or PKU, a rare metabolic disease. This program could lead to around $788 million in peak risk-adjusted sales, wrote analyst Tazeen Ahmad. To accompany the upgrade, Bank of America raised its price target to $68 per share from $55. Manufacturing stock Armstrong World Industries was another name on JPMorgan's list. Shares have soared 37% in 2025 but could rise another 7% to the bank's $210 price target. JPMorgan initiated the stock at an overweight rating in June. \"Armstrong represents a rare combination of operational stability and embedded innovation,\" wrote analyst Tomohiko Sano. \"From thermal ceiling technologies like TEMPLOK to AI-enabled design support via ProjectWorks, AWI is expanding value across segments, driving both top line and profitability through shared platforms. This redefinition elevates AWI from a building materials manufacturer to a solutions-oriented, building performance company.\" Sano also applauded the company's strong margin stability, even through end-market volatility, as well as its potential for multiple expansion and margin improvements. Two other additions to JPMorgan's focus list included food manufacturer McCormick and auto auction platform ACV Auctions.","content_hash":"7bd73cb230dccd4c0c66c41fe5eaa5db","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2414,"method_rank":0}

Roughly a third of U.S. consumers said they loved high protein in the second quarter of 2025, up from 24% three years ago, according to Datassential, which tracks restaurant menus and consumer preferences.\nCustomers who add Starbucks' protein cold foam to their grande beverages can expect about 19 to 26 grams of protein, while the chain's grande-sized protein latte delivers 27 to 36 grams of protein, the company said.\n\"As we continue to get back to Starbucks, we're focused on modernizing our menu with innovative, relevant, and hype-worthy products that will resonate with our customers,\" Starbucks Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman said in a statement.\nThe protein cold foam will be available in a variety of flavors, including a new banana flavor, vanilla, matcha, chocolate, brown sugar, salted caramel and plain.

The S & P 500 has fallen 0.7% on average in September, making it the worst month of the year historically, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. However, multiple Wall Street firms have pointed out that the seasonal weakness is more prevalent in the back half of the month. \"On average, it's the back-half of the month that tends to show weakness,\" Jonathan Krinsky, BTIG's chief market technician, wrote in a weekend note to clients. Case-in-point: Goldman Sachs pointed out that the second-half of September is, on average, the worst two-week period of the year. This year, the back said the period will be particularly interesting given that systematic support has seemingly \"dried up,\" with institutional investors net selling U.S. equities for two months in a row. One silver lining Goldman found is that positioning remains historically modest, which can keep any market dips light as long as fundamental shocks can be avoided. \"We expect this month to be challenging and driven by active stock-picking on the institutional level while retail continues to direct flows into passive funds,\" Goldman wrote. .SPX 3M mountain S & P 500, 3 months This seasonal period comes as investors wonder what's next for a market that appears to be priced to perfection. While BTIG's Krinsky said there are reasons for \"caution\" into the new trading month, he said bulls will keep control of the market if the S & P 500 can hold above 6,400. If the benchmark index falls below that, it could test the 6,100 to 6,200 range. It didn't take long for that milestone to enter the fray. The S & P 500 on Tuesday traded around 6,390 in late morning trading. Still, the broad index is coming off a hot streak. The S & P 500 has risen for the last four months and is up more than 8% on the year.","content_hash":"67099f80ec1482e560f059ec9a28f34f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1887,"method_rank":0}

Employees would receive about $232.7 million after lawyers' fees and expenses are deducted.\nThe case had its origins in 1989, when Colgate converted its pension plan to a cash balance plan and let participants receive benefits in lump sums.\nColgate amended its plan in 2005 to retroactively award annuity payments to participants who received lump sums but had not received the full value of their benefits. The plaintiffs said Colgate erred in calculating those payments.\nLitigation over Colgate's pensions began in 2007, and Friday's settlement addresses a lawsuit filed in 2016.\nColgate denied wrongdoing and said it settled to avoid the risk and expense of more litigation. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe New York-based company set aside money for the settlement in the first quarters of 2023 and 2025.\nOther Colgate brands include Hill's Pet Nutrition, Irish Spring, Speed Stick, Lady Speed Stick, and Tom's of Maine.\nThe case is McCutcheon et al v. Colgate-Palmolive Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-04170.\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New YorkEditing by Rod Nickel)","content_hash":"74b183bf237bc0fdb88c6c031c11b69c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1508,"method_rank":0}

While market capitalization falls as the spot price declines because it prices every coin at the current level, realized cap adjusts only when coins are spent and repriced on-chain.\nUnder the realized cap model, dormant holdings, long-term holders and lost coins act as stabilizers, preventing large drawdowns even when short-term price action turns negative. The result is a measure that better reflects true investor conviction and the depth of capital committed to the blockchain.\nIn previous cycles, realized cap suffered much steeper drawdowns. During the 2014–15 and 2018 bear markets, it fell by as much as 20% as prolonged capitulation forced large volumes of coins to be repriced lower. Even in 2022, the metric experienced a drawdown near 18%, according to Glassnode data.\nThis time, in contrast, realized cap is gaining despite a double-digit price correction.
