Today, we are pleased to report the best second quarter and first half results in Build-A-Bear's history, achieving record revenue while simultaneously expanding pretax margin and earnings per share. This unprecedented start to the year is largely a result of a long-term focus on monetizing Build-A-Bear's unique position in the marketplace, multigenerational appeal, and exceptional brand recognition to scale the business with innovative initiatives across three strategic pillars.\nFor example, the use of our unique capital-light partner-operated retail model to accelerate our global expansion strategy, the focused effort on developing social media initiatives to drive omnichannel sales with a broadened consumer base as a part of our digital transformation strategy, and the introduction of new concepts like our mini beans collection as a representation of our strategy to invest in leveraging our powerful brand equity to evolve beyond our traditional retail and product space. Simply put, we are building on the iconic status of the brand to introduce it to more people, in more places, with more types of products for more purposes, all with a strategic vision to drive profitable growth.\nBefore I provide more information regarding these ongoing initiatives, let's review some financial highlights from the second quarter and first half of 2025, all of which set new records for the company. Specifically, in the second quarter, revenues grew 11% to over $124 million. Pretax income increased by 33% to over $15 million, and EPS rose by 47% to 94¢. For the first half, revenues grew more than 11% to over $252 million. Pretax income increased over 31% to almost $35 million, and EPS rose approximately 45% to $2.11. Additionally, during the first half of the fiscal year, we returned more than $13 million in capital to shareholders.\nAfter posting multiple quarters of record results over the past four and a half years, Build-A-Bear's most recent performance clearly supports the benefits of our very purposefully evolved and diversified business model and executional discipline. As an example of our progress from a profitability perspective, our first half EBITDA margin rate of nearly 17% more than tripled versus 2019, the last pre-COVID year, driven by annual store contribution margins of over 25% combined with the growth of our higher-margin commercial segment. When considering these results were achieved amid a wide variety of economic challenges and geopolitical shifts, they serve as a valuable source of confidence in our team, our brand, our plans, and the company's future.\nWith that in mind, while we understand a meaningful portion of the year and acknowledge the potential for some economic uncertainty ahead, we also believe it is appropriate to increase our 2025 guidance at this juncture. Specifically, we shared in today's press release our increased revenue and pretax income guidance, based on the current tariff rate, as well as higher expectations for net new unit growth.\nTherefore, when considering our business momentum, historical ability to respond to shifting marketing conditions, solid balance sheet, strong cash flow, and a focus on controlling the controllable, we remain confident in our continued efforts to drive our three strategic pillars: one, the expansion and evolution of our experiential retail footprint; two, the advancement of our comprehensive digital transformation; and three, the continued investment to leverage the powerful equity of the Build-A-Bear brand while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders. Now, Christopher Hurt, Build-A-Bear's Chief Operations Officer, will provide some additional information about our first strategic pillar, the expansion of our retail footprint. Chris?\nChristopher Hurt: Thanks, Sharon. We are committed to bringing our signature work experience, the cornerstone of the Build-A-Bear brand, to new markets through three retail business models: corporately managed, partner-operated, and franchise. In the quarter, 14 net new experience locations were opened, of which 86% were international, expanding the brand experience to 32 countries across North America, South America, Europe, Australia, Asia, and Africa. As a testament to the enthusiasm for the brand, specifically, our domestic partners continue to expand their Build-A-Bear presence. As Girl Scouts introduced two new locations, bringing their total to 33, and Great Wolf Lodge opened a workshop in their new Connecticut location, which brings our experience to all 22 of their US lodges.\nOur international partners and franchisees also continue to expand by entering two new countries, Georgia and Uzbekistan, and opening locations in Colombia, Mexico, Australia, Fiji, Denmark, Qatar, Kuwait, and the UAE. We are also thrilled to announce that the Build-A-Bear brand will be returning to Germany in the third quarter, operated by one of our current partners, Intersource.\nAdditionally, we have both continued to grow and have plans for future evolution of our corporately operated footprint ranging from more traditional formats in select mall-based locations, tourist-focused workshops, innovative concepts like November's successful debut of our Hello Kitty and Friends workshop remodel, and significant expansion of our POWERHOUSE FAO Schwartz location in Rockefeller Plaza and the recently announced plans for a multilevel one-of-a-kind Build-A-Bear workshop at ICON Park in Orlando, Florida, which is scheduled to open in 2026. We are pleased to say we kicked off this remarkable adventure with a groundbreaking ceremony last month.\nAs noted, given that our 2025 expansion plans are exceeding expectations, we are increasing our net new unit growth guidance for the year to at least 60 locations from the previous 50. We continue to expect the majority of the new unit growth to be driven by our partner-operated model, mainly with international partners. In fact, we ended the quarter with 157 partner-operated units now totaling 25% of our total location cap. As these new experience locations continue to open around the globe, there's no question that we are adding a little more heart to life in more places and for more people. Now I will turn the call back over to Sharon.\nSharon Price John: Thank you, Chris. Our experience locations are truly the crux of our brand essence. For our second strategic pillar, as noted, our ongoing digital transformation includes the advancement of social media initiatives across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, as well as the amplification of an impressive amount of user-generated content for the brand. With social media having an increasingly critical role in the broader media landscape, it is now a key element in the way we showcase products, tell brand stories, and spark trends for our teen and adult consumers, now often referred to as kiddults.\nAs an example, our effective marketing campaign to support this summer's fruit stand assortment created a fully integrated launch of a nonholiday, nonlicensed collection that drove triple-digit growth in media and was a significant contributor to our second quarter success. We efficiently generated awareness and sales for the entire offering, including our make-your-own watermelon frog, dragon fruit dragon, and pineapple ocelotl. We further enhanced the fruit stand with mini beans, including fan-favorite kiwi koala, which contributed to the 80% year-on-year revenue increase for the mini theme collection.\nImportantly, we see the continued investment in social listening tools, super fan research, AI, influencers, algorithms, and trend watching to inform and create comprehensive dialed-in product stories supported by engaging, shareable content, especially for the growing adult market, who often tend to be higher value collectors, gift givers, and viral product purchasers. The third pillar is to invest in ideas and opportunities to leverage our brand power to drive incremental growth.\nNotably, because of our more sustainable and more consistent revenue and cash flow, Build-A-Bear has been able to make concerted efforts in longer-term initiatives over the past few years, including the scalable reinterpretation of the Build-A-Bear workshop experience with meaningful licensed partners like our successful Hello Kitty and Friends Los Angeles location, the multichannel expansion of the brand into potentially thousands of additional points of sale across geographies through a wholesale business model leveraging new product types like mini beans, and the evolution of our organizational structure and the elevation of talent to enable these and other strategic growth initiatives.\nYou may recall that during our third quarter 2024 earnings call, we noted that we enjoyed the best Halloween performance in our history. Today, we are pleased to announce positive comparisons for Halloween 2025 and quarter-to-date sales as our Q2 momentum continues. Key contributors thus far include the return of Vault favorite Pumpkin Kitty, the scary cute zombie axolotl, and our new on-trend poseable bat, which currently looks like it may be a surprise early sellout. And, yes, we also expanded the collection with fun Halloween-themed mini beans, including a candy corn longhorn.\nLooking ahead, we believe we have a robust pipeline for the remainder of 2025, kicking off with special plans for National Teddy Bear Day on September 9, an October launch tied to the upcoming sequel for last year's blockbuster, Wicked for Good, and, of course, a strong holiday lineup, including the tenth anniversary version of our famous glisten, the magical snow deer. In closing, to reiterate, for the full year, assuming tariffs hold at current levels and the economic environment remains relatively stable, our updated guidance reflects increased expectations for fiscal 2025, and we anticipate record results for the fifth consecutive year. Voin will provide more details in his remarks.\nWith that, I would like to thank the entire Build-A-Bear family, our hundreds of partners, and millions of amazing guests for helping us achieve a record first half for fiscal 2025 as we strive to continue delivering on our corporate mission of adding a little more heart to life. Voin?\nVoin Todorovic: Thank you, Sharon, and good morning, everyone. I will discuss the quarterly results and then share more about our updated full-year guidance. This was the most profitable second quarter and first half in the company's history. For the first half, both our retail and commercial segments grew double digits, 11% and 22%, respectively. Both segments delivered improved gross profit margins, and with disciplined expense management, we achieved higher pretax income margins. These results underscore the effectiveness of our strategic initiatives implemented over the past several years. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $6 million through dividends and share repurchases, bringing our year-to-date total to $13.1 million.\nWe also maintain significant flexibility with about $80 million remaining under our board-approved purchase authorization. Moving to a more detailed review of our second quarter results, total revenues were $124.2 million, an increase of 11.1%. Net retail sales were $114.6 million, an increase of 10.8%. Our stores delivered strong performance in the quarter, with transaction growth driven by continued positive traffic trends. Domestic store traffic rose 3%, significantly outperforming the national benchmark, which saw a 3% decline. Dollars per transaction were up, supported by higher average unit retail, mostly benefiting from reduced promotional activity and selective price increases, partially offset by a decline in units per transaction. Ecommerce demand increased 15.1%, driven by strong consumer response to key product launches.\nThe timing of these launches was more favorable compared to last year when similar releases occurred at the beginning of the third quarter, allowing us to capture demand earlier and contribute meaningfully to second quarter performance. Commercial revenue, which primarily represents wholesale sales to our partner operators, continues to be the fastest-growing segment of our business, with 18.3% growth in the quarter. Gross margin was 57.6%, an improvement of 340 basis points compared to last year, reflecting margin strength across both retail and commercial segments.\nRetail gross margin expansion was primarily driven by improved merchandise margin, supported by reduced promotional activity and selective price increases, as well as the fact that we saw significant leverage of our fixed cost with strong revenue growth. While tariffs started to impact our cost of goods sold during the quarter, last year's strategic decision to pull forward inventory reduced our tariff exposure to about $1 million. SG&A expenses were $56.4 million, or 45.4% of total revenues, compared to 44% last year. Higher store-level compensation, corporate costs, and general inflationary pressures, partially offset by the timing of marketing expenses, contributed to the 140 basis point increase.\nPretax income grew 32.7% to a second quarter record of $15.3 million and 12.3% of total revenues. EPS was $0.94, an increase of 46.9%, reflecting higher pretax income, a lower income tax rate, and a reduced share count. The lower income tax rate in the quarter reflects the benefit of discrete items. Our EPS for the first half of the year was $2.11, up 44.5% year over year. Turning to the balance sheet, at second quarter end, cash and cash equivalents totaled $39.1 million, an increase of 55.4% compared to the same period last year. This was after returning $31 million to shareholders over the past twelve months.\nThe company finished the quarter with no borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Inventory at quarter end was $81.8 million, an increase of $14.8 million. About half of the dollar increase is attributable to tariffs, with the remainder driven by accelerated purchase of our core products and investments to support elevated commercial segment sales, in line with our expectations. We remain comfortable in both the level and composition of our inventory, which positions us well to meet demand and execute our growth strategy for the balance of the year. Turning to the outlook, we have increased our revenue and pretax income guidance, and we raised our net new unit growth expectations.\nSpecifically, following double-digit first half growth and a solid start to the third quarter, we have increased our guidance for revenue growth to be in the range of mid-single to high-single digits. However, as a reminder, we have more challenging comparisons for the second half of the year. Also, we have increased the pretax income guidance to be in the range of $62 to $70 million, which assumes the current tariff rates to be in effect for the rest of our fiscal year. Let me add some more commentary on tariffs as they relate to Build-A-Bear.\nWhile the current US tariff policy is impacting our North American business, the tariffs should not directly affect the cost of products sold outside of North America. Also, please note that our retail cost of goods includes merchandise, rent, warehousing, and distribution expenses. However, the merchandise portion is the only cost directly impacted by tariffs. As a reminder, the current 30% US tariff on Chinese imports was in place at the time of our Q1 2025 call. It was recently extended through November 10. Since the first quarter call, the tariff on Vietnamese imports has increased to 20%, doubling the rate that had taken effect on April 5.\nBecause we had already expanded our sourcing capabilities to include both Vietnam and China, many of our products are dual-sourced, providing production and global distribution flexibility. Accordingly, we now expect tariffs and the associated cost impact on our fiscal 2025 income statement, net of mitigation, to be less than $11 million, of which about $1 million was in our Q2 results as previously noted. Also, our pretax guidance continues to include approximately $5 million of additional medical and labor costs previously mentioned on our last call. Of note, these costs collectively create a headwind of almost $16 million for the year. In closing, we are pleased with our strong performance on a year-to-date basis.\nAs we look ahead, our focus remains on executing our strategy, expanding our global footprint, accelerating our digital transformation, and investing in high-return capital projects while delivering consistent value to shareholders through disciplined capital allocation. Finally, I want to extend my sincere thanks to our store and warehouse associates, corporate team members, and valued partners around the world. Their dedication and collaboration were instrumental in delivering record first-half results, and they continue to be the driving force behind our success. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the keys. One moment, while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Beder with SCC Research. Please proceed with your question.\nEric Beder: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter and the guidance.\nSharon Price John: Thanks, Eric.\nEric Beder: Just talk a little bit, I know you have a number of different ways to handle the issues with tariffs. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the response when you raise prices to what you're seeing from the consumer when they do that? When you do that?\nSharon Price John: Well, as Voin mentioned in his remarks, our price increases that we have taken are very selective, very strategic, something that we've done for many years. And you know, our objective with that is to find the right price value for the consumer, and what we tend to do when we do choose to increase those prices selectively is related to when we reset the stores. So on a seasonal reset, for products that aren't directly comparative, we might raise slightly versus what would have been sort of the slot equivalent of the previous season. And that provides a little more latitude in the way we think about it.\nBut the key to what we're doing is always managing both the entry-level price point with our birthday treat there. So that's still, or as a reminder for those on the call that might not know, we provide a product that is called the count your candles program where you can come in on the month of your birthday and pay your age that you're about to become. And we use that as a very valuable tool for us to acquire new consumers. It's necessary for you to be in the loyalty program to get that discount.\nSo that levels out some of what might be considered price increases for an average consumer who has a broad array of different prices that they can participate in. We're very focused on maintaining our core animals. There are some pricing changes on some of our core animals, but not to the degree that you might expect given what we would believe some of this tariff impact is going to be over time. But we want those to be attainable for our consumers.\nAnd where you might see some of the larger price increases is generally where we have greater latitude with the consumers, like our collectors, for example, or some of our more select licensed product partnerships, where that makes sense. I'm going to add one little piece too here is that we have been in the business of telling stories, not just selling items. So we drive our dollars per transaction on more than just the unit cost. And that's an important change in our entire strategy of the way we're building our business. Voin may want to add some color on that.\nVoin Todorovic: Yes. And, you know, as I mentioned in my remarks, you know, also our transactions were up, driven by traffic. We significantly outperformed national traffic numbers that were down 3%. They were up 3%. So our traffic to our stores and transactions were up. Our conversion numbers were slightly up versus last year in the quarter too. So we really haven't seen negative impact of some of the selective price changes that Sharon talked about. But, again, as we are telling these more comprehensive stories in our marketing activities, are working and we are driving more traffic to stores, we have been able to capture some of that traffic effectively and really drive additional business.\nAnd, you know, this also is a testament to some of the new product launches and collections like mini beans that we introduced as we drive more people to our stores. It drives higher ticket price. And, you know, like and we have those at relatively low price points because they are selling at about $10 a piece.\nEric Beder: You know, that's very true. And you also gone the other way with the super large giant product also. Third party. How should we be thinking about how these mature? I know that last year, you know, the third party stores went up by about 40 plus. This year, they're gonna go up by 50, 60. Long does it you know, I know there's initial RAM. And then how long did how what's kinda how should we be thinking about the maturity of those and how they can provide even, you know, more how they will end up impacting you?\nSharon Price John: I'll start, and I'll hand it over to Chris. That's his area. So but I just want to clarify Eric. I know we used to call that third party. We now refer to that as partner operated. So just to be specific about what that's referring to. Yes. Our partner-operated is a big focus of our three-pronged strategy for store evolution and expansion, for our experienced location footprint. It's been very successful for us. And we are starting to see it accelerate as we've gotten more focused on that in this TAP light model, has proven to be an incredibly successful approach for us. To expand the brand outside, particularly outside North America and The UK.\nChris, do you want to add some color on that?\nChristopher Hurt: Yeah. Thanks, Sharon. Thanks, Eric. As these stores start to mature, you know, we've seen very great response from our partners as they are adding more locations. There is, you know, an incredible amount of runway in all of our international areas and with our partners. As we continue to add countries, as we continue to add partners going forward, the expansion of these locations, as you remember, a lot of these are shop-in-shops. There are many more toy store locations in the rest of the world versus The United States where the Build-A-Bear brand can go in as a shop-in-shop location fully branded.\nThe opportunity for our partners to go into actually toy stores that they already own and operate and build of theirs an incredibly additive brand experience. You know, they recognize that Build-A-Bear is the, you know, originator of retail experiential and they want that in their locations. So this is an excellent opportunity for them to expand. And we're seeing that as these stores, comp upon themselves.\nEric Beder: Yeah. We've seen it all. So thank you, and good luck with Halloween. It looks great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gibas with Northland Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Gibas: Great. Good morning, Sharon, Voin, and Chris. Thanks for taking my question. As it relates to MiniBeans, wondering if we could get kind of an update there in terms of maybe how sales compared year over year. Anything else you can share in terms of metrics or, like, units sold? And you know, along those lines too, you know, how has maybe progress trended on opportunities to get, you know, broader wholesale distribution of mini beans? You know, how are discussions with retailers going?\nSharon Price John: Yeah. So great question. Appreciate it. Well, mini beans collection. First of all, as a little bit of a background on that, we launched that in February 2024. And we provide waves of collectible assortments. We're trying we are driving the collectability of mini beans. People are seeking them out, the different styles. And a lot of guest engagement on this particular line. Some of them are takedowns, as we would say, of our most beloved characters, and a lot of them are unique to themselves. So and they, you know, are priced around $10 as Voin said. But we as I mentioned in my remarks, we've seen an 80% increase of mini beans on a year-on-year basis.\nAnd we are seeing some continued ramp I mean, the momentum is continuing. It's very exciting, particularly as we are now launching them in conjunction with big stories that are a part of our overarching workshop story, like I mentioned, Fruit Stand. Or with our holidays. So with all of those as opportunities ahead of us, we do expect to continue to see that growth. We have had many discussions, and we are having success with selling mini beans in the wholesale channel.\nWe had mentioned on our previous call that happening already outside The United States with some of the partners that Chris alluded to who have toy stores of their own where they are then putting Build-A-Bear inside of the toy stores. So they're selling those in their toy store, not necessarily well, they are associated with Build-A-Bear, but they're not but inside the Build-A-Bear experience. So that's very positive for us. And we also have already placed mini beans in a number of locations and are in some very robust conversations with other wholesalers. Another exciting and, Chris, do you want to mention some of those wholesalers, Applegreen?\nChristopher Hurt: Yeah. That's exactly right. You know, we've had a relationship with Hudson that are in our airport locations. They've started to expand their mini bean collections in those locations. Mentioned Applegreen is a convenience an upscale convenience type of store that we have over 50 locations where mini beans have been placed. And as Sharon mentioned, our international partners, they have stores toy stores where they don't have a Build-A-Bear workshop shop-in-shop yet, and they're able to do mini beans in those locations. So we're starting to see expansion internationally of our mini beans collection on a wholesale basis.\nGreg Gibas: Yeah. And we also very helpful. And yep, sorry. Go ahead.\nSharon Price John: Oh, well, we just wanted to add that some mini bean news is that we are now we'll be introducing actually, introducing our first licensed version of mini beans with the new mini beans Sanrio launch.\nGreg Gibas: Great. And, yeah, really nice to hear. Impressive growth out of that unit. Appreciate that. And, you know, I guess I would just you know, noting kind of the improved ecommerce demand or that certainly accelerated kind of quarter over quarter. Anything worth calling out there in terms of success you're seeing with that, you know, any particular drivers of the strong growth within that channel?\nVoin Todorovic: Well, as I mentioned, Greg, in my remarks, we saw over 15% strong demand in the quarter. You know, there were some softer comps with last year as product launches year over year. There was some shift between Q2 and Q3. But nonetheless, we are seeing an improvement in this portion of our business. We are focused on improving and growing this business. As well as similar to what we have seen in our brick and mortar locations, online, our discounts have been lower. And, you know, like, our promotional cadence has been changing. We still continue to be very optimistic about our future plans and gifting initiatives that are going to be associated with our website.\nWe continue to evolve in this area of the business. We are making some talent acquisitions really to help us create a new chapter in this particular portion of our business. And I think with some of the stuff that we have seen, there's still in the short run. You know, there may be some choppiness, but, you know, over a longer haul, we feel good about the wholesale business is what we are trying to do. And, again, as we said many times in the past, we are agnostic of how consumers choose to shop in our stores or online. But, you know, we would love to see positive growth in all of our segments.\nSharon Price John: I think it's also really critical to understand that we see our web business as a big piece and in a strategic pillar and as the digital transformation, but also more importantly, as a critical element in our omnichannel approach to business. While buildabear.com does drive sales, and it also, as you know, drives some of those sales through the store through our stores at these mini warehouses. Which is great for our, for our sales associates in that at the at that level for us to distribute in the for the last mile but it's important that you recognize that it also serves as important communication and information tool for our guests.\nMost of our guests, from what we can tell, hard to this is, you know, directional information. They have a tendency to go online first. Or find a store, plan a visit, plan a party, web pages are our largest visited web pages. So we know that the guests are using our buildabear.com as a source of information and planning for their store visits. And we love to see that engagement across both of our key channels in store and online and that's that's the big ecosystem that we're working on for the omnichannel solution.\nGreg Gibas: That makes sense. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keegan Cox with D. A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nKeegan Cox: Good morning, and congrats on a great quarter.\nVoin Todorovic: Thank you.\nKeegan Cox: My question is on the implied second half guidance. Just kind of throwing it together and looking at the midpoint calls for a slowdown. Does that imply weaker margins in the back half? And if so, why?\nVoin Todorovic: So thanks for the question, Keegan. First, you know, I want to mention that our previous revenue guidance was in mid-single digits that we initiated several months ago. We raised that guidance now and expanded the higher end of the range to high single digit. You know, we had a strong first half result. Plus 11% or so that we saw in total revenue growth. But as we mentioned, last year, second half, you know, we had some really strong results, especially driven by best ever Halloween. We had some so as we are gonna have some tougher comps, that was implied in our initial guidance, you know, that the year is gonna be at that level.\nNow we are excited about the progress that we are making. Clearly, there are some macroeconomic uncertainties that we are facing like every other company. That are related to in particular, to tariffs, and I'll cover that in a to talk a little bit about challenges on the profitability side of the guidance. But as we think about revenue with some of the things that we have put in place, we believe we have inventory. We have believed that we have momentum that's currently taking us through a first month of third quarter. And, you know, we are gonna stay focused on things that are within our control. We have managed our promotional cadence. We have managed excellent customer service.\nOur conversion numbers, as I mentioned earlier, are up. So, you know, we are doing things that's within our control. Now there are a lot of things that are outside of our controls. One of those things are tariffs. Tariffs are a real cost that we are facing. Even though we are expecting to see additional negative impact of tariffs, as I mentioned, the Vietnamese tariffs have gone have doubled from 10% to 20%. That's gonna impact us even more in the second half of the year.\nAnd, you know, when you think about $11 million or just a little bit less than $11 million impact negative impact of tariffs, plus additional $5 million that we called out from medical and minimum wage labor cost at the beginning of the year. We have nearly $16 million that we are overcoming of headwinds. So when you look at our guidance and, you know, like, even, like, if you think about mid to high end of that guidance, we are still, you know, close or slightly beating our last year full year profitability despite the $16 million headwind.\nKeegan Cox: Got it. That's helpful. And then my next question is on the partner-operated locations. I know you mentioned earlier that the existing partners keep adding new stores, and I know you mentioned a new partner in Germany. I'm just wondering how much momentum you're seeing with those new partners. And within your partner stores, do you find that your customer is different than maybe your corporate stores in America?\nChristopher Hurt: Yeah. Thanks. In talking through that, just one clarification. Our partner that will be opening our German locations is Intersource, which is a current partner that has opened stores in The Nordics. So we're excited for them to be able to open those locations in Germany. They recently in this quarter, also opened a standalone store in Copenhagen, which was very successful. So they are really seeing the great thing that we always said that a teddy bear hug is understood in every language, and that is totally true. The guests really recognize the brand. The power of the brand has really grown globally through our franchise model originally and through our corporate models in The UK.\nAnd specifically in Regent Street Hamleys where we've seen success, where we expanded that location. Along with our social media reach of our partners. Our own social media, and our marketing of our brand, our experience, our stories are then delivered to our partners who then put their own country-specific take on those social media outreaches. The other part of this that has really been incredible is that our guests are the ones that are driving this as well. Our user-generated content is just incredible. When guests themselves are coming into the stores, and they have such an incredible experience around the world that they want to showcase that experience to all of their friends and followers.\nSo this just combination of all these things happening, this incredible momentum with the brand based on the experience, and that's really the key part of this.\nOperator: As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Silver with Argus Research. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Silver: Thanks, operator, and thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the results as well. My question is, I guess, the fact that the balance sheet remains in great shape, even with the tariff considerations and the company already initiating a dividend policy and returning capital to shareholders through buybacks. Even though the company is navigating multiple challenges across the global economy, if the global dynamics remain on the stable side, curious as to how that might play into any decision to expand company-operated stores outside The U.S. during a time where partners are aggressively expanding the brand across multiple markets.\nVoin Todorovic: So thank you for the question. It's an interesting question as it relates to allocation and our investments and growth on a global scale. We are definitely open in considering operating stores. We are operating stores in Canada, in the UK, in different international markets. There are some challenges with some of those things, you know, setting up teams and the accounting implications. But at the end of the day, you know, we want to have the highest ROI for a company.\nAnd if there are some opportunities down the road really to have different types of relationships with our partners in those respective markets, to accelerate growth or to make additional investments at the appropriate time, especially as you mentioned with the solid balance sheet and healthy cash flows, we may consider some of those options. But, you know, we are still in the early stages. And as Chris mentioned, we are in 32 countries. There are plenty of countries around the world that we are still not present in. So, you know, this is a big opportunity. And we will definitely be looking at ways to help our partners accelerate.\nBut, you know, if there are some things to continue to make investments in markets that we are not currently present outside of the U.S., you know, it would be on a case-by-case decision that would be made.\nSharon Price John: I'd just add to that it is well within the realm of normal that a U.S.-based company operates in countries that tend to where the market tends to act like The U.S. So we're in Canada and The UK, which is a very typical approach for a U.S.-based organization. And while we may have opportunities, as Voin said, and we've talked about this many times, to make some strategic investment in some of those partners, I would stop short of saying that we would want to be the unique operator in said countries because it's important. The reason you have partners is because they know the market better than you.\nThey know the mall operators better than you or the tourist locations better than you. And they also know the marketplace and the consumer insights better than you. In most of the cases of the partners that we're operating with right now, in fact, they already are big operators in that space. And as Chris alluded to, they have stores there. Many times, they're toy stores that we then automatically, and I put that in quotation, are considered to be put in those toy stores. So they have their four walls that allow us to get up and running quickly, and then they look at independent Build-A-Bear workshop locations as another growth engine for their company.\nSo it's a working model right now. And I expect that, you know, we have a lot of runway in front of us on that working model. But as partnerships evolve, absolutely. There may be a different type of relationship that we want to consider, but we have a foreseeable future in the as-is.\nSteve Silver: Great. Thanks so much for the extra color.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. Miss John, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nSharon Price John: Well, thank you so much, and we appreciate everyone joining us today to hear more details regarding our record-breaking fiscal second quarter 2025 results and look forward to the third quarter call. Have a wonderful day and a great Labor Day weekend.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.\nTrump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush\nThe Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech.

Our outlet stores segment grew 2.4% for the quarter, and we are excited by the recent initiatives and accelerating trends in that channel. As we look at the progress that we are making in our brands, we are particularly pleased by the success that we are seeing in the overall performance of trend-right products across our brand portfolio. In Movado, we are making significant progress in returning the brand to growth in our wholesale distribution.\nWe have seen strong performance in our own e-commerce site, with 6% growth and strong trends in our digital partners. In brick and mortar, Movado brand sell-through has returned to growth in the second quarter in our department store channel, where we have implemented and expanded our coverage as a point of sale and installed our new point of sale display. We will continue to execute behind these initiatives as the year progresses. On the product front, Movado has seen increased penetration and success in women's watches, including our new iconic bangle watches and our new mini quest in bold, which along with our bold tank watch is a best seller.\nOn the men's side, we are seeing strong performance in the Movado bold collections, including Verso automatic and Quest automatic. Our heritage collection inspired by Movado's rich heritage continues to do particularly well in a limited distribution across the country. The Movado brand marketing campaign for the second half will include new creative featuring our Movado icons, Ludacris, Jessica Alba, Julianne Moore, Christian McCaffrey, and Tyrese Halliburton. We are very excited by the digital-first content that our team has executed with a greater focus on products associated with each of the icons. We have exciting new products debuting this fall, like the new Museum Imperial with Christian McCaffrey and Our Heritage 1917, with Tyrese Halliburton.\nOn the women's side, Jessica Alba and Julianne Moore will be featured with different shapes of our museum bangle collection and a women's version of the museum imperial and Heritage 1917. Turning to our licensed brands, we are seeing a return to the fashion watch and jewelry category with increased interest by Gen Z consumers across digital platforms like TikTok, Reels, and YouTube. Sales in our licensed brands grew by 9.5% for the quarter or 6.5% in constant currency. In Hugo Boss, we have experienced strong growth in our iconic families, Time Traveler and Candor. Our new updated Grand Prix is quickly becoming a best seller.\nWe are also excited by our new women's watches led by the May family with a petite square shape. In Tommy Hilfiger, we are very excited to be refocused on the women's watch category. Our EMEA family is already showing signs of strong sell-through and will be featured in our fall campaign. Complementing Mia is Moira, a new mini East West Oval that has gotten a strong reception. On the men's front, we are excited by our new seventies-inspired Chronograph Hudson Collection, which will be featured in our holiday campaign, as well as by RegattaTH, a new sports watch collection in exciting colors opening at $139.\nIn Lacoste, we are introducing a new black and gold version of our iconic LC 33 collection and will complement our Tang Parisienne with a new oval version. Our Lacoste jewelry business continues to exceed expectations, and we are very excited to introduce the Arthur and Crocodile families to complement our best-selling Metropole bracelet collection. In Calvin Klein, we are launching a new mini version of our best-selling Pulse collection, as well as a new 18-millimeter contemporary collection that has really piqued our retailers' attention. Coach continues to perform extremely well, particularly in the United States, and is now showing momentum in Europe as well.\nFor the second half, we have several new introductions in our best-selling Sammy Oval collection with a strong new 20-millimeter Reese tank. We will also be expanding our best-selling charter collection for him. As we enter the second half of the year, we recognize that uncertainty remains around tariffs and the broader retail environment. At the same time, we are excited by the new products we have introduced and encouraged by the resurgence we are seeing in the fashion watch market. As a leadership team, our focus remains on driving profitability and delivering consistent growth in both sales and operating margin while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and executing against our strategic plans across all of our businesses.\nWhile some of our initiatives have longer time horizons, we are confident that we are taking the right actions for the long term and positioning Movado Group for sustainable success. I am happy about the plans that we are building for the year ahead, and I would now like to turn the call over to Sallie.\nSallie DeMarsilis: Thank you, Efraim, and good morning, everyone. For today's call, I will review our financial results for the second quarter and year-to-date period of fiscal 2026. My comments today will focus on adjusted results. Please refer to the description of the special items included in our results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2026 in our press release issued earlier today, which also includes a reconciliation table of GAAP and non-GAAP measures. Turning to a review of the quarter, overall, we were pleased with our performance for 2026. Sales were $161.8 million as compared to $157 million last year, an increase of 3.1%. In constant dollars, the increase in net sales was 1.4%.\nNet sales increased across licensed brands and company stores, partially offset by a decrease in net sales in owned brands. By geography, U.S. net sales decreased 1.6% as compared to the second quarter of last year. International net sales increased by 6.9%. On a constant currency basis, international net sales increased 3.9% with strong performances in certain markets such as Latin America and Europe. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 54.1% compared to 54.3% in the second quarter of last year. The decrease in gross margin rate as compared to the same period of last year was primarily driven by increased tariffs and unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by favorable channel and product mix.\nOperating expenses were $80.6 million as compared to $82.6 million for the second quarter of last year. The $2 million decrease was driven by a strategic reduction in marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in performance-based compensation. The combination of higher revenue and gross profit and a decline in operating expenses drove operating income to $7 million, a $4.4 million improvement from $2.6 million in 2025. We recorded approximately $1.1 million of other non-operating income in 2026 as compared to $1.8 million in the same period of last year. Other non-operating income is primarily comprised of interest earned on our global cash position. We recorded income tax expense of $2.7 million in 2026 as compared to $843,000 in 2025.\nNet income in the second quarter was $5.3 million or $0.23 per diluted share as compared to $3.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the year-ago period. Now turning to our year-to-date results, sales for the six-month period ended July 31, 2025, were $293.6 million as compared to $291.4 million last year. Total net sales increased 0.8% as compared to the six-month period of fiscal 2025. In constant dollars, the increase in net sales for the year-to-date period was 0.3%. U.S. net sales declined by 1.6%, and international sales increased by 2.6%. Gross profit was $158.9 million or 54.1% of sales, as compared to $158.2 million or 54.3% of sales last year.\nThe decrease in gross margin rate for the first six months was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange and increased tariff costs, partially offset by favorable channel and product mix. Operating expenses were $151 million as compared to $153.4 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was driven by a strategic reduction in marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in performance-based compensation. For the six months ended July 31, 2025, operating income was $7.9 million compared to $4.8 million in fiscal 2025.\nWe recorded approximately $2.7 million of other non-operating income in the six-month period of fiscal 2026, which is primarily comprised of interest earned on our global cash position, as compared to $3.8 million in the same period of last year. Net income was $7.2 million or $0.32 per diluted share as compared to $5.5 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the year-ago period. Now turning to our balance sheet, cash at the end of the second quarter was $180.5 million as compared to $198.3 million of the same period last year. Accounts receivable was $94.4 million, up $7.7 million from the same period of last year, primarily due to timing and mix of business.\nInventory at the end of the quarter was up $28.3 million or 15.5% above the same period of last year. $5.1 million of the increase was due to foreign currency, and $4.6 million of reciprocal tariffs is included in inventory on hand at the end of the second quarter. As Efraim mentioned, as of July 31, we have built a strong position in inventory of Swiss-made watches in the United States and would expect that a substantial portion of this year's needs are covered. We are comfortable with the composition and balance of our inventory at year-end.\nIn the first six months of fiscal 2026, capital expenditures were $2.8 million, and we repurchased approximately 100,000 shares under our share repurchase program. As of July 31, 2025, we had $48.4 million remaining under our authorized share repurchase program. Subject to prevailing market conditions and the business environment, we plan to utilize our share repurchase program to offset dilution in fiscal 2026. As Efraim mentioned, we closely monitor the changing tariff landscape, and we will continue to develop mitigation plans. Given the current macroeconomic environment and the ongoing uncertainty of the impact of tariffs on our business, the company is not providing fiscal 2026 outlook. I would now like to open the call up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press 2 to remove yourself from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up their handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for a question. Our first question comes from the line of Hamed Khorsand with BWS Financial. Please proceed with your question.\nHamed Khorsand: Hi, good morning. So there was lots of commentary about mini watches, and I just wanted to understand what you are seeing from consumer habits or purchasing that you think that the mini is the route that you are taking?\nEfraim Grinberg: So I think, and you know, we have both what we call mini watches, and we have microwatches, which are smaller. Mini watches for us are watches from, like, 23 to 28 millimeters. And what had happened is that for a period of time, watches had gotten bigger both for men and for women. So over the last few years, they have gotten smaller again. And with that aspect, it has actually brought young women back into the category. And there is a lot of social media around that and layering of women's watches with jewelry. And so we believe it represents a significant opportunity across our brand portfolio.\nAnd that trend has, as many trends do, begun in luxury and then moves into more accessible products as well.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And during Prime Day, I know you guys were participating. Was there anything that stood out of that event that has continued since? Or was it purely the consumer responding to price?\nEfraim Grinberg: So we are probably a bigger participant in the prime events in Europe than we are in the United States. But we have seen our overall digital business with those retailers that are completely focused on the digital environment, whether it be Zalando or the Amazons of the world, really doing very well on a global basis. And that is really good to see, and that is really across our brand portfolio. So we believe that is an increased opportunity as we continue to progress down our strategic plan.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. And then I know you have talked about raising inventory because of the Swiss watches, but earlier this year you had also raised inventory because of what is going on with tariffs. How much of your increase overall year to date, and I am speaking on calendar so excuse me, year to date on the calendar, can you just digest through the channel by the holiday shopping season?\nEfraim Grinberg: Sure. So I will start, and then I will turn it over to Sallie. Our inventories got very low at year-end, so we began to rebuild inventory in Q1 of this year. We would expect our inventories to be in line by year-end. And what that has allowed us to do at the same time is to offset some of the tariff impact by having inventory moved to the United States prior to the implementation of certain tariffs. Obviously, we cannot offset all of it, and then we have taken other actions, whether it be pricing or negotiations with suppliers, to help mitigate some of the effect as well. But I will turn it back to Sallie as well.\nSallie DeMarsilis: The only detail I will add to that, and thank you, Efraim, that was very thorough, is we have, as I mentioned, about $28 million of additional inventory at this time. We do expect to work it down by the end of the year to something more reasonable. But of that, about $16 million of it is in the U.S. So we did pull it forward into the U.S. so that we can manage through these tariffs and kind of get ahead of some uncertainty with that. As we also mentioned, just to reiterate, we do think that a substantial portion of what we need in the U.S. is probably already here.\nWe will add in what might be new styles or something that is an advertisement or maybe something that is just selling faster than we had anticipated. Bring it in, but we should be in relatively good shape.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. Can I ask one more question?\nEfraim Grinberg: Certainly. Absolutely.\nHamed Khorsand: You have taken a lot of these restructuring charges in the last few quarters. When do they stop? And when do us investors see it show up in quarterly results?\nEfraim Grinberg: Well, I think it is a combination both of charges dealing with our event that occurred in the Middle East last year, as well as some charges on the restructuring side. I would think on the restructuring side, they are predominantly done. There could be some laggard expenses on the other charges, but I would expect overall that they will be reduced significantly.\nSallie DeMarsilis: And just to remind you that we did mention when we were talking about the savings and the initiatives we were putting in place, those are offset by some increases this year in our costs. So you will see they offset some of the increases that we would have for regular year-over-year increases for merit, adding back performance-based compensation, and, of course, currency.\nHamed Khorsand: Okay. Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have reached the end of the question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Efraim Grinberg for closing remarks.\nEfraim Grinberg: Okay. Thank you all for participating with us today, and we look forward to joining you again for our third quarter conference call where we will hopefully be able to share with you the progress that we continue to make on our strategic initiatives. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

Visit americanexpress.com to learn more.\nWhen Citi unveiled its all-new Citi Strata Elite℠ Card, it also announced an overhaul to the Citi Strata℠ Card.\nThe Citi Strata Card, which replaces the Citi Rewards+ Card (no longer available), offers a way to earn Citi ThankYou® Rewards in a number of helpful categories, like at supermarkets and transit, and in one category of your choosing. Considering the card has a $0 annual fee, it offers a fairly low-pressure entry into the Citi Rewards family.\nThe Citi Strata℠ Card is a solid rewards credit card that earns in several everyday spending categories, with no annual fee.\n- No annual fee\n- Customizable earnings category\n- Earns transferable rewards\n- Has foreign transaction fees\n- Fewer built-in benefits\nHighlights\nHighlights shown here are provided by the issuer and have not been reviewed by CNBC Select's editorial staff.\n- For a limited time, earn 30,000 bonus Points after spending $1,000 in the first 3 months of account opening.\n- 0% Intro APR on balance transfers and purchases for 15 months; after that, the variable APR will be 19.24% - 29.24%, based on your creditworthiness. There is an intro balance transfer fee of 3% of each transfer (minimum $5) completed within the first 4 months of account opening. After that, your fee will be 5% of each transfer (minimum $5).\n- Earn 3 ThankYou® Points for each $1 spent in an eligible Self-Select Category of your choice (Fitness Clubs, Select Streaming Services, Live Entertainment, Cosmetic Stores\/Barber Shops\/Hair Salons, or Pet Supply Stores). Choose your eligible Self-Select Category on Citi Online or by calling customer service. The default Self-Select Category is Select Streaming Services.\n- Earn 5 ThankYou® Points for each $1 spent on Hotels, Car Rentals and Attractions booked on Citi Travel® via cititravel.com; earn 3 ThankYou Points for each $1 spent at Supermarkets, on Select Transit purchases, and at Gas & EV Charging Stations.\n- Earn 2 ThankYou® Points for each $1 spent at Restaurants; earn 1 ThankYou® Point for each $1 spent on All Other Purchases.\n- No Annual Fee\nBalance transfer fee\nThere is an intro balance transfer fee of 3% of each transfer (minimum $5) completed within the first 4 months of account opening. A balance transfer fee of 5% of each transfer ($5 minimum) applies if completed after 4 months of account opening.\nWelcome bonus\nThe Citi Strata Card has a limited-time welcome offer of 30,000 bonus points after spending $1,000 in the first three months of account opening.\nThe card earns its bonus in the form of Citi ThankYou® Points, which can be redeemed for a range of rewards at varying rates. Citi ThankYou® Points are generally valued at roughly 1.75 cents per point by the industry, so this welcome bonus is worth about $525.\nBenefits and perks\nWith the Citi Strata Card having no annual fee, it's not unexpected for the additional benefits to be a little slimmer:\n- Access to Citi Entertainment®: Get special access to thousands of events, including presale tickets and exclusive experiences\n- Mastercard ID Theft Protection: This Mastercard program can monitor the information you choose to protect and alert you if suspicious activity is found. Enrollment is required but complimentary.\n- Citi Shop®: A free browser extension, available exclusively to eligible Citi cardmembers, that helps you save by finding offers and coupons in the background.\nThe Citi Strata Card, unsurprisingly, doesn't offer any kind of travel or rental car insurance, which is something to keep in mind if you're searching for this protection.\nHow to earn and redeem Citi ThankYou® Points\nEarning\nFor a no annual fee card, the Citi Strata offers some strong earning opportunities:\n- Earn 5X points on hotels, car rentals and attractions booked on Citi Travel® via cititravel.com\n- Earn 3X points on an eligible self-select category of your choice (fitness clubs, select streaming services, live entertainment, cosmetic stores\/barber shops\/hair salons or pet supply stores)\n- Earn 3X points at supermarkets\n- Earn 3X points on select transit purchases\n- Earn 3X points at gas & EV charging stations\n- Earn 2X points when spending at restaurants, including restaurant delivery services\n- Earn 1X points on all other purchases\nThe ability to earn 3X points in a category of your choice is a nice addition for those looking for increased flexibility in their card, and the card earns in some key everyday categories like supermarkets and gas stations. If you're someone who enjoys going to restaurants, the 2X points the card offers are nice, but can be outpaced by some other more dining-focused options. While the 5X earned via Citi Travel purchases is a good rate, booking through a travel portal often means jumping through more hoops.\nRedeeming\nWhen redeeming ThankYou® Points earned by your Citi Strata Card, you have several options to choose from:\n- Travel\n- Gifts cards\n- Cash back\n- Shopping via select retailers\n- Charitable donations\nWhile options like cash back and gift cards are usually the simplest, they often don't provide you with the best value. You'll often get the most bang for your buck when transferring your rewards to select travel rewards programs, including:\n- ALL Accor Live Limitless\n- Aeromexico\n- Air France-KLM Flying Blue\n- Avianca LifeMiles\n- Cathay Pacific Asia Miles\n- Choice Privileges\n- Emirate Skywards\n- Etihad Guest\n- EVA Air\n- JetBlue TrueBlue\n- Leaders Club\n- Preferred Hotels & Resorts\n- Quantas Frequent Flyer\n- Qatar Airways Privilege Club\n- Shop Your Way\n- Singapore Airlines\n- Thai Royal Orchard Plus\n- Turkish Airlines Miles&Smiles\n- Virgin Atlantic Flying Club & Virgin Red\n- Wyndham Rewards\nBeing a cardholder of the Citi Strata Elite, Citi Strata Premier® Card (see rates and fees) or Citi Prestige® Card (no longer available) will unlock even more transfer opportunities with AAdvantage® miles and better conversion rates.

Each of these categories is capped at up to $6,000 a year on eligible purchases, then you'll earn 1%. The card also offers an $84 Disney streaming credit in the form of up to $7 back per month as a statement credit when using your Blue Cash Card for the purchase.\nWhen comparing this card to the Citi Strata, both have similar earning rates but in different categories.

The card also offers numerous travel protections, and the Ultimate Rewards® points it earns are among the most valuable credit card rewards due to Chase's transfer partners.\nWhile the Sapphire Preferred does have an annual fee, the $95 charge can be recouped fairly quickly through the hotel credit and through over $200 in partnership benefits via DoorDash and Lyft. The card offers less customization than what you get with the Citi Strata, but it's better aligned for those who are interested in using their card for travel.\nIs the Citi Strata Card right for you?\nThe Citi Strata Card is a strong $0 annual fee card. It offers rates of up to 5X points when booking via Citi Travel and earns rewards on common purchases, making it easier to save up your points for redemption. Citi Strata cardholders get access to Citi's rewards ecosystem, too.\nThe card doesn't offer many additional benefits or come with any statement credits, both of which are more common with premium cards. For those interested in a no-annual-fee card that earns rewards on everyday purchases, the Citi Strata Card is the perfect fit.\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

You can follow today's market updates here on our daily live blog.\nUpdate: 4:43 p.m. ET\nChipmakers Fall After Nvidia Earnings\nInvestors are marinating on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, which landed in investors' ballpark. Although the results saw the company beat and raise, the stock continues to sink. It's not the only one.\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) (-1.2%) is down, falling with other AI names like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (-1.8%), Taiwan Semiconductor (-1.58%), and Marvell Technology (-1.39%), among others.\nUpdate: 4:23 p.m. ET\nBreaking: Nvidia Earnings Are Here\nInvestors are starting to digest Nvidia (NVDA) (-3%) earnings, which just dropped:\nData center revenue was $41.1 billion, while Blackwell Data Center revenue was up 17% sequentially. Cloud service providers represented about 50% of data center revenue.\nAs previously indicated, Nvidia did not ship any H20 chips to China in the quarter. This remains a point of interest for investors, which will likely be covered on the call this evening.\nNetworking revenue and gaming revenue surprised to the upside, while compute revenue disappointed.\nThe company sees its current quarter (Q3) guidance at $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts were looking for $53.1 billion, per LSEG. They see adjusted gross margin of 73% to 74%.\nThe company is also announcing a $60 billion share buyback. Its quarterly cash dividend will remain $0.01\/sh.\nTech stocks are tipping over on the news.\nThis story is developing and more information will be added shortly.\nUpdate: 4:10 p.m. ET\nP.M. Earnings: CrowdStrike, Snowflake, HP\nA handful of after hour earnings are trickling in, producing some big after hour reactions. Here are the highlights in after hours, as of publishing:\nSnowflake (SNOW) (+13%) rising after strong earnings beat, with revenue up 32% year-over-year to $1.1 billion; issued strong guidance.\nHP Inc. (HPQ) (+5.1%) is up after a slim beat on earnings and revenue; raising guidance on strong AI hardware results.\nPure Storage (PSTG) (+16%) is up after a healthy earnings beat; annual subscription annual revenue (ARR) rose 18%, faster than the company's revenue.\nUrban Outfitters (URBN) (-7%) after revenue rose 11.3% year-over-year as all five of its core brands saw sales growth.\nWe are still awaiting results from Nvidia (NVDA) , which will report at 20 after the hour.\nAfter Market: Movers & Losers\nThe U.S. stock market is now closed for the day. The Russell 2000 (+0.64%) pulled out another stellar performance, trailed by the Dow (+0.32%), S&P 500 (+0.24%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.21%). The Nasdaq-100 (+0.17%) which is being carefully watched ahead of some big tech earnings after the bell, saw a modest end-of-day gain.\nHere were the top ten performers on U.S. exchanges today, per Barchart:\nAnd on the other end of the market, here were the ten worst-performing names today:\nUpdate: 3:40 p.m. ET\nInvestors await Nvidia Earnings\nWe're about 20 minutes away from Nvidia's (-0.08%) long-awaited quarterly earnings; arguably the biggest report of the season.\nInvestors have traded the stock in a narrow band over the last few hours. Right now, it's settled to about even on the day.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 (+0.09%)is similarly situated, up just a few bips, as many of the world's largest businesses brace for the results.\nIt's also a big deal for the U.S. economy: AI has been a driving force in the U.S. GDP in recent quarters, making up for an American consumer which is increasingly facing economic pressure.\nAs a result, its results could offer clues of where AI is going, as well as how it might contribute to economic growth.\nUpdate: 2:13 p.m. ET\nSwiftie See, Swiftie Do\nIn case you missed it: Taylor Swift is engaged. Yes, we all know.\nAnd now, so does the stock market.\nEarlier today, we touched on how fiancé Travis Kelce is announcing a new partnership with American Eagle (+8%), helping boost the stock and its newfound retail popularity.\nIt turns out it isn't the only stock that the Swifts are moving today. The public wanted to see the ring. In fact, it has become the largest related query when you look up Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce on Google Trends.\nIt's a one-of-one though, designed by Artifex Finew Jewelry's Kindred Lubeck. Still, investors pumped up publicly-traded jewelry company Signet Jewelers (+6%), betting that the 'cushion cut' look would fetch the attention of late 20s and early 30-somethings seeking their own fairytale engagement.\nUpdate: 12:31 p.m. ET\nMidday Movers: MongoDB, ViaSat, Summit Therapeutics, Deutsche Bank, American Eagle\nWe're finally at the midpoint of the market day. Stocks have sank in the last 30 minutes, pushing the Nasdaq Composite (-0.10%) into the red. The S&P 500 might not be far behind, following a similar trajectory. However, the trend is not as pronounced for the Dow (+0.16%) and Russell 2000 (+0.50%).\nWe're still adding some details here, but here are some of the stocks that are making headlines and big moves intraday:\nMongoDB\nDatabase software company MongoDB (MDB) (+34%) is soaring after its after hour earnings yesterday. Revenues grew 24% to $591 million, while losses narrowed. The company said it added over 5,000 customers in the first half of the year. It's the market's best-performing stock today.\nViaSat\nYesterday, AT&T (T) settled on a $23 billion deal for EchoStar's (SATS) (+13.2%) 50 MHz spectrum licenses in North America. The two are up again today and they're bringing ViaSat (+5.86%) along with. That's because an analyst note from William Blair says that the company's 68 MHz of L-band spectrum might not be sufficiently captured in the company's valuation.\nSummit Therapeutics\nSummit Therapeutics (SMMT) (-9.3%) is pulling back after new survival data was released on its partnered drug with Akeso. Ivonescimab, already approved in China, hit its primary endpoint in its phase 3 HARMONi-A trial. Given optimism around its commercial potential in the U.S. and Europe, Summit has soared. The stock has risen over 32% in the past six months.\nDeutsche Bank\nInvestment bank Deutsche Bank (-5%) is falling after being downgraded to \"neutral\" by Goldman Sachs. They remain bullish, but after nearly doubling year-to-date on the NYSE, the German bank isn't computing as a \"buy\" anymore. (Goldman also downgraded Commerzbank AG.)\nAmerican Eagle\nFashion retailer American Eagle (AEO) (+8%) has appreciated a much-needed injection to its stock price thanks to a partnership with American heartthrob Sydney Sweeney. Although controversial, the stock has risen 41% since mid-June, thanks in part to the praise of the President himself. Today, it's going higher again on a new partnership, this time with Travis Kelce. Seen him in the news in the last 24 hours? Seems timing is on their side, even if sales seem not to be.\nUpdate: 12:03 p.m. ET\nTemp Check: Stocks Up Ahead of Nvidia Earnings\nStocks are now at their session highs, continuing a pattern we've seen a lot of recently: slow start, then a rocket. The Dow (+0.22%), S&P 500 (+0.21%), and Nasdaq Composite (+0.17%) are all in the green.\nLet's talk Nasdaq 100 (+0.12%). This concentrated bundle of tech stocks is underperforming every other index. With Nvidia's (NVDA) (+0.11%) highly-anticipated report coming after the bell, many traders are in 'wait and see' mode. You can see it i just how minimal the moves are on the heatmap, especially at the top.\nGrowth stocks are doing something totally different, though. The Russell 2000 (+0.52%) is awash in green and grey, adding to its days-long rally since the Fed's rate cut revelation in Jackson Hole, Wyo. last Friday. It's now up 6.44% on the year, with almost all those gains coming in the month of August.\nUpdate: 10:03 a.m. ET\nIn Focus: Nvidia Earnings After the Close\nThis morning, Nvidia (NVDA) (-0.83%) is down before its heavily-anticipated after hours report. Analysts polled by Bloomberg are looking for earnings per share of $1.01 on $46.2 billion in revenue today. That would put year-over-year growth at 49% and 53% respectively.\nA lot is riding on hitting those numbers. Options are pointing to a $260 billion price swing on the earnings release. And aside from that, Nvidia is the largest component of the S&P 500 (at 7.64% of the index) and Nasdaq-100 (14.43%). It's also part of the Dow.\nTheStreet team has been writing at length about the earnings and the sky-high expectations imposed on the market's biggest stocks.\nAnalysts have recently been revisiting their stock targets for the stock, which our Silin Chen covered last night. For the most part, analysts have been looking to the upside.\nThose targets will have to meet reality today, though. And to that end, Faizan Farooque wrote at length this morning about what investors should keep an eye on in this afternoon's earnings report:\nThe market is now open. Three of the four indexes are in the red to start the day, including the Nasdaq Composite (-0.18%) and Russell 2000 (-0.13%). Although, in recent days, the indexes have started their days to the downside, only to rally in the late session.\nSpeaking of which, the S&P 500 (+0.03%) and Dow (+0.29%) are up to start the morning. Sectors like energy, consumer services, and health technology are flashing green in the early session. However, at large, individual stocks within indexes are pretty flat at the moment.\nUpdate: 8:35 a.m. ET\nA.M. Earnings: Royal Bank of Canada, Williams Sonoma, Abercrombie & Fitch\nWe have seen a few earnings reports cross the wire this morning. Here are some of the highlights, with data provided by TipRanks:\nRoyal Bank of Canada (RY) (+2%) reported a record quarter as provisions for credit losses came in lower than expected.\nWilliams Sonoma (WSM) (+1%) delivered strong earnings, while revenues came in line; EPS of $2\/sh on $1.837 billion in revenue.\nJM Smucker (SJM) (-6%) reported a double miss, with earnings of $1.90 per share on $2.11 billion.\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) (-1%) reported a narrow beat, with $2.23 per share on $1.2 billion in revenue.\nKohl's (KSS) (+17%)delivered nearly double the EPS as expected, with $0.56 per share on $3.35 billion in revenue.\nUpdate: 8:11 a.m. ET\nFutures At Session Lows\nFutures are suggesting something about the anticipation around today's blockbuster report, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 at session lows in futures trading. We'll see if they can lock in for the open.\nUpdate: 7:35 a.m. ET\nGoldman Sach's Low-$50 Oil Prediction\nGoldman Sachs GS is out with a fresh note on the oil market, saying that Brent crude will drop to the \"low $50s\" by the end of 2026 as additional capacity is utilized. From today's brent price, such a decline would be between 15% and 25%.\nUpdate: 5:21 a.m. ET\nEarnings Today: Nvidia, CrowdStrike, Snowflake\nInvestors have been awaiting today's biggest report all season: chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) . The company is the most valuable company in the world (and the largest component of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes). As such, its report is bound to be a major market mover when the report comes down after hours.\nDespite its enormous importance, it won't be alone today. In fact, there's a number of other reports on deck. Per Nasdaq, there are 61 reports in order today, including Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) , and Snowflake (SNOW) .\nEconomic Data: MBA Mortgage Data & EIA Data\nTaking a backseat today, economic reports from the Mortgage Bankers Association and Energy Information Administration will be at the forefront of economic data reports. All data is for the week of Aug. 22, 2025.","content_hash":"a1d3575af4863127e765c064cb2c34cb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":11778,"method_rank":0}

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.43%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.46%.\nStock indexes settled higher on Tuesday on some positive US economic news. The US core capital goods and consumer confidence reports were stronger than expected. Also, the strength in semiconductor makers was supportive of the overall market. In addition, China is sending Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang to the US to meet with US trade officials and negotiators, a move that signals trade talks with China are progressing.\nStock indexes added to their gains Tuesday afternoon when bond yields declined on strong demand for the Treasury's $69 billion auction of 2-year T-notes. The 10-year T-note yield fell -2 bp to 4.25%.\nHowever, fresh concerns over the Fed's independence limited gains in stocks and weighed on the dollar after President Trump moved to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, citing \"sufficient cause\" based on the administration’s allegations she made false statements on one or more mortgage loans. Ms. Cook said she will not resign, and her lawyer pledged to take \"whatever actions are needed to prevent\" the president's \"illegal action.\"\nUS July capital goods new orders nondefense ex-aircraft and parts, a proxy for capital spending, rose +1.1% m\/m, stronger than expectations of +0.2% m\/m.\nThe US June S&P Core Logic composite-20 home price index eased to +2.14% y\/y from +2.81% y\/y in May, the smallest increase in two years.\nThe Conference Board US Aug consumer confidence index fell -1.3 to 97.4, stronger than expectations of 96.5.\nThe US Aug Richmond Fed manufacturing survey rose +13 to a 5-month high of -7, stronger than expectations of -11.\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations' digital services taxes that hit American companies. Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nOn the geopolitical front, diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine remain elusive, as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two countries. On Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said there was no meeting planned between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine and that there \"needs to be an agenda first\" for a meeting to take place. \"This agenda is not ready at all.\"\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh tariff news or developments on ending the Ukraine-Russian war. After Wednesday's close, Nvidia will release its quarterly earnings and guidance. On Thursday, Q2 GDP is expected to be revised upward by +0.1 to 3.1% (q\/q annualized). Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -5,000 to 230,000. On Friday, July personal spending is expected to climb +0.3% m\/m, and July personal income is expected to rise +0.4% m\/m. Also, the July core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, is expected to climb +0.2% m\/m and +2.9% y\/y. In addition, the Aug MNI Chicago PMI is expected to fall -0.6 to 46.5. Finally, the University of Michigan's final-Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to be unrevised at 58.6.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 87% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17. The markets are discounting the chances at 52% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With Q2 earnings season winding down, over 94% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets closed lower on Tuesday. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell to a 1.5-week low and closed down -1.11%. China's Shanghai Composite fell from a new 10-year high and closed down -0.39%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 dropped to a 2-week low and closed down -0.97%.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) on Tuesday closed up +7.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -2.1 bp to 4.254%.\nT-notes recovered from early losses on Tuesday and moved higher after strong demand for the Treasury's $69 billion auction of 2-year T-notes sparked short covering in T-note futures. The auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.69, better than the 10-auction average of 2.62. T-notes also garnered support when Fed Governor Cook said she has no plans to resign and that \"no cause exists\" for President Trump to fire her.\nT-notes initially moved lower on Tuesday after President Trump said he will move to fire Fed Governor Cook, exacerbating investor concerns about the Fed's independence and fanning inflation fears if politics forces interest rates below the neutral rate. Also, rising inflation expectations undercut T-note prices after the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate rose to a 3.5-week high on Tuesday of 2.438%. In addition, today's stronger-than-expected US core capital goods and consumer confidence reports were bearish for T-notes.\nEuropean government bond yields on Tuesday were mixed.

The company's new push to add fresh groceries to its same-day delivery service in select markets, where Prime members can already buy non-perishables and all kinds of other items, is no experiment. It's a calculated bet on logistics that enables customers to order eggs and baked goods at the same time as T-shirts and picture frames and get everything delivered together. By further enhancing its same-day fulfillment hubs, the e-commerce and cloud giant is aiming to narrow the gap with traditional grocers while setting a new standard for convenience. \"Our north star here is we want to continue to make grocery shopping easier, faster, and more affordable for our customers,\" said Jason Buechel, CEO of Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market. \"Now, under one roof, you have the opportunity for customers to get all the things they've always been purchasing from our same-day facilities and adding perishable groceries to that as well,\" Buechel told CNBC in an interview. He is also vice president of the company's worldwide grocery stores, which also include the Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go brands. What's at stake Amazon announced on Aug. 13 that Prime members in more than 1,000 cities and towns can now get free delivery on perishable groceries and any other items available for same-day delivery. Orders under the $25 minimum would incur a $2.99 fee. Amazon plans to expand to 2,300 markets by year-end, with further expansion slated for 2026. If available in your area, the new options will be served automatically to Prime members who are logged into Amazon's website. This enhanced service is different from the fresh food and grocery items already available from Whole Foods Market and other partners. The existing service fills orders at local stores that are then picked up and delivered by local drivers. That model is not going away. But some of that ordering, particularly smaller orders, could shift the new paradigm of fresh foods warehoused at same-day delivery fulfillment centers According to Buechel, Amazon's ability to roll out the new service at scale comes from expanding and retrofitting its existing same-day facilities or smaller, specialized sites designed to pick, pack, and sort in-demand items for rapid delivery to customers within a short driving radius. \"What we've done is extend upon our already existing infrastructure … adding in some specialized capabilities that will allow us to support perishable groceries,\" Buechel said. Those capabilities include creating a temperature-controlled environment to support product freshness of perishable groceries. Buechel also highlighted \"specialized training programs for our employees that are helping them support the cold-chain processes required in a perishable environment.\" On the day of the announcement, Amazon stock rose more than 1% while delivery competitors like Instacart and DoorDash dropped 12.4% and 4.8%, respectively. Walmart , which has a major grocery presence, and pure-play grocer Kroger also slipped 2.3% and 4.2% that day. The market's initial reaction signaled Amazon's latest move could pose a competitive threat. However, early analysis from Wells Fargo and others suggests Amazon's \"share capture could be slow,\" pointing to \"points of friction,\" such as a limited assortment of fresh options, wide delivery windows that frustrate customers, and the need for continued investment to build out the service. Still, Buechel pointed to encouraging early adoption. He noted that 70% of customers who used the new service at its initial launches in Phoenix, Orlando, and Kansas City, Missouri, were first-time perishable buyers, and more than 20% returned within the first month to make additional purchases. \"It really showed us the unmet demand that we had with our customer base and that we as Amazon are a trusted partner for our customers in being able to deliver this offering,\" he said. Years in the making Amazon has been building toward this grocery expansion for years. Amazon Fresh debuted in 2007 in Washington state, promising delivery within a two-hour window. Over time, that offering has scaled to meet growing customer demand. Amazon Fresh launched brick-and-mortar locations starting in 2020, and currently has more than 60 stores, according to the company . In 2017, the company deepened its grocery footprint with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, bringing a trusted brick-and-mortar brand under its umbrella. Whole Foods stores currently are up to more than 535. When customers shop Amazon Fresh on Amazon's website, those orders are filled separately from the same-day delivery infrastructure, using grocery fulfillment centers or an Amazon Fresh store or a Whole Foods, depending on which is closer. Today, tens of millions of shoppers turn to Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods for their full range of grocery needs while also using Amazon's platform to shop local and specialty retailers. Amazon has become one of the largest grocers in the U.S., generating $100 billion in annual gross sales from groceries and household essentials. While those early moves laid the foundation for Amazon's grocery ambitions, it's the company's network of same-day fulfillment centers that have become the real engine of its rapid delivery strategy. These same-day fulfillment centers have \"really made a difference\" in Amazon's push to expand grocery delivery, said Marc Wulfraat, founder and president of MWPVL International, a specialized supply chain, logistics, and distribution consulting firm. Wulfraat estimates that roughly 76 same-day fulfillment centers have been retrofitted with coolers and freezers to enable the fresh groceries to be stored in the same locations as all the other same-day items. Wall Street analysis In its announcement, Amazon said it expanded its same-day delivery service to include \"thousands of fresh grocery items.\" While thousands may sound like a lot, Wells Fargo said, \"Prime same-day grocery selection looks somewhat limited.\" The analysts added, \"While Amazon is likely to expand its offering over time, it may initially struggle to become a regular grocery option for consumers without a broader basket.\" Wells Fargo estimates grocery could be a drag on Amazon's operating income with each percentage point of U.S. market share potentially costing $2.5 billion to $3 billion annually due to thin margins. While crediting Amazon's logistics strength and Prime as competitive moats, the analysts said that grocery's \"margin profile\" and \"operational complexity\" warrant investor caution. Wells Fargo has an equal weight rating on Amazon and a price target of $245 per share on the stock. MoffettNathanson takes a similarly cautious view. They said the number of SKUs, or stock keeping units, \"falls well short of what the consumer ultimately needs, tens of thousands of items.\" The analysts' grocery industry research shows that the average grocery store carries 32,000 items, underscoring \"Amazon's difficulty in strong-arming their way in\" the grocery market. The analysts stress that \"selection needs to increase by orders of magnitude. Otherwise, this remains a limited top-off use case.\" MoffettNathanson has a buy rating on Amazon and a price target of $263. Amazon seems to recognize its initial same-day limitations, saying the new service is designed to \"complement Amazon's existing grocery delivery offerings — including Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and a variety of local grocery and specialty retailers on Amazon.com.\" Bottom line We see the grocery expansion as a bold step given the industry's complexity and razor-thin margins, but meaningful disruption across the sector will take time to unfold. If any company can make such a power move, it is well-funded Amazon, which also boasts financially strong businesses in advertising and the cloud. For now, we view this as a long-term story with Amazon gradually pressuring traditional grocers as it refines its offerings and expands selection. We also have confidence in Amazon's decades of logistics and Whole Foods' expertise to give customers a one-stop shop, same-day solution for all their essential needs. We continue to maintain our buy-equivalent 1 rating on Amazon shares and a $250 price target. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AMZN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Trading activity is thin as the markets await Nvidia’s earnings after the close for an update on the artificial intelligence boom. With a $4.4 trillion market capitalization, Nvidia has an 8.1% weighting in the S&P 500, giving it significant power to impact the index.\nGains in stocks are limited as bond yields rise on concerns about the Fed’s independence following President Trump’s push to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. The 10-year T-note yield is up +2 bp to 4.28%. Additionally, weakness in the semiconductor market is weighing on technology stocks and the broader market.\nComments today from New York Fed President Williams were neutral, as he stated that the US economy is slowing, not stalling, and he remains optimistic about the economy’s direction. He added that every FOMC meeting is “live” for interest rates and that at some point, it will be appropriate for us to adjust rates downward as we remain in a “modestly restrictive” stance on policy.\nUS MBA mortgage applications fell -0.5% in the week ended August 22, with the purchase mortgage sub-index up +2.2% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index down -3.5%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage rose +1 bp to 6.69% from 6.68% in the prior week.\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump late Monday threatened to impose new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against other nations’ digital services taxes that hit American companies. Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh tariff news or developments on ending the Ukraine-Russian war. After today’s close, Nvidia will release its quarterly earnings and guidance. On Thursday, Q2 GDP is expected to be revised upward by +0.1 to 3.1% (q\/q annualized).

Supply pressures are also weighing on T-notes, as the Treasury will auction $28 billion in 2-year floating-rate notes and $70 billion in 5-year T-notes later today. In addition, T-notes are under pressure with President Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Cook, exacerbating investor concerns about the Fed’s independence and fanning inflation fears if politics forces interest rates below the neutral rate.\nEuropean government bond yields are moving lower today. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.695% and is down -1.6 bp to 2.707%. 10-year UK gilt yield is down -0.7 bp to 4.733%.\nThe German Sep GfK consumer confidence survey unexpectedly fell -1.9 to a 5-month low of -23.6, weaker than expectations of no change at -21.5.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nMongoDB (MDB) is up more than +32% to lead software stocks higher after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.08, well above the consensus of 65 cents, and raising its 2026 adjusted EPS forecast to $3.64-$3.73 from a previous forecast of $2.94-$3.12, stronger than the consensus of $3.20.

The industry and the company seem to finally be pushing past it.\nOil companies like Chevron are far from dead just yet.\nContrary to a common assumption, American Express isn't just another credit card company.\nWarren Buffett's anti-excitement approach to picking stocks may not be everyone's preferred style. There's no denying, however, that Buffett's got the gift. Share prices of his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), have dramatically outperformed the overall market for most multiyear time frames since the 1960s. That's why you'd be wise to poach a few of his picks when you're looking for a new name to add to your portfolio.\nIf you have $5,000 in available cash that isn't needed for monthly bills, to bolster an emergency fund, or to pay down short-term debt, you might want to put it towards an investment in one (or all) of these three Buffett-approved Berkshire holdings. Here's why.\n1. Nucor\nProbably the most talked about of Buffett's recent stock transactions is Berkshire buying a stake in struggling health insurer UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH). Share prices are down by roughly half from April's peak value, mostly in response to disappointing results and news that the company's Medicare billing practices were being investigated by the Department of Justice. Of course, the time to step into a quality company is when its stock is well down.\nEven having Buffett-like boldness, however, might not justify you jumping into this particular trade when there are so many other good options available. There are still just too many unknowns surrounding this company, like new regulatory requirements and competition encouraged by the White House.\nA far more widely palatable Buffett pick to copy is Berkshire's new position in Nucor(NYSE: NUE).\nIt's not exactly a household name. The steel company's $34 billion market cap just isn't all that big anymore, nor is steel a sexy growth industry like artificial intelligence or space launches.\nSteel is a solid, all-around business to be in, though. While consumption of it was down slightly during, after, and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Steel Organization is looking for a slight improvement in demand this year, echoing an outlook from Fitch. And this turn is likely to be the beginning of a much longer trend. Precedence Research believes worldwide demand for steel is set to grow at an average annualized pace of a little more than 5% (enormous growth by the industry's historical standards) through 2034; the planet's physical infrastructure just needs massive updating, while at the same time population growth is driving the need for more residential housing here and abroad. The continued proliferation of new green energy projects is also driving demand.\nThat doesn't mean Nucor will always be easy to own. Indeed, steel and steel stock prices are notoriously volatile.\nAfter making no net progress for the past three years, when it looks like the global steel business is working its way out of a rut, though, it's certainly not difficult to see why Buffett and his lieutenants liked this name well enough to scoop up a 6.6 million-share stake worth right around $1 billion. At its current stock price, $5,000 will get you roughly 33.5 shares of this dividend-paying stock.\n2. Chevron\nChevron(NYSE: CVX) isn't a new trade. In fact, Berkshire's been sitting on a position in the oil giant since 2020, occasionally selling some, but mostly buying to make it the conglomerate's fifth-biggest stock holding now. With the recent addition of 3.4 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway now owns 112 million shares of Chevron, collectively worth more than $19 billion.\nIt's a surprising trade even for Buffett. Although he's a fan of traditional businesses like this one, even the Oracle of Omaha has to see that alternative energy poses an existential threat to the hydrocarbon energy industry.\nOr, perhaps he just sees the bigger picture. That is, it will take several more years before the world reaches \"peak oil,\" (the point at which daily consumption of crude starts to permanently decline), and it will take several more decades before demand for oil becomes so modest that the business becomes untenable. Goldman Sachs says the planet's oil consumption won't reach its apex until 2034, while Chevron rival ExxonMobil predicts that even as far down the road as 2050, more than half of the world's energy needs will still be met by oil, or by the natural gas that's often found in conjunction with crude.\nTranslation: There's still plenty of money to be made in this business, and there will be for a long while.\nMuch of this money will be passed along to Chevron shareholders in the form of dividends, which is just fine by Buffett. Newcomers will be plugging into it while the stock's forward-looking dividend yield stands at a healthy 4.3%. A $5,000 investment will get you just under 132 shares.\n3. American Express\nFinally, add American Express(NYSE: AXP) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy right now if you're looking to put $5,000 to work in some quality companies for the long haul. That $5,000 will get you a bit more than 15.5 shares.\nBerkshire Hathaway didn't buy any American Express stock with its most recent round of purchases. Why would it? Through decades' worth of its own slow-and-steady growth paired with the attrition of other major holdings, American Express is now Berkshire's second-biggest holding, worth $48 billion. That's nearly 22% of the credit card company itself, and 16% of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio.\nYou might not want to buy (proportionally speaking) quite as much of the company as Buffett has. But you may still want to buy some for yourself for the same reason Buffett has stuck with this trade for as long as he has. That is, it's a well-run company with a surprisingly well-defended moat.\nOn the surface, it's just another credit card name, in the same vein as Mastercard and Visa, two other companies Berkshire owns, by the way. That's not what American Express is, though. Whereas Visa and Mastercard are only operators of payment networks that serve credit card issuers, American Express is both the issuer and the payment network. This arrangement provides the company with a great deal of cost-effective flexibility.\nBut even this distinguishing detail doesn't do American Express full justice. It might be more accurate to describe American Express as a perks and rewards program manager that operates its business around card-based payments. That's why some of its customers are willing to pay up to almost $700 per year in exchange for credits toward digital entertainment, ride-hailing, discounted hotel stays, and access to private airport lounges.\nThese paid-for perks, of course, also mean most of American Express' cardholders are at least a little affluent, and therefore mostly unfazed by economic headwinds that might stymie other consumers' spending, or their ability to make their payments. The numbers say as much anyway. Despite inflation and other economic headwinds blowing at this time, the company's second-quarter revenue grew 9% year over year to a record-breaking figure of $17.9 billion. Adjusted earnings jumped 17% from $3.49 per share to $4.08, extending a lengthening growth streak that was only recently -- and only temporarily -- interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nucor right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nucor, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nucor wasn’t one of them.

The same technology powering ChatGPT and image generators is now helping fraudsters write phishing emails, clone voices, and impersonate bank employees with terrifying precision.\nThis isn't a theoretical risk. It’s happening. Every day.\nAnd banks and credit unions are squarely in fraudsters’ crosshairs.\nIn recent months, we’ve seen a sharp rise in AI-enabled scams targeting financial institutions.\nIn December, 2024 the FBI issued an alarming alert about deepfake schemes and AI-generated voices being used to fool family, friends, and financial institutions.\nAccording to the Federal Trade Commission, Americans lost over $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, which marks a significant increase of about 25% to 35% compared to 2023 —a record—and experts believe that AI played a major role in the increase. And Bloomberg reported last year that banks are being tested by new fraud techniques that combine social engineering with synthetic identities generated by AI.\nBanks: scrambling to keep up with fraudsters\nSimply put, it’s getting harder to tell what’s real, and that’s exactly what bad actors want.\nIn my conversations with CTOs and CIOs at banks & credit unions across the country, I hear the same concern over and over: \"We’re seeing attack types we’ve never faced before—deepfakes, voice scams, AI-driven synthetic IDs—and we’re scrambling to keep up.”\nMany of these institutions are staffed by smart, experienced professionals. But they’re under-resourced, under-staffed, and increasingly under siege.\nLarger banks have started pouring resources into AI detection systems. JPMorgan Chase is investing in proprietary models to flag suspicious behaviour in real-time. But smaller institutions? They often can’t afford to build in-house AI teams. A 2024 survey from the American Bankers Association found a startling unfamiliarity with AI.\n“While roughly 97% of respondents polled on how familiar they were with AI said they were either very or somewhat familiar with the tech, only 74% had some understanding of the difference between the two main forms of AI,” per the ABA’s survey of 127 financial institution executives. “26% had no understanding whatsoever.”\nThat’s a vulnerability. Fraudsters know it.\nThey’re testing defences at the edges: Launching deepfake video scams on unsuspecting branch staff. Sending phishing texts that use perfectly mimicked language from internal memos. One credit union CTO I spoke with described a spoofed email so convincing, it fooled a veteran employee into initiating a wire transfer. The email wasn’t just written well. It was trained on years of past emails from the organisation—scraped, compiled, and mimicked by an AI.\nA new battlefield-and the only playbook will not cut it\nBut here’s the good news: Banks can fight back using the same weapon that’s being used against them.\nGenerative AI isn’t just a threat. It’s a tool. In the right hands, it becomes a powerful shield.\nAI-powered fraud detection platforms can now analyse transaction patterns in real-time, flag anomalies, and even simulate likely attack vectors before they happen. Behaviour-based models don’t just look for bad actors—they learn what “normal” look alike for a given account, user, or network. That means they’re better equipped to catch the outliers that traditional systems might miss.\nEven small institutions can deploy AI through cloud-based tools. Vendors are now offering scalable, subscription-based platforms tailored for community banks and credit unions. Some even specialise in training models on local data, making them uniquely sensitive to the patterns and rhythms of smaller financial ecosystems. You don’t need a PhD in machine learning to get started—you just need the will to act.\nThe point isn’t to replace people. It’s to augment them. To empower your frontline staff, your compliance officers, and your fraud teams with better tools. With faster response times. With early warnings that give you a chance to act before the money disappears.\nOf course, no system is perfect. Fraud is a moving target. But not deploying AI because you can’t afford perfection is like refusing to lock your doors because the thief might pick the lock anyway.\nA moment of reckoning – and a moment of opportunity\nSmall banks and credit unions have always thrived by putting community first—by offering trust, relationships, and service that big banks can’t replicate. Protecting those relationships now means investing in the tools that can keep them safe.\nDon’t wait until an AI-generated voice fools your teller. Or a synthetic identity opens an account and vanishes with a six-figure loan. Start exploring your options today.\nIn my experience, there are at least three main qualities to look for when your CTOs and CIOs are deciding which anti-fraud AI tool to employ:\nAI-Native Threat Detection: Choose vendors that don’t just tack on AI—but build their fraud prevention solutions around real-time, AI-powered behavioural analytics, anomaly detection, and synthetic media recognition to identify deepfakes, voice clones, and evolving scam patterns.\nRapid Integration & Interoperability: Look for platforms that can be deployed quickly and integrate seamlessly with existing core banking systems, CRMs, and KYC tools. The ability to adapt fast is critical as fraud tactics evolve faster than ever.\nExplainability & Human-in-the-Loop Oversight: The best vendors provide transparent AI models with clear audit trails and human verification checkpoints—giving compliance teams insight into why a transaction was flagged and ensuring regulators stay on your side.\nAI in fraud management at banks enables real-time detection of suspicious transactions by analysing patterns and anomalies in vast datasets. Machine learning models continuously adapt to evolving fraud tactics, improving accuracy and reducing false positives.\nThe banking industry must look at AI-powered hybrid fraud detection solution that combines the strengths of rule-based engines with the adaptability of AI-driven models. At its core, the system identifies discrepancies between traditional rules (e.g., “3-in-30” transaction velocity checks) and AI predictions, using these gaps as a learning opportunity. When the AI model fails to flag a fraud that the rule engine catches, the discrepancy is logged, analysed, and used to synthetically generate new, realistic fraud-like transactions. These synthetic examples are then injected back into the training pipeline, allowing the AI to retrain and improve its generalisation over time.\nThe key innovation lies in its self-correcting feedback loop—an automated mechanism where the AI learns from its own mistakes without requiring constant human intervention. Through iterative training and synthetic data augmentation, the system demonstrates increasing accuracy, precision, and recall with each retraining cycle. This approach allows it to detect subtle and evolving fraud patterns that static rules often miss, making it an ideal foundation for a future-ready, intelligent fraud detection platform suitable for real-time banking environments.\nBeyond that, train your teams; run tabletop simulations; ask hard questions: What would we do if a scammer spoofed our CEO’s voice? How would we know?\nThe fraudsters have swords. But we have shields. We just need to lift them.\nAI isn’t just part of the problem. It can be the solution.\nThe time to act is now.\nAnoop Gala is the Senior Vice President, Head of Financial Technology Services Infinite Computer Solutions\n\"Turning swords into shields: Why–and how–banks must fight AI-powered fraud management\" was originally created and published by Retail Banker International, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

While management raised its earnings per share outlook for the full year, the lack of an upside revenue guide as well pressured the stock in after-hours trading. Revenue in the fiscal 2026 second quarter increased 21% year over year to $1.17 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $1.15 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 6% to 93 cents in the three months ending July 31, beating the 83-cent estimate, LSEG data showed. Why we own it Cybersecurity is a must-have for companies in the digital age. Led by co-founder and CEO George Kurtz, CrowdStrike is one of the best there is (along with fellow Club name Palo Alto Networks ). The company specializes in endpoint protection through its AI-native platform called Falcon. Competitors: Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet , SentinelOne , Microsoft Portfolio weighting: 2.8% Most recent buy: March 10, 2025 Initiation date: Oct. 16, 2024 Bottom line CrowdStrike put together a great quarter. In addition to revenue and adjusted EPS beats, the company posted record second-quarter net-new annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $221 million, which was approximately $19 million more than the consensus estimate. Net-new ARR growth was an acceleration that happened a quarter ahead of the expected schedule. Management expects growth to pick up even more during the back half of the company's fiscal year. In simple terms, net-new ARR is a way to show how fast a company's recurring revenue base is growing. It's a great way to measure the health of a subscription-based company, and CrowdStrike management believes ARR is the best leading indicator of the business. The only blemish to the quarter was the underwhelming revenue guide for the third quarter and full fiscal year. CrowdStrike trades at a premium multiple, so we're not shocked to see the stock get scrutinized in extended trading. Some of the miss may be due to conservatism, but what's really happening here is a deviation of about $10 million to $15 million per quarter tied to the company's customer commitment packages (CCP). CrowdStrike gave its customers some \"freebies\" to maintain high retention rates, reduce churn following the July 2024 global IT outage, but the program also resulted in significant adoption of its platform. CrowdStrike sees this $10 million to $15 million per quarter negative impact persisting through its fiscal 2026 fourth quarter before subsiding. CRWD 5Y mountain CrowdStrike 5 years Just over a year ago, CrowdStrike's botched software update caused problems for computers around the world. After an initial stock drop after the incident, the company worked really hard to keep its customers, with great success and a stock that climbed to an all-time high last month. Shares of cybersecurity companies have come off the boil in recent weeks due to Fortinet and Check Point getting hammered after reporting. Palo Alto, our other portfolio cyber stock, delivered a beat and raise last week. Those shares, which jumped on earnings, have been recovering from a terrible selloff around its $25 billion CyberArk announcement. CrowdStrike moved off its after-hours lows after management said the fiscal second quarter results increased their conviction in achieving at least 40% year-over-year net-new ARR growth for the back half of the fiscal year, which would bring its ending ARR growth to more than 22%. Revenue left more to be desired, but management's explanation of the lingering impacts from its CCP program, as well as its bullish outlook of the future, helped the stock recover some of its post-market losses. Still, shares have been volatile in after-hours trading. At one point, they traded as low as about $390, only to swing back above $400 as the earnings call progressed and eventually settled at nearly $405, or just over 4% lower from Wednesday's closing price. The move extends what's been a disappointing stretch this summer. After closing at a record high of $514 of July 3, CrowdStrike shares have dropped roughly 20% when factoring in the after-hours action. Given this fall from the highs and the after-hours drop on what we view as strong results, we are upgrading the stock to our buy-equivalent 1 rating. We kept our price target on the stock at $520. Commentary CrowdStrike's financial results were all better than expected. We mentioned the top and bottom line beat earlier, but the company also delivered total ARR growth of 20% year over year and record free cash flow for its fiscal second quarter. Behind the strong results was continued adoption of CrowdStrike's Falcon Platform through Falcon Flex. The industry is moving to this idea of a platform or a one-stop shop for all cybersecurity needs with the same company. Palo Alto is putting its effort behind a version of this, calling it platformization. CrowdStrike's Flex subscription model allows customers to consolidate their security solutions through a flexible licensing agreement. Total Flex customers now exceed 1,000 thanks to the 220 new customers added in the quarter. Those are leading to some decently sized deals with the average Flex customer representing more than $1 million of ending ARR. The Falcon Flex model allows customers to achieve a low total cost of ownership while optimizing security by letting them swap one security module for another as needed. Not only are more customers signing up to the Flex model, they are also \"re-flexing\" or re-upping to more security modules and consolation at a high rate, providing management with conviction in their net-new ARR outlook. On artificial intelligence, companies and organizations of all sizes will depend on CrowdStrike's best-in-class solutions even more. Bad actors are growing more sophisticated by the day, and advances in AI are introducing new threats that enterprises must defend against. \"Model creation and AI development happen in the cloud and in the data center. AI adoption happens at the endpoint on the computing device itself. And AI access happens by users with human and increasingly non-human machine identities. CrowdStrike secures each of these attack surfaces,\" CEO and founder George Kurtz explained on the earnings call. CrowdStrike also announced this evening the acquisition of a company called Onum, which it believes will improve its next-gen SIEM capabilities. SIEM stands for security information and event management. Guidance For full-year fiscal 2026, CrowdStrike management left its revenue outlook essentially unchanged, nudging up the low end by $5 million. It now sees full-year revenue in the range of roughly $4.75 billion to $4.81 billion. However, the company raised its adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $3.60 to $3.72 from its prior outlook of $3.44 to $3.56. The new outlook is above the consensus of $3.52. For its 2026 fiscal third quarter, the current quarter going on right now, CrowdStrike's revenue guidance at the midpoint was $1.213 billion, a bit below the $1.228 billion consensus. But adjusted earnings per share are expected to be 93 cents to 95 cents, which is a beat versus the consensus of 91 cents. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CRWD, PANW.

Lawyers for Monarez said she was \"targeted\" for \"protecting the public over serving a political agenda.\"\nMeanwhile, four other top health officials at the CDC announced Wednesday they were quitting the agency. That includes Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who said he could no longer serve because of the \"weaponizing of public health.\"\nThe loss of those respected leaders and efforts to oust Monarez follow a string of measures by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – a prominent vaccine skeptic – to overhaul federal health agencies and change immunization policy in the U.S. That includes mass firings, gutting a key government vaccine panel, canceling studies on mRNA shot technology and hiring those with like-minded views.\nKennedy has a long track record of making misleading and false statements about the safety of vaccine shots, but in his current role, he wields enormous power over the agencies that regulate the immunizations and determine both who can get them and which ones insurance plans should cover.\nDr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the leadership overhaul at the CDC represents Kennedy's \"failed leadership and reckless mismanagement,\" adding that he has a \"blatant disregard for science and evidence-based public health.\"\nThe agency is also reeling from funding cuts and an Aug. 8 attack by a gunman at its headquarters in Atlanta.\nSome health policy experts said the leadership exodus could further erode the public's trust in an agency that is responsible for detecting disease outbreaks and guiding state and local health departments when needed.\n\"This has to be seen on top of a raft of ways that CDC has been weakened and undermined, maybe irreversibly,\" Lawrence Gostin, professor of public health law at Georgetown University, told CNBC.\n\"Throughout all of those years, CDC has been independent and the jewel in the crown of American science. That's literally all crumbling as we speak,\" he said. \"This is almost the definition of politics undermining science.\"\nTop official highlights vaccine concerns\nDaskalakis was among the officials to explicitly highlight concerns with the views held by Kennedy and his staff, which he said challenged his ability to continue in his role at the agency.\n\"I am unable to serve in an environment that treats CDC as a tool to generate policies and materials that do not reflect scientific reality and are designed to hurt rather than to improve the public's health,\" Daskalakis said in his resignation letter, which was posted on X.\nHe said the CDC's recent changes to the adult and children's immunization schedule \"threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people.\"\nIn May, Kennedy said the CDC removed Covid vaccines from the list of shots recommended for healthy pregnant women and children. An updated guidance days later said shots \"may\" be given to those groups.\nDaskalakis said the data analyses that supported the change have \"never been shared with the CDC despite my respectful requests to HHS and other leadership.\" He also said HHS circulated a \"frequently asked questions\" document written to support Kennedy's decision without input from CDC subject matter experts, and that it cited studies \"that did not support the conclusions that were attributed to these authors.\"\nOn Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the latest round of Covid vaccines only for those at higher risk of serious illness, marking another shift in policy around those shots since the pandemic began.\nShares of Covid vaccine makers dipped on Thursday. Moderna's stock fell more than 3%, while shares of Pfizer fell around 2%.\nThose companies and other drugmakers have been bracing for changes to vaccine and public health policy since Trump first named Kennedy as his pick to lead HHS in November. The CDC's leadership shakeup only adds to the uncertainty in the pharmaceutical industry, which is also grappling with Trump's drug pricing policies.\nKennedy tried to distance himself from his previous views about vaccines and other health policies during his Senate confirmation hearings back in January, claiming that he isn't \"anti-vaccine\" and would not make it \"difficult or discourage people from taking\" routine shots for measles and polio.\nBut some of Kennedy's recent efforts appear to reflect his vaccine-critical views. For example, Kennedy in August argued that mRNA vaccines – the technology used in Covid shots – are ineffective and advocated for the development of other jabs that use other \"safer\" platforms.\nYears of research support the effectiveness of mRNA Covid vaccines, and the technology is now approved for use in shots against respiratory syncytial virus.\nThreat to public health\nAs changes roll through the CDC, concerns over a threat to public health and protocol are growing.\nDaskalakis slammed the means by which HHS and other CDC leadership have communicated major policy changes. For example, Kennedy announced he was firing the entirety of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices – a panel of vaccine advisors to the CDC – through an X post and op-ed \"rather than direct communication with these valuable experts,\" Daskalakis said.\nHe said he believed there would be an opportunity to brief Kennedy on key topics such as measles, avian influenza and the approach to the respiratory virus season. But Daskalakis said seven months into the new administration, no CDC subject matter expert from his center had briefed Kennedy.\n\"I am not sure who the Secretary is listening to, but it is quite certainly not to us,\" he said. \"Unvetted and conflicted outside organizations seem to be the sources HHS use over the gold standard science of CDC and other reputable sources.\"\nDr. Debra Houry, who also resigned Wednesday from her post as the CDC's chief medical officer, similarly said that senior leaders \"never were able to brief the Secretary\" on any of the issues the agency deals with.\n\"The CDC scientists are top notch and excellent,\" she told MSNBC in an interview. \"What we would actually have preferred was to have more interactions with the secretary.\"\nHoury added that \"over the past few months, things at the CDC have been really difficult when it comes to having science and data driven decisions.\"\nAs longtime experts leave the CDC, the threat of infectious diseases is growing. While measles cases are ticking up in the U.S. again, bird flu is spreading in cattle. The first human case of the flesh-eating parasite \"New World screwworm\" has been detected in the country.\nThe departures could \"make our public health less assured,\" Benjamin of the American Public Health Association said.\nHe said the leadership disruption also raises concerns about the nation's ability to detect and respond to an emerging infectious disease spreading because the CDC is the \"glue that holds\" individual doctors and state and local health departments together.\n\"I am worried that we won't know in time, and that we'll be chasing that disease for far longer than we should,\" Benjamin said.\nBenjamin said he has \"little confidence\" that the Trump administration will find someone \"highly competent\" with relevant experience to replace Monarez.\n\"It obviously all has enormous implications for the health and well being of the public, and enormous implications around the finances of our nation,\" he said. \"Prevention and wellness saves us money, and public health is the best buy.\"","content_hash":"727e64dfc504af0b607c7c0ba904d4e1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7843,"method_rank":0}

That same year, brewing giant Whitbread acquired the business for £19m.\nOver the decades that followed, Whitbread turned Costa into a high street behemoth that generated annual sales of £1.3bn from 3,000 stores – eventually selling out to Coca-Cola when the business was arguably at its peak.\nNow, that wave of optimism has faded away.\nUnveiling its global financial results for 2024, Coca-Cola said a 3pc decrease in coffee sales was “primarily due to the performance of Costa Coffee in the United Kingdom”.\nThe latest available standalone accounts for Costa also show sales rose to £1.2bn in 2023, lagging behind where they were in 2019.\nHowever, as well as battling dwindling popularity, Costa’s problems have also been compounded by rising costs, with the price of coffee hitting record highs in 2024.\n“It’s very susceptible to movements in raw material prices, very susceptible to labour prices and very rent-dependent in terms of the locations,” says Hamish Renton, managing director of food & drink consultancy HRA Global.\n‘Victim of Reeves’\nLike other retailers, Costa has also been hit over the past year by Rachel Reeves’s Budget, as her National Insurance (NI) tax raid dramatically increased employment costs.\nAccording to Black, this may be one of the factors in Coca-Cola trying to offload the business.\n“Costa is an absolute victim of Rachel Reeves,” he says.\n“Payroll costs have absolutely rocketed with the National Living Wage and NI contributions. You’ve then got higher energy costs overall and [coffee shops] are quite energy-intensive businesses.\n“You can see why Coke might not necessarily want to plough a lot more money into it.”\nNews of a potential sale comes as Costa has been subject to scrutiny for raising prices following the surge in inflation post-Covid.\nAgainst this backdrop of soaring costs, Costa has found itself between a rock and a hard place – losing out to cheaper rivals and more premium competitors such as Gail’s.\n“They’re losing ‘coffeephiles’ who are prepared to pay a lot for coffee and food, as well as those people who are either making their own or going to somewhere cheaper like Greggs, or McDonald’s,” says Black. “They are in a bit of a vice.”\nA medium latte in Costa’s Victoria store comes in at £4, while a large costs £4.35.\nAcross the street, a small Greggs latte costs £2.50 while a large is £3.25. A few doors down, a McDonald’s latte costs just £1.99.\nPeter Martin, founder of hospitality consultancy Peach 20\/20, also claims Costa has struggled to improve its stores at a time when more interesting options are available.\n“They’ve got that solid Middle England base, but it’s not very exciting,” he says.\n“The coffee channel has, for many people, moved on,” adds Black. “All those independents, and indeed the likes of Gail’s have got more authenticity and provenance.”\nFood has also been an issue, says Black.\n“Caffè Nero, Costa and Starbucks are all pretty rank when it comes to food and you are overcharged for what you get,” he says.\n“Greggs, McDonald’s, Pret a Manger and Gail’s have a superior food assortment, and – maybe with the exception of Pret – more affordable coffee.”\nSupermarket push\nHowever, it has not been all doom and gloom under Coca-Cola, which has rolled out thousands of Costa vending machines across the UK’s convenience stores and petrol stations.\nThis helped to keep sales afloat while footfall in cafes dwindled. But some argue it also led to a loss of romance for the consumer.\n“What it offers in convenience and speed, it takes away in terms of that human interaction,” says Renton. “Part of the whole coffee experience is for us to slow down, isn’t it?\n“In the independent sector, there is that ‘honouring’ of the beans. The beans are front and centre, the origin story, the provenance, the roasting history, some tasting notes. That is what hooks you in. It’s very analogous to wine or chocolate or cacao. There’s a romancing of the shopper.\n“Out of a machine, it isn’t romantic. And then you’ve got to get a little ticket and take it to the desk. It makes you feel like it’s 1988 and you’re buying cheese.”\nBlack adds that, given the brand’s near-ubiquity across Britain, opportunities to expand the business have been few and far between.\n“[Coca-Cola] actually acquired a very mature business, certainly in the UK,” he says, adding it is difficult to find “a gap in the street where there isn’t a Costa Coffee or a machine”.\nAt the time of its acquisition, Coca-Cola was pushing to become what it called a “total beverage company”, pushing outside its core soft drinks business into new markets.\n“Hot beverages are one of the few segments of the total beverage landscape where Coca-Cola does not have a global brand,” Quincey said at the time.\nAs well as giving it a foothold on the high street, much of Coca-Cola’s interest hinged on being able to grow the Costa brand in big retailers, while also appealing to shoppers at home.\nShortly after Coca-Cola bought the business, it unveiled the first range of canned supermarket coffees under the Costa brand.\nYet Coca-Cola’s attempts to conquer supermarkets fell flat.\nIn 2024, volume sales of its canned and bottled coffee drinks suffered a decline of almost 25pc, according to NIQ data, prompting the company to go back to the drawing board for a new recipe.\n“The business is still a good business but it’s not quite delivered on the different verticals of growth that we were hoping to accelerate much quicker, the ready-to-drink coffee, the Express machines at home,” Quincey admitted last month.\n“It hasn’t become an at-home product, which I think they definitely wanted it to become,” Peter Martin adds.\nAll of which suggests it may be easier for the soft drinks giant to cut and run rather than attempt a costly turnaround.\n“Looking at it from Coca-Cola’s point of view is very different from perhaps a UK investor. Costa actually, in one sense, is a great British success story.”\nRenton agrees that Costa could fare better in different hands.\n“It’s a relatively decent business,” he says. “It’s steady.

The company designs application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that power hyperscale data centers, offering custom, cost-efficient solutions for targeted AI workloads, in contrast to Nvidia’s GPUs, which are built for broader, more general-purpose computing.\nAfter a tough 2024, this year has been even more punishing for Marvell, with shares sliding by double digits due to a mix of sector-wide turbulence and company-specific setbacks. A broader tech selloff tied to trade tensions and slowing global growth piled on early pressure, leaving investors hesitant despite Marvell’s positioning in the AI supply chain.\nConcerns have also emerged that the company may miss out on designing Amazon’s (AMZN) next-generation Trainium AI chips, raising questions about its competitive position in the fast-moving AI market. Moreover, the volatility has persisted even after Marvell beat expectations in its most recent earnings release. That said, as the company gears up to release its fiscal 2026 Q2 earnings report on Aug. 28, here is a fresh look at this struggling chipmaker.\nAbout Marvell Stock\nThrough close collaboration and transparency with its customers, Marvell has been shaping the next generation of enterprise, cloud, automotive, and carrier infrastructure. For over 30 years, the company’s semiconductor solutions have enabled the world's data to be moved, stored, processed, and secured, meeting today’s demands while paving the way for tomorrow's technologies.\nEarlier in August, Marvell completed the sale of its Automotive Ethernet business to Infineon Technologies for $2.5 billion in an all-cash deal. The unit had been expected to generate between $225 million and $250 million in revenue during fiscal 2026, but with the divestiture now finalized, its contribution to Marvell’s results going forward will be limited.\nThe sale enables Marvell to sharpen its focus on core areas, such as data infrastructure and AI-focused chips, while streamlining operations and strengthening its balance sheet. Yet despite the company’s strong focus on high-growth areas within the semiconductor landscape, its stock performance paints a grim picture.\nWith the company’s market capitalization of around $62.9 billion, shares of this chipmaker have come crashing down nearly 42% from its January high of $127.48. So far this year, the stock has nosedived a notable 32%, sharply lagging behind the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has posted a modest 9.7% gain over the same stretch.\nEven after the recent sell-off, Marvell’s stock remains pricey, trading at 34 times forward earnings, which is well above the sector median of 23.5 times. However, it sits below its own five-year average of 38.7x, suggesting that while still a premium name, it’s somewhat more reasonably valued compared with its historical levels.\nMarvell’s Q1 Earnings Recap\nMarvell’s shares dipped nearly 5.6% on May 30, following the release of its fiscal 2026 first-quarter earnings on May 29, but the decline had little to do with the company’s performance. Chip stocks broadly fell that day amid external pressures, including President Donald Trump’s claims that China had violated its trade deal with the U.S. and reports that the administration planned to expand sanctions on the country’s tech sector.\nComing back to Marvell’s Q1 earnings performance, the company posted a record $1.9 billion in revenue, up an impressive 63% year-over-year (YoY) and slightly ahead of analyst estimates. Driving growth was the Data Center revenue of $1.4 billion, which not only accounted for 76% of total revenue but also increased 76% compared to the same quarter last year.\nMarvell attributed this strong performance to rising production of its custom AI chips and robust demand for electro-optics products that support AI and cloud infrastructure. While the Data Center segment clearly stole the spotlight, other areas of the business also delivered solid contributions, highlighting the company’s broad-based momentum.\nFor instance, Enterprise Networking generated $178 million, marking a healthy 16% YoY increase, while Carrier Infrastructure experienced a breakout moment, with revenue soaring a remarkable 93% to $138 million. On the profitability side, adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.62, representing a striking 158% jump from the prior year and slightly beating Wall Street’s $0.61 estimate.\nMarvell closed the quarter with $886 million in cash and equivalents against $4.2 billion in total debt, maintaining a solid financial position. The company also prioritized returning capital to shareholders, distributing $52 million in dividends and repurchasing $340 million of its own stock during the first quarter, underscoring its commitment to rewarding investors while navigating strong growth.\nMarvell Investors, Mark Your Calendars for August 28\nMarvell is set to release its fiscal 2026 second-quarter earnings after market hours on Thursday, Aug. 28. With AI-related sales already driving the bulk of its Data Center revenue and expected to expand further, the company appears well-positioned for sustained long-term growth, reinforcing its role as a key player in AI and cloud infrastructure.\nFor Q2, management anticipates the company’s revenue to be around $2 billion, plus or minus 5%. GAAP gross margin is projected between 50% and 51%, while non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be higher, ranging from 59% to 60%. Additionally, non-GAAP earnings per share are forecast at $0.67, with a margin of error of $0.05.\nMeanwhile, analysts are also eyeing an ambitious outlook, projecting triple-digit growth in the bottom line, with EPS estimated at $0.51 for the quarter. Looking further ahead, analysts expect Marvell’s fiscal 2026 EPS to surge roughly 134% YoY to $2.15, before climbing another 31.6% to $2.83 in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for MRVL Stock?\nAs Marvell approaches its Q2 earnings, Morgan Stanley expects the company to deliver stronger-than-anticipated guidance, despite the recent divestiture of its Automotive Ethernet business and ongoing uncertainty around Amazon’s Trainium chip. Analysts led by Joseph Moore note that upside could come from optical products, which they see as more durable and higher-margin than the ASIC business, even as estimates were slightly lowered to account for the automotive divestiture.\nWhile the Trainium 3 discussion may continue to create noise, Morgan Stanley expects steady sequential ASIC revenue, hitting $2 billion for the year, bolstered by a strong ramp in optical products. Overall, Wall Street appears highly bullish on MRVL, with the stock carrying a consensus “Strong Buy” rating.\nOf the 33 analysts offering recommendations, a majority of 24 analysts are giving it a solid “Strong Buy,” two suggest a “Moderate Buy,” and the remaining seven give a “Hold.” MRVL’s average analyst price target of $92.86 indicates 25% potential upside from the current price levels. The Street-high price target of $149 suggests an even greater leap of 99% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

A big part of the rally is investor excitement for sustained artificial intelligence (AI)-driven growth and adjustments to Federal Reserve policy that open the door to interest rate cuts.\nWhile investor sentiment and macroeconomic factors undoubtedly influence short-term price action, the stock market's long-term performance ultimately boils down to earnings.\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will report its second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings on Aug. 27 after market close. Here's why expectations are high, and why the \"Ten Titans\" stock could single-handedly move the S&P 500.\nNvidia's profound impact on the S&P 500\nThe Ten Titans are the largest growth stocks by market cap -- making up a staggering 38% of the S&P 500.\nNvidia is the largest -- with a 7.5% weighting in the index.\nThe other Titans are Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Broadcom, Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix.\nAside from its value, Nvidia is also a major contributor to S&P 500 earnings growth.\nMegacap tech companies influence the value of the S&P 500 and its earnings. And since many of the top earners are growing quickly, the market arguably deserves to have a premium valuation.\nSince the start of 2023, Nvidia added roughly $4 trillion in market cap to the S&P 500. But it also added over $70 billion in net income -- as its trailing-12-month earnings went from just $5.96 billion at the end of 2022 to $76.8 billion today. That's like creating the combined earnings contribution of Bank of America, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Costco Wholesale in the span of less than three years.\nNvidia's value creation for its shareholders, and the scale of just how big the business is from an earnings standpoint, is unlike anything the market has ever seen. But investors care more about where a company is going than where it has been.\nNvidia's unprecedented profit growth\nExpectations are high for Nvidia to continue blowing expectations out of the water. Over the last three years, Nvidia's stock price rose after its quarterly earnings report 75% of the time. Analysts have spent the last few years flat-footed and scrambling to raise their price targets as Nvidia keeps raising the bar. It looks like they aren't making that mistake any longer -- as near-term forecasts are incredibly ambitious.\nAs mentioned, Nvidia's trailing-12-month net income is $76.8 billion, which translates to $3.10 in diluted earnings per share (EPS). Consensus analyst estimates have Nvidia bringing in $1 per share in earnings for the quarter it reports on Wednesday and $4.35 for fiscal 2026. Going out further, analyst consensus estimates call for 37.8% in earnings growth in fiscal 2027, which would bring Nvidia's diluted EPS to $6 per share.\nBased on Nvidia's current outstanding share count, that would translate to net income of $107.7 billion in fiscal 2026 and $148.5 billion in fiscal 2027. Unless other leaders like Alphabet, Microsoft, or Apple accelerate their earnings growth rates, Nvidia could become the most profitable U.S. company by the time it closes out fiscal 2027 in January of calendar year 2027. These projections strike at the core of why some investors are willing to pay so much for shares in the business today.\nThe key to Nvidia's lasting success\nNvidia can single-handedly move the stock market due to its high weighting in the S&P 500. However, its influence goes beyond its own stock, as strong earnings from Nvidia could also be a boon for other semiconductor stocks, like Broadcom. But the ripple effect is even more impactful.\nIn Nvidia's first quarter of fiscal 2026, four customers made up 54% of total revenue. Although not directly named by Nvidia, those four customers are almost certainly Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. So strong earnings from Nvidia would basically mean that these hyperscalers continue to spend big on AI -- a positive sign for the overall AI investment thesis.\nHowever, Nvidia's long-term growth and the stickiness of its earnings ultimately depend on its customers translating AI capital expenditures (capex) into earnings -- which hasn't really happened yet.\nCloud computing hyperscalers are spending a lot on capital expenditures (capex) as a percentage of revenue -- showcasing accelerated investment in AI. But eventually, the ratio should decrease if investments translate to higher revenue.\nInvestors may want to keep an eye on the capex-to-revenue metric because it provides a reading on where we are in the AI spending cycle. Today, it's all about expansion. But soon, the page will turn, and investors will pressure companies to prove that the outsize spending was worth it.\nThe right way to approach Nvidia\nAlmost all of Nvidia's revenue comes from selling graphics processing units, software, and associated infrastructure to data centers. And most of that revenue comes from just a handful of customers. It doesn't take a lot to connect the dots and figure out just how dependent Nvidia is on sustained AI investment.\nIf the investments pay off, the Ten Titans could continue making up a larger share of the S&P 500, both in terms of market cap and earnings. But if there's a cooldown in spending, a downturn in the business cycle, or increased competition, Nvidia could also sell off considerably. So it's best only to approach Nvidia with a long-term investment time horizon, so you aren't banking on everything going right over the next year and a half.\nAll told, investors should be aware of potentially market-moving events but not overhaul their portfolio or make emotional decisions based on quarterly earnings.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The stakes were so high for the company that its CEO, John Ketchum, penned an open letter pleading with Congress to preserve clean energy incentives.\nBut a surprising thing has happened since the bill's passage: NextEra Energy shares have ticked up as part of a broader rally for clean energy stocks.\nDespite the setback from Washington, NextEra Energy is well positioned to outperform markets and continue increasing its dividend for years to come. Here's why.\nA large pipeline of early- and late-stage projects\nNextEra Energy got a break from the Treasury Department on Aug. 15 when it released guidance saying that companies would be eligible for remaining clean energy tax credits, even with less than 5% of the total project cost paid by the July 5, 2026, deadline. Beginning physical work will be enough to qualify.\nSolar stocks soared on the news, with NextEra shares rallying roughly 5% that day. That's in part because NextEra already has a 7.2-gigawatt backlog in solar projects, and Ketchum is well aware of what's needed to qualify for those tax credits. As he put it in the late July second-quarter 2025 earnings call: \"... our view is pretty simple and pretty straightforward. The begin construction term has been around for well over a decade.\"\nFor context, a gigawatt of electricity is enough to power 750,000 homes. NextEra is still planning an expansion of clean energy projects that could serve perhaps 10 million new customers in the years ahead.\nFor instance, the company's Florida Power & Light business, the largest electric utility provider in Florida, plans to add 8 gigawatts of solar and battery storage capacity by 2029. The company is also planning to expand its nuclear generation portfolio, and is in talks with regulators on restarting Iowa's only nuclear power plant, the Duane Arnold Energy Center, to add to its four nuclear units in Florida.\nAnd while Ketchum didn't specify exactly how many of these clean power projects already meet the \"begin construction\" standard to qualify for the credits, the company has almost a year to bring them to that threshold.\nA healthy, growing dividend while investors wait for more growth\nIn addition to having one arm of its business, Florida Power & Light, provide electricity to millions, NextEra Energy's other business, NextEra Energy Resources, is one of the largest energy infrastructure developers in the United States. With America's energy demand set to skyrocket thanks largely to power-hungry artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, rising demand for electricity will be an important tailwind for the company.\nOf course, only time will tell whether NextEra can lay claim to those lucrative tax credits by next July. And the \"inflection point\" that Goldman Sachs is warning of in electricity demand from the AI revolution is still a few years away. But as investors wait for surging electricity demand to boost NextEra's earnings and, ultimately, share price, the company looks well positioned to continue its decades-long streak of increasing dividends.\nIn the Q2 earnings call, Ketchum reiterated his expectation that NextEra will hike its dividend by around 10% next year. The company has now raised its dividend every year since 1994, including a 10% increase this year.\nAs you can see below, the company has maintained double-digit percent dividend growth in each of the last four quarters, which roughly tracks its earnings and revenue growth (the exception, a 17% dip in revenue in Q2 2024, came as higher interest rates ramped up NextEra's borrowing costs).\nData source: Company quarterly filings.\nNextEra's payout ratio of 75% means that the company already pays out 75% of its earnings in dividends, which is higher than income investors like to see. However, the company grew earnings by 25% year over year last quarter, which suggests earnings growth is exceeding the rate of dividend hikes.\nAll told, NextEra has raised its dividend by 629% in the 31 years since 1994, including annual hikes during the collapse of the dot-com bubble, the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and the pandemic-era lockdowns. Not only is that well above the 117% rate of inflation seen in the same time frame, but it's also a testament to management's resolve to reward shareholders.\nThe utility giant could be a good bet\nBased on this history, strong fundamentals and earnings growth, and the imminent boost from supercharged demand for electricity in the age of AI, NextEra Energy is well positioned to deliver market-beating returns in the years ahead, both in the form of continued dividend increases and capital appreciation.\nWhile the \"big, beautiful bill\" that's now law was \"tough,\" in Ketchum's words, he also called it \"constructive\" in that management now knows the rules that energy companies must abide by -- and now NextEra can play to win. This company, which has beaten analysts' earnings expectations for each of the last four quarters, may surprise a lot more people in the years ahead. NextEra stock could be a worthwhile buy for income-focused investors who also want for market-beating capital appreciation over time.\nShould you buy stock in NextEra Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

I guess we'd have to unwind them.\"\nA federal appeals court ruled Friday that most of Trump's global tariffs were illegal, reaffirming an earlier ruling by the Court of International Trade and saying he exceeded his authority in using emergency powers to impose them. The judges, however, allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the case moves through the appeals process.\nOther members of the administration are making backup plans, however. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he is confident the Supreme Court will back Trump's use of the 1977 emergency law to impose broad tariffs but said the administration is working on a Plan B.\nIn any case, the \"reciprocal\" tariffs Trump unveiled on dozens of US trade partners (which you can see in the graphic below) now face legal limbo.\nMeanwhile, Trump said he is not considering lowering tariffs on India, a week after the US doubled duties on its imports to 50% in response to India's purchase of Russian oil.\nWhen a reporter asked if he might roll back some of the tariffs, Trump replied, \"No.\"\nTrump has amped up criticism of the trade relationship between the US and India, saying it has been heavily one-sided for decades. Trump's comments came as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has embarked on bids to strengthen ties with China and Russia as relations with the US have deteriorated. On Tuesday, Trump suggested he wasn't considering lowering tariffs on India.\nThe US trade deficit widened to its largest amount in four months in July as companies raced to import products in order to front-run President Trump's latest round of broad-based tariffs.\nBloomberg reports that the goods and services trade gap grew nearly 33% from the prior month to $78.3 billion, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The value of imported goods increased 5.9% in July, driven by industrial supplies, consumer goods, gold, and capital equipment. Exports also ticked higher during the month.\nThe swings in trade this year have created volatility in gross domestic product (GDP) readings as well, as frequent policy changes have led some importers to pull forward or pause shipments. Following the release of trade deficit data, Goldman Sachs lowered its third quarter GDP growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.7%.\nIf Trump's biggest tariffs get thrown out, companies could get a refund — but not consumers\nWhile companies absorb tariff costs and pass some of them along to consumers, President Trump has been touting the amount of money US tariffs are bringing the government.\nBut if the Supreme Court upholds a lower court's ruling that the tariffs are illegal, thereby striking them down, the government could have to refund the taxes it has collected on imported goods. That would mark a huge reversal in Trump's trade policy — but not one that is likely to land consumers any cash back.\nIndia looking beyond US for pharma exports amid tariff tensions\nIndia is seeking to boost drug exports to Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, in an effort to reduce dependence on the US market amid tariff concerns, Reuters reports.\nChina just made its latest deliberated move in its trade dance with the Trump administration.\nBloomberg reports:\nChina started imposing levies on additional US optical fiber imports, after a six-month investigation found that American companies had circumvented its anti-dumping measures.\nThe duties, ranging from 33.3% to 78.2%, took effect Thursday Beijing time on “certain cut-off shifted single-mode optical fiber” from the US, according to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.\nAmong the companies subject to the new duties, Corning Inc. (GLW) now faces a 37.9% levy, OFS Fitel LLC is at 33.3% and Draka Communications Americas Inc. has a 78.2% duty.\nThe probe was the first anti-circumvention investigation China has ever initiated, the Mofcom said in a separate statement published Thursday.\nCarney sends envoy to DC after 'constructive' Trump call\nBloomberg reports on some progress around talks between the US and Canada:\nAs a reminder, some goods from Canada face 35% US tariffs. But many goods are exempted under the US-Canada-Mexico trade agreement, leading Carney to boast that the effective 5.5% rate is the \"lowest average tariff of any country in the world.\"\nBut sectoral duties — and overall certainty — remain a concern:\nBolsonaro's coup trial speeds ahead as his son tries to keep Trump engaged\nBloomberg has an interesting nugget in a story today about former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's coup trial.\nEduardo Bolsonaro, the former president's son, took a leave from Brazil's Congress and moved to the US to lobby President Trump on his father's cause. He wasn't pushing for — and didn't expect — the US leader to respond by levying 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports.

Much cheaper money now would likely stoke a boom, a weaker US dollar, and materially higher inflation.”\nThe pressure on long-term interest rates isn’t unique to the US. They’ve been propped up in the UK, France and other countries by investors’ worries about the same combination of high government debt loads and increasingly unpredictable politics.\nBut the crosscurrents of Trump’s return to the White House have posed their own challenges.\nDuring last year’s presidential campaign, when investors started betting on his victory, 10-year Treasury yields rose sharply even as the Fed started pulling its benchmark overnight rate back from a more than two decade high. That’s because investors were anticipating that the Republican’s tax-cut and deregulation agenda would add fuel to what was, at the time, a surprisingly resilient economy.\nSince Trump has taken office, though, the Fed has been on hold as his unpredictable trade war upends the economic outlook, spooks foreign investors and threatens to push up consumer prices. When Trump’s April tariff rollout unleashed one of the worst bond selloffs in recent decades, sending yields surging, Trump paused them, saying the markets were “getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.”\nHe has since reimposed the import levies and his trade policy has continued to remain in flux. At the same time, his tax-cut bill is set to add more than $3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, which will add to the stockpile of debt unless his tariffs are kept in place by future presidents and wind up providing enough revenue to offset the cost.\n“The US has to issue a tremendous amount of debt in order to fund its deficit,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management.\nHe said that overhang is adding to concerns about growth and inflation. “As a result, I would expect that long rates will remain higher and more volatile than the market expects.”\nWhile Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the administration’s cost-cutting and pro-growth policies would eventually pull down the 10-year yield — which he has held up as a key benchmark of success — that hasn’t happened yet. While shorter-term yields have dropped on anticipation of another round of Fed cuts, the 10-year’s rose as high as 4.31% Tuesday before settling around 4.26%, roughly where it was at the time of Trump’s election in November. The 30-year yield edged up to 4.92%.\nThat marked a relatively muted response to Trump’s announcement that he was firing Cook from the Fed over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, a move that Cook has vowed to fight in court. The Fed said it will abide by the outcome of the case.\nWhat Bloomberg Strategists say...\n“The attempted removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook dominated traders’ thinking Tuesday. Higher term premium at the long end of the curve has been the biggest fallout so far. However, if efforts to gain political control of the the Fed gain more traction, we should expect a larger reaction both in premiums and inflation expectations.”\n—Edward Harrison, Macro Strategist, Markets Live\nSome of the market’s response reflects expectations that the courts will protect the Fed’s independence. Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Investment Management, pointed to the “institutional safeguards that protect and jealously guard” the Fed from political pressure. Even Cook’s replacement, she said, would unlikely alter the Fed’s near-term trajectory.\nMoreover, with job growth slowing and Powell now telegraphing that another round of rate cuts may start as soon as next month, traders are already pricing in five quarter-point reductions through the end of next year. Powell, a Trump appointee whose term as chair ends in May, has also said he wouldn’t step down from his role and has sought to insulate the central bank from politics.\nYet, a mounting effort by Trump to reshape the Fed would almost certainly keep bond markets on edge — and long-term debt yields elevated.\nMarkets have grown accustomed to the Fed’s autonomy, with recent presidents going out of their way not to be seen as influencing the central bank’s policy.\nIts insulation from electoral politics hasn’t been an issue for investors since the early 1970s, when the Nixon administration sought to keep rates low by pressuring then Fed Chair Arthur Burns. That has served as a cautionary tale ever since, given the subsequent surge of inflation that many blamed on the central bank for caving to the president.\n“The unspoken Fed mandate is don’t be Arthur Burns,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “You don’t bow to political pressure.”\n(Updates with rise in 30-year yield in 15th paragraph.)","content_hash":"8c0ee284a39881332c78439e92f6d6fb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6597,"method_rank":0}

The $4 trillion chipmaker’s quarterly financials have become a litmus test for the AI boom—and, by extension, for the whole stock market. Constituting 8% of the market-cap-weighted S&P 500 index and with an unrivaled grip on the chips that power generative AI, Nvidia sees its results treated more like a macroeconomic indicator by Wall Street than as a report card on a single company. The earnings announcement has even become a cultural phenomenon complete with watch parties.\nInvestors are bracing for the company’s latest quarterly results due after Wednesday’s market close, with trading in Nvidia options implying expectations that the stock will move 6%, up or down—equal to a $260 billion change in Nvidia’s market value.\nIn the three months since the company last gave investors a quarterly update, back in May, Nvidia’s stock has surged 35%. But the tension surrounding what is already the most closely watched earnings event of the season has been ratcheted up by recent jitters over what some worry is a dangerous financial bubble in AI-related stocks. And uncertainty about Nvidia’s China business continues to loom large.\nWall Street analysts are looking for Nvidia’s Q2 revenue to surge 53% year over year to $46 billion, at the high end of Nvidia’s guidance, with earnings per share of $1.01. Data center sales, the crux of Nvidia’s business, are expected to come in close to $40 billion. But with Nvidia’s shares having gained so much in recent months, a miss on Wednesday, or cautious guidance tied to China restrictions, could send the stock plummeting.\nNvidia may remain one of the greatest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, but a critical part of the company’s business has also become a geopolitical football as the U.S. and China compete for technological dominance. In April, Washington began requiring export licenses for the company’s H20 chips—stripped-down versions of Nvidia’s top-of-the-line AI chips that were specifically designed to comply with the U.S. export controls that took effect in late 2022 and were tightened again in 2023. Those tighter export licenses forced the company to take a $4.5 billion charge in Q1 tied to unsold inventory and purchase commitments.\nFrom there, things only got more complicated for Nvidia’s China business. After Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang visited President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the White House said it would permit the company to sell H20s after all. Nvidia applied for export licenses but faced extensive delays, thanks to the tougher U.S. stance and Chinese buyers hesitating to commit to purchasing. Then, earlier this month, Nvidia and AMD struck a deal with the Trump administration to grant licenses in exchange for a 15% revenue-sharing arrangement on China chip sales.\nBut as shipments of H20 chips resumed, China began discouraging companies from buying them, expressing concerns that the information Nvidia was asking customers to submit for U.S. government review could contain sensitive information. The Chinese government also reportedly claimed it had found evidence that Nvidia’s chips might contain back doors that would allow U.S. spy agencies to extract data on how they were being used. In addition, comments from U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about providing China with Nvidia’s “fourth-best chips” were considered “deeply insulting” by Chinese officials, according to the Financial Times.\nFinally, last week Huang announced in Taipei that Nvidia has started winding down production of the H20 chip and begun work on a more powerful successor, saying the company was working on offering a “new product for AI data centers,” modified to reduce some of its performance, as required by the United States. He said he was seeking the Trump administration’s approval to sell the chip.\n“It’s up to, of course, the United States government,” Huang said. “And we’re in dialogue with them, but it’s too soon to know.”\nAs a result of all the uncertainty, analysts predict Nvidia will not allude to China revenue in the earnings report.\n“I suspect they will not count, nor forecast China revenue; there’s too much uncertainty involved,” said Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI Research.\nJack Gold, founder and principal analyst at J. Gold Associates, told Fortune that Nvidia now has two primary groups to please: stockholders and the Trump administration. “They’re caught between a rock and a hard place,” he said. “It’s a really strange situation we’re in now where the government in the U.S. actually has their hands into the pockets, into the wallets of these companies.”\nBeyond geopolitics, Nvidia faces another challenge: growing unease that the AI boom is starting to look like a bubble. This would strike at the heart of Nvidia’s business and its stratospheric valuation—the company trades at more than 40 times its projected earnings—which rely on ever-growing demand for its powerful GPUs. Nvidia’s growth is heavily concentrated in a handful of cloud giants, including Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, as well as highly funded AI startups like OpenAI. If those companies slow spending, Nvidia could suddenly lose its biggest buyers.\n“I do believe that everyone’s concerned about an AI bubble,” said Freund, though he added that those concerns have lasted for three years already. He did not, he emphasized, think it would pop now. “I think there are still two to five years of growth left,” he said.\nGold agreed, saying there were “at least several quarters, if not a couple of years of good profits” for Nvidia, but he cautioned, at some point, if the market crashed, that money spent on chips would go away.\n“It concerns me,” he said. “This time, I’m sure the earnings will still be great—[Nvidia is] selling everything they can build at ridiculously inflated prices, which is fine, if you can get away with that.” But from a broader market perspective, he added, the massive AI data center build-outs “can’t go on forever.”\nThat’s why, said Freund, Huang is actually working to get investor attention to shift from the data-center-centric view to other areas of Nvidia’s business, including its automotive and robotics work: “That’s his game right now, how to get investors to shift to a more holistic view of AI as it moves out of the data center and into the real world.”\nBut those investors are likely more interested in the here and now—what tomorrow’s numbers show. Let the watch parties begin.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","content_hash":"b026197db725e34dd190e95cfd50d244","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6535,"method_rank":0}

Tariff tensions are increasing, and consumer spending patterns are changing.\nIn the face of these headwinds, retailers that can strike a balance between scale, value, and innovation will be best positioned to capitalize on the next phase of growth. Two household names that sit at the top of this competitive market are Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).\nBoth have different strategies for growth, digital transformation, and customer engagement. Let’s find out which retail stock offers the best opportunity now.\nThe Case for Walmart Stock\nWith a market cap of $766.6 billion, Walmart remains the largest retailer in the world by revenue. Its size remains its most significant advantage, bringing it closer to joining the exclusive $1 trillion market cap club. The retail giant operates around 10,500 stores and clubs in over 19 countries.\nWalmart’s stock is up 5.8% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) gain of 9.6%.\nIn the second quarter, total revenue increased by 4.8% to $177.4 billion, while adjusted earnings per share increased by 1.5% to $0.68. The company’s e-commerce segment stood out once more, delivering 25% global growth, with Walmart and Sam’s Club outperforming expectations. Walmart increased comparable sales by 4.6% in the U.S., with strong performance in the apparel, media and gaming, and automotive categories. Sales increased by 10.5% in international markets, driven by strong performances in China, Walmex, and Flipkart.\nWalmart is continuing to reshape its business model by expanding into higher-margin areas. Membership income increased by 15%, while global advertising increased by 46%, with contributions from VIZIO. Walmart’s continued investment in artificial intelligence (AI) was a key highlight of the quarter. Walmart is developing AI-powered “super agents” to transform its operations and customer experience.\nBesides being a value stock, Walmart’s defensive nature also appeals to passive income investors during uncertain economic conditions. The company has earned the title of Dividend King by consistently increasing dividends over the last 53 years. Its dividend payout ratio of 32% suggests the dividends are sustainable for now.\nOverall, on Wall Street, Walmart stock has earned a “Strong Buy” rating. Out of the 37 analysts covering WMT stock, 30 have a “Strong Buy” recommendation, six rate it a “Moderate Buy,” and one recommends it is a “Hold.” Its average price target of $112.92 suggests upside potential of 17.5% from current levels. Its Street-high estimate of $127 implies potential upside of about 32.2% in the next 12 months.\nThe Case for Target Stock\nValued at $44.1 billion, Target is a large American retail chain that sells a wide range of products, including clothing, groceries, electronics, home goods, and household essentials, both in physical stores and online. It is known for its low prices, trendy merchandise, and easy one-stop shopping experience.\nOn Aug. 20, along with the second quarter results, Target announced that the company is entering a pivotal new chapter as long-time CEO Brian Cornell prepares to hand over the reins to Michael Fiddelke, the chief operating officer, effective Feb. 1, 2026. The leadership change occurs at a time when the retail giant is dealing with tariff volatility and consumer shifts. A sudden C-Suite leadership change, combined with an internal transition, spooked investors, causing Target’s stock to plummet. Target’s stock is down 29% so far this year.\nDuring the earnings call, incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke acknowledged, “We’re not realizing our full potential right now.” He outlined three priorities for returning Target to profitable growth: establishing merchandising authority, improving the guest experience, and leveraging technology and speed. In the second quarter, net sales fell 0.9% year on year to $25.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were $2.05, down from $2.57 the previous year, with management attributing the majority of the decrease to tariffs and inventory costs. Looking ahead, Target reaffirmed its full-year guidance for low single-digit comp declines and adjusted EPS of $7 to $9, compared to $8.86 in 2024. The consensus earnings estimate is $7.40 per share for the year.\nTarget also has a reputation as a Dividend King, having increased dividends for 54 consecutive years, with the most recent increase of 1.8% to $1.14 per common share. It has a dividend yield of 4.8%, which is higher than both Walmart’s yield of 0.98% and the consumer staples sector average of 1.89%. Its payout ratio of 57.1% is also reasonable, leaving room for expansion.\nDuring the earnings call, the current CEO also reminded investors of Target’s structural advantages, which include nearly 2,000 well-located stores in all 50 states and a $31 billion owned brand portfolio. In addition, the company has partnerships with world-class companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX), and it operates one of the largest loyalty programs in the country, Target Circle.\nThese assets, combined with a profitable and growing digital business, provide a solid foundation for Target’s next phase under new leadership.\nOverall, Wall Street holds a cautious stance on TGT stock, rating it a “Hold.” Of the 35 analysts covering the stock, eight analysts rate it a “Strong Buy,” with three rating it a “Moderate Buy,” 19 rating it a “Hold,” one suggesting a “Moderate Sell,” and four rating it a “Strong Sell.” The average target price of $108 implies upside potential of 11% from current levels. Plus, its high target price of $135 suggests the stock can rally as much as 39% over the next 12 months.\nWhich Retail Stock Is the Better Buy?\nWalmart appears to be the safer, more reliable option. Its grocery dominance, investments in AI and automation, and expanding advertising business serve as strong growth drivers while remaining resilient during downturns. Furthermore, the company is a consistent dividend payer. For risk-averse investors looking for consistency, Walmart remains the clear choice.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Pulte says he also referred a third property to the Department of Justice as well.\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\nCook has sued Trump and the Fed, saying the Republican president's unsubstantiated claim she engaged in mortgage fraud before taking office did not give him legal authority to remove her, and was a pretext to fire her for refusing to lower interest rates\nHere is what is known, and not known, about the mortgages.\nPROPERTIES\nCook's annual financial disclosure, filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, shows one mortgage for an investment property and two mortgages for personal residences. All were dated 2021, when the Georgia native was a professor at Michigan State University and before her May 2022 confirmation by the Senate to the Fed Board of Governors.\nThe loans were originated a little more than a year into the COVID-19 pandemic when interest rates had plunged due to the Fed's efforts to support the economy during the health crisis. Tens of millions of homeowners refinanced existing loans or obtained new mortgages during that period.\nTWO 'PRIMARY' RESIDENCES, ONE 'INVESTMENT' PROPERTY\nCook's mortgage paperwork does identify two different properties as her primary abodes.\nA public records search identified a $203,000 mortgage in Cook's name in Washtenaw County, Michigan, dated June 18, 2021, and a $540,000 mortgage, also in her name, in Fulton County, Georgia, dated July 2, 2021. The mortgages were originated by the University of Michigan Credit Union for the Michigan property and Bank Fund Credit Union for the Georgia property.\nSpokespersons for the two credit unions did not reply to requests for comment.\nDocumentation for both contains an identical occupancy clause that requires the borrower to, within 60 days, \"occupy the property as borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy.\"\nCook also took out a $361,000 mortgage, originated by Bank Fund Credit Union, for a condo in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 7, 2021, Middlesex County records show. The Cambridge property has a \"second home\" rider that requires it be held primarily for use by the owner and not regularly rented out.\nAll three mortgage documents specify that the occupancy requirements stand \"unless lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist which are beyond borrower's control.\"\nIt is not known if Cook obtained such an agreement, if there were extenuating circumstances, or whether or for how long she occupied any of the properties.\nWHY DOES IT MATTER?\nMortgages obtained for primary residences and second homes can come with cheaper financing than those for investment properties, which have a higher default rate and are typically subject to tighter underwriting by lenders.\nA study published in 2023 by the Philadelphia Fed found indications of occupancy fraud - misrepresenting a property as owner-occupied when it is used as a rental property - in 3% of mortgages from 2008-2017. It was not known if Cook's properties were intended to be owner-occupied.\n\"The real question to ask here was, was there any misleading of lenders,\" Cornell University Law Professor Robert Hockett said. \"If the lenders knew... and they were able to factor that in in order to risk-price the lending, then that's above board.\"\nTHE BORROWING RATES\nIn fact, the mortgage rates Cook obtained were higher than the prevailing national averages at the time. It is not known when Cook locked in her mortgages, but typically borrowers fix their rate a month or two before the purchase.\nCook's financial disclosure shows one personal residence mortgage of $100,001-$250,000. Though the address is not specified, it is the same 15-year borrowing term as on her $203,000 Ann Arbor, Michigan, mortgage.\nFrom the beginning of April to early July, the national average for the 15-year rate ranged from 2.23% to 2.45%.\nCook's rate was 2.875%.\nHer financial disclosure identifies a second loan for a personal residence for $500,001-$1 million. Again the address is not listed but the value and term of the loan matches her $540,000 mortgage on her Atlanta, Georgia condominium.\nThe national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage ranged from 2.93% to 3.04% from April 15, 2021 to July 1, the day before she signed the mortgage, Freddie Mac data shows.\nCook's rate was 3.25%.\nCook identifies a third mortgage of $250,001-$500,000 as an investment\/rental property with a 15-year term that matches her $361,000 mortgage on her Cambridge, Massachusetts, condo. The national average for that term ranged from 2.19% to 2.45% in the two months before she signed the mortgage.\nCook's rate was 2.5%.\nFraud, Cornell's Hockett said, is generally \"either affirmatively misrepresenting, or failing to disclose...such as to lead someone into taking a risk they wouldn’t otherwise risk, or give you something other than they would otherwise give you...the very fact that they didn't give her an advantageous rate suggests they were informed.\"\nWHY THOSE CITIES?\nPublic records show that Cook first bought the Ann Arbor home in 2005, when she first got her job as a professor at Michigan State University in nearby East Lansing, and indicate that the 2021 mortgage was a refinance. MSU transitioned to remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in March 2020, and returned to mostly in-person teaching in the fall of 2021.\nCook was born in Georgia and graduated from Spelman College in Atlanta. It is not known when or for how long she lived in Atlanta. Cook taught at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 1997 to 2002.\n(Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Dan Burns and Chizu Nomiyama)","content_hash":"1b1ec3fd2e6c2b024cc3399db15d625f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6367,"method_rank":0}

But with today’s volatile job market, some people’s careers are tripping at the finish line.\nTake the case of Brian. He’s been fired at the age of 69, just one year before he was set to retire. According to a survey by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies, nearly six in 10 retirees (58%) retired sooner than planned, and among these 43% cited employment reasons such as job loss (16%), organizational changes (16%), job unhappiness (14%), and retirement buyout (9%).\nThough he has ample savings, Brian's unsure what his termination means for his 401k, and whether he should start collecting Social Security right away. Should he work with an employment lawyer to try to get a larger severance payout? With so many questions, on top of the shock of being let go, his head is swimming.\nHere’s what he can do to sort out his surprise early retirement.\nBrian’s retirement savings\nFidelity says that at 67, you should have 10 times your annual salary saved. Luckily, Brian is in a decent place financially. Between his 401(k) and other investment accounts, he has a little over a million dollars. By contrast, Vanguard says the average retirement account balance of those 65 and older is just $299,442.\nBrian has already created a conservative investment portfolio, to ensure that market fluctuations don’t affect his balances too dramatically. Moreover, he has worked with his financial advisor to plan a rough budget for his retirement, and was feeling comfortable about his financial future until his sudden loss of employment.\nHere’s what Brian needs to know about his legal entitlement to his 401(k), how his Social Security may be impacted, and whether he can collect employment insurance or a severance package.\nAre you being treated fairly?\nIt’s important to note that in at-will employment states, your employer can fire you for any (legal) reason at any time, even after you’ve announced your retirement. If Brian has any doubts whether his termination was legal, he should speak to an employment lawyer who may be able to help him bring an action against his former company.\nIllegal reasons for firing an employee include discrimination based on factors like age and ethnicity, retaliating against employees for exercising their legal rights or being a whistleblower reporting unsafe or illegal work practices, or because of a medical condition.\nWhile there are no state or federal laws making severance pay mandatory, it is usually customary for salaried employees, and the size may depend on your position and how long you've been at the company. Whether you should negotiate for more depends on your unique circumstances, and you should carefully read the severance agreement before you sign it. Also consider speaking to an expert.\n\"If you are terminated, it is important for you to go back and re-read your initial offer letter and employment contract,\" says Gardner Employment Law, adding that the terms of separation could be useful when negotiating for your severance agreement. \"Inclusion of hard to understand legal jargon in the terms of your severance package may be a tactic used by your employers to get you to sign an inadequate severance agreement.You may have been wrongfully terminated or a victim of discrimination harassment, and an employment expert could help you get compensated for your employer’s wrongdoing.\"\nWhat happens to your 401(k) and Social Security?\nYour contributions to your 401(k) plan are yours, even if you are fired. Since Brian has been with his company for many years, he is likely fully vested in the program, and therefore also owns his full share of his employer’s contributions.\n\"When you retire, you can leave your 401(k) in the current plan, roll it over into an IRA or take a lump sum distribution,\" explains BlackRock. \"Each option has benefits and drawbacks, so evaluate your financial situation and goals. Consider fees, investment options and liquidity needs. Understanding tax implications is crucial, and consulting a financial advisor can help you minimize your tax burden and comply with IRS rules, such as required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting at age 73.\"\nBrian can apply for Social Security right away and receive more than his full retirement benefit amount since at 69 he is older than his full retirement age. However, he would be able to maximize his monthly benefit by waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security.\n\"Our research indicates that waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security can boost benefit checks by 24% compared to claiming at full retirement age for those born in 1960 or later,\" said J.P. Morgan in the press release for its Retirement Insights Report. \"On the other hand, starting benefits early at age 62 means receiving only 70% of the full retirement amount, resulting in a permanent reduction. It's crucial to understand the benefits and tradeoffs of claiming decisions.\"\nSince Brian is so near retiring, he may elect not to apply for unemployment. However, he would be eligible provided his termination was without cause. He should be aware, however, that any severance he collects counts as income, and may impact the payout he receives from the federal program.\nDeciding what to do next\nUnfortunately, getting fired when you’re close to retirement is fairly common. A study from ProPublica and the Urban Institute found that 28% of stable, longtime employees sustain at least one damaging layoff by their employers between turning 50 and leaving work for retirement.\nBrian may well decide to hang up his work tools, even if it’s a decision that carries negative emotions. His primary concern after making his financial arrangements should be to take care of his health insurance coverage, whether he opts for Medicare or a private insurer. He may also choose to find part-time work to keep himself busy and bring in extra income.\nWith a solid retirement fund in place Brian can feel easy in his mind about his future financial security. If you are fired without a solid base of savings to rely on, be sure to speak to a financial advisor to help you understand your options for retirement or to plan how to return to work.","content_hash":"676665b8d8fddf5ed2fbd5d554c7da22","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6253,"method_rank":0}

At the same time, given crypto's volatility, investors who are just starting out should probably not stray too far from the established blockchains.\nThe simplest solution is a two-asset crypto stack, comprised of Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) as a scarce store of value to anchor the portfolio, and Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) to get exposure to the growth of programmable finance. Bitcoin sets the floor, whereas Ethereum gives you upside tied to utility and developer adoption. Here's how those pieces fit together, and how to set expectations so you can actually stick with them as you gain wisdom (and hopefully wealth, too).\nStart with securing your supply of the scarcer asset\nFor long-term wealth compounding, buying a scarce asset like Bitcoin should be a higher priority for your limited pool of capital than investing in riskier plays, including Ethereum.\nAs you've probably heard by now, Bitcoin's protocol specifies creation of a maximum of 21 million coins of which 19.9 million already exist. Additionally, there are periodic events called halvings that occur roughly every four years that reduce the rate of new supply hitting the market.\nThe upshot is that if you buy Bitcoin and hold it forever, those who want to purchase it in the years after you did will, on average, be competing for a smaller float, which means that they will likely be paying higher prices for significantly less coin. As an aside, it's a lot easier to build the discipline you need for truly long-term holding when you see this process start to play out in your favor, but that tends to take at least one halving cycle.\nBut knowing the above doesn't eliminate risk or make it easier to hold through deep downturns, at least not until you've survived a couple without capitulating and selling.\nKnow that even as the anchor of your crypto portfolio, Bitcoin is volatile and subject to shifting and unpredictable policy winds. It can and will drop sharply and stay down for longer than feels comfortable. The more enthusiastic you get about buying it when prices are higher, the more depressed you will be when the bear market rolls around.\nTherefore, the investor's edge with this asset is behavioral. Use small, steady buys as part of a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, keep a multiyear horizon, and size the position so your plan survives the inevitable rough patches.\nDon't let your emotions interfere with the plan, and remember, the value engine keeps working whether you refresh the price or not.\nThe growth leg is important too\nWhereas Bitcoin's growth is derived from people agreeing that it's valuable and scarce, Ethereum's growth depends on it remaining a platform for smart contracts and programmable finance.\nSmart contracts are just programs that live on the blockchain and power decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, tokenized funds, and more. As a result, Ethereum remains the largest venue for DeFi by total value locked (TVL), a useful proxy for on-chain economic activity. As capital tends to be sticky once it arrives in a chain, it's a reasonable bet that Ethereum will continue to be the leader.\nOperating smart contracts or decentralized applications (dApps) requires holding Ethereum's native token, Ether, to pay for gas (user) fees, as well as any fees associated with the particular program being used. That creates a structural reason for investors, users, and developers to buy and hold it. It's also possible to stake Ether to gain a yield, which is another incentive for the asset to be purchased and held for long periods.\nSeparately, Ethereum's growth potential is large because it's a platform for an entire ecosystem of different segments, which themselves can experience growth and drive demand for the native token, or potentially attract capital inflows to the chain.\nEther also has distinct supply mechanics, though they're not as favorable to long-term holders as Bitcoin's. Its supply can shrink when network activity burns more fees than new issuance creates. For all of 2023 and 2024, net supply growth was negative, but the effect is not guaranteed to be consistent, nor is it guaranteed to create significant reduction in the circulating supply over time.\nBut its risks differ from Bitcoin's. Gas fees can and do spike during peak demand, and the ecosystem's breadth means having a large surface area for hacks, scams, regulatory problems, buggy applications, and failed projects.\nThe practical approach\nFor new investors, there's an easy way to apportion your portfolio in these two assets.\nTreat Bitcoin as the lower-risk core, and Ethereum as the higher-growth complement. A simple starter mix is 70% Bitcoin and 30% Ethereum, rebalanced annually if desired. Understand that, despite what many people might tell you, there is no rush to accumulate either of these assets because they will both be around for many years to come.\nThe most important thing is to invest consistently. The second most important thing is to hold through volatility and downturns. Once you've mastered both, you will be well ahead of most of the pack.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Here's how Gap performed in the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: 57 cents vs. 55 cents expected\n- Revenue: $3.73 billion vs. $3.74 billion expected\nThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $216 million, or 57 cents per share, compared with $206 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier.\nSales rose to $3.73 billion, up slightly from $3.72 billion a year earlier. Sales came in lower than expected and so did comparable sales. During the quarter, comparable sales rose 1%, weaker than the 1.9% rise that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.\nWhile Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy all saw comparable sales rise during the quarter, Athleta dragged down the company's overall performance with comps down 9%.\n\"Clearly, Athleta is a powerful brand in the active space, being the number five brand in the space, but we're disappointed in the quarter. We have moved away, if you will, from really distinctive performance roots,\" CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. \"We've paid a lot of attention, trying to court a new customer, and ultimately didn't have enough offerings for our core customer. As we balance that out, we've been very transparent to say it's a year of reset for us.\"\nLast month, Gap announced that Maggie Gauger, a longtime veteran of Nike, had been tapped as Athleta's next CEO — the third top executive hired to helm the brand in the last two years.\nThe company reaffirmed its fiscal 2025 net sales growth outlook and is continuing to expect revenue to grow between 1% and 2%, in line with estimates of 1.6%, according to LSEG. For the current quarter, Gap is expecting sales to grow between 1.5% and 2.5%, better than the 2% that analysts had estimated, according to LSEG.\nTo offset the impact of tariffs, Gap is doing what other companies are doing: working with its suppliers, adjusting its sourcing, diversifying its supply chain and taking targeted price increases where appropriate.\nNotably, the company said it doesn't expect the annualization of tariffs to cause any further declines in operating income in 2026.\n\"As it relates to pricing, we're making targeted adjustments with pricing, as we always do. There isn't anything that we've done that is substantially different,\" Dickson said. \"We focus on making sure that we're presenting to our consumer the right value proposition, and ultimately want to make even more sure that we're sustaining the momentum and market share gains that our playbook has been performing.\"\nJust over two years into Dickson's tenure as Gap's CEO, the company is in a far different position. It's seen six straight quarters of comparable sales growth, it's sitting on a $2.2 billion cash pile and its brands are back at the center of culture and conversation.\nRecently, Gap launched its \"Better in Denim\" campaign featuring Katseye and Kelis's 2003 hit \"Milkshake.\" Dickson said the campaign has been a standout success, delivering 20 million views in the first three days, 400 million total views and 8 billion impressions. It's also the No. 1 search on TikTok, Dickson said.\n\"We could all acknowledge that Gap moved from what was a clothing retailer just a couple years ago, that was overly promotional and didn't have necessarily a strong voice from a merchandising perspective to consumers, and now today, it is a pop culture brand that's telling great stories, driving great merchandising initiatives and arguably shaping culture with some of the programs and products and marketing campaigns,\" Dickson said. \"This is proving that Gap is a powerful pop culture brand, and this is also what our playbook looks like when you get it right.\"\nThe campaign highlights the efforts Gap is taking to stay competitive in the crucial denim category, especially with Levi's recent partnership with Beyoncé and American Eagle's campaign with Sydney Sweeney. At a time when consumers are pulling back on nice-to-have products like new clothes and accessories, retailers have had to do more to cut through the noise and ensure they're resonating with consumers.\nStill, as the company continues to make strides in its turnaround plan, Wall Street has come to expect a lot, and Gap has had to work harder to beat expectations.\nDuring the quarter, its gross margin came in at 41.2%, behind expectations of 41.9%, according to StreetAccount.\nHere's a closer look at how each brand performed:\nOld Navy: Gap's largest and most important brand saw sales of of $2.2 billion, up 1% compared with last year. Comparable sales were up 2%, compared with expectations of up 2.2%, according to StreetAccount.\nGap: The namesake banner saw net sales of $772 million, up 1% compared with last year. Comparable sales were up 4%, compared with expectations of 4.1%, according to StreetAccount. Its the seventh consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth.\nBanana Republic: The safari-chic, business essentials brand saw net sales of $475 million, down 1% compared with last year. Comparable sales were up 4%, far ahead of expectations of 0.2%, according to StreetAccount.\nAthleta: The athleisure brand saw sales of $300 million, down 11% compared to last year. Comparable sales were down 9%. The brand's new CEO is looking to reverse that slump and reconnect with Athleta's core consumer.","content_hash":"81d65d8bcb32813f39338cf465e0a5c1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6206,"method_rank":0}

It expects earnings per share of $23.85 to $24.30, up from its previous range of $22.65 to $23.20.\nIt expects comparable sales, a metric that takes out one-time factors like store openings and closures, to grow between 2.5% to 3.5%, up from projections of as much as 1.5%. The company had raised its annual profit forecast and the upper end of its full year sales range in May.\nIn the company's news release, CEO Kecia Steelman said its outlook for the year \"reflects both the strength of our year-to-date performance and our caution around how consumer demand may evolve in the second half of the year.\"\nShares of Ulta gained about 3% in extended trading, after earlier hitting a 52-week during the regular session.\nHere's what the company reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $5.78. It was not immediately clear if that was comparable to the $5.08 expected by analysts.\n- Revenue: $2.79 billion vs. $2.67 billion expected\nIn the three-month period that ended August 2, Ulta's net income rose to $260.88 million, or $5.78 per share, from $252.6 million, or $5.30 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased from $2.55 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nBeauty has remained a hot category for consumers, even as they pull back or watch their spending in other discretionary categories. Yet that's fueled tougher competition for Ulta Beauty as specialty players like LVMH-owned Sephora, big-box retailers like Walmart and department stores like Kohl's have all bulked up their beauty businesses.\nFor investors, tariffs have been a closely watched challenge for retailers, too. Compared to other retailers, Ulta is not as directly exposed. Only about 1% of the company's merchandise last fiscal year was direct imports, then-CFO Paula Oyibo said in May on the company's earnings call. She said at the time most of Ulta's exposure to the higher duties was minor, such as store fixtures and supplies.\nEven in tumultous economic times, Steelman said beauty and wellness tend to fare better because they \"offer a unique sense of comfort and escape.\"\n\"Our insight suggests consumers continue to prudently manage their day-to-day spending and are watchful of pricing trends in response to tariffs,\" she said on the earnings call. \"At the same time, beauty enthusiasts tell us that they're prioritizing their beauty regimens and remain strongly engaged within the category.\"\nIn the second quarter, Ulta's comparable sales grew 6.7% year over year, more than double analysts' expectations, according to StreetAccount.\nCustomers visited more and spent more when they shopped on Ulta's website and in its stores compared to the year-ago quarter. Transactions rose by 3.7% and average ticket increased by 2.9%.\nUlta added new brands and products that drove purchases in the quarter, including more products from Sol de Janeiro, exclusive Korean beauty brand Peach & Lily and Shakira's hair care brand, Isima, Steelman said on the company's earnings call.\nPlus, she said, it's trying to reach more of its existing and prospective customers in new ways. It had an activation at the Coachella and Lollapalooza music festivals and was the official beauty retail partner of Beyonce's Cowboy Carter Tour.\nIn a growing number of Ulta stores, it is dedicating space to wellness-related products, such as supplements. It has opened a wellness shop in about 370 stores and plans to expand them to more stores this quarter, Steelman said.\nAlong with attracting more customers in the U.S., Ulta has looked internationally for growth. It announced in July that had acquired Space NK, a British beauty retailer, from Manzanita Capital. The deal allows Ulta to enter a new international market, since Space NK has 83 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\nUlta did not disclose the price of the acquisition, saying it funded the transaction with cash on hand and Ulta's existing credit facility and that it would not be material to financial results for the fiscal year.\nFor Ulta, Space NK offered a less expensive way to enter a new market, Steelman said. Its business, which will continue to operate independently, could offer learnings that could shape Ulta's strategy, she said. Compared to Ulta, its shops tend to be smaller, located on main streets in cities and sell primarily prestige beauty merchandise.\nThe company is expanding in other international markets, too. Ulta recently marked the soft opening of its first Ulta store in Mexico and it plans to open its first store in the Middle East later this year, Steelman said Thursday on the company's earnings call.\nUlta is also introducing a third-party marketplace, which Steelman said will launch in the third quarter. A growing number of retailers, including Best Buy, are launching the marketplaces a way to expand the mix of merchandise they carry without needing more store shelf space or buying more of their own inventory.\nAt the same time, Ulta recently announced the end of one of its efforts to expand reach. It cut ties with Target, which had opened mini Ulta shops in more than 600 big-box stores. The licensing deal, which will end in August 2026, allowed Target to sell a smaller and rotating assortment of makeup, skincare, hair care products and more that are carried by the full Ulta stores. Target carried those items on its website, and it staffed the shops.\nFor Ulta, however, the Target deal contributed little to its finances, Steelman said. Royalty revenue from the deal last fiscal year \"was well below 1% of net sales,\" she said on the company's earnings call.\nUlta is looking for a new CFO as well. The company's former CFO, Oyibo, left Ulta in late June after about a year in the role. Ulta has not yet announced her permanent successor.","content_hash":"4ab503c0415691037ab3030e7f06f691","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6177,"method_rank":0}

For many homeowners, the equity they’ve built can be a source of funding for their lives, from home renovations to debt consolidation. But accessing that equity through a home equity loan (HELoan) or home equity line of credit (HELOC) isn’t a decision to take lightly.\nDavid Kimball, CEO of Prosper Marketplace and a consumer credit expert with over 25 years of experience, shared his wisdom with GOBankingRates as part of our Top 100 Money Experts series. He’s seen countless homeowners make smart moves — and costly mistakes — when tapping into their home’s value.\n“Home equity can be a powerful tool — but only if you borrow with purpose and a clear repayment plan,” Kimball said.\nBefore you consider either option, Kimball says there are three important questions every homeowner must ask themselves.\nQuestion 1: Do I Need a Lump Sum or Flexible Access to Funds?\nThe first thing to figure out is how you plan to use the money. Do you need it all at once, or would you rather take it out bit by bit?\n“The biggest difference comes down to how and when you access the funds,” Kimball explained. “A HELoan gives you a lump sum upfront, typically with a fixed interest rate and predictable monthly payments. You receive all the money at once and begin repayment immediately.”\nHELoans work best when you know exactly how much money you need for one big expense — for example, renovating your kitchen and knowing it will cost $50,000, paying off credit cards, or covering a big medical bill.\n“Conversely, a HELOC is a revolving line of credit from which you can borrow as needed over a set draft period, usually five to 10 years,” Kimball said. “A bank or lender will provide you with a maximum credit line amount, and as you repay what you owe, the amount becomes available again.”\nHELOCs work like a credit card backed by your house. You borrow only what you need and pay interest on only that amount. This works better when you’re not sure exactly how much you’ll need or when you’ll need it, such as a home project that might cost more than expected or keeping money available for emergencies.\nQuestion 2: What’s My Repayment Plan — and Can I Afford It Long Term?\nThis question gets to the heart of what Kimball considers the biggest mistake homeowners make: “borrowing without a clear, sustainable repayment plan.”\n“It’s very easy to focus on the benefits of accessing cash, but remember: your home is the collateral,” he said.\nThe repayment structures differ between the two options. HELoans offer predictable fixed payments over a set term, making budgeting straightforward. You know exactly what you’ll pay each month and when the loan will be paid off.\nHELOCs are more complex. “Especially with HELOCs, people can get caught off guard when draw periods end and repayment begins — often with large, variable payments,” Kimball said.\nDuring the draw period (typically five to 10 years), you might pay interest on only what you’ve borrowed. But when that period ends, you enter the repayment phase, where you must pay both principal and interest on the full balance. This can create major payment shock if you’re not prepared.\nWhat’s more, most HELOCs have variable interest rates. “If you’re considering a HELOC, prepare for the possibility of rising interest rates and how it can impact your monthly payments,” Kimball advised.\nQuestion 3: Am I Borrowing With a Clear Purpose — or Just Because I Can?\nThis final question is all about the psychological aspect of home equity borrowing that, unsurprisingly, often gets overlooked.\n“Home equity can be a powerful financial tool, but it’s not ‘free money,'” Kimball said. “If used impulsively, these options can add unnecessary risks and financial strain.”\nKimball recommends being honest about your motivations. Are you tapping equity for:\nSmart purposes: Home improvements that add value, consolidating high-interest debt, covering genuine emergencies or funding education.\nQuestionable purposes: Lifestyle upgrades you can’t otherwise afford, vacations or general spending without a clear plan.\n“When used wisely, home equity products can help you build and protect your financial future,” Kimball said. “But it’s important to borrow with purpose.”\nChoosing the Right Option for Common Goals\nKimball breaks down how different financial goals align with each product:\nHome Renovations\n“For major, one-time home improvements with a defined budget, a HELoan’s fixed payments offer peace of mind. For phased projects, or if costs might fluctuate, a HELOC provides the necessary flexibility.”\nDebt Consolidation\n“If you’re looking to pay off existing high-interest debt with a single, clear payment, a HELoan is often the more straightforward choice due to its lump sum nature and fixed repayment.”\nEmergency Fund\n“While ideally covered by an emergency fund, a HELOC can serve as a valuable financial safety net for unforeseen costs, offering access to funds only if and when they’re needed.”\nThe Bottom Line\nBefore borrowing against your home’s value, Kimball’s advice is straightforward: “Do the math upfront. Look at how much money comes in, what goes out, and what you already owe — then make a realistic plan for paying it back.”\nKeep in mind that both options put your house on the line. You’ll usually get better interest rates than with other loans, but if you can’t make payments, you could lose your home.\n“It’s not about how much you’re borrowing — but how you plan to borrow,” Kimball explains.\nBy honestly answering these three questions, you’ll ensure you’re ready to make this major decision.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates’ Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

The rule makes it cheaper for consumers who buy products directly from international sellers.\nThe volume of these low-value shipments has swelled amid the rise of e-commerce, experts said.\nIn 2024, the U.S. received about 1.4 billion de minimis shipments, more than double the 637 million in 2020, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\nThe average de minimis shipment was about $48 in 2024, according to CBP data.\nMost of the shipments come from China, which accounts for about 60% of the volume, Sharad said.\nPresident Donald Trump ended the de minimis exemption for China in May. He's now doing the same for the rest of the world.\nCheap items bought online and shipped to consumers' doorsteps will be slapped with duties, whereas they'd previously applied just to packages over $800, Sharad said.\nAll shipments — including beauty products from Korea, leather shoes from Italy, kitchen knives from Japan — will be subject to additional fees and taxes, such as tariffs that the Trump administration has levied on most U.S. trading partners.\n\"For the consumer, it can be quite a big price increase,\" said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, whose research specializes in trade with China and global supply chains.\n'Pro-poor trade policy'\nThe actual price increase for consumers will depend on many factors such as country-specific tariff rates, duties the U.S. places on goods and manufacturing materials, and how businesses adjust pricing, economists said.\nHere's how the end of de minimis would impact some specific consumer goods, according to a FlavorCloud analysis:\n- $30 slippers (lightweight, premium cotton) from China would cost about $45, a 51% increase;\n- $37 nutritional supplements (plant-based, performance-formulated) from Canada would cost about $60, up 60%;\n- A $240 chef's knife (with wooden handle and white steel) from Japan would cost about $298, up 24%.\nPablo Fajgelbaum, an economics professor at University of California, Los Angeles, and Amit Khandelwal, an economics professor at Yale University, write that de minimis is a \"pro-poor trade policy.\"\nMore from Personal Finance:\nWealthy Americans are traveling to Europe to dodge tariffs on luxury goods\nWhy it may be time to diversify away from the S&P 500\nMore changes are ahead for student loan repayment plans\nAn end to the rule would disproportionately hurt low-income and minority households, which derive more of a financial benefit from the duty exemption than richer households, according to research they published in February.\n\"Most people [using the de minimis exemption] are people who were living on a budget and are concerned about prices,\" Lovely said. \"I think some people will just buy less.\"\nIt's not just consumers: Small businesses will also have to adjust to the new regime, Lovely said.\nIt puts more pressure on them when tariffs are already raising their costs for goods and manufacturing materials like steel and aluminum, she said.\nMore transparency for imports\nThe Trump administration argues that scrapping the de minimis rule will level the playing field for U.S. businesses and shore up national security.\nThe government currently has little insight on de-minimis shipments due to the simplified customs clearance procedures for them, attorneys at law firm Hogan Lovells wrote recently.\nThe rule has been exploited by bad actors to import counterfeit products, illicit drugs like fentanyl and other harmful goods, according to CBP officials.\nCollecting duties on more imports also raises federal tax revenue, economists said.\nHowever, beefing up oversight of these shipments creates a larger administrative burden and requires more manpower to screen packages — all of which come with an extra cost for the federal government, economists said.\nIt's unclear whether the additional tax revenue collected by the federal government will outweigh the extra costs, Lovely said. \"I don't think we'll ever really know.\"\nMeanwhile, postal services in Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, Switzerland, the UK and other European nations said recently that they'd suspend shipments to the U.S. amid confusion over questions like how customs duties would be collected.\n\"CBP has prepared extensively for this transition and stands ready with a comprehensive strategy, having provided clear and timely guidance to supply chain partners, including foreign postal operators, carriers, and qualified third parties to ensure compliance with the new rules,\" Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Trish Driscoll wrote in an e-mailed statement.\n\"As a result, CBP has collected more than $140 billion in total customs revenue\" from Jan. 20 through July 31, she wrote.\nWhile the trade system will eventually adjust, there may be delays and higher prices in the short term, economists said.\nThe near-term impact may be \"unavailability\" of certain items, especially with the end-of-year holidays approaching, said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale University Budget Lab and former chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Biden administration.\n\"I would not say this will have a large macroeconomic impact on the U.S.,\" Tedeschi said. \"That said, for certain people it will cause a great deal of headache,\" he added.","content_hash":"83b8ca8832d676bdc481967c36011855","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5808,"method_rank":0}

It now offers over 130 ready-made applications to help businesses in 19 different industries accelerate their adoption of AI.\nC3.ai stock was trading at around $29 on July 23, but it has since plummeted by more than 40%. On July 24, Thomas Siebel announced he plans to step down from his role as CEO for health reasons, and on Aug. 8, the company released a very disappointing set of preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2026 first quarter (which ended on July 31).\nC3.ai is scheduled to release its complete Q1 results on Sept. 3, and management will probably use the accompanying conference call to try and ease some investor concerns. Should investors buy C3.ai stock ahead of the upcoming report, or steer clear until the company's future is more certain?\nC3.ai offers a great value proposition for its customers\nDeveloping AI software from scratch requires significant financial and technical resources, which not every company can spare. C3.ai's readymade applications are a cost-effective alternative, especially because they can be customized to suit the needs of each individual business.\nFor manufacturers, the C3.ai Reliability application can predict when and how critical equipment might fail, so maintenance schedules can be adjusted as necessary. This reduces downtime by up to 50% and also increases efficiency. For banks, the C3.ai Anti-Money Laundering application improves the accuracy of suspicious activity identification by a whopping 200%, which significantly reduces compliance risks.\nC3.ai's applications are accessible through leading cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, so businesses can pair them with state-of-the-art computing capacity to achieve the necessary scale. Since businesses don't have to maintain their own data center infrastructure, this arrangement is extremely affordable.\nC3.ai's Q1 revenue likely fell way short of expectations\nAccording to management's guidance, C3.ai was expected to generate between $100 million and $109 million in revenue during the fiscal 2026 first quarter. Based on the company's preliminary results, it delivered just $70 million, representing a 19% decline from the year-ago period. If that number remains the same when the company releases its official Q1 results on Sept. 3 (which is likely), it would obviously be a major disappointment for investors.\nSiebel called the result \"unacceptable\" and attributed it to two things: First, a total restructure of C3.ai's sales and services departments had a disruptive effect on deal closures during the quarter, and second, Siebel says he was personally less involved than usual in the sales process because of his health issues.\nThe restructure is now complete, so it should no longer be a headwind, but only time will tell whether Siebel's absence will continue to hurt sales.\nC3.ai's disappointing Q1 revenue had significant consequences for the bottom line. The company's preliminary results showed a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net loss of almost $125 million, which is nearly double the amount it lost in the year-ago quarter. Management probably couldn't slash costs fast enough by the time it noticed the revenue shortfall, which created the blowout loss.\nC3.ai still has over $700 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, so it has some breathing room while it rights the ship, but the company will have to make some very hard decisions with respect to cost-cutting if its revenue doesn't return to growth. Ironically, reducing expenses will often lead to slower growth, especially if things like marketing are on the chopping block.\nShould you buy C3.ai stock before Sept. 3?\nThe 40% decline in C3.ai stock since July 24 has pushed its price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio down to just 5.8, which is near the lowest level in three years. In other words, the stock is quite cheap relative to its history.\nHowever, an attractive valuation won't matter if C3.ai's revenue continues to decline. Shrinking businesses tend to destroy shareholder value over the long term, so investors typically avoid them. While it's possible the company will resolve its recent issues, I think investors should adopt a wait-and-see approach. Siebel's replacement hasn't even been selected yet, so there is still a significant amount of uncertainty on the horizon.\nAs a result, it might be best to avoid C3.ai stock ahead of Sept. 3, and perhaps until the company is firmly back on track with growing revenue and shrinking losses.\nShould you buy stock in C3.ai right now?\nBefore you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and C3.ai wasn’t one of them.

The latest round of 13F filings revealed that legendary billionaire investors like David Tepper, Stanley Druckenmiller, and George Soros have all been quietly increasing their stakes in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).\nWhile Nvidia has dominated the AI conversation, with eye-popping returns and constant headlines, it’s actually TSM that plays the indispensable role behind the scenes. TSM manufactures the world’s most advanced chips that power Nvidia’s GPUs, Apple’s (AAPL) iPhones, and the servers fueling AI adoption.\nThe timing of this buying spree is no coincidence. With TSM delivering record-breaking earnings growth, the stock has surged 40% in the past year. Yet, its valuation still sits near sector averages, making it a compelling blend of growth and relative value that even the savviest hedge fund managers can’t seem to ignore. Let’s find out more on TSM.\nTSM’s Record Earnings\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the world’s leading contract chipmaker with a market capitalization of roughly $1.21 trillion, is the engine behind the GPUs, smartphones, and data-center processors. It pays an annual dividend of $2.13 per share, yielding 0.91%, underscoring its commitment to returning steady cash flow even amid aggressive expansion.\nYear-to-date, TSM has climbed 20.43%, and over the past 52 weeks it’s surged 40.67%, closing most recently at $235.59.\nOn valuation metrics, the stock trades at forward earnings of 23.71x versus the sector median of 23.53x, while its PEG ratio of 1.11x compares favorably against the industry’s 1.88x, an indicator that growth expectations still outpace its price multiple.\nIn its July 17 earnings release for Q2, prepared under Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission: International Financial Reporting Standards (TIFRS) on a consolidated basis, TSM announced revenue of NT$933.79 billion ($30.07 billion), up 38.6% year-over-year (YoY) and 11.3% sequentially, and net income of NT$398.27 billion ($13.14 billion), representing a 60.7% spike versus the prior year and a 10.2% uplift quarter-on-quarter (QoQ).\nTSMC’s diluted earnings per share climbed sharply to NT$15.36 for the quarter, equivalent to US$2.47 per ADR, a substantial increase from US$1.54 per ADR in the same period last year. The company sustained impressive profitability metrics across the board, posting a gross margin of 58.6%, an operating margin of 49.6%, and a net profit margin of 42.7%, highlighting both its pricing power and disciplined cost management.\nTSM’s Big Investments\nThe world’s largest contract chipmaker is making an astonishing investment of more than $100 billion in the United States, a decision that signals not only bold ambition but a strategic response to geopolitical and supply chain realities. This massive capital infusion will result in at least five new facilities, including three state-of-the-art chip fabrication plants, two advanced packaging centers, and a dedicated research and development hub.\nTSM is also aggressively scaling up in Japan, with new manufacturing efforts focusing on advanced Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor sensors and automotive chips. In Kumamoto, the first Japanese fab is already operational, serving major automotive and tech clients.\nMeanwhile, a second facility is preparing to break ground later this year, contingent on the completion of necessary infrastructure and regional logistics. This push will reinforce Japan’s role as a pivotal hub in TSM’s international supply chain and expand its reach into the fast-evolving automotive chip market.\nDemonstrating that the bullish outlook isn't limited to hedge fund titans, public disclosures reveal that Congressman Cleo Fields recently purchased up to $500,000 worth of TSM stock, spread across two transactions in June and July 2025.\nAnalysts’ Nod of Approval\nAnalyst sentiment around Taiwan Semiconductor remains resolutely bullish as the company approaches its next earnings release, scheduled for Oct. 16, 2025. For the current quarter ending September, consensus forecasts point to earnings of $2.56 per share. That’s a sizable jump from $1.94 in the prior year’s period.\nLooking ahead, the full-year 2025 earnings estimate has climbed to $9.83 per share, well ahead of last year’s $7.04, translating to expected YoY growth rates of 31.96% for the quarter and a remarkable 39.63% for the year.\nTSM’s management has echoed this optimism, projecting third-quarter revenue will reach between $31.8 billion and $33.0 billion. Despite a rapidly expanding cost base tied to its $100 billion U.S. investment spree, gross profit margins are expected to remain impressively high, between 55.5% and 57.5%.\nTurning to analyst recommendations, the consensus is pretty much as decisive as it gets, with a “Strong Buy” from nine out of the 12 analysts covering TSM. The mean price target sits at $261.38, which implies an upside of approximately 10.7% from the current price.\nConclusion\nTSM is attracting confident bets for good reason. The company continues to deliver strong earnings and guidance, and analysts see even more room for shares to run, with a consensus target pointing to double-digit upside from here. With billionaires taking notice and the market’s fundamentals lined up, the stock looks set to push higher as demand for its chips stays hot. All signs suggest TSM still has runway ahead.\nOn the date of publication, Ebube Jones did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

During that time period, Bitcoin is up an unremarkable 2%. In comparison, a number of top altcoins have soared 75% or more.\nSo which is the next crypto that's ready to explode in 2025? To answer that question, it's helpful to understand which altcoins are currently soaring in value, and what they all have in common. Let's take a closer look.\nWhich cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin?\nRight now, 45 altcoins are beating Bitcoin soundly. The list of top performers includes a few meme coins, such as Pudgy Penguins(CRYPTO: PENGU), which is up a head-spinning 148% over the past 90 days on August 26. The good news is that investors can safely ignore these meme coins due to their mercurial, volatile nature. If anyone can explain why digital penguins have gone viral over a long, hot summer, please tell me.\nThe name that really jumps off the list of top performers is Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH), which is up 75% over the past 90 days. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency is attracting the attention of both retail and institutional investors, due to its recent explosive run.\nMoreover, several top decentralized finance (DeFi) cryptocurrencies have turned in some stunning performances over the past 90 days. For example, both Chainlink(CRYPTO: LINK) and Uniswap(CRYPTO: UNI) are up 55%. Not to go too deep into the weeds here, but both of these are ERC-20 tokens, meaning that they were designed to run on the Ethereum blockchain.\nBoth of these cryptocurrencies are direct plays on the growth potential of decentralized finance, and especially on the surge in new activity happening within the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. From my perspective, these DeFi tokens are exactly the sorts of cryptocurrencies that can explode later in 2025.\nBased on the above, it's possible to put together a convincing investment thesis for the second half of 2025. The spate of new crypto legislation coming out of the United States, combined with the growing pace of crypto adoption around the world, is leading to new opportunities for DeFi tokens, and especially those that run on top of the Ethereum blockchain. If any cryptocurrency is going to pop soon, it will likely be one of these.\nMeet Ondo, the crypto that could explode soon\nIt may be too late to get in on Ethereum, but there are some intriguing options lurking elsewhere within Ethereum's blockchain ecosystem. One that has my attention is Ondo(CRYPTO: ONDO). It's currently ranked No. 38 among all cryptocurrencies, with a nearly $3 billion market cap.\nOndo is also an ERC-20 token (just like Chainlink and Uniswap), but is probably off the radars of most investors. It is only down 2% over the past 90 days, so it's basically running neck-and-neck with Bitcoin.\nWhat's tempting about Ondo is that it's a direct play on all the goodness happening within DeFi. It's a token primarily favored by institutional investors, and promises to bring \"institutional grade\" finance to crypto.\nOndo is primarily used for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which is one of the hottest investment ideas within DeFi right now. This refers to the process of transforming real-world assets (such as stocks and bonds) into blockchain assets.\nThis cryptocurrency also has the support of World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture affiliated with the Trump family. In February, World Liberty Financial scooped up nearly $500,000 worth of Ondo tokens.\nMoreover, I've already seen a recent glimpse of the amazing upside potential of Ondo. At the end of last year, Ondo more than tripled in value and hit an all-time high of $2.14. Given that Ondo is now trading for around $1, this implies that Ondo could have the potential to double in value, in order to regain its all-time high. Asking for Ondo to do much more than that, though, might be too much.\nPicking winners in crypto\nBe aware: It is notoriously difficult to pick the next big winner in crypto. Investment narratives fall in and out of favor. Meme coins come and go, and top cryptos can rise or fall, often based on no apparent reason. Risk and volatility are very much an issue any time you venture beyond Bitcoin or Ethereum.\nBut if you're willing to take on the risk, then it might be time to look for coins that haven't popped yet. The best investment opportunities are those that are linked to the Ethereum DeFi investment narrative. This narrative jas already worked with Chainlink and Uniswap, both of which are up big over the past 90 days.\nCould Ondo be next?\nShould you buy stock in Ethereum right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn’t one of them.

From that definition alone, you can expect good companies with stable growth, global market reach, and\/or resilient business models.\nAnother thing you might gather from the definition is that these companies don’t usually come cheap - and you’d be 100% right.\nThat’s why finding Dividend Aristocrats trading at oversold or near-oversold territory can be an excellent opportunity to snag quality stocks with consistent, reliable income at a discount. However, finding such stocks - or indeed, identifying the right time to look for them - might present a challenge.\nWell, you’re in luck, because today, I’ll show you three Dividend Aristocrats trading around oversold territory. And, as a bonus, I’ll also show you how to look for them yourself.\nHow I Came Up With The Following Stocks\nAs usual, I started the analysis using Barchart’s Stock Screener tool. Once there, I added a few simple filters:\nCurrent Analyst Rating: 4 (Moderate Buy) to 5 (Strong Buy). The Current Analyst Rating filter tracks and averages ratings from Wall Street analysts. A score of 4-5 means that most analysts are bullish on the stock, particularly expecting positive price movement within the next 12 months.\n14-Day Relative Strength Index (RSI): Below 40%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a popular technical indicator that measures a stock’s price movement over a given period (typically 14 days) and plots it on a scale of 0 to 100 to gauge momentum. A reading of 30% or below suggests that the stock is oversold, while a reading of 80% or above indicates overbought action. Setting the filter to look for stocks trading at 40% or below the RSI gives me a list of stocks that show signs of momentum weakness, which may present attractive entry points - perhaps recently rising from oversold territory, or moving towards it, but not necessarily dipping below.\nWatchlist: Dividend Aristocrats. Lastly, I have several watchlists for different stock types, which I can use to limit or expand my analysis. For today, I’m sticking with Dividend Aristocrats.\nWith those filters, I got exactly three companies after running the screen.\nI then arranged the list from lowest to highest 14-day RSI. Now, let’s start with the first one:\nAmcor plc (AMCR)\nAmcor plc is a multinational packaging company that specializes in producing different types of containers, including flexible containers, rigid materials, and specialty cartons. The company services a wide range of industries, including (of course) food and beverage, healthcare and pharmaceutical, home and personal care, and other specialty brands.\nOn August 14, the company released its Q4 and FY’25 financials, and unfortunately, their quarterly bottom-line numbers missed estimates by nearly 5%. Amcor previously met analyst expectations in the last three quarters, making this earnings miss a devastating surprise for its stock price, causing it to fall from $9.68 to a new 3-month low at $8.43.\nThe sudden drop in AMCR’s stock price also brought its 14-day RSI tumbling to 32.35%, though the stock is currently trading near a support level. To me, I see it as a buying opportunity.\nFor those interested, Amcor pays 50.8 cents annually, which translates to an approximate 6% yield. Analysts are also cautiously optimistic about the stock, rating it a Moderate Buy.\nWalmart Inc (WMT)\nNext up is Walmart, one of the world's largest retailers. The company’s massive brick-and-mortar presence in the US and extensive global supply chain give it a significant advantage over most of its competitors. Its growing omnichannel strategy is also beginning to yield results, with global eCommerce growing 25% year-over-year according its last quarterly financials (released August 21, 2025).\nHowever, like Amcor, Walmart missed earnings expectations by nearly 7%, causing its stock price to tumble to $96.05 and its 14-day RSI to dip to 38.51%.\nToday, WMT stock pays 94 cents annually, reflecting around a 0.98% yield. And, despite the earnings miss, analysts continue to reiterate their Strong Buy rating on the stock.\nCardinal Health (CAH)\nLast on the list is Cardinal Health, a healthcare services and products company that distributes pharmaceuticals, manufactures medical and surgical products, and operates logistics and supply chain solutions for medical facilities in the US.\nSimilar to the first two Dividend Aristocrats, Cardinal Health’s recent price drop from $157 to as low as $137.75 between August 11 and 12, 2025, was due to the company missing revenue estimates by a measly 1%. However, CAH stock has since regained ground and is now trading at $147.49.\nAs for dividends, the company recently increased its payouts to $2.044 per share, per year, which yields approximately 1.38%. Analysts also rate the stock a Strong Buy, which signals a belief in further recovery.\nFinal Thoughts\nSometimes, stock price drops are opportunities in disguise. As the Oracle of Omaha says, “Be greedy when others are fearful.”\nStill, the stock market remains fluid. Although these stocks have received excellent Wall Street ratings, and I’m confident that these dips are temporary, I freely admit that I might be wrong. So, if I were you, I’d monitor these positions closely for any new developments.\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Yet, some see a buying opportunity even as the company navigates a hostile policy environment, a stalled project, and an urgent multi-billion plan to raise capital that has sent its shares tumbling by nearly 40% this month. The latest blow came on Friday, when the U.S. government issued a surprise \"stop-work\" order for Orsted's Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island, citing \"national security interests.\" The move was an unexpected setback for a project that was already 80% complete, with 45 of its 65 massive turbines installed, after a nine-year permit review process. DNNGY 1M mountain The halt could not have come at a worse time for Orsted. Earlier this month, the company had announced its intention to raise 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) through a rights issue — equivalent to nearly half its market capitalization — after failing to find a partner for a major U.S. project. The crises have triggered a sharp sell-off in Orsted's stock, leaving investors to question the viability of its ambitious growth plans and the stability of its funding model, which relies heavily on selling stakes in its projects. The uncertainty has been so pronounced that S & P Global Ratings downgraded the company's long-term credit rating to 'BBB-' from 'BBB,' citing a deterioration in Orsted's overall business environment and a lack of capital expenditure flexibility. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted the rights issue was \"largely unexpected\" and would create \"3-4 weeks of market uncertainty\" until the terms are disclosed in early September. Despite the turmoil, analysts at Berenberg see the sell-off in its share price as overdone. The equity analysts upgraded the stock to a \"Buy,\" saying that the company's decisive move to shore up its balance sheet provides a financial cushion to withstand even the most severe outcomes. \"I think it's fair to say we think the shares are now pricing in close to a worst-case scenario, with the c40% share price decline in the last three weeks potentially an overreaction,\" James Carmichael, energy analyst at Berenberg, told CNBC. \"There is still some near-term price risk given the ongoing rights issue and the continuing uncertainty in the US, but we think there is an opportunity here for the brave.\" Berenberg's analysis suggests the rights issue gives Orsted the balance sheet capacity to fund its capital needs through 2027, even in an unlikely worst-case scenario where it cancels its U.S. projects and fails to complete any other planned disposals. In such a scenario, Berenberg modeled a downside valuation of 172 Danish kroner per share — or 13% lower from the current share price — viewing that as a floor. Money managers also appear to be seeing value for Orsted's stock at the current level. New York-based hedge fund ValueWorks reportedly bought a sizeable stake in the wind energy giant earlier this month, making it a top-40 shareholder. 'Stop-work' order's impact The immediate challenge, however, remains the Revolution Wind project, a 704 MW farm jointly owned with BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners. While Orsted has not provided a cost estimate for the pause, a similar order placed on Equinor 's Empire Wind project earlier this year was reported to cost around $47 million per week, according to estimates from Sydbank analysts. Orsted has said that it is evaluating all options, including legal proceedings, to resolve the matter and aims to get the project back on track for completion in the second half of 2026. However, analysts at UBS noted that the major issue is not Revolution Wind itself, but the \"rise in the risk profile for the Sunrise Wind project.\" That much larger project, which is 100% owned by Orsted and is at an earlier stage, represents a far greater financial exposure. In fact, the failure to secure a partner for Sunrise Wind was the primary trigger for the rights issue. The $9.4-billion challenge Sydbank's Jacob Pedersen noted the risk that project write downs could force the company's capital needs to swell beyond the planned 60 billion Danish kroner, making it harder to attract investors to the share issue. \"Billion-dollar write-downs could mean that the capital requirement increases beyond the 60 billion kroner, and we do not rule out that the stop-work order could delay the capital raising,\" Pedersen said in a note to clients on August 25, according to a Google translation. \"With the increased uncertainty of new write-downs, it may become more difficult to entice shareholders and investors to subscribe for new shares.\" The company's management told analysts, according to RBC, that the capital raise provides the necessary balance sheet strength to account for the U.S. uncertainty. They also confirmed that even if planned divestments of its Hornsea 3 project in the U.K. and its Greater Changhua 2 project in Taiwan were to fail, and the company had to pay breakaway costs on its U.S. projects, it would have the necessary funds through 2028. The Danish state, which holds a 50.1% stake in Orsted, has committed to participating in the rights issue, providing a critical anchor of support. A syndicate of banks including Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Danske Bank, and J.P. Morgan have been appointed to underwrite the remainder of the offering. The company is expected to reveal further details around its fund raising efforts on September 5. For many investors, it will be a day they hope their nightmare ends.","content_hash":"299e156aa0d9b0cbf8d47316517f7cd7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5660,"method_rank":0}

Yes, the option to access these tools is helpful; sometimes, you don’t even need the complicated filters and criteria. Sometimes, all you want is to find an underlying asset for a long call with a bullish trend that has enough volume to make it easier to sell once you’ve hit your profit goal.\nLuckily, with Barchart, you can get exactly that. With just a few clicks, you can find the most actively traded options so you can spot where the market’s attention is focused and find opportunities for yourself.\nA long call is an option strategy that involves buying a call option on a stock you are bullish on. The call option contract gives you the right but not the obligation to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at your specified strike price on or before the expiration date.\nHowever, you don’t need to exercise that right to profit from the trade. In fact, it’s often more profitable to sell the option before expiration instead of exercising your right. By selling your long call at a profit, you get to profit from any extrinsic value the long call has, if any.\nNow, as a general rule, underlying assets with high volume are preferred when trading options. Volume indicates the number of option contracts that have changed hands within the trading day. It helps traders identify which assets have the market’s interest, and which type of option contract has the most volume, indicating whether the overall sentiment is bearish or bullish.\nIdentifying Options Volume Leaders\nSo, to get the list of the most actively traded options in the market, visit Barchart.com, then click Options at the top, then click Most Active Options under the Volume & Open Interest subsection.\nOnce there, you will be immediately brought to the Most Active Stock Options page, where you’ll see a list of stocks with the highest total volume of trades. It also lists the IV rank, IV percentile, total options volume, and, more importantly, the total percentages of calls and put trades. This last piece of information gives you a good idea of what the market thinks of that particular asset.\nThe top five underlying assets are Nvidia, Tesla, Opendoor, Palantir, and AMD. Now, I know for a fact that, out of all five, Nvidia’s the only one with an upcoming earnings report. In fact, that will happen today, August 27, 2025, after the market closes. For that reason, I won’t suggest buying NVDA calls for now - unless you’re the adventurous type, that is.\nFor this article, let’s take a look at number two instead, which is Tesla. Out of over 1.4 million option trades during the last trading day, 64% are calls, which aligns with my bullish take.\nNext, click on the ticker symbol to access the stock’s profile page, and subsequently click on \"Long Call\/Put\" in the left-hand navigation pane.\nSelecting Your Trade\nOnce there, you’ll immediately see a list of long call trades for the nearest expiration date, which is August 29, 2025. The first thing I like to do is change the expiration date to over 30 days out. For this example, I’ll switch it to October 17, 2025, which is the closest expiration date to Tesla’s estimated Q3 2025 earnings release.\nI intend to capitalize on the volatility during the run-up to the report, while not necessarily waiting until earnings day itself.\nNext is selecting your strike price. And for that, I’ll use three examples: an out-of-the-money trade, an at-the-money trade, and an in-the-money trade.\nOut-Of-The-Money Trade (Low Delta)\nUsing the first recommended trade, the screener suggests buying a 425-strike call option on TSLA for $7.45 per share, or a total premium of $745. The trade has roughly 20 delta - the lowest of all suggested trades. Delta tracks how much option premiums change based on every $1 change in the underlying’s price. So, all things being equal, this trade’s premium is expected to increase by 20 cents every time TSLA rises by a dollar.\nThe trade has a 14.90% probability of profit, which is to be expected when trading OTM options. TSLA would have to trade at $432.45 (strike price + premium) at or preferably before October 17 for the trade to break even.\nAt-The-Money Trade (Mid Delta)\nNext, you can buy a 350-strike, at-the-money call option on Tesla. Premium per share is $28.10 - a massive jump from the OTM premium - and the trade has 56 delta and a 35% chance of profitability. The breakeven price is $378.10.\nIn-The-Money Trade (High Delta)\nLast but not least is the 305-strike ITM call. The current asking price for this particular contract is $56.80, bringing your breakeven price to $361.80. This trade has an 81 delta and a 44% chance of profit.\nFinal Thoughts\nFinding well-traded options with solid volume and open interest is an excellent starting point for identifying profitable trades. However, you then need to align strikes, expirations, and expectations with your own trading strategy. Always weigh the trade-off between ITM, ATM, and OTM calls, and see if their breakeven prices fall within your expected price movement.\nLastly, consider the individual risks associated with each, and always remember that the options market is dynamic. So, keep your eyes peeled for new developments, and always be prepared to cut and run in case things go south.\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"A judge set a hearing for Friday morning on Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook's request to block President Donald Trump from firing her.\nThe hearing was scheduled hours after Cook filed a lawsuit against Trump challenging his unprecedented attempt to remove her from the central bank's board of governors, which sets key interest rates that affect mortgage rates and other debt rates.\nThe suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., also names Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the board itself as defendants.\nCook's lawsuit is likely to end up being decided by the Supreme Court.\nThe case has been assigned to Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed to the federal bench in late 2021 by former President Joe Biden.\nFriday's hearing on Cook's bid to temporarily block her removal while her case proceeds is set for 10 a.m. ET.\nTrump said Monday that he was removing Cook because of allegations that she committed mortgage fraud by claiming two different properties as her main residence in 2021, before she joined the board.\nThe Federal Reserve Act says a president can remove a member of the Fed's Board of Governors only \"for cause.\"\nCook's attorney said Trump's justification is \"nakedly pretextual\" and argued it would not constitute sufficient cause to remove her even if Trump's allegations were true, \"which they are not.\"\n\"This case challenges President Trump's unprecedented and illegal attempt to remove Governor Cook from her position which, if allowed to occur, would the first of its kind in the Board's history,\" the lawyer, Abbe Lowell, wrote in the lawsuit.\n\"It would subvert the Federal Reserve Act ... which explicitly requires a showing of 'cause' for a Governor's removal, which an unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications submitted by Governor Cook prior to her Senate confirmation is not,\" Lowell wrote.\nCook has not been charged with, much less convicted of, any crime, including mortgage fraud.\nCook is asking Cobb to declare Trump's firing order \"unlawful and void\" and affirm that she remains a board member.\nShe also wants the judge to rule that the claims about her mortgages do not constitute \"cause,\" which the lawsuit defines as \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or comparable misconduct.\"\nPowell and the Fed Board are being sued only to the extent that they are able to \"effectuate President Trump's purported termination of Governor Cook,\" the suit said.\nThe complaint notes that Cook, who was appointed in 2022 by Biden and confirmed by the Senate, is \"the first Black woman to sit on the Federal Reserve's Board in its 111-year history.\" Her term is set to end in 2038.\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement responding to Cook's suit that Trump \"exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the Federal Board of Governors for cause.\"\n\"The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,\" Desai said in the statement to CNBC.\n\"The removal of a governor for cause improves the Federal Reserve Board's accountability and credibility for both the markets and American people.\"\nBut Cook's lawsuit asserts that the mortgage allegations are a pretext being used by Trump to vacate the board seat and \"forward his agenda to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"\nIn a separate court filing asking Cobb to temporarily block Trump's attempted firing while the case plays out, Lowell said Trump's allegations about her mortgages are not true.\nAnd even if she had committed the \"infraction\" at issue, the lawyer wrote, Trump would still not have cause to remove her, in part because the alleged conduct took place before she joined the Fed board.\n\"Whether an offense amounts to 'cause' for removal should depend on a combination of when it occurred, whether it occurred in the performance of the officeholder's official duties, and how serious of an offense it is,\" Lowell wrote in the request for a temporary restraining order.\n\"The President would not have 'cause' to remove a Federal Reserve Governor even if he possessed smoking gun evidence that she jaywalked in college.\"\n\"And here, he would not have 'cause' to remove Governor Cook even if she had erred in filling out a form for a private mortgage before she assumed office,\" Lowell wrote.\nThe Federal Reserve declined to comment on the lawsuit.\nTrump's effort to fire Cook came after months of him complaining that she, Powell and other board members were not cutting interest rates, as he wanted.\nThe allegations against Cook first surfaced from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and an aggressive backer of Trump's criticisms of Powell.\nPulte sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice, which said it will investigate the mortgage claims against Cook. Pulte, the DOJ and the White House have all demanded that Cook quickly leave her post in light of the allegations.\nWithin hours of Trump's termination letter to her being made public on Truth Social, Cook vowed to \"continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.\"\nIf Trump is successful in removing Cook, it would put him on track to have appointed a majority of the Fed Board of Governors' seven members.\n\"We'll have a majority very shortly,\" Trump said at the White House during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \"So that'll be great.\"\nThis is breaking news. Check back for updates.\n— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.","content_hash":"0a2541714dec26ef3adfaf0e3e8315d7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5578,"method_rank":0}

Fidelity followed with $87.4 million into its FETH product, cementing its role as the sector’s second powerhouse.\nEven Grayscale, which has struggled for months with persistent outflows from its legacy ETHE trust, showed signs of recovery as its newer Spot ETH product drew $53.3 million in inflows.\nThe strong comeback has lifted total Ethereum ETF assets under management to $28.8 billion, with cumulative inflows climbing to nearly $13 billion since their debut earlier this year.\nWhat makes the momentum more striking is that it came amid sharp price declines, with Ethereum sliding more than 8% during the same session to around $4,420.\nAnalysts say the disconnect between prices and flows highlights that institutions are treating dips as buying opportunities rather than reasons to retreat.\nBitcoin, by contrast, saw healthy but comparatively muted demand. Fidelity’s FBTC led inflows with $65.5 million, followed closely by BlackRock’s IBIT at $63.3 million and ARK’s ARKB with $61.2 million.\nCombined, Bitcoin ETFs added $219 million, showing continued institutional support but falling well short of Ethereum’s showing.\nAltogether, U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs now hold $143.6 billion in assets, with cumulative inflows topping $54 billion.\nInstitutional Demand for Ether Surges, But Broader Altcoin Rally Stalls\nAltcoin investors may have to wait longer for a broad rally, with Bitfinex analysts noting that the next “altseason” is unlikely until new exchange-traded funds expand access beyond Bitcoin and Ether.\nIn a Monday markets note, the team said they do not expect a “‘rising tide lifts all boats’ environment” until later this year, when inflows into Bitcoin products strengthen and fresh vehicles for altcoins are launched.\n“These products are likely to generate sustained, price-agnostic demand, creating conditions for a broader re-rating across the digital asset complex,” the analysts wrote, while cautioning that appetite for risk remains subdued compared to prior cycle highs.\nCoinbase Institutional’s David Duong struck a more optimistic tone, suggesting September could usher in a full-scale altcoin season as market conditions shift.\nThe divide in views comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pushes back decisions on several pending ETF applications, including 21Shares and Bitwise’s Solana products, a Core XRP Trust, and a Bitcoin-Ether hybrid fund tied to Truth Social.\nEthereum has already seen substantial treasury accumulation. July recorded the largest monthly jump in corporate ETH holdings on record, rising 127% to 2.7 million ETH worth $11.6 billion.\nSER data shows 70 entities now hold a combined 4.3 million ETH, 3.6% of supply, while ETFs control another 6.5 million ETH. Together, nearly 9% of circulating Ether is locked in corporate treasuries and funds, underscoring the growing role of institutional demand.\nFundstrat Analysts Call ETH Bottom, Project Rally Toward $5,100–$5,450\nEthereum may have found its short-term floor after a steep sell-off pushed prices to $4,313 on Tuesday, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee.\nThe managing partner said on X that he expected ETH to bottom “in the next few hours” as his treasury firm BitMine added another $21 million to its holdings.\nThe call came during a broader market rout triggered by Bitcoin’s drop to a seven-week low, which erased more than $200 billion in crypto market value. Ether has since rebounded, climbing back above $4,430 at the time of writing.\nMark Newton, Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy, also struck a bullish tone, describing ETH as “a very good risk\/reward here.” He projected a recovery toward $5,100–$5,450 if support near $4,300 holds.\nOn-chain data shows similar conviction among Binance whales, who have stepped up spot and futures buying since July. Analysts note that whales tend to accumulate after trends are confirmed, and their activity could add momentum toward the $5,000 mark.\nSource: Tom Lee\nChart signals also support the case for a bottom, with ETH defending its ascending trendline around $4,300 and trading above bullish Ichimoku cloud formations. Resistance lies near $4,448, with higher targets at $5,376 and $6,290 if the rally extends.","content_hash":"94fe16b719168d41fd3e61539eb29572","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5531,"method_rank":0}

The latest indications seem to suggest this. After all, following something of a break, the famous financier's investment vehicle again sold a chunk of Apple shares in the second calendar quarter, according to the company's latest 13F filing.\nAll told, Berkshire Hathaway lightened its stake in the tech giant by 20 million shares, bringing the total down to 280 million at quarter's end. That was quite the eye-opener for Apple investors. However, does it necessarily mean they should follow the great investor's lead and sell the stock too?\nFamiliar feeling\nIt's understandable if any Apple- or Berkshire-watcher was blasted with deja vu on this news. From the end of 2023 through the second quarter in the following year, Buffett and Berkshire had been consistent and aggressive Apple sellers before taking the aforementioned pause.\nThis latest divestment paled in comparison to those early ones. Between December 2023 and the end of June 2024, Berkshire sold nearly half of its Apple stake.\nBuffett usually doesn't care to explain the reasoning behind Berkshire's moves in its vaunted equity portfolio when they happen. So we can only speculate as to the motives for this one.\nMy gut feeling is that much of this has to do with portfolio rebalancing. Berkshire first loaded up on Apple stock in 2016, which was a surprise to many given Buffett's historical aversion to tech companies. He sure liked this outlier, though, as it doubled and then some from the beginning of 2020 to the immediate post-pandemic period.\nDespite Buffett and Berkshire's golden reputation, it's actually rare that one of their equity holdings vaults so high in such a short space of time. Apple's surge was a happy occurrence but it led to a problem -- it started becoming an oversized presence in the Berkshire stock collection. In fact, as 2023 came to a close, Apple alone comprised almost 50% of the value of the company's equity portfolio.\nA weighty company\nAny good investment manager espouses the value of diversification, and Buffett has always embraced the principle too. Even in the relatively early years before the investor was something of a household name, Berkshire was big on spreading its (even back then) considerable wealth around.\nThe company's 1980 annual report detailed its holding in 18 stocks, with a combined market value at the time of just under $530 million (hard to imagine these days, as the portfolio now tips the scales at almost $300 billion). Back then, none of the stocks had a weight of more than 20% of the total portfolio (again, in terms of market value).\nWhen Buffett and his crew began divesting the Apple shares early last year, I thought then that much of it had to do with lightening the stock's load in Berkshire's equity lineup.\nI feel the same way today as, even after that the sale of 20 million shares, Apple is still the No. 1 position in terms of both total market value ($63.6 billion, to be exact) and share of portfolio, at more than 21% -- however, that's well below the nearly 50% not very long ago.\nHold on to the fruit\nSo what does this mean for Apple stock, and does this presage a wider investor sell-off?\nOutside of the usual copycat moves, as Buffett's trades are mirrored by many individual and corporate investors alike, I don't believe so. Apple has been rather a weak performer as a stock lately as the growth of product sales -- as ever, its top revenue source -- hasn't been inspiring. Meanwhile, the top line for services isn't rising fast enough to compensate for this slowdown.\nYet that increasingly crucial category is contributing more to Apple's revenue stream, rising by 13% in its most recently reported quarter to $27.4 billion. That was notably better than the 8% increase of product sales, which landed at $66.6 billion.\nAnd absent any great leap in hardware technology -- like the iPhone in 2007 -- the services category has greater potential for growth than products. For me personally, the many revenue streams available to Apple in the services sphere are a key reason I hold onto the stock. It's not because I believe there's a monster, whiz-bang new tech toy coming from the company anytime soon.\nUltimately, then, I don't think Apple stockholders should unload their holdings as Berkshire has done. Again, I feel the company's latest divestment is due more to the structure of that equity portfolio than concern about Apple's business.\nShould you buy stock in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Appaloosa added another 7.57% to its stake in the e-commerce and cloud services giant in Q2. At the end of the quarter, Tepper's position in Amazon was valued at more than $592 million.\nAppaloosa bought 1.45 million additional shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) in Q2. This purchase boosted the hedge fund's stake in the GPU maker by more than 483%. It also more than offset Tepper's sale of 380,000 Nvidia shares in the first quarter of 2025.\nTepper significantly increased his hedge fund's holding in Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM) in Q2 as well. He bought another 755,000 shares of the chip stock, boosting Appaloosa's position by nearly 280%.\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) takes the prize as Tepper's biggest new AI stock added to Appaloosa's portfolio last quarter. The billionaire bought 8 million shares of the chipmaker in Q2 -- before the U.S. government's move to take a 10% stake in Intel.\nMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) isn't a large holding for Appaloosa. However, the hedge fund owns a lot more of the memory and storage solutions company's stock now. Tepper more than doubled Appaloosa's stake in Micron in Q2.\nWhat analysts think about these stocks\nUnlike the Trump administration, Wall Street is decidedly bearish about Intel. The consensus 12-month price target for the stock is more than 10% below the current share price. Only two of the 44 analysts surveyed by LSEG in August recommended Intel as a \"buy\" or \"strong buy.\"\nAnalysts are more upbeat about Nvidia. The average price target for the stock reflects an upside potential of around 7%. However, look for upward revisions to analysts' views of Nvidia if the company delivers a significantly better-than-expected (or worse-than-expected) fiscal 2026 Q2 update.\nWall Street is almost equally bullish about two of the AI stocks Tepper bought in Q2. The consensus price targets for Amazon and Taiwan Semi are 15% and 14.5%, respectively, higher than the stocks' current share prices.\nAnalysts are most excited about the prospects for Micron over the next 12 months. The average price target reflects an upside potential of roughly 29%. Rosenblatt Securities' Kevin Cassidy is especially optimistic about Micron, recently raising his target for the stock to $200 -- more than 70% higher than the current share price.\nCassidy predicts that AI will continue to drive greater demand for Micron's DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) technology. He also likes Micron's valuation, with the stock trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.98.\nIs Wall Street right?\nI think Wall Street analysts are generally correct in the direction of movement for the five AI stocks Tepper bought in Q2. Intel appears to be the weakest of the group, in my view. Micron's valuation and AI-related growth could give it the most upside potential over the next 12 months. I also agree with analysts that Amazon, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semi have more room to run.\nWhich stocks are the best for investors to own over the long run? I'd go with Amazon and Nvidia.\nAmazon Web Services remains the largest cloud service provider. It should continue to grow as AI models are trained and deployed in the cloud. Amazon's e-commerce profits continue to increase robustly. The company has opportunities in other areas as well, including healthcare and satellite internet services.\nNvidia's GPUs are still the gold standard in powering AI applications. I don't see that changing anytime soon. The company's Blackwell GPUs are selling hand over fist. Nvidia's major customers (including Amazon) are investing heavily to expand their data center capacity. Whatever the company says in its Q2 update, I think Nvidia's long-term prospects are bright.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Even Intel is unconvinced.\nIntel Foundry, which manufactures custom semiconductors for outside customers, has not been fruitful for the company. The business division lost out on potential big contracts, like one with Sony, according to Reuters, and has cost the company significantly more than it has brought in.\nDifferences over how Intel would turn around its struggling foundry business was partially responsible for Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation from the company board in August 2024. Tan was appointed CEO in spring 2025.\nKevin Cassidy, a managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, told TechCrunch he doesn’t see how this deal will solve Intel’s problems. Intel Foundry doesn’t need money to solve its issues, he said, instead it needs to change its approach to its customers.\n“They didn’t understand customer service,” Cassidy said of Intel Foundry’s struggles to sign customers. “They have always manufactured internally, the manufacturing group was king. It’s hard to be a customer service-focused group when you think you know better.”\nIntel did not respond to a request for comment.\nRipple effect\nIntel recently acknowledged the potential downsides of this deal in an SEC filing posted Monday. The company highlighted the risks it carries for its investors and customers — two groups of people Intel naturally relies on.\nThis deal dilutes existing shareholders and reduces their governance rights. The Trump administration said it would vote alongside Intel’s interests, which could help the company move its ideas forward; but business decisions that actively sour an existing investor base conflicts with efforts to drum up investor interest.\n“I would be disappointed if I was a stockholder,” Cassidy said. “Intel gave up another 430 million shares, and diluted my shares, and [they] were able to buy it at a 20% discount.”\nIntel also mentioned the potential impact this could have on its international business. The vast majority of the company’s revenue in its last fiscal year, 76%, came from outside the U.S., the company reported.\nAmid the current U.S.-led international trade turmoil, companies outside the United States will now have to grapple with whether or not to work with a company partially owned by the U.S. government.\nSending signals\nNot everyone is doom and gloom about the recent transaction. Cody Acree, managing director and senior research analyst at Benchmark Company, told TechCrunch he doesn’t see the company’s international customers shying away from Intel.\nAcree said the deal isn’t perfect, but the government’s commitment to Intel’s future may give the chipmaker the boost it needs — even if it’s just a small step on a long road to recovery.\n“Intel has shown that it’s been struggling for the last decade and may need some kind of government intervention; a bail out is probably too harsh of a term, but the government intervention is being seen as at least a stepping stone toward reinvigorating Intel,” Acree said. “I don’t necessarily agree with it being a fix-all by any means. It’s at least encouraging to know that the government is backing Intel instead of challenging the leadership as they were a month ago.”\nAndrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, agreed that a deal with the U.S. government could be positive. In an interview before the deal was formally announced, Rocco said that this could give Intel a bigger role in the administration’s current push for domestic AI prowess through initiatives like OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle’s Stargate initiative and bringing semiconductor manufacturing stateside.\n“The market is going to be so big, the data center and chip market, even if they get a small slice,” Rocco said. “There is room for them to succeed. This will be a positive. You have to have a five-to-10-year time horizon.”\nStill, both analysts cautioned the deal won’t be Intel’s savior. For a true, long-standing rescue, Intel needs to look inward.\nWhile the Trump administration claims it will be a passive investor, that doesn’t mean its involvement can’t drum up business for the company, Acree said. While that hopefully wouldn’t come from pressure or force, Cassidy said, it definitely could.\nIf the Trump administration tells American companies to buy Intel’s chips and hardware, they might not have to do as much convincing to get companies on board.\nAcree and Cassidy said the real test for Intel won’t be the deal, or even the optics of it. It will be whether Intel can drum up interest for its 14A chipmaking processor. Tan has said the company would not start production on its 14A chipmaking process until they secured substantial customer interest.\n“There is still no guarantee that Intel is going to be able to come back into the market at the leading edge,” Cassidy said. “Intel has been burning cash for quite a few years, I don’t know if it is just more money to buy time to find the formula to get them back on the leading edge.”","content_hash":"c2f11c680ac34ae11d11eb303db05894","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5373,"method_rank":0}

Because bills are complicated, I asked ChatGPT to explain Trump’s new student loan repayment plan to us — below is what it said.\nA Shift in the System: Out With the Old Plans\n“Previously, borrowers could choose from a variety of income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. These plans adjusted monthly payments based on income and family size, often resulting in very low or even $0 monthly payments, with loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years,” ChatGPT wrote.\nThe new law eliminates this tiered system, offering borrowers only two options: a modified Standard Repayment Plan and a new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP).\n“Borrowers who are currently in an existing IDR plan, such as SAVE, PAYE, REPAYE or ICR, must actively choose to switch to Income-Based Repayment (IBR) or the new Repayment Assistance Plan by July 1, 2028 or they will be automatically moved into RAP,” according to ChatGPT.\nWhat Is the New Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)?\nThe stricter terms of the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) are the central feature of the OBBB’s student loan reform. Monthly payments are capped at 1% to 10% of adjusted gross income (AGI), depending on the borrower’s income and household size, with a minimum payment of $10 per month — a departure from earlier plans that allowed for $0 payments.\nAnother key change is the timeline for loan forgiveness. The new RAP increases the time to 30 years, from 20 to 25 under current plans.\nNote to the reader. Originally, ChatGPT wrote that if a borrower’s payment didn’t cover interest, it would accumulate. This could lead to compound interest skyrocketing outstanding balances and devastating consequences. I — the humble human writer — was skeptical, so I found the actual text of Section 82001 of the OBBBA, which deals with student loan repayment and uploaded it to ChatGPT. I relay this as a cautionary tale of blindly believing everything ChatGPT says. Here is the model’s answer after reading the bill text:\nInterest waiver: If a borrower’s monthly RAP payment is too low to cover all the interest that accrues that month, the unpaid interest is simply not charged. In other words, your balance won’t grow as long as you make the required payment.\nPrincipal “matching” credit: When a qualifying payment reduces principal by less than $50, the Department of Education will top-up the difference — up to $50 per month.\nBorrowing Limits and Changes To Public Service Loan Forgiveness\nThe big changes came in the form of borrowing limits, something that will greatly affect future students who don’t have the money to pay for college out-of-pocket.\n“Undergraduates keep the long-standing Direct Loan limits of $5,500 to $12,500 a year, with lifetime caps of $31,000 for dependent students and $57,500 for independents. However, Parent PLUS Loans are now limited to $20,000 per year and $65,000 total. Graduate and professional students can borrow up to a total of $100,000 or $200,000 for select degrees such as law or medicine,” the chatbot wrote.\nThese caps are particularly worrisome for low- to middle-class students. For instance, according to U.S. News and Best Colleges the average annual costs of college tuition and fees — not including living expenses, transportation and various other costs — are:\nThese changes could result in students not being able to attend schools they worked hard to get into or send them to the private loan market, where interest rates are often higher, depending on creditworthiness and terms are less favorable.\nIs It Now Harder To Repay Student Loans?\nThe answer is undoubtedly yes, for many.\n“Economic hardship and unemployment deferments are no longer available for new loans, reducing stopgaps during hardship,” ChatGPT wrote.\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program also faces changes, according to ChatGPT. “Some nonprofit and public service workers may now be excluded based on the nature of their work, particularly in fields such as immigration defense or gender-affirming healthcare for minors. This narrowing of eligibility has raised concerns among legal and advocacy groups. While RAP simplifies choices, it offers fewer borrower protections and a longer path to debt relief,” the chatbot wrote.\nChatGPT’s Last Bit of Explanation\nChatGPT said this overhaul aims to simplify repayment — but for many borrowers it also means:\nReduced support for low-income, parent or career-changer borrowers.\n“If you’re currently in SAVE or another IDR plan: you’ll likely need to act before July 1, 2028 and switch to IBR, otherwise you’ll default into RAP. Existing borrowers should reassess their strategy soon,” ChatGPT wrote.\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

The protocol has already secured backing from top-tier investors, including Framework, Dragonfly, Digital Currency Group, Delphi, and Fintech Collective.\nUnlike traditional financing, which often hinges on long cash flow projections and lengthy approvals, USD.AI offers loans secured 1:1 by AI hardware. This allows loans to close in under a week, compared to the 60–90 days typical of traditional funds. For capital-intensive sectors, that speed could mean the difference between scaling and stagnation.\nThe protocol’s adoption curve has been steep. Since June, USD.AI has grown from virtually zero to more than $62.7 million in total value locked (TVL).\nAccording to data from DeFiLlama, deposits surged past $10 million by mid-June, climbed steadily into the $30–40 million range in July, and accelerated again in August to reach their current all-time high.\nSource: DeFiLlama\nBorrowing activity, while still modest at $1.25 million, reflects an early phase of adoption, with most users currently utilizing USD.AI as a savings and yield platform.\nPartnerships have also played a central role in its rise. USD.AI has teamed up with K3 Capital, Concrete, Euler, and Pendle to launch its innovative “AutoVaults,” which allows depositors to earn optimized yields across DeFi markets.\nPendle, in particular, has been a key supporter, recently launching Boost USDai and sUSDai vaults that integrate with USD.AI’s ecosystem and offer enhanced incentives for liquidity providers.\nOn August 14, USD.AI raised $13 million in Series A funding led by Framework Ventures. With $50 million already in deposits during private beta, USD.AI plans a public launch featuring an ICO and a game-based allocation model.\nYZi Labs, which manages over $10 billion in assets globally and has backed more than 300 projects across 25 countries, said its decision to support USD.AI reflects a belief that new financial primitives are needed to scale AI infrastructure.\nDavid Choi, co-founder of USD.AI, framed the project as a lifeline for a new class of builders who have hardware but lack traditional financing channels.\n“Not everyone has a CFO or a Wall Street connection. But they do have machines and a future to build,” Choi said. “This is a dollar that scales for the outsiders, and we’re excited to have YZi Labs’ support in that mission.”\nThe backdrop for this innovation is a rapidly escalating capital crunch in the AI industry. Analysts estimate that over $6.7 trillion will be required for compute infrastructure in the next five years, yet much of that financing remains out of reach for all but the largest firms.\nReports of OpenAI’s Sam Altman exploring new financing instruments to raise trillions for infrastructure show just how acute the funding gap has become.\nUSD.AI seeks to address that gap by giving smaller players the same financial access, without diluting equity or waiting months for approvals.\nYZi Labs Emerges as Force Behind Institutional Push Into BTC and BNB Ecosystems\nSince its relaunch in January, the firm has widened its scope to include artificial intelligence and biotechnology while reinforcing its commitment to blockchain.\nChangpeng Zhao, Binance’s former CEO, has taken an active role as a mentor to startups within the program, while co-founder Ella Zhang has returned to lead operations.\nIn May, the firm made a major bet on Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem through an investment in Avalon Labs, a BTC-based platform developing capital markets around BTC-collateralized lending, stablecoin USDa, and credit services.\nAt the time, Avalon held more than $500 million in total value locked, with over 20,000 BTC under management, making USDa the second-largest CDP project on DeFiLlama.\nThe U.S.-based entity focuses exclusively on BNB Chain investments and is targeting a listing on a major American exchange to give institutional investors direct exposure to BNB, Binance’s $92 billion native asset.\nMomentum continued in August when China Renaissance (CR), a Hong Kong–listed financial group, partnered with YZi Labs to acquire $100 million worth of BNB. CR will act as a champion for broader institutional adoption, becoming the first HK-listed firm to hold BNB as a proprietary asset.\nYesterday, a new milestone followed. B Strategy, a digital asset investment firm led by former Bitmain executives, launched a $1 billion BNB-focused treasury vehicle, with backing from YZi Labs.\nThe company, which aims to model itself as the “Berkshire Hathaway of the BNB ecosystem,” plans a U.S. listing while reinvesting in core BNB projects and community initiatives.","content_hash":"b2ddcfc4c1a41a36577492010924b042","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5303,"method_rank":0}

This comes after the warehouse club hiked its membership fees earlier this year. Its basic tier increased by $5, making the plan $60 a year, while its Club+ membership spiked from $110 to $120.\nWhile BJ’s welcomed more members during the quarter, its foot traffic in stores increased by 5% year-over-year, beating Costco, which only saw its store visits climb by 3.2%, and Sam’s Club, whose visits grew 1.6%, according to recent data from Placer.ai.\nDespite recent growth in members and foot traffic, BJ’s flagged in its earnings report that its comparable club sales decreased 0.3% year-over-year due to “the declining retail prices of fuel.”\nThe national average price of gas began declining in April last year. Currently, the national average price of a gallon of gas is around $3.18, increasing competition for BJ’s, which exclusively offers members low prices on gas.\nBJ's CEO raises red flag about an alarming problem in stores\nDuring an earnings call on Aug. 22, BJ’s CEO Bob Eddy said that the company’s performance during the quarter was also impacted by “macro uncertainty” and “unseasonably wet and cold weather” in core Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets.\nThis contributed to BJ’s general merchandise sales declining by 2.2% year-over-year, while services remained flat.\n“Certain higher-ticket discretionary categories in GM (general merchandise), such as recreation and lawn and garden, experienced double-digit declines in comp sales,” said Eddy.\nHe also flagged that members are growing “more cautious” about their spending in stores as they become more concerned about economic pressures such as tariffs and inflation.\n“We did see members across all income levels turn a bit more cautious during the quarter, driven by the uncertain macro environment,” said Eddy. “Despite this change in consumer sentiment, our members continue to count on BJ’s, and total spending increased in total and on a per-member basis, with low-income households demonstrating incredible loyalty.”\nEddy noted that even though members are increasing their spending, they are “really frustrated” and “a little bit concerned” about the state of the economy, which is pushing them to seek more value as they make purchases.\n“Their propensity to use coupons or to react to deals is a bit higher,” said Eddy. “You know, certainly looking at private label a little bit more than they have in the past, which may be good for us in the long term, but it could be an indication of consumer stress out there. Discretionary categories were more impacted than the nondiscretionary, which, again, was not too much different from the first quarter.”\nConsumers are making drastic changes to spending amid tariff threat\nThe shift in customer behavior comes as many Americans are concerned about President Donald Trump’s tariffs (taxes companies pay to import goods from overseas) causing higher prices for everyday goods and services.\nA recent survey from market research company Numerator found that 87% of consumers are worried about tariffs putting a dent in their finances.\nAlso, 80% of consumers are changing their shopping habits in response to tariffs by delaying nonessential or expensive purchases, buying less imported goods, searching for sales and coupons, and switching to shopping at lower-priced retailers and discount stores.\nThese concerns were exacerbated after higher tariff rates went into effect on Aug. 7. Shortly after this major policy shift, recent data from the University of Michigan found that consumer sentiment dropped by 5% at the beginning of August, the first decline in four months.\n“The U.S. consumer is in okay shape,” said Comerica Bank Chief Economist Bill Adams in a statement to TheStreet. “Sentiment is sour, but actual behavior looks okay. Consumer spending will likely grow moderately in the second half of 2025, then get an incremental boost in 2026 as tax cuts bolster disposable incomes.”\nBJ's doubles down on a major tactic to battle tariff impact\nAfter the Trump administration first announced tariffs earlier this year, BJ’s warned investors during an earnings call in May that it may have to raise prices in its stores and even remove products from shelves that “might not make any sense” for its members.\n“We're always leaning into our model to deliver value, and while upward pressure on cost may drive prices higher, we are doing everything possible to minimize the impact to our members,” said Eddy during the call in May.\nAmid higher tariff rates, BJ’s is further doubling down on cutting inventory in areas that sell discretionary products and those that sell items with higher tariffs attached to them.\n“We’ll have a great assortment for our members, but we’ve ordered less units this year than we have in the past,” said Eddy. “And the math there is really simple to think about. Given the low margins at which we operate, you need to sell four or five units at full price to pay off one that you mark off, mark down to zero. So we’re just trying to better balance the economic equation in our business.”","content_hash":"fe28c9822948967b4250228dcd87e8f0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5302,"method_rank":0}

And, what rights do homeowners have against unauthorized surveillance by insurance companies?\nDrones are insurers' latest tool\nA reconnaissance drone didn’t just investigate Schueler’s home — it successfully torpedoed her coverage, something she learned with astonishment in an email just weeks later.\n\"They were cancelling my insurance. They had shown a drone coming over the house at some point, and there were some tree branches hovering over my house that they wanted removed,\" Schueler said. \"I wasn't home because my car wasn't in the driveway.\"\nHer insurer gave her just six weeks to trim the branches or they’d terminate her policy.\n\"I was very nervous. I'm like, 'How much is this going to cost, and can I find somebody to take these branches down?' And, plus, I was losing branches on a beautiful tree,\" she said. \"It ended up costing $1,200. I had no choice.”\nWhile Schueler was fortunate to find a tree removal company, not everyone is. The practice of insurers using drones for surveillance on policyholders is \"becoming very, very common,\" according to Amy Bach, executive director at United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group.\nAnd it’s not just risky policyholders getting spied on.\n\"I had insurance with this company for the last 12 years, with no claims,\" Schueler told reporters. \"I've been a good customer to them.\"\n\"People are getting dropped based on, 'We see mold on your roof,' or 'We see damaged roof tiles,' or 'There are trees touching your house,' risk factors that insurance companies are increasingly on the lookout for,\" Bach said.\nBut the insurance companies aren't doing the spying themselves. Instead, insurers are buying them from \"insurtech\" companies — private investigators that use innovative technology to help insurers be more efficient and save money.\n“It’s kind of like your credit score is a big deal. Now, your insurance score is a big deal in terms of whether or not they are going to keep you, what they’re going to charge you,” Bach told WINK News in Fort Myers, Florida.\nAs the trend towards increased surveillance continues, some experts and authorities are starting to voice concerns publicly. “We are pushing for there to be some reasonable limits on insurance companies' ability to take these photos and use them, but of course, insurance companies are pushing back,” said Bach.\nMassachusetts state representative David LeBoeuf is championing homeowners' rights and the need for legislation. He’s introduced a bill to protect homeowners’ privacy and rights:\n\"It gives you the right, if your homeowner's insurance policy is not renewed because of the use of an aerial image, to actually see that image, to know when it was taken, to have the defects identified, and to create an appeals and cures process,\" he said.\nInsurers argue that drones reduce costs\nMark Friedlander of the Insurance Information Institute says drone use is already an established practice, pointing to the common sight of drones in areas hit by natural disasters.\n“It is a much more precise, accurate way to assess the condition of homes,” he said. “Insurers have a right to inspect your home, and we feel it’s much less intrusive [to use] a drone to take aerial imagery versus sending somebody out.”\nAnd it’s only going to become more common. According to the Wall Street Journal, by 2030, satellite technology could allow properties to be photographed and updated daily, adding a new level of scrutiny from insurers.\nAs for Lynne Schueler, her policy was eventually renewed for another year, but she knows that her property will be subject to drone surveillance before her insurer offers her any new policy.\nWhat can you do?\nBut just because insurers can use drones for aerial inspection of your home, here’s what your insurer cannot do when surveilling you:\nTrespass on your property\nRecord the inside of your home without your permission\nHarass or intimidate you\nMisrepresent themselves (claiming to be a city or utility worker, for example)\nFriedlander says the most common time when insurers may inspect your home via drone is when it is time to renew your policy or when you have just purchased new coverage.\n“The goal isn’t to eliminate customers,” he said. “It is to assess risk and make sure that the home meets the underwriting guidelines of your insurance company.”\nAs insurers increasingly rely on drone surveillance, it’s crucial for homeowners to discuss with their insurance company how risks are assessed. Ask how they use technology and how it can affect your premiums.\nAlso, consider if there are any repairs you can make to your home to reduce its insurance risk. Additionally, regularly review your insurance policy and actively compare home insurance rates and coverage options.","content_hash":"eb8b0772c7a229c3a51091d8aaa88f3a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5201,"method_rank":0}

And now, there's another company experiencing a strong acceleration in growth from the increasing demand for generative AI software.\nPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) originally made its name by providing software and analytics solutions to intelligence agencies in the U.S. But for the past couple of years, its growth has improved by selling its AI software solutions to commercial customers as well. The company now seems to be on its way to becoming one of the most important names in AI software.\nLet's look at the reasons Palantir could become the next addition to the roster of big tech names.\nPalantir is already one of the leaders in AI software\nPalantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which was introduced in April 2023, has become a huge hit among customers. The platform enables both government and commercial customers to use large language models (LLMs) and other AI tools to automate processes and build applications to improve efficiency and productivity.\nAIP has been ranked as the best AI platform by Forrester Research, above what's offered by other tech titans. It's helping to land new customers, as shown in the following table tracking the increase in overall customers since the launch of AIP in April 2023, and the value of new contracts that the company has been signing each quarter.\nSource: Palantir quarterly reports and earnings call transcripts\nThe customer count has doubled in the past couple of years. At the same time, the size of the contracts it's signing has jumped significantly. This is evident from the almost fourfold growth in the total contract value (TCV) during the same period.\nAIP is also driving higher contract value because it's also encouraging existing users to sign bigger contracts. Management said on the recent earnings conference call that it is seeing \"existing customers expand their work at a faster rate.\"\nAs a result, Palantir is now sitting on $7.1 billion worth of remaining deal value (RDV) -- the total value of its unfulfilled contracts at the end of the previous quarter. The 65% year-over-year jump in this metric was higher than the 48% increase in the company's quarterly revenue to $1 billion. Palantir, therefore, has strong revenue visibility that is likely to translate into years of growth.\nOn track to grow at an incredible pace\nThe company's revenue gains and the pace at which it is signing new contracts mean that it is expanding faster than the AI software platform market, which is expected to show an annual growth rate of nearly 39% through 2030. According to a report from researcher MarketsandMarkets, the AI software platforms are expected to generate just over $18 billion in revenue this year and $94 billion in 2030.\nThe market is expected to grow fivefold by the end of the decade. Palantir is expecting its 2025 revenue to land at $4.1 billion. That would put its share of the AI software platform market at almost 23% (based on the expected market size of $18 billion). If it keeps growing at a faster pace than the market, as it is currently doing, its share of this space would increase by 2030.\nAssuming the company can increase its share to 30% in 2030, its annual revenue could hit $28 billion (based on the $94 billion estimate mentioned earlier). But then, Palantir has the potential to do better than that considering its leading position in the AI software platform market. Moreover, there are other estimates indicating that the annual revenue from AI software platforms could jump to $153 billion in 2028 itself.\nAs a result, Palantir Technologies' actual growth in the coming years could turn out to be much faster than expected, and that could be enough to help it become the next name in big tech.\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

I think the Treasury do understand that now.\n“The market also doesn’t seem to like endless speculation about what different tax rises could be. Some of this is clearly adding to the nervousness in markets.”\n“The Chancellor is facing a significant shortfall on the fiscal side,” he said. “Our view is that growth is going to be weaker than forecast, which further deteriorates the fiscal picture.\n“We are reaching a stage where further tax rises will be counterproductive and measures to cut spending haven’t had much success so far.”\nMs Reeves has recently rearranged her top team in preparation for her Budget, giving pensions minister Torsten Bell responsibility for economic policy, according to The New Statesman.\nSimon French, chief UK economist at Panmure Liberum, said one of Mr Bell’s first jobs would be to address why there was a “UK ‘moron premium’ on gilt yields”.\n‘Drifting without an anchor’\nBritain’s debt costs have been the highest among G7 economies since the Chancellor’s spring statement in March.\nAt the time, she was forced to restore £9.9bn of fiscal headroom to meet her borrowing targets.\nShe faces an even bigger task to do the same thing in autumn.\nAlex Kerr, at Capital Economics, predicted that Ms Reeves will have to raise between £17bn and £27bn, “most of which will probably be funded by tax rises”.\nMr French said the UK’s higher borrowing costs were “a warning for the Government, which it would do well to heed”.\n“The warnings from the bond market are getting more significant and therefore more attention should be paid to avoiding bad outcomes,” he said.\n“Markets want politicians to be pragmatists, not ideologues. And the facts have fundamentally changed in terms of debt sustainability. I think the Chancellor gets it. The problem is that the rest of her party doesn’t.”\nHe added: “Bond market pricing suggests UK fiscal policy is drifting without an anchor.”\nThe surge in Britain’s borrowing costs comes amid growing risks across global debt markets.\nDonald Trump sent US borrowing costs higher on Tuesday after he claimed to have sacked one of the governors of the Federal Reserve over allegations of fraud.\nLisa Cook later said she would not resign and insisted the president did not have the power to sack her.\nHowever, the move still posed a “genuine threat” to markets, according to Thomas Mathews, at Capital Economics.\nHe said: “With these moves happening in the context of broader attacks on the credibility of US institutions, investor confidence in the Fed’s independence shouldn’t be taken for granted.”\nMeanwhile, French long-term borrowing costs hit their highest level since 2011 after prime minister François Bayrou called for a confidence vote on plans to pass unpopular budget cuts.\nJohn Hardy, an analyst at Saxo Bank, asked: “Can the bond vigilantes corral the French politicians into moving forward with austerity or are they willing to test the ‘Truss-nomics’ risks to French debt should they allow the government to fail?”","content_hash":"6179af24e1bc6485fc1c9649e2b13576","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5029,"method_rank":0}

Companies tied to servers, networking, and storage have seen renewed investor interest as hyperscale data centers and enterprises boost infrastructure investments to keep pace with AI workloads.\nOne stock standing out ahead of its next catalyst is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). The company has been in the spotlight since completing its $14 billion Juniper Networks deal, which gives it deeper exposure to AI-driven networking. Now, all eyes turn to Sept. 3, when HPE reports quarterly results. Analysts say the update could be a key catalyst for the stock as investors look for signs that networking momentum and AI-related demand are fueling growth.\nBased in Texas, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is a global technology leader that provides solutions enabling businesses to capture, analyze, and act upon data seamlessly from edge to cloud. It also provides networking and storage solutions, as well as the HPE GreenLake cloud services for hybrid cloud management. The company boasts a market cap of $29.6 billion.\nAfter plunging to a yearly low in April 2025, HPE stock rebounded sharply, gaining over 80% from there, bringing it to 6% up year-to-date (YTD). Recent regulatory approval and a rapid close of a major asset deal sparked investor buying.\nValuation-wise, HPE is attractively valued with a price-to-earnings (P\/E) of 11, significantly cheaper than the sector median of 23, suggesting the stock is undervalued compared to its peers. Additionally, its price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 0.81 is far below the sector median of 3.09, reinforcing its attractive pricing.\nMark Your Calendar For September 3\nPreviously, Hewlett Packard Enterprise delivered a solid performance, topping expectations on both revenue and earnings. The company reported EPS of $0.29, ahead of the $0.28 consensus, on revenue of $7.63 billion, representing 5.9% year-over-year (YoY) growth. The Q2 beat was fueled by strong momentum in subscription-based services and emerging AI demand. Management highlighted that GreenLake’s annualized revenue run rate surged 47% YoY to $2.2 billion, underscoring the success of its hybrid-cloud model.\nHowever, HPE’s outlook remains cautiously optimistic. For fiscal 2025, management projects 7% to 9% revenue growth in constant currency. For Q3 specifically, the company has guided an EPS of $0.40 to $0.45 and a full-year EPS of $1.78 to $1.90. A beat on revenue, particularly from AI and server demand, or signs of improved margins, management aims to lift server margins toward 10% by Q4, which could give the stock.\nHPE will release its fiscal Q3 2025 results on Sept. 3, and investors see the event as a potential catalyst. Analysts are forecasting earnings of about $0.36 per share, down from $0.45 a year earlier, reflecting ongoing macroeconomic pressures. Still, the focus is less on the near-term earnings decline and more on how HPE is executing in its core markets, enterprise servers, storage, networking, and whether its AI-driven initiatives can narrow the gap with rivals like Super Micro Computer (SMCI).\nStrategic Developments and AI Focus\nOn the strategic front, HPE cleared a major hurdle in late June when the U.S. Justice Department settled its antitrust suit over HPE’s $14 billion Juniper Networks acquisition. The deal will close after HPE divests its Instant On wireless business and licenses Juniper’s Mist AI code to competitors.\nMeanwhile, HPE continues to strengthen its AI infrastructure offerings through partnerships. It is adding Nvidia (NVDA) Blackwell GPUs in new ProLiant servers and building on alliances with companies like Graphcore for AI accelerators. These developments complement HPE’s core hybrid-cloud and Edge strategy. The Q3 report may include updates on these initiatives and could show how ramped up HPE’s AI-related sales and cost programs are.\nWhat Do Analysts Say About HPE Stock?\nWall Street’s tone on HPE stock has turned more favorable. Morgan Stanley recently upgraded the stock to “Overweight,” raising its price target to $28 from $22 on expectations of an AI-driven rebound in enterprise spending. The firm projects EPS growth of 18% by FY26 and sees earnings potentially reaching $2.70 to $3.00 by FY27.\nOther firms have also lifted their targets. J.P. Morgan initiated coverage with an “Overweight” rating and a $30 target, while Bank of America raised its target into the mid-$20s.\nOverall, HPE carries a “Moderate Buy” consensus rating from 18 Wall Street analysts. The stock is currently trading near its mean price target of $23, but the Street-high target of $30 still implies an upside potential of about 36%.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Like its American counterpart, the Japanese firm funds acquisitions through capital market raises, including share issuances and bond programs.\nEarlier this year, it redeemed 3 billion yen ($20.4 million) of its 19th Series Ordinary Bonds to optimize liabilities while continuing to scale its Bitcoin holdings.\nThe company argues that its aggressive Bitcoin strategy is rooted in Japan’s challenging macroeconomic conditions, marked by high national debt, prolonged negative real interest rates, and a weakening yen.\nBy shifting its reserves into Bitcoin, Metaplanet says it aims to hedge against inflation, currency depreciation, and broader instability in the global monetary system. Management also highlighted Bitcoin’s scarcity, portability, and transparency as reasons for treating it as a superior reserve asset compared with traditional safe havens such as government bonds.\nAs of June 30, Metaplanet had 128,000 shareholders, a figure that has surged by more than 1,000% in the past year thanks to its high-profile Bitcoin accumulation. The company has also become a focal point for global institutional investors, with the upcoming international offering designed to deepen access to long-term overseas capital and improve liquidity for its shares.\nWith 18,991 BTC already on its balance sheet, Metaplanet now ranks as the fourth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally and the largest in Asia. Industry observers have increasingly referred to the company as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” a label reinforced by its bold financing strategies and its rapid rise into the upper echelon of public Bitcoin holders.\nThe company’s filing confirmed that the international offering will go ahead only if shareholders approve an increase in the total number of authorized shares at an extraordinary general meeting on September 1.\nIf approved, the share sale will significantly expand Metaplanet’s capital base, setting the stage for its next wave of Bitcoin acquisitions and reinforcing its role as one of the most aggressive corporate buyers in the digital asset market.\nJapan’s push for clearer regulation is fueling a wave of corporate crypto adoption. The Financial Services Agency plans to classify digital assets as financial products under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by 2026, while proposed tax reforms could cut capital gains on crypto to a flat 20% from rates as high as 55%.\nFinance Minister Katsunobu Kato reinforced this direction at the WebX2025 forum in Tokyo, highlighting digital assets’ potential in diversified portfolios.\nAmid the policy shift, Tokyo-listed firms are ramping up Bitcoin holdings. Five companies, including Metaplanet, disclosed new allocations this week, adding 156.79 BTC to their reserves.\nEnergy firm Remixpoint led with 41.5 BTC ($4.6M), bringing its total to 1,273 BTC, ranking among the top 40 global corporate holders.\nFashion retailer ANAP Holdings lifted its balance to 1,017 BTC, while Agile Media Network added 0.59 BTC.

The stock is down by 30.3% year-to-date (YTD).\nLucid’s recent quarterly results have also led to a decline in the stock. Over the past month, the shares have been down by 27.9%.\nDespite the selloff, Lucid Group’s stock trades at a stretched valuation. Its price sits at 6.15 times sales, which is higher than the industry average of 0.98 times.\nLucid Group’s Q2 Results Missed Wall Street Expectations\nOn Aug. 5, Lucid reported its second-quarter results for fiscal 2025. The company’s total revenue increased by 29.3% from the prior year’s period to $259.43 million. However, this fell short of the Wall Street analysts’ expected consensus figure of $280 million.\nThe reason for this topline miss was the slowing demand in the EV market, with customers increasingly opting for cheaper hybrid cars. The Trump administration’s tariffs have also impacted the EV industry, and the $7,500 EV tax credit is set to expire in September.\nThe company’s rollout of the Gravity SUV has been slower than expected. However, Lucid is offering a $7,500 lease discount on the Gravity SUV in Q4 to help offset the loss of the federal tax credit.\nAmid all this, in July, Lucid gave its shareholders a reason to cheer when it was announced that it had formed a next-generation partnership with Uber (UBER) to launch robotaxis. This program will see Uber deploy a minimum of 20,000 Lucid Gravity vehicles equipped with Nuro Driver Level 4 autonomy. The $300 million investment provided Lucid with a financial runway, which investors welcomed.\nLucid reported an adjusted loss of $0.24 per share in Q2, which is better than the $0.29 that it had reported in Q2 2024. However, this reported figure fell short of the $0.21 loss per share that Wall Street analysts had expected.\nWall Street analysts are also optimistic about Lucid's ability to reduce its losses. For the current quarter, its loss per share is expected to narrow by 39% year-over-year (YoY) to $0.25. For the current year, the company’s loss per share is expected to reduce by 25.6% annually to $0.93, followed by a 29% improvement to $0.66 in the next year.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About LCID Stock?\nWhile analysts are optimistic about Lucid’s prospects, they do recommend caution. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald maintained a “Neutral” rating on the stock and a $3 price target. This reiteration was likely due to the company’s robotaxi partnership with Uber and the prospects its Gravity SUVs exhibit.\nAnalysts at Baird maintained a “Neutral” rating on the shares of Lucid, but post its Q2 results, lowered the price target from $3 to $2. The firm believes that cost reductions to improve vehicle profitability and a potential technology licensing deal will be the catalysts that Lucid needs at this time.\nWall Street analysts are cautious about LCID, giving it a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the 14 analysts rating the stock, two have given it a “Strong Buy” rating, a majority of 10 analysts are cautious with a “Hold” rating, one gave a “Moderate Sell” rating, and one has given a “Strong Sell” rating. The consensus price target of $2.76 represents a 31% upside from current levels. The Street-high price target of $7 indicates a 231% upside.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Dutta did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.\nSugar prices have some support from signs of stronger global sugar demand. China's July sugar imports surged +76% to 740,000 MT, and Pakistan recently tendered for 200,000 MT of refined sugar.\nOn August 12, NY sugar rallied to a 2.5-month high on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. On August 15, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of July fell by -0.8% y\/y to 3,614 MT, and the 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through July fell -7.8% y\/y to 19,268 MT. However, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of July increased to 54.10% from 50.32% the same time last year. Also, Conab said last month that 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported last Friday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 650.3 mm as of August 22, or 2% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices retreated through early July, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025\/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025\/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y\/y.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024\/25 sugar production rose +14% y\/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024\/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023\/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024\/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025\/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y\/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025\/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y\/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y\/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +25% y\/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025\/26 sugar production will climb +2% y\/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

That's important as the data center business made up 88% of Nvidia's overall revenue in the second quarter.\n\"We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue,\" Nvidia wrote in the filing.\nIncreasingly, analysts are looking to those cloud capital expenditure spending commitments to model the future growth of Nvidia.\n\"We see limited room for further earnings upside revision or share price catalyst in the near-term unless we have increasing clarity over upside in 2026 [cloud service provider] capex expectations,\" wrote HSBC analyst Frank Lee in a note on Thursday. He has a hold rating on the stock.\nBut Nvidia's Customer A and Customer B are not necessarily cloud providers. It's a bit of a mystery, and an Nvidia representative declined to share the identities of Customer A and Customer B.\nIn its filing, Nvidia says it has both \"direct customers\" and \"indirect customers.\" Customer A and Customer B are listed as \"direct customers.\"\nDirect customers are not the end users of Nvidia's chips. They're companies that buy the chips to build into complete systems or circuit boards that they then sell to data centers, cloud providers and end-users. Some of these direct customers are original design manufacturers or original equipment manufacturers like Foxconn or Quanta. Others are distributors or system integrators like Dell.\nIndirect customers, meanwhile, include cloud service providers, internet companies and enterprises, which typically buy systems from Nvidia's direct customers. Nvidia says it can only estimate revenue to indirect customers based on purchase orders and internal sales data.\nDeciphering if any of those cloud providers are Nvidia's mystery customers is difficult, in part because the chipmaker has wiggle room in the definitions of its direct and indirect customers.\nNvidia, for example, wrote in the filing that some direct customers buy chips to build systems for their own use.\nAdditionally, Nvidia noted that two of its indirect customers each accounted for over 10% of its total revenue, primarily buying systems through Customers A and B.\nContributing further to the mystery of it all, Nvidia said that an \"AI research and development company\" contributed a \"meaningful\" amount of revenue through both direct and indirect customers.\nNvidia told investors on Wednesday that demand for the company's AI systems remains high, not just among cloud providers, but among other kinds of customers, including enterprises buying systems for AI and \"neoclouds,\" which are companies that are taking on the biggest providers with services more tuned for AI. Nvidia also listed foreign governments, saying it would record $20 billion in revenue this year for \"sovereign AI.\" All of these product categories are contributing to Nvidia's revenue growth, Kress told analysts on an earnings call.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang also said that the company has a new forecast of $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. It said that it could take about 70% of the total cost of a $50 billion AI-focused data center, not just for its graphics processing units but for other chips it sells, too.\nHuang told investors it was a sensible target for the next five years because of how much hyperscalers were spending and committing to spend — $600 billion this year, according to Huang. He also said new kinds of customers, such as enterprises or overseas cloud providers, were joining the build-out.\n\"As you know, the capex of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years as the AI revolution went into full steam,\" Huang said.","content_hash":"fec2f30488294764890b4279b86bc256","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4632,"method_rank":0}

As of Aug. 27, its stock trades around $300, reflecting a year-to-date gain of approximately 28%, driven by robust demand in the AI and cloud computing sectors. With fiscal 2024 revenue surging 44% to reach $51.57 billion and fiscal 2025 second-quarter fiscal at $15 billion, a 20% increase — the company demonstrates strong financial momentum. However, investors must weigh both optimistic and cautious perspectives in light of evolving market dynamics. The bull case for Broadcom stems from its pivotal role in the AI boom. Analysts continue to project that AI-related revenue will grow, driven in part by the reopening of exports to China and partnerships with hyperscalers such as Google and Meta. The company's diversified portfolio, spanning semiconductors (contributing 56% of revenue) and infrastructure software, provides resilience. Earnings growth remains impressive; FY Adjusted EPS estimates of $6.65 represent nearly 152% year-on-year growth. The secular backdrop was the reason we suggested two possible positions ahead of earnings: either long stock with a low-cost collar, or a September 260 call, partially financed by the sale of the July 220\/310 strangle for a cost of $18.66 ($1,866 per spread) — which we highlighted in June . Here's what we said back then: \"If you don't own the stock, but are planning to buy it ahead of earnings, a call spread risk reversal will have characteristics similar to that of stock with a put spread collar. One may also consider extending the tenor of the long leg, turning the trade into a calendar spread as well, such as this example:\" As we look back on this trade now, the July 220\/310 strangle has of course expired, leaving only the long 260 call remaining which, thanks to the stock's appreciation, is now worth about $44 ($4,400) per contract, or ~$2,530 in profits per spread. At this point, with earnings approaching next week, it makes sense to adjust the trade for a few reasons Because the September 260 calls are \"in-the-money,\" they are behaving much like the underlying stock, without offering much of a downside buffer if the AVGO gives back some or all of its recent gains. The \"extrinsic\" premium in those options will decay, particularly after the earnings release. Even good earnings results may be greeted, as Nvidia's were, with a muted response. A lot of optimism has been baked into the AI trade, and it makes sense to reset the trade to create a buffer in the event of a pullback. The average move from the week prior to earnings through the two weeks following is ~10% over the past decade or so. Those moves have been considerably sharper recently, though. The expected move through the September expiration is about $32. I would first suggest rolling the September $260 calls up and out to the (nearly) at-the-money October $310 strike. This would take nearly $28 off the table, more than the original investment in the trade. If a trader did nothing else, they would be playing \"with house money.\" That said, a trader would reasonably be concerned with the \"vol crush\" that follows earnings, an effect that could be significantly mitigated by rolling the September long call to an October call\/spread risk reversal (example below). This trade commits just over $5 to the new position.

The total is up 2.3% from the previous quarter.\nWhile lower-income Americans are most likely to struggle with the higher costs of everyday items, a new set of surveys from the National Foundation for Credit Counseling found that over the past six months, debt issues have been affecting a growing number of Americans across all income levels.\n\"It really doesn't matter on the income level,\" said Mike Croxson, CEO of the NFCC, an organization of non-profit credit counseling agencies. \"It's really about the debt level. Because when you reach the tipping point that the interest expense exceeds what you can afford to pay, that's what gets the consumer into trouble.\"\nThe NFCC survey of 2,010 U.S. adults aged 18 and older, conducted by Harris Poll, was released in April, then updated after a follow-up survey of 2,089 individuals in early August.\n'Negative debt behaviors' cross income levels\nThere are several signs that consumers' debt struggles are getting worse.\nWhile the percentages are relatively small, the latest NFCC survey shows the share of individuals who made a credit card payment in the last six months that was less than the required minimum rose to 13% in August, up from 8% in the spring.\nThere was a similarly small increase in those who transferred debt from one card to another. The share of borrowers who consolidated credit card debt into a personal loan doubled, from 4% in the April survey to 8% in the August survey.\nThe share of those who engaged in some of these \"negative debt behaviors\" in the past six months was generally the same across income levels, from those earning less than $50,000 a year to those with annual incomes over $100,000, said Kathy Steinberg, a vice president at Harris Poll, in an email.\n\"Those in higher-earning households are less likely to be more worried about various aspects of their finances compared to six months ago,\" but still, they \"express concern,\" Steinberg said.\nCompared to six months ago, 30% of high-income consumers in the August survey are now more concerned about having enough money to cover unexpected expenses, and 20% are now more worried about making timely debt payments, she said.\nOther signs of debt strain\nOther data indicate that borrowers are increasingly falling behind on their payments, including those who are more than 90 days late. The July CreditGauge report by the credit scoring company VantageScore shows that late-stage credit delinquencies increased year-over-year across all credit tiers, including among the most credit-worthy borrowers.\n\"There are a number of things that are driving that,\" said VantageScore CEO Silvio Tavares. \"The employment environment that's worsening, and we're seeing that in late payments. But the reality is another trend, that's been going on for some time, is inflation and sustained high interest rates. Those are the other key drivers of that change.\"\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey from July found lenders have been tightening standards on credit card loans in the past several months.\nRising delinquencies and economic uncertainty are impacting lenders' decisions, Tavares said.\nHe also noted that consumer demand for mortgages and car loans has fallen in recent months.\n\"Consumers who take out mortgage loans and auto loans tend to be higher income, more affluent. Obviously, those are big purchases, and we're seeing them really throttle back their demand for those,\" said Tavares.\nPayments may be out of reach, even for higher-income consumers, he said.\nAround 15% of people buying or leasing a new vehicle have a payment of more than $1,000 a month, according to a new Experian report. The average monthly payment for a new auto loan is $749.\nSIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course on financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox. Sign up here.

That doesn't necessarily mean you're a workaholic who lacks boundaries — rather, you find ways to combine your personal and professional duties that work for you, instead of being strict and inflexible with your time.\nMorris' insight comes as young professionals are demanding more out of work, shaping new professional norms like relaxed dress codes and mental health days. Along with an inadequate salary and burnout, lack of work-life balance is one of the top reasons why Gen Zers would quit a job, according to a 2022 report from Talent LMS, a workplace training company, which surveyed over 1,200 respondents between ages 19 and 25.\nThe pursuit of work-life balance can also cause mental distress, Jeff Karp, a professor of biomedical engineering at Harvard Medical School and MIT, told CNBC Make It in September 2024.\n\"We hear these things from others, [like] trust in the process [and] balance is so important, we need more balance, it's the ultimate goal,\" Karp said. \"It ends up being very frustrating and can lead to anxiety, because we're constantly feeling like we're not in balance. There's a state we should be in [and] we're never in that state.\"\nOf course, sometimes you may actually need a complete reset, shutting off your laptop for a few days and turning your work phone off. But if your boss doesn't use their vacation time, or is constantly reaching out during your time off, unplugging can feel impossible.\nThat's why it's up to leaders to set the tone for boundaries in the office and what good work-life integration may look like.\n\"If I never take a holiday, the tone that I set for everybody is, don't take a holiday — you can't do that. And I don't think that that's right,\" says Morris. \"As leaders, we have a responsibility to role model what we expect of others.\"\n\"At the end of August, I'm going away [on vacation],\" she adds. \"And my team will all know, [so] when they're able to actually go off and do something, they should go off the grid and do it.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Here what you need to know","published_at":"2025-08-28T11:00:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_cnbc_com","source_name":"cnbc.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"Amtrak rolled out its NextGen Acela trains on Thursday, marking the next phase for the U.S.'s attempt at high-speed rail.\nDubbing itself as \"America's only high-speed rail service,\" the new trains will run between Washington, D.C., and Boston, with a top speed of 160 mph. It's an extension of Amtrak's existing Acela trains, which run through the busy Northeast corridor and operate at speeds up to 150 mph on certain sections of the route.\nAccording to Amtrak, more than 69 million passengers have traveled on Acela trains since the service began at the end of 2000. In fiscal year 2024, Amtrak said customers rode more than 3 million Acela trips, generating nearly $530 million in ticket revenue.\nThe new trains, contracted with French manufacturer Alstom, will replace the current Acela equipment. Amtrak said the NextGen Acela trains will accommodate 27% more customers and have enhanced features like free, high-speed Wi-Fi, as well as wider seats, a tilt system that enables a smoother ride and more daily departures.\nAt its launch, Amtrak said it will begin with five new trains, aiming to deploy all 28 by 2027.\n\"I think America deserves high-speed rail,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a Wednesday event with Amtrak in Washington, D.C. \"This is, at 160 miles an hour, one great step in that process.\"\nLike its predecessor, the Acela fleets offer only first class and business class seating. The rail company will operate both the older trains and newer models over the next few months as more of the NextGen trains are added.\n\"These trains are beautiful, they are fast, they are state-of-the-art, and they are American-made,\" Amtrak President Roger Harris said at the Wednesday event. \"There has never been a better way to travel by train in America.\"\nThe parts for the new trains were manufactured in 29 states, with 95% produced within the U.S., Amtrak said, adding that the manufacturing generated more than 1,200 new jobs.\nAs of 2024, Amtrak owned 16 Acela trainsets.\nA rocky track record\nThe new trains are not without struggles. Amtrak originally planned on debuting them in 2022, but faced numerous delays.\nIn May, Amtrak said it was eliminating 450 roles to save $100 million in annual costs. That came after the White House reportedly forced CEO Stephen Gardner to resign in March as President Donald Trump called for changes. Amtrak has yet to name a new CEO.\nThe rail company has also lost money for years. In fiscal year 2024, Amtrak reported $3.6 billion in revenue compared with $8.8 billion in capital and operating expenses. It recovered 84% of its operating costs with ticket sales and other revenue, Amtrak added.\nThe new trains are also significantly slower than their high-speed counterparts in Europe and Asia, with Japanese bullet trains operating at a top speed of 200 mph.\nIt's not America's first attempt at the high-speed rail, either.\nCalifornia has aimed for more than a decade to build a bullet train that can travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco in under three hours. That vision has since been trimmed, aiming to now connect just a 170-mile stretch of land with questions surrounding its viability.\nLast month, Duffy formally terminated all of the California High-Speed Rail Association's federal funding after a Federal Railroad Administration report determined that the project was unable to complete its goals, and on Tuesday, he pulled an additional $175 million from the project. The state of California has filed to sue the government for what it calls an \"illegal\" action with the canceled federal funding.\nPrivate rail company Brightline has also attempted the high-speed rail formula in Florida. The company aims to privatize the rail system and has welcomed millions of passengers on its trains, which travel at 125 mph.\nBut Brightline has had its fair share of financial struggles. The company is facing looming debt and reported a net loss of roughly $549 million in 2024, marking an uncertain road ahead.","content_hash":"1d9152b7e858e0d67a47a2d16ccea87f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3979,"method_rank":0}

Subscribe here to receive future editions in your inbox.\nHere are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:\n1. Nvincible?\nThe results are in: Nvidia reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street's expectations last night. The chipmaker also provided better revenue guidance than analysts had anticipated for the current quarter.\nHere's what else to know:\n- Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 processors to Chinese customers in the quarter, but the company did release $180 million worth of H20 inventory to a client based elsewhere.\n- Data center revenue soared compared to a year ago, but the figure still came in slightly under what analysts had forecasted.\n- Shares were down around 1% in premarket trading this morning. Read what the report means for the broader AI trade and stock market.\n- Follow live market updates.\n2. Consumer check-out\nIt's been a good morning for retailers — with one exception.\nDollar General and Best Buy both exceeded Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations before the bell. Dick's Sporting Goods also topped analysts' estimates and raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance. But Bath & Body Works reported earnings slightly below expectations for its second quarter.\nThe retail reports come at the tail-end of the corporate earnings season. More than 97% of S&P 500 companies have already shared results, according to FactSet. Of those, FactSet found that more than eight out of every 10 have beaten the Street's forecasts.\n3. Shot shift\nRegulators approved the latest round of Covid vaccines yesterday, but only cleared the shots for people at higher risk of severe illness from the virus.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the shots are available for \"all patients who choose them\" after they consult with doctors. But as of now, as CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino reports, it isn't clear how easy it will be to get a vaccine, or if insurance plans will still cover them for healthy adults.\nJust hours after the announcement, the White House said it fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez after she refused to resign. At least four other officials also announced their resignations yesterday, a massive shakeup for the agency.\n4. Dark web\nSports fans who watch games on YouTube TV got good news yesterday amid Google's tiff with Fox. The platform's parent company and the broadcast network said they came to an agreement that provides a short-term extension, meaning Fox's channels won't go dark on YouTube just yet. Google did not say how long the extension would last.\nThe tech company also made headlines yesterday for other reasons. In an all-hands call last week — the audio of which was reviewed by CNBC's Jennifer Elias — Brian Welle, Google's vice president of people analytics and performance, said the company had cut 35% of managers overseeing small teams over the last year.\nCEO Sundar Pichai at the meeting emphasized the need for Google to \"be more efficient as we scale up.\"\n5. Swift lift\nYes, we're still talking about Taylor Swift's engagement. In our defense, the stock market is too.\nSignet Jewelers surged more than 6% yesterday, building on its initial pop following Swift's announcement on Tuesday. Shares of Ralph Lauren, whose clothing appeared to be worn by both Swift and fiancé Travis Kelce in their engagement photos, also rose for another session.\nAmerican Eagle shares meanwhile rallied 8.5% after the retailer announced a collaboration with Kelce and Tru Kolors, his sportswear brand. It of course marks the latest celebrity campaign for American Eagle: The company's denim ads starring actress Sydney Sweeney earlier this month stirred controversy and roiled the stock.\n— CNBC's Laya Neelakandan, Annika Kim Constantino, Jennifer Elias and Kif Leswing contributed to this report.","content_hash":"5d28066cea60fc6edeef4d5b162f4059","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3906,"method_rank":0}

Industry contacts have told the firm for the last few years that hyperscale customers deploying AI were experimenting with AMD’s technology as a “price check” to Nvidia (NVDA), “nothing more,” but contacts over the last month have increasingly noted that hyperscalers now are working with AMD in a partnership manner, the firm tells investors.\n-\nArete upgraded Qualcomm (QCOM) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $200, up from $172.

The firm is “modestly more constructive” on self-storage real estate investment trusts following the Q2 reports due to “modest” buy-side expectations into 2026 and “achievable” 2025 outlooks.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n-\nNew Street downgraded PDD Holdings (PDD) to Neutral from Buy with an unchanged price target of $120 post the Q2 report.

That would be similar to the arrangement made with the European Union.\n\"We have confirmed with the United States that a sincere and prompt implementation of the Japan-US agreement is vital,\" he said on Thursday.\nSeparately, Bank of Japan board member Junko Nakagawa said on Thursday that although tariff negotiations between the two sides have resulted in an agreement, many uncertainties remain.\nHe warned that exports and industrial production are projected to be negatively affected in Japan \"for the time being,\" saying that there will be a \"reactionary decline\" in light of front-loading from U.S. tariffs.\nCorporate profits are also expected to decline, mainly in the manufacturing sector, Nakagawa said, \"reflecting the effects of the deterioration in export profitability due to the increase in U.S. tariffs and of the slowdown in overseas economies.\"\nInvestment package on the table\nReuters had earlier reported that also on the agenda for Akazawa's trip was a written confirmation of the details of Japan's $550 billion investment package for the U.S. in exchange for reduced tariffs on imports.\nThat comes after U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a Fox News interview on Monday stateside that the U.S. will make an announcement regarding the package.\nThe $550 billion package was announced as part of Tokyo's deal with the U.S. in July, which saw so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on Japanese exports lowered to 15% from 25%. Tariffs on Japan's key automobile sector were also cut to 15%.\nHowever, sticking points emerged over the $550 billion investment package, with Trump touting the package as \"our money to invest, as we like.\"\n\"Some people are saying Japan is simply handing over $550 billion,\" Akazawa said after the trade deal was announced. \"But such claims are completely off the mark,\" according a to Reuters report on July 25.\nAkazawa also reportedly said that the returns would be split between Japan and the United States, according to the degree of contributions by each side, while recognizing the U.S.' willingness to contribute a larger share.","content_hash":"6810cafb2bd128ac20227b2238428a07","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3502,"method_rank":0}

The total universe of US-domiciled ETFs sits at about 4,300, compared with 4,200 US stocks, Bloomberg reported. There are now more than 250 single-stock ETFs on the market, most of which are leveraged, according to data from CFRA Research. Of more than $23 billion in the leveraged single-stock ETF category, the most-targeted companies are Tesla (nearly $7.7 billion in such ETFs) and NVIDIA ($6 billion), said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF research and analytics at CFRA Research. Asset managers have also been building out other niche categories, like defined outcome and buffered ETFs.\nInvest in Gold\n“These categories have had some success with investors. And as a result, we’ve seen this almost ‘gold-rush’ mentality,” Ullal said. “We are still very much in the launch-and-see-what-works phase.”\nREAD ALSO: What’s Behind Tuttle Capital’s 21 New Option Income ETFs and Emerging Markets Are Heating Up. Here’s What It Means for US Investors\nMild, Mild West\nThe next few years will show what works and what doesn’t. Asset managers tend to give their products two or three years to determine whether they are viable, meaning they can attract enough assets to offset the costs of running strategies. Just this month, companies have filed for dozens of new leveraged single-stock ETFs, focusing on securities ranging from stock in Starbucks and Lululemon Athletica to crypto such as Dogecoin and Sui. The 138 leveraged single-stock ETFs on the market as of the end of July represented nearly $22 billion in total assets and had brought in about $3.2 billion in net sales year to date, according to data from Morningstar.\nIssuers keep prepping new strategies:\n-\nThemes this month filed with the SEC for 16 new 2X leveraged single-stock ETFs, following a separate set of 15 such products it prepped in May.\n-\n21Shares filed for a pair of 2X leveraged ETFs: one focused on Dogecoin and another on Sui.\n-\nDefiance has Leveraged Long + Income XRP and SOL ETFs in the works. It also filed for four additional Defiance Daily Target 2X Long ETFs, focused on American Eagle Outfitters, Bullish, DoorDash and Moderna.\nExchange Traded Freedom: Expect even more leveraged single-stock ETFs and specialty products before issuers slow down. “A lot of the providers have seen success in some of their very niche ETFs … There is a lower bar for profitability on these products,” said Morningstar manager research analyst Zachary Evens, who noted that a colleague calls the product strategy a spaghetti cannon, a play on the “throwing spaghetti against the wall and seeing what sticks” cliche. Most long-term investors may be better suited to low-cost passive ETFs with long track records, but there is an abundance of options, he said, comparing it to that of a supermarket. “You can buy pretty much anything you want at the grocery store,” he said. “But should you have it? That can be up for debate.”\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

With the end of August in touching distance, the largest cryptocurrency seems set to close the month in the red, as it has done for the past three years.\nStill, that's the best August return since 2021, and there are signs in the options market that gains may be coming before the month-end expiry.\nBitcoin and ether options worth over $14.6 billion are set to expire Friday with the “max pain” level at $116,000. Max pain is the strike price at which the largest number of options expire worthless, generally causing the greatest financial pain to option holders and greatest benefit to options sellers. That's above the current price, so sellers have an incentive to push BTC higher toward that level to minimize their costs.\nThe CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader market, has added 3.2% in the past 24 hours and the CoinDesk 80, which encompasses a large swathe of smaller tokens, rose 4%.\nFor the longer term, bitcoin's 200-day moving average has just crossed above $100,000. BTC has been trading above the 200-day level since the end of April, underscoring the strength of its long-term uptrend.\nThe 200-day moving average is a long-term trend indicator that smooths price action over roughly six months, helping investors distinguish between bullish and bearish market conditions.\nDerivatives Positioning\n-\nBitcoin open interest (OI) across top derivatives venues has started to slip, which is in line with the downward price action over the past few days, implying traders are actively exiting their leveraged positions.\n-\nBTC OI now stands at $30.3 billion, just shy of the all time high at $32.6 billion, Velo data shows. Three-month annualized basis is still rising, and is currently 8%- 9% across all exchanges, implying that the basis trade is still profitable.\n-\nIn options, bitcoin's upward-sloping implied volatility curve suggests the market expects long-term volatility to be higher than short-term, while other metrics point to a more immediate bearish outlook.\n-\nSpecifically, the recent move of the 25 delta skew into negative territory for near-term maturities indicates a clear shift in market sentiment, with traders paying a premium for puts over calls to gain downside protection.\n-\nThe bearish sentiment is confirmed by the 24-hour put\/call volume, which shows a significant skew towards puts, another sign traders are actively hedging against or speculating on a price decline.\n-\nFunding rate APRs across major perpetual swap venues are starting to bounce back at around 8%-10% annualized, according to Velo data.\n-\nBTC annualized funding on Binance turned negative (-0.39%) for a short period today before bouncing back to around 10%. This indicates that while there may have been pockets of bearish sentiment, the overall market trend is starting to be more supportive by traders willing to pay a premium to bet on a price increase.\n-\nCoinglass data shows $266 million in 24 hour liquidations, skewed 58% towards shorts. ETH ($99 million), BTC ($47 million) and SOL ($20 million) were the leaders in terms of notional liquidations. The Binance liquidation heatmap indicates $111,593 as a core liquidation level to monitor in case of a price rise.","content_hash":"97df767d4c3516f214bd6d5ef68ab3f4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3305,"method_rank":0}

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.4%, crossing the 6,500 level for the first time as it set a second-consecutive all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ticked up 0.2%, enough to notch its own record.\nThe government said US GDP rose 3.3% in the second quarter, a surprise bump up from its first estimate and a broad rebound from the 0.5% dip in Q1. That was due to a variety of factors — notably, a decrease in imports that followed a Q1 import surge to \"front-run\" tariffs, as well as a healthy pickup in consumer spending. Meanwhile, jobless claims fell as layoffs remained low.\nAnother economic test looms on Friday, with the July reading on PCE consumer inflation, closely watched by the central bank, due in the morning.\nInvestors were also watching the ongoing dispute between Trump and Cook. On Thursday, Cook sued the president after refusing to bow to his termination letter earlier this week — the biggest test yet of the central bank’s independence from executive branch influence.\nMeanwhile, the initial cloud over Nvidia lifted as investors dug into its quarterly report, seen as a test of the AI trade driving stock gains this year. The chipmaker's shares closed down nearly 0.8%, paring bigger immediate post-earnings losses, as the company's disappointing data center sales and uncertainty over its future in China overshadowed its earnings beat.\nNvidia stressed that demand for its AI chips — which power applications like ChatGPT remotely from data centers — is healthy, countering recent fears of an AI bubble about to burst. CEO Jensen Huang touted \"extraordinary\" demand for the company's Blackwell AI GPUs (graphics processing units).\nHuang also told Yahoo Finance that the company is getting \"fired back up\" to sell chips into the $50 billion China AI market following a short-lived export ban, though geopolitical uncertainty remains an overhang on that opportunity.\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 26 updatesGDP grows at 3.3% annualized pace in Q2, in bump from previous estimate\nUS GDP grew at a 3.3% annualized pace last quarter, according to the government's second estimate released Thursday. That's a bump up from the 3.0% from its first estimate, and also higher than the 3.1% forecast.\nThe GDP growth comes after the US economy shrank at a 0.5% annualized pace in the first quarter.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks GDP, said the Q2 bump \"primarily reflected a decrease in imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, and an increase in consumer spending.\"\nPresident Trump's tariffs have upended the economic landscape, with imports surging — thus subtracting from GDP — in Q1 as businesses and consumers attempted to \"front-run\" tariff-related price increases.\nIn other economic data, initial jobless claims fell slightly from last week, coming in at 229,000 compared to 234,000 the week prior. As layoffs remained low, however, hiring also is staying tepid.","content_hash":"e4c0ea1f572afab4f761d55a8d828991","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3290,"method_rank":0}

Nvidia's latest results helped the send major indexes to about a 0.25% loss early Thursday before the S & P 500 rallied to end the day above 6,500 for the first time. On Monday, stocks sold off but have spent the next three days moving higher. One strategy for investors looking to ride out any near-term crosscurrents, however, might be to look to steady, long run \"compounders\" and outperformers, according to Trivariate Research. While U.S. stock indexes are on track for a fourth straight winning month, traders are still grappling with several concerns around the strength of the tech stock rally, the effect of tariffs on consumer spending and inflation and President Donald Trump's interference with the U.S. central bank and pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. \"Because of large market volatility, several investors have told us they are going to just buy compounders and wait out the near-term noise,\" Adam Parker, Trivariate Research founder and CEO, said in a recent note to clients.\" To find strong multi-year stock opportunities, Trivariate looked at four key growth metrics: gross margin growth, revenue growth, net margin growth and prior price momentum. \"Of the four signals we studied, buying stocks in the top 10% of consistent previous gross margin expansion resulted in the best subsequent stock performance,\" Parker wrote. Parker, the former chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, identified more than three dozen companies that have increased gross margins every quarter for 12 consecutive quarters. Of those, 22 are forecast to continue to boost gross margins in coming quarters, he said. Take a look at some of those stocks below: E-commerce giant Amazon was the largest company on the screen by market capitalization, and qualifies as a steady gross margin grower. Amazon has an annual gross profit margin of 48.85%. Amazon shares are up more than 4% this year through Wednesday, lagging \"Magnificent 7\" tech peers like Google parent Alphabet , Meta and Nvidia . Amazon in late July released better-than-expected financial results for its second quarter, along with light operating income guidance for the current quarter. Electrical equipment makers Eaton and Amphenol are other stocks that investors can look to for long-term outperformance, according to Trivariate. Eaton has been a data center play, surging 21% in the past six months, nearly twice the return in the S & P 500. Wall Street is sticking by Eaton even after shares sold off on a disappointing third-quarter outlook. Of the 32 analysts who cover Eaton, 21 rate it a strong buy or buy, while 11 peg it at no more than a hold. Eaton's annual gross margin is about 38%. Coupang , Airbnb and AT & T were other companies tagged as offering reliable, long-term growth in gross margins. Shares of Coupang, the leading e-commerce platform in South Korea, have jumped more than 28% year to date through Wednesday. Josh Brown and Sean Russo of Ritholtz Wealth Management recently spotlighted Coupang as a stock with room to run. Over the past two years, Coupang has widened gross margins by 4.8 percentage points and and EBITDA margins by 1.9 points, they said.","content_hash":"2dae062b8dc843720c4f6fc3b526acb2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3268,"method_rank":0}

Shares of EchoStar surged on news of the deal, the proceeds of which it said will go toward retiring debt and funding its growth operations. AT&T, meanwhile, says the splurge will help fuel its 5G ambitions.\nREAD ALSO: Apple Hits the Jackpot as Google Ducks Antitrust KO and Macy’s Makeover Smoothes Out Earnings-Related Worry Lines for Investors\nIf You’re Not Fourth, You’re Last\nEchoStar’s 5G ambitions date to 2019 and are a byproduct of another major telecom deal, T-Mobile’s acquisition of Sprint. When reviewing that mega-merger, the US Department of Justice wanted to preserve access for US wireless customers to a fourth major carrier. Dish (which spun off from EchoStar in 2008, only to merge back into the parent company in 2023) entered the fray by acquiring prepaid wireless provider Boost Mobile and certain Spectrum assets from Sprint and T-Mobile for approximately $5 billion.\nIn the following years, Dish and EchoStar spent billions of dollars to build out their 5G network, which the reconciled couple said in Federal Communications Commission filings last year reached roughly 80% of Americans. The big problem? Nobody uses it:\n-\nBoost Mobile has lost customers since Dish acquired it, servicing around 7 million wireless customers, down from around 9 million in 2020. And while that technically makes it the fourth-largest mobile carrier, it’s far from being the major competitor the FCC sought. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T each have well north of 100 million subscribers, and together, they control more than 90% of the US market.\n-\nIn April, Elon Musk even complained to the FCC that EchoStar was essentially hogging precious airwave space for no reason. Shortly after, the agency opened an investigation into the company’s allegedly slow buildout toward becoming a true No. 4, which FCC Chair Brendan Carr indicated in July isn’t necessarily a “magic number.”\nExit Strategy: There have been more bumps for EchoStar. In May, the company copped to skipping a $326 million cash interest payment amid the FCC probe, while sources told The Wall Street Journal in June that the company was even considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Which is why its exit now is hardly surprising, especially given the price. According to a New Street Research note to clients seen by Bloomberg on Tuesday, AT&T is paying $9 billion more than EchoStar paid for the spectrum and about $5 billion more than the appraised value used in securitizing the assets. New Street called the sale price “a great mark-on value,” and EchoStar’s share price spiked 70% on Tuesday, following the news. All in all, not a bad payday for a distant fourth, though definitely not what Congress had in mind.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TSLA. Tesla, Inc. 's share was trading at $323.90 as of August 20th. TSLA’s trailing and forward P\/E were 192.80 and 175.44 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nTesla’s Q2 2025 earnings highlight a company in transition, where short-term financial stagnation masks the potential of a much larger structural opportunity. Revenue and cash from operations have been largely flat since late 2022, yet this is less relevant if Tesla succeeds in becoming the dominant Physical AI platform. The strategy hinges on putting the most cars on the road, thereby collecting unmatched data to train the leading Physical AI model.\nTesla’s Robotaxi program, now surpassing 7,000 miles of operations in Austin, has become the company’s top KPI, signaling the importance of autonomy over near-term profits. While the repeal of the $7,500 IRA EV credit will pressure growth in the coming quarters, deliveries rose 14% year-over-year and automotive revenue increased 19%, supported by strong demand for the new Model Y. Looking ahead, the launch of new affordable Tesla models by Q4 2025 should accelerate adoption, echoing the efficiency gains last seen in 2020 that transformed Tesla into a free cash flow powerhouse. Elevated CapEx has pressured operating cash flow, but this investment is necessary to scale new models and drive the Physical AI opportunity.\nWith $36 billion in cash against $13 billion in debt, Tesla retains financial flexibility to weather near-term challenges while pursuing long-term autonomy leadership. Ultimately, the thesis rests on whether Tesla expands Robotaxi operations and executes on new models, both of which could unlock a step-change in value. As Elon Musk noted, Tesla is moving from a pre-autonomy world to a post-autonomy one, positioning the company for a potentially massive revaluation.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) by Oliver | MMMT Wealth in April 2025, which highlighted weak deliveries, margin compression, and lack of FSD revenue while focusing on Tesla’s long-term AI and autonomy ambitions. The stock has appreciated ~38% since then as autonomy gains traction. Antonio Linares shares a similar view but emphasizes Robotaxi expansion and affordable model launches.\nTesla, Inc. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 104 hedge fund portfolios held TSLA at the end of the first quarter which was 126 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

(Nasdaq: SBET), one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Ether, reported a substantial increase in its digital asset reserves.\nThe company announced it has acquired 56,533 ETH at an average price of $4,462, lifting its total holdings to 797,704 ETH, valued at approximately $3.7 billion.\nThe expansion shows SharpLink’s ongoing commitment to Ethereum adoption and its long-term treasury strategy, launched earlier this summer.\n“Our regimented execution of SharpLink’s ETH treasury strategy continues to demonstrate the strength of our vision and the commitment of our team,” said Co-Chief Executive Officer Joseph Chalom.\n“With nearly 800,000 ETH now in reserve and strong liquidity available for further acquisitions, our focus on building long-term value for stockholders while simultaneously supporting the broader Ethereum ecosystem remains unwavering,” adds Chalom.\nStrong Capital Position from ATM Facility\nThe company’s At-the-Market (ATM) facility played a central role in fueling the latest purchases. SharpLink raised $360.9 million in net proceeds during the week of August 18–22, giving the company a robust cash position. Approximately $200 million remains undeployed, earmarked for additional ETH acquisitions in the near term.\nThis capital influx highlights institutional confidence in SharpLink’s aggressive treasury program. Since June 2, 2025, when the initiative began, the firm has consistently converted fiat proceeds into ETH, boosting its concentration ratio on a cash-converted basis above 4.00 — more than doubling in just over two months.\nGrowing Rewards Through ETH Staking\nAlongside its purchases, SharpLink continues to benefit from Ethereum’s proof-of-stake yield. The company’s staking rewards reached 1,799 ETH since the program’s launch, adding another layer of revenue generation on top of its growing digital asset base.\nWith nearly 800,000 ETH locked, the compounding rewards could become a meaningful driver of value for shareholders.\nAnalysts note that SharpLink’s dual approach — aggressive acquisitions combined with staking yield — sets the company apart as one of the most committed corporate advocates of Ethereum’s ecosystem.\nShareholder Returns Bolstered by $1.5B Buyback\nIn addition to expanding its ETH treasury, SharpLink’s Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program on August 18, 2025. The buyback plan shows confidence in the company’s long-term financial outlook and complements its ETH-driven growth model.\nBy simultaneously returning capital to investors and scaling its ETH exposure, SharpLink aims to balance shareholder value with forward-looking digital asset adoption. With a strong liquidity buffer and clear strategic direction, the company positions itself at the forefront of corporate crypto treasury management.\nRead original story SharpLink Acquires 56,533 ETH After $360.9M Raise by Tanzeel Akhtar at Cryptonews.com","content_hash":"b584db7b2cb31f96e2c1c152edefe535","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2936,"method_rank":0}

These companies can provide you with a solid base return that tends to grow over time as they increase their earnings and dividend payments. That combination of dividend income and earnings growth has historically added up to a much higher total return over the long term compared to non-dividend payers.\nConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) and VICI Properties (NYSE: VICI) are two rock-solid dividend stocks worth adding more of right now or adding to your portfolio if you don't already hold them. Here's what makes them stand out.\nThe fuel to deliver high-octane dividend growth through the end of the decade\nConocoPhillips is on the cusp of a major growth wave. The oil and gas producer has invested heavily to transform its business into a cash-flow growth machine. It currently has decades of inventory with a supply cost below $40 a barrel. As a result, it's producing lots of free cash flow at the current oil price point in the upper $60s. Meanwhile, its long-cycle investments in liquified natural gas (LNG) and Alaska should fuel robust free-cash-flow growth over the coming years.\nThe company's 2024 merger with Marathon Oil has paid off even more than anticipated. The oil giant initially expected to capture $500 million in annual cost savings within the first year of closing the deal, which it subsequently doubled to $1 billion. It now expects to deliver $1 billion in additional cost and margin enhancements from this merger by the end of next year. On top of that, its investments in a trio of global LNG projects and Willow development in Alaska should add another $6 billion in incremental free cash flow to its annual total by 2029.\nThis surge in free cash flow will give ConocoPhillips more fuel to increase its already attractive dividend (at over 3%, it's more than double the S&P 500's 1.2% yield). The company intends to deliver dividend growth within the top 25% of companies in the S&P 500 in the future. That high-octane growth rate from a company that already offers a high-yielding payout makes it a very attractive dividend stock to add to these days.\nThe high-end dividend growth should continue\nVICI Properties has built one of the country's largest experiential real estate portfolios. The real estate investment trust (REIT) invests in market-leading gaming, hospitality, wellness, entertainment, and leisure destinations. It leases the properties it owns to high-quality operating companies under long-term, triple-net leases (NNN), an increasing percentage of which escalates rents at rates tied to inflation (42% this year, rising to 90% by 2035). As a result, VICI Properties generates very stable and steadily rising rental income.","content_hash":"2766bc7b4c50270c13e1d491ca9edb5b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2917,"method_rank":0}

Here's what investors need to know today.\n1. US Stock Futures Near Flat Ahead of Nvidia Earnings\nU.S. stock futures are little changed as traders await the closely watched earnings report from AI powerhouse Nvidia after the bell today, which may spark big market moves. Futures associated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq are fractionally higher after each index gained Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is edging higher to trade at around $111,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury is near flat. Oil and gold futures are declining.\n2. Nvidia Expected to Report Soaring Q2 Revenue After Bell\nInvestors are watching Nvidia (NVDA) ahead of its highly anticipated second-quarter report after markets close today. The AI chipmaker is projected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.02 on revenue that jumped more than 50% year-over-year to $46.52 billion, according to consensus estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Nvidia is expected to post its biggest post-earnings stock move in a year, according to recent options pricing. Nvidia shares are up less than 1% in premarket trading.\n3. US Tariffs on India Double to 50% in Response to Russian Oil Purchases\nU.S. tariffs on India doubled to 50% early Wednesday in response to the country's oil purchases from Russia. President Donald Trump has sought to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, and has been using tariffs to apply pressure to countries that provide support to Russia. Earlier this month, Trump announced that India would face an additional 25% tariff on top of existing \"reciprocal\" tariffs of 25%, and the Indian government in response said that the tariff was \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"\n4. Cracker Barrel Stock Jumps as Company Restores Original Logo After Controversy\nCracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBRL) shares are surging nearly 6% in premarket trading after the company announced Tuesday night it would restore its original logo, potentially ending the controversy that angered some fans of the restaurant. President Trump weighed in on the controversy earlier yesterday, arguing that the restaurant chain should return to its original logo. Shortly after, the company announced it was returning to the original logo, earning praise from Trump. \"Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!\" Trump wrote.","content_hash":"7a045197af956d166eeb64a6d907aedc","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2907,"method_rank":0}

Realized cap: measuring new capital inflows\nRealized cap tracks the net USD-denominated capital invested in a token, reflecting the cumulative cost basis of all holders. Since the cycle low in November 2022, ETH has absorbed over $81 billion in fresh capital inflows, pushing its realized cap to a new all-time high of $266 billion as of August 8th, 2025.\nFor context, this represents a 43% increase for ETH over the period — substantial, but still well below bitcoin’s 136% rise in realized cap. The slower growth rate suggests that while ETH has been attracting meaningful new investment, there may still be ample room for expansion as institutional interest accelerates.\n2. Unhedged spot ETH ETF demand: tracking institutional allocation\nIn our bitcoin study, we developed a method to estimate genuine institutional demand by isolating ETF inflows not tied to hedged arbitrage trades. Applying this framework to ETH shows that 80–90% of spot ETH ETF inflows are likely genuine institutional allocations, with the remainder driven by arbitrage strategies — long spot positions hedged via CME futures to capture price differentials.\nInterestingly, the proportion of arbitrage-related flows is much higher for ETH than bitcoin, where only around 3% of spot ether ETF inflows are estimated to be arbitrage-based. This highlights that institutional allocation to ETH still lags behind BTC, though we expect this gap to close gradually with the recent influx of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.","content_hash":"55a23ecb8f9c783b03868288a511ad65","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2896,"method_rank":0}

Unlike the retail-driven chaos of 2021, today’s crypto market is heavier, more selective, and increasingly shaped by political and institutional forces.\nAccording to FBS analysts, liquidity is no longer flowing freely across the entire market. Instead, it is concentrating at the top — in tokens with both strong fundamentals and political leverage. By mid-2025, the top 10 altcoins already captured over 70% of the total altcoin market cap, compared to less than 50% in 2021.\nThe turning point, analysts note, has been U.S. policy. Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has pushed through the most pro-crypto agenda in U.S. history. His administration’s executive order opening 401(k) retirement plans to digital assets, alongside new legislation and crypto-friendly regulators, has created a fast lane for institutional adoption.\n“Altseason 2025 won’t be defined by retail speculation. Political pipelines and institutional flows are shaping it,” FBS analysts explain. “The winners are likely to be projects with direct access to this liquidity, not random microcaps.”\nAmong the tokens positioned to benefit are:\n-\nSolana (SOL), boosted by political ties, ETF narratives, and strong technical momentum.\n-\nOndo (ONDO), a leader in tokenized real-world assets with backing from Coinbase, BlackRock, and regulatory alignment.\n-\nSui (SUI) — recently added to WLFI’s strategic reserve, with backing from Trump-linked investors.\n-\nWLFI (World Liberty Financial) — a Trump-branded project preparing a publicly listed treasury vehicle, potentially opening the door to wider institutional access.\n-\nDogecoin (DOGE), retaining cultural staying power with support from high-profile figures.\nThe analysis stresses that while altseason is still ahead, traders should not expect “buy anything and it goes 100x” scenarios. Instead, liquidity will be directed toward a curated shortlist of politically connected and institutionally viable tokens.\n“Crypto is entering a new era,” FBS concludes. “Market cycles are increasingly shaped by institutions and policy, not just retail enthusiasm.”\nUsers can read the full analysis here.\nDisclaimer: This material does not constitute a call to trade, trading advice, or recommendation, and is intended for informational purposes only.\nAbout FBS\nFBS is a global brand that unites several independent brokerage companies under the licenses of FSC (Belize), CySEC (Cyprus), and ASIC (Australia).

In light of this divergence, gold could be a perfect hedge, and the precious metal has soared (along with broader markets) for a reason this year.\nWhile the structural outlook for gold looks positive amid the central bank buying spree, near unsustainable fiscal positions in many major economies, and structural geopolitical tensions, there are a few reasons to be tactically bullish in the short term. These include\n-\nMonetary policy easing: Powell has signaled rate cuts, and a 25-basis point cut at next month’s Fed meeting looks like the most likely outcome. Since gold is a non-interest-bearing asset, rate cuts are theoretically positive for the yellow metal.\n-\nTrump-Fed Tussle: On more than one occasion, most recently during his Jackson Hole speech, Powell has said that the Fed works without any political interference. However, the tussle between the Fed and President Donald Trump looks set to intensify after he removed Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, who has questioned the president’s “authority to do so.” Central bank independence is a hallmark of all modern economies, and any signs to the contrary are negative for markets and Treasuries, while being a positive for gold.\n-\nTariff threats: The U.S. has issued draft rules putting 50% tariffs on India for the country’s purchase of Russian oil. Trump has also threatened China with 200% tariffs if the country curbs exports of rare earths. Additionally, the president has talked about higher tariffs on countries that have a digital tax targeting U.S. tech giants. While markets don’t really expect Trump to walk the talk (at least in entirety), the tariff threats are back, which are supportive of gold.","content_hash":"9c8485388cf088b0071d9c5e606ac855","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2855,"method_rank":0}

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Banking Dive newsletter.\nA co-founder of the fintech Aspiration Partners faces up to 40 years in prison after pleading guilty to two charges of wire fraud, the Justice Department announced last week.\nAspiration co-founder Joe Sanberg’s actions fleeced $248 million from investors and lenders, the DOJ said.\nSanberg and fellow board member Ibrahim AlHusseini promised shares of Sanberg’s stock in the fintech to two lenders to obtain $145 million in loans in 2020 and 2021, the DOJ said. The two board members falsified bank and brokerage statements to inflate AlHusseini’s assets by tens of millions of dollars to secure the loans, the department said.\nFurther, Sanberg – it appeared – recruited companies and individual investors to sign letters of intent with Aspiration in which they pledged tens of thousands of dollars per month for tree planting services, the DOJ said, citing court documents. Sanberg, however, concealed that these payments came from Sanberg rather than from the customers, the DOJ said, adding that the co-founder instructed employees not to contact the customers.\nThe fintech booked revenue from Sanberg’s customers from March 2021 to November 2022, but Sanberg did not disclose that he was the source of the payments, the DOJ said.\nThat falsely inflated the revenue in Aspiration’s financial statements, the department asserted. Aspiration filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March.\nSanberg also misstated Aspiration’s financial condition in materials, including a fabricated letter from the fintech’s audit committee indicating the company had $250 million in available cash and equivalents when Aspiration counted less than $1 million in available cash, the DOJ said.\n“This so-called ‘anti-poverty’ activist has admitted to being nothing more than a self-serving fraudster, by seeking to enrich himself by defrauding lenders and investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars,” Bill Essayli, acting U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, said in a statement Aug. 21.\nAspiration launched in 2013 as a neobank focused on sustainable and green investing. It had aimed to go public in 2021 through a special-purpose acquisition company merger that valued the company at $2.3 billion.\nSanberg’s fellow co-founder, Andrei Cherny, stepped down as CEO of Aspiration in 2022. The company cut more than 180 jobs in a restructuring the following year. Aspiration spun off its consumer financial services brand into a standalone company in 2024.\n“The defendant didn’t just bend the truth, he built a business on a lie to boost the company’s value and line his own pockets,” Eric Shen, inspector in charge of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Criminal Investigations Group, said in Thursday’s statement.","content_hash":"eee0d8ad21d3f971eaa2380e4c2e707f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2853,"method_rank":0}

Cook then responded, saying \"no cause exists under the law\" for Trump to fire her and vowing to stay put. Cook has not been charged with any crime.\nThe market reaction was swift\nIn the wake of the news, gold surged within shouting distance of its 52-week high as investors sought shelter. Treasury yields climbed overnight as bond investors grew jittery about the Fed's independence, while the dollar fell 0.2%. Heading into Tuesday’s market open, major indices, including the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq, edged down.\nThe market moves likely reflect investor anxiety about institutional stability. Trump's attempts to oust Cook marks the first time in the Fed's 111-year history that a president has attempted to fire a governor, and legal experts question whether he has the authority to do it.\nThe law requires Fed officials be removed only \"for cause\"— typically severe wrongdoing in office. A recent Supreme Court decision strengthened the Fed's legal protections, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity\" shielded from presidential mass firings.\nCrisis comes amidst broader attack\nThe chaos comes as Trump wages a broader campaign against the central bank, demanding rate cuts. And the irony is stark: Just last week, Powell signaled a rate cut may be on the way . “The baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” Powell said, referring to Trump’s sweeping changes to tax, trade, and immigration policy.\nBut Trump's escalating attacks, including his attempt to fire Cook, are creating the kind of market chaos and institutional uncertainty that could give Fed officials pause. Central bankers prefer clear, stable conditions when making policy decisions, not constitutional crises over their independence. By sowing doubt about the Fed's autonomy, Trump may be undermining his own goal of cheaper money, potentially forcing Powell to delay cuts until the political storm passes.\n“It’s a massive moment for the nation and the economy. Trump’s actions suggest he has his eye on a far more ambitious prize than just replacing Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends next May. Instead, the president appears to want total control over the bank’s interest-rate setting structures,” wrote Politico’s Jack Blanchard on Tuesday morning. “Plenty of Fed watchers believe we’re seeing the greatest threat to its independence in generations.”","content_hash":"9a4f2e3f892e25317cd0d74174d4f55a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2842,"method_rank":0}

Bitcoin has fallen about 12% since hitting a record high of above $124,000 on August 14. The digital currency fell as low as $108,700 this morning, its lowest level since July 9.\nBelow, we take a closer look at Bitcoin’s chart and use technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching out for.\nPotential Bull Trap Emerges\nSince hitting its all-time high less than two weeks ago, bitcoin has reversed course, potentially laying the groundwork for a bull trap—a trading event in which prices rise before reversing sharply, leaving investors with an unexpected loss.\nIt’s also worth noting that as the pioneer cryptocurrency made a new high, the relative strength index made a comparatively shallower high to create a bearish divergence between the price and indicator, signaling waning buying interest.\nLet’s identify two key support levels on bitcoin’s chart to watch if the price continues to decline and also point out resistance areas worth monitoring during possible recovery efforts.\nKey Support Levels to Watch\nThe first lower level to watch sits around $107,000. Investors could seek to accumulate BTC near the prominent December and January peaks, an area on the chart that may flip from prior resistance to future support.\nSelling below this level could see a retracement toward the closely watched $100,000 area, currently just below the upward sloping 200-day moving average (MA). This location would likely attract buying interest near a horizontal line that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart between November and June.\nResistance Areas Worth Monitoring\nDuring recovery efforts, investors should keep track of the $117,000 area. The cryptocurrency could encounter selling pressure in this location near last week’s failed retest of the 50-day MA and a sideways trend that formed on the chart in the second half of July.","content_hash":"252f7cbb354b3739f3e035dcb1679006","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2842,"method_rank":0}

If you’re not sure where you currently stand, George Kamel, personal finance expert and popular Ramsey personality, has plenty of advice for you.\nLearn More: Here’s Why You Might Want To Invest Your Retirement Savings in a Roth 401(k)\nRead Next: 7 Tax Loopholes the Rich Use To Pay Less and Build More Wealth\nHopefully you’re already on the right track, but if not, following Kamel’s guidance can set you up for success — whatever the current state of your finances. Here’s a look at his top four tips to help you avoid financial disaster in retirement.\nDon’t Rely Solely on Social Security\nIf you’re planning to live solely off of Social Security in retirement, Kamel said this likely won’t provide you with enough money to uphold your standard of living.\nFor example, the estimated average Social Security retirement benefit, according the Social Security Administration (SSA), is around $2,000 per month. That’s a new high but still equates to just $24,000 per year.\nGiven this, Kamel said it’s important to calculate what you’ll need to live in retirement. Having a specific number to work toward — more on this next — will allow you to know exactly how much to save each month and determine what age you can afford to retire.\nFor You: 4 Retirement Expenses Boomers Didn’t Plan for — but Should Have\nSave Enough Money\nIt might sound simple, but many people retire without having enough money saved. As noted above, you need to calculate how much you’ll need in retirement — then actually commit to hitting certain savings goals each month.\nIf you start saving for retirement at age 50, you can have $1 million in a retirement account by age 70 if you save $1,160 per month — assuming an 11% rate of return — Kamel said in a Facebook post. He noted that the S&P has had an average annual return of 11% over the past 30 years.\nDiversify Your Investments\nFinancially speaking, Kamel said putting all your eggs in one basket isn’t a good idea. Since no one can perfectly predict the markets, he said it’s important to diversify your portfolio to keep it balanced.\nFor example, he advised diversifying evenly between four different types of mutual funds — growth and income funds, growth funds, aggressive growth funds and international funds. Each type of fund would get 25% of your portfolio.\n“This is the same exact portfolio that I have in my retirement account that Dave Ramsey has in his retirement account,” he said.\nDon’t Retire Too Early\nRetiring early might sound appealing, but Kamel said stepping away from the workforce too soon can be detrimental to your finances. Specifically, if you’re under 59 1\/2 years old, he noted that you’ll have to pay penalties on withdrawals from retirement accounts, and you’ll also miss out on compound interest.","content_hash":"f30a51c50d54ce5e23f990743aed2c24","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2838,"method_rank":0}

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a productivity software firm whose shares have struggled as investors remain skeptical about its AI products. Year-to-date, the stock has lost 17.8%, and it is down by 13.70% since Cramer’s comments in January. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s shares have struggled as the firm has failed to impress investors with its earnings, and analysts have turned bearish. For instance, Melius Research downgraded the stock to Sell in August, which led to a 2% drop in price. Cramer had warned in January that Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s AI products weren’t being well received by the market:\n“Well I think that Adobe’s AI, I have to like Firefly very much. But this Canva product, I mean Canva is still, it’s so, the suite of Adobe products, it’s still, it’s so expensive. It’s fantastic. And any pro would never use a Canva. But when we, if Canva gets taken up in the design schools in this country, it will be existential for Adobe. Which is a fantastic company. So, be aware, they are the gold standard but people are not, people look for value everywhere now and they’re cutting back on anything. I think there are people who just say you know what this is just too expensive.”\nCopyright: grinvalds \/ 123RF Stock Photo\nCramer discussed the downgrade in detail as he commented in August:\n“Alright, so, I’m going to have to just, sometimes you have to just say someone knows this better than I do. There’s a fellow by the name of Ben Reitzes… He has been coaching me, just saying, listen, understand that AI is eating software. This is a software-as-a-service company. In other words, when you buy them, when you buy Adobe, you get certain seats, you bring them in. It’s a very costly program. It is unbelievably good for graphics, okay? But there’s a new company called Figma that’s come in, and they do a lot of stuff that Adobe does for a little bit cheaper. There’s Canva, which does it for incredibly cheap. So I think that what’s really happened is, is that others have come into their market with a cheaper product that a lot of people feel is just as good, that has artificial intelligence in it, and they can’t maintain their price. So far, their price has been able to be maintained, but that’s the big worry about Adobe. And I have no answer for Adobe. None. I just don’t.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ADBE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Combined with Ethereum ETFs, nearly 5% of the market supply has been absorbed in just eight months — more than double Bitcoin’s fastest accumulation rate of 2% during Q4 of 2024.\nWith Ether trading at about $4,500, just days after it notched a fresh record, the asset is primed for an even more explosive rally, according to Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets strategy at UK-based bank, Standard Chartered.\n“ETH and the ETH treasury companies are cheap at today’s levels,” Kendrick wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday.\nHis forecast? $7,500 “by year-end.”\nKendrick’s math is pretty straightforward: when corporate treasuries hoover up supply faster than any period in crypto history, price should follow suit. And unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum buyers get a bonus — that 3% staking yield that Bitcoin can’t match.\nOther analysts have already said that Ethereum is a stronger corporate treasury play than Bitcoin.\n10% of all Ether\nTo get to $7,500, Ether will need a lot of lifting from the asset’s main buyer nowadays: treasury companies.\nIn a July note, Kendrick predicted that corporate holders would end up owning 10% of all Ethereum in circulation.

Not too bad for a guy who started by selling books online.\nUp Next: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 6 Steps I Took To Become Rich on an Average Salary\nFor You: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\nThis fortune didn’t appear overnight, though. Bezos accumulated his wealth over decades of saving, investing and navigating plenty of pitfalls and setbacks along the way. Despite obstacles, he remained focused on his goals and refining his approach to business and financial planning.\nAlong the path to obtaining billionaire status, Bezos has acquired wisdom and insight that can help other entrepreneurs looking to strike gold. Here’s what the Amazon founder has to say about building wealth — and what you can learn from it.\nDon’t Be Afraid To Think Big\nBezos has shared some knowledge about thinking big on everything from long-term investments to real estate purchases. He has always emphasized the importance of focusing less about short-term gains and more about building toward the future. This philosophy has been pivotal to Amazon’s success.\n“Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Bezos said, adding that most people get too caught up worrying about risks while missing out on huge opportunities. Instead, Bezos is a fan of playing the long game.\nConsider This: Suze Orman’s Top Tip for Building Wealth Is a ‘Very Easy One’\nKeep Your Eyes on the Money\nBezos is all about what he calls “intuition, curiosity and the power of wandering.” Sometimes you need to step back and look at the bigger picture to find outside-of-the-box solutions — even if that means being a little less efficient.\nSteps to building wealth can vary, but as long as you are putting money into your retirement accounts rather than racking up credit card debt with high interest rates, you’re on the right track.\nPut Passion Behind Your Work\nClocking in and clocking out just to earn a paycheck is one way to go about work. But Bezos knows that building real wealth requires passion — that extra something that gets you up in the morning ready to invest your whole self into your company.\nAs Bezos explained, “You can have a job, or you can have a career, or you can have a calling. And if you can somehow figure out how to have a calling, you have hit the jackpot.”\nWhile some chase trends for quick profits, Bezos encourages you to look inward and explore what you believe you can give to the world and use that drive as motivation. When work aligns with personal passion, financial success becomes a natural byproduct.","content_hash":"4d538465f1d02d8b1e876690990f2413","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2799,"method_rank":0}

Analysts polled by FactSet expected 40 cents a share.\nSales rose 4.6% to $3.03 billion and topped the $2.98 billion that Wall Street modeled.\nIn May, Hormel Foods lowered the top end of its per-share earnings guidance by a few cents for the year, and said that tariffs could dent its top line by 1 cent to 2 cents a share in the back half of the year. At the same time, the company raised the low end of sales guidance slightly, as executives expected a strong second half to its fiscal year from several parts of its food empire.","content_hash":"fe7377d6246230baa96a98c61b063645","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2798,"method_rank":0}

Grocery store giant The Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) is cutting nearly 1,000 jobs from its corporate workforce. Here’s why, and how the company’s stock is reacting.\nMost Read from Fast Company\n-\nEggs recalled after salmonella outbreak sickens nearly 100 people: Full list of products to avoid\n-\nA national lab made a nuclear fusion breakthrough. A new startup wants to make it into a power plant\nWhat’s happened?\nYesterday, Kroger interim CEO Ron Sargent said that the grocery chain would lay off hundreds of corporate workers, according to a memo seen by Fast Company.\nThe layoffs will total fewer than 1,000 employees. Kroger currently employs around 409,000 workers, the majority of whom work in its 2,700 grocery stores, which include Kroger, Food4Less, CityMarket, and more.\nIn the memo, Sargent revealed that, “In the past few months, we have all looked for ways to simplify the organization, shift resources closer to our customers, and focus on work that creates the most value.”\nHowever, the job cuts will not affect employees in the company’s stores, distribution centers, or manufacturing facilities.\nThe memo went on to say that the savings from the corporate layoffs would be reinvested in the company and used to help fund new locations, create store-level jobs, and offer price reductions to customers.\nThe layoffs and memo were reported earlier by Reuters. A Kroger spokesperson confirmed the job cuts when contacted by Fast Company.\nLayoffs follow store closures and failed merger\nThe newly announced layoffs mark another low point for Kroger over the past 12 months.\nWithin that timeframe, the company has incurred significant setbacks. The most dramatic of those is the failed merger between Kroger and Albertsons, which was valued at $25 billion.\nThe merger would have seen the two grocery store chain giants join ranks, creating a new supermarket juggernaut. This would have allowed the newly formed company to compete against grocery offerings from arch-rivals Walmart and Amazon.\nHowever, in December, a federal judge blocked the merger on anti-competition fears. The merger was later abandoned entirely and has led to legal proceedings between the companies.\nKroger has also announced this year the closure of 60 of its stores, which are expected to shutter by the end of 2026. Kroger said that the closures would provide it a “modest financial benefit.”\nKroger investors shrug off the job cuts\nDespite the devastating effect that these layoffs will have on the impacted workers, the news seems to have had no impact on Kroger’s stock price.","content_hash":"353642db824d3b84f8c75c76f3aeeb9d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2741,"method_rank":0}

Technology has advanced over time, as it tends to do, and there are now literally millions of cryptocurrencies, most of which significantly outperform Bitcoin when it comes to of transaction speeds and costs.\nDespite that, Bitcoin is still worth knowing about for investors. It's arguably the most important cryptocurrency, for one simple reason.\nBitcoin leads the crypto market by a wide margin\nThe crypto market as a whole is worth $3.9 trillion (as of Aug. 26).

The second-largest is Ethereum, which is worth approximately $550 billion todfay, and every other coin is worth under $200 billion.\nBitcoin isn't the only good crypto investment, but it has the longest track record of success and has bounced back from several bear markets. It was also the first cryptocurrency to receive spot ETF approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the first to become popular as a strategic asset in corporate treasuries, both of which have led to more inflows.\nA quality pick for a crypto portfolio\nAs a crypto investor, it can be tempting to focus on altcoins -- cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin -- because they have more room to grow.

It has also been an extraordinary stock to own in recent years. In fact, over the past five years, JPMorgan Chase has produced a 247% total return for investors, compared with 105% from the S&P 500.

When that didn't happen, the sector rebounded sharply.\nEven so, JPMorgan Chase outperformed the overall financial sector by more than 100 percentage points.\nWhy has JPMorgan Chase stock performed so well?\nFor one thing, JPMorgan Chase has continually reported strong financial results. In nearly every quarter, the bank's earnings and revenue have come in above analyst estimates.\nAlso, management has prioritized returning capital to investors, both through buybacks and dividends. The bank's outstanding share count has dropped by 10% in the past five years, and dividends account for 44 percentage points of the stock's total return over the past five years.\nFinally, JPMorgan has a history of coming out of banking crises even stronger, and that was certainly the case in 2023, when it acquired most of failed First Republic Bank's assets and deposits.\nAt the current share price, JPMorgan Chase has a market capitalization of about $812 billion.

A measure excluding volatile items and holiday travel climbed to 3.2%, from 2.5%.\nIn the month, CPI rose 0.9% from June as electricity prices jumped 13% and holiday travel and accommodation rose 5% thanks to robust demand over school holidays.\nThe bureau said the spike in electricity prices was in part due to the end of federal government electricity rebates for households in the state of New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory.\n\"This means that those households had higher out-of-pocket costs for electricity in July. In addition to this, prices rose due to annual electricity price reviews coming into effect,\" said Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics.\nNew rebates will be reflected in August data, she said.\nThat suggests the spike in electricity will partially unwind in August and seasonal travel pressures typically fade once school holidays end, said Sunny Kim Nguyen, head of Australian economics at Moody’s Analytics.\n\"Even so, the core measure, which strips out the noisy stuff, reminds us that service prices haven't fully cooled and that inflation is still hovering a little above the comfort zone.\"\nThe RBA cut interest rates this month for the third time and opened the door to more policy easing as inflation cooled.

The startup's ChatGPT assistant now reaches 700 million people a week.\nOn LMArena, Microsoft's new model was ranked 13th for text workloads on Thursday, below models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, Mistral, OpenAI and xAI.\nMicrosoft said in its blog post that the model was refined with help from around 15,000 of Nvidia's H100 graphics processing units, and it also has a working cluster of Nvidia GB200 chips.\n\"We have big ambitions for where we go next — model advancements, an exciting roadmap of compute, and the chance to reach billions of people through Microsoft's products,\" said Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft's AI unit, in a post on X.\nMicrosoft has previously developed small open-source language models under the name Phi.\nMAI-1-preview represents \"our first foundation model trained end to end in house,\" Suleyman wrote on X.\nSuleyman used to compete with OpenAI at startup Inflection. Last year, Microsoft hired him and many of his Inflection colleagues. Before that, Suleyman was a co-founder of DeepMind, an AI research startup that Google bought in 2014.\nSuleyman's group inside Microsoft has been expanding, with about two dozen people coming from Google's DeepMind AI lab in recent months.\nWATCH: OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar: Biggest issue we face is being 'constantly under compute'","content_hash":"b9d330fdecaabf033dba58bf02f4f8e3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2717,"method_rank":0}

As of 11:16 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 18.6%.\nThe catalyst that sent the cloud-based storage company higher was results that surged past expectations.\nSNOW in the forecast\nFor its fiscal 2026 second quarter (ended July 31), Snowflake generated revenue of $1.1 billion, up 32% year over year, driven by product revenue that also grew 32%. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.35, which surged 94%.\nFor context, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $1.09 billion and EPS of $0.27, so Snowflake beat expectations with room to spare.\nOther metrics helped highlight the company's solid growth. Remaining performance obligation (RPO) -- a leading indicator of future revenue -- grew to $6.9 billion, up 33%.\nSnowflake's total customer count grew to 12,062, up 19% year over year. At the same time, its most lucrative customers, those spending more than $1 million in trailing-12-month revenue, grew 30%. Snowflake also continued to expand its business with existing customers, as evidenced by its net revenue retention rate of 125%.\nA long runway ahead\nInvestors were positively giddy as Snowflake raised its full-year outlook and provided a Q3 forecast higher than expectations. Snowflake is guiding for third-quarter product revenue in a range of $1.125 billion to $1.3 billion, or growth of about 26%. The company also increased its 2026 guidance to $4.4 billion, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of $4.34 billion.

The news raised concerns about market concentration and prompted heated speculation that rivals would need to join forces to remain competitive.\nREGIONAL DUOPOLY\nThe U.S. rail industry has already undergone significant consolidation in recent decades, shrinking from dozens of carriers to six major class I railroads.\nThe U.S. freight rail industry is dominated by four top U.S.-based carriers - two in the west and two in the east. That means shippers have only two carrier options considering the point of origin.\nTop railroad operator Union Pacific, which primarily operates in the west, proposed to join Norfolk, which has a strong foothold in the east. Initially, this prompted speculation that the other two U.S.-based railroad operators - BNSF Railway in the west and CSX in the east - could merge to stay competitive against a coast-to-coast giant.\nThat game has changed in the past days. First, Buffett-backed BNSF dropped out.\nTwo large Canadian railroad companies also operate in the United States. Canadian Pacific, the only one with a tri-national network, would be the next viable candidate to merge with CSX. But Tuesday's announcement left CSX without a viable partner for a large merger.\nHIGHER REGULATORY RISKS\nThe reduced chances of a consolidation wave raises the regulatory risks for Union Pacific's attempt to buy Norfolk and go coast-to-coast.\nIf this was the only deal under review by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, regulators would have greater concerns because a single large operator could muscle out smaller regional operators.\nExpectations were different last month. When Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern disclosed they were in talks last month, board officials were gearing up to review two megamerger proposals, a person close to the discussions previously told Reuters.","content_hash":"f6b7da6e440e06b743a5a181487ba177","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2712,"method_rank":0}

That increase “was largely attributable to Capital One’s acquisition of Discover Financial Services, as accounting standards require the acquiring institution to recognize a provision expense related to certain acquired assets,” the regulator said.\nDive Insight:\nCapital One’s acquisition of Discover – the largest banking deal of the past six years – closed in the second quarter. McLean, Virginia-based Capital One reported a $4.3 billion second-quarter loss in July, as it began digesting its acquisition of Riverwoods, Illinois-based Discover.\nDiscover-related expenses in the second quarter totaled $9.4 billion, counting money set aside for some of the bank’s loans.\nCapital One – whose assets rose 34% with the purchase, to $659 billion – also said in July Discover integration costs will exceed the $2.8 billion estimate originally shared. Capital One spent about $409 million on Discover integration expenses in the first half of the year.\nThe deal was originally estimated at $35.3 billion when it was announced in February 2024, but the fair value purchase consideration was actually $51.8 billion when the deal closed May 18.\nFDIC-insured banks reported a return on assets ratio of 1.13% in the second quarter. Community bank profits rose 12.5% from the first quarter, to $7.6 billion.\nSecond-quarter loan growth increased compared to the first quarter, with total loan and lease balances growing about 2.1%, or $263.7 billion. Still, the industry’s annual rate of loan growth in Q2 was 4%, compared to the pre-pandemic average of about 4.9%, the FDIC said.\nDomestic deposits also rose, for the fourth consecutive quarter, by 0.6%, or $101.5 billion.\nThe number of banks on the FDIC’s “Problem Bank List” – lenders with a CAMELS composite rating of four or five – fell by a net of four, to 59 banks, during the second quarter. That number makes up about 1.3% of total banks, “which is in the middle of the normal range for non-crisis periods of 1 to 2 percent of all banks,” the regulator said.","content_hash":"2378504bb0dc5a67e89136d514a53a24","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2707,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on WTM. White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd.'s share was trading at $1,763.47 as of August 18th. WTM’s trailing P\/E was 22.08 according to Yahoo Finance.\nPixabay\/Public Domain\nWhite Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. (WTM) represents a compelling long-term investment opportunity, driven by the intrinsic value of its diverse portfolio and supported by strong financial fundamentals. Founded by Jack Byrne, known for revitalizing GEICO, WTM has built a reputation as a financial services holding company with operations spanning property and casualty insurance, municipal bond insurance, and asset management.\nWhile the company underperformed in the recent quarter, the investment thesis rests on the conviction that the market significantly undervalues the true worth of its businesses. Each of WTM’s core segments demonstrates resilience, with robust balance sheets, strong cash flows, and improving returns on invested capital (ROIC), creating a foundation that is not only defensive during periods of market turbulence but also positioned for meaningful value creation over time. The strength of these fundamentals underscores the company’s ability to generate durable returns, making it attractive in both steady and volatile environments.\nImportantly, the alignment of its portfolio with disciplined capital allocation principles enhances the potential for substantial upside as markets recognize the embedded value of its holdings. Despite near-term performance challenges, the long-term thesis remains firmly intact, supported by financial stability and portfolio diversity that mitigate risk while providing opportunities for strategic value realization. With its businesses positioned to deliver sustainable growth and rising profitability, WTM continues to offer investors an undervalued and underappreciated platform with significant catalysts for rerating. For patient investors, this creates a favorable risk\/reward profile, reinforcing conviction in maintaining a long-term position.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Markel Group Inc. (MKL) by Value Don’t Lie in April 2024, which highlighted its diversified insurance, investment portfolio, and Markel Ventures as key drivers of long-term value despite lagging profitability in reinsurance. The company's stock price has appreciated by approximately 6.01% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as valuation remains compelling. Stock Analysis Compilation shares a similar thesis but emphasizes WTM’s resilient balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation.","content_hash":"27743fe89a702279e13de82cdd13378d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2706,"method_rank":0}

The firm’s leadership was taken on by Principal Colin Drake, who joined in 2018 after running his own RIA, Drake Wealth Management.\nMarin is joining the larger RIA to “preserve continuity and expand client support,” such as trust and estate planning, tax and insurance guidance, and investment research, according to the announcement. The firm will take on the Wealthspire name, but Drake and Christine Cione, client service director, will continue working with clients.\nDrake referred in a statement to his former partner, Shore, and the effect his passing had on the decision to join a larger RIA.\n“After losing Dave, I knew we needed a partner we could trust to help carry this work forward,” Drake said. “Having worked with the firm’s West Coast team (at predecessor firm Private Ocean) for over a decade, the team members are already like family, and I feel confident that this relationship honors the past while preparing us for the future.”\nNew York-based Wealthspire has 25 offices in the U.S. with more than 130 advisors.

Comparatively, he said Europe has a yearly output of around 2 million, more than half of which is produced by Rheinmetall.\nThe European Union has been supporting Ukraine in its military effort to combat Russia's invasion, amid uncertainty over the U.S.' long-term plans to back Kyiv.\nEurope's \"biggest need is artillery ammunition and missiles,\" Papperger said, stressing the new plant in Unterluess will focus on both items.

In March, the company increased its financial outlook for the year, projecting revenue of $3.45 billion to $3.50 billion, up from an earlier outlook of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion.\nCracker Barrel apologizes for logo redesign\nSince the redesign-induced stock slump, CBRL shares have remained depressed, which is likely one of the reasons that the company has decided to publicly apologize for the logo change.\nYesterday, the company put out a statement saying that it “could’ve done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.”","content_hash":"1fce9b7a45f551b929c03cfb8d679660","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2698,"method_rank":0}

But xAI’s lawyers face an uphill battle in proving that Apple’s defaulting to ChatGPT on iOS harms consumers.\nMost Read from Fast Company\n-\nEggs recalled after salmonella outbreak sickens nearly 100 people: Full list of products to avoid\n-\nA national lab made a nuclear fusion breakthrough. A new startup wants to make it into a power plant\nApple has struggled to add its own advanced AI features—including a chatbot—to its operating systems for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. At its June 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple instead announced an exclusive agreement with OpenAI, making ChatGPT the default chatbot option on its devices.\nMusk and xAI argue that the deal hurts rivals, including xAI’s Grok chatbot. “Working in tandem, Defendants Apple and OpenAI have locked up markets to maintain their monopolies and prevent innovators like X and xAI from competing,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. “Plaintiffs bring this suit to stop Defendants from perpetrating their anticompetitive scheme and to recover billions in damages.”\nCurrently, iPhone users who want Grok must download its stand-alone app. Musk and xAI contend that Apple should be compelled to let users easily select any chatbot. While Apple has spoken about integrating other models such as Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, it has not acted on those talks so far.\nThe suit raises antitrust issues, but recent precedent makes such cases hard to win. Courts typically judge them based on consumer benefit—such as product quality and cost—rather than on harm to competition alone. (By one estimate, ChatGPT accounted for more than 80% of AI chatbot visits as of July.)\n“It’s also consistent with what antitrust laws are about,” says Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University. “Just because ChatGPT has 80% of the market doesn’t mean that that’s antitrust. The law doesn’t want to punish companies for products that consumers want.”\nOpenAI was first to market with a large language model-driven chatbot in late 2022, with ChatGPT hitting 100 million users in just two months. For many, “ChatGPT” became synonymous with “AI chatbot” well before its Apple deal.\nKreps notes that xAI’s lawyers must show the Apple-OpenAI partnership “meaningfully raised prices for consumers, reduced innovation, or blocked consumer choice,” which is a high bar to cross. The court may also question xAI’s standing, since it is a direct competitor.","content_hash":"cadba24645940a818deeddbbdad37d0e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2695,"method_rank":0}

Cronos launched a partnership with Crypto.com in February.\nThis latest announcement of Trump Media’s crypto expansion isn't the president's first foray into crypto finance. In January, the president’s company launched its fintech platform Truth.Fi. At the time, Nunes said, “Truth.Fi is a natural expansion of the Truth Social movement” adding that making “American First investment vehicles” is another step to helping “American patriots” protect themselves from threats from “Big Tech and woke corporations.”\nTrump also signed the GENIUS Act into law in July, which provides a framework for digital tokens backed by conventional assets such as Treasury bills or bank deposits. Then he signed an order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed it would not be purchasing more of the digital asset than was already on hand.\nThe new Trump-backed treasury firm will partially be funded by an affiliate of Yorkville, YA II PN, Ltd., with a $5 billion equity line of credit. The rest of the company’s expected funding will come from $200 million in cash, $220 million in cash-in mandatory exercise warrants, and $1 billion in CRO, which it said represents 19% of CRO’s total market cap.\nThe group said that this investment would make it the “first and largest publicly traded CRO treasury company” and the “largest digital asset treasury company to market cap ratio in history.”\nTrump Media and Crypto.com also announced a new partnership between the two on Tuesday in which Truth Social and Truth+ will offer a rewards system that uses Crypto.com’s digital wallet infrastructure and offers CRO as a utility token, a release said.\nAccording to the agreement, Trump Media plans to buy about $105 million in CRO, which it said makes up about 2% of CRO’s total market cap. Crypto.com will buy $50 million shares of Trump Media’s common stock. The release said both entities are subject to a lockup period.\nIn the future, the two plan to let Truth Social users pay for subscriptions and services with their Crypto.com CRO balance.

Institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs remain supportive of the flagship crypto, providing a solid base of demand.\nHowever, Chen sees Ethereum as better positioned to outperform. She expects ETH to trade in the $4,600–$5,200 range, as momentum builds across its ecosystem.\nEthereum’s move past $4,300 is viewed as a key breakout level, confirming strong demand for the blockchain’s utility and showing the potential start of an altcoin season.\nOne catalyst has been Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s unexpectedly dovish policy stance, which boosted risk appetite across equities, bonds, and digital assets.\nThe softer outlook for interest rates has encouraged capital rotation within crypto markets, with on-chain data showing whales selling Bitcoin to increase Ethereum exposure.\nWhale Rotation and Institutional Utility\nEthereum’s recent surge has been fueled not only by macro easing but also by growing utility across decentralized finance (DeFi) and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.\nOn-chain data shows over $2 billion of BTC converted into ETH by large holders in recent days, highlighting confidence in Ethereum’s near-term trajectory.\nThis rotation is also reinforced by Ethereum’s staking yield proposition. Unlike Bitcoin, which functions primarily as a store of value, ETH enables holders to earn passive income through staking.\nThis dual function — capital appreciation plus yield — makes ETH attractive to both long-time Bitcoin holders and institutional investors.\nKevin Rusher: Sub-$5,000 ETH Is Nearing the End\nKevin Rusher, founder of RAAC, a real-world asset borrowing and lending ecosystem, argues that Ethereum’s days below $5,000 may soon be over.\n“While the crypto market is experiencing a short-term sell-off after ETH hit an all-time high over the weekend, the market returns for ETH have been eye-popping over the medium term,” Rusher said.\nHe points out that in the past 30 days, ETH is up 17% compared with Bitcoin’s 7% decline, showing Ethereum’s relative strength. Bitcoin dominance has also slipped to 58.6%, further highlighting Ethereum’s growing role in the digital asset market.","content_hash":"2050dd58c2b7be27a8b4d5dd3e4750df","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2692,"method_rank":0}

The three indicators outlined below will help.\nYou're trying to watch KPop Demon Hunters on Netflix for the 10th time and relax before bed. Then you get the push notification:\n\"Trump says he's firing a Fed governor.\"\nThis is tough news to process so late in the evening. You want to finish the movie, but now you're worried about your money.\nIs this going to tick off foreign investors and cause them to dump the US assets you have in your portfolio? That's what happened back in April, after Trump called for Fed Chair Jerome Powell's firing. The Dow dropped 972 points in a single day.\nCould it also spur a fresh bout of inflation? That's long been a concern of Fed-watchers who have warned against easing the economy too quickly.\nEither way, you're going to have a hard time sleeping tonight.\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. What if you had a handy checklist of market signals to watch, to decide just how worried to be?\nLook no further:\n(1) The US dollar\nThe granddaddy of the currency world. The means through which so much global business activity occurs. A source of national pride and joy.\nAnd also a good barometer for how foreign investors are feeling about the US. It's pretty simple: if they don't like where things are going, they'll reduce exposure.\nThis is exactly what happened on Tuesday, amid the Lisa Cook furor, with the dollar index dropping as much as 0.3%. The same thing happened back during Powell-gate on April 21, when the greenback fell 1%.\n(2) The 30-year Treasury yield\nWhile the dollar is a good sentiment gauge, this is more of a reading of inflation expectations.\nIf investors are starting to get leery of the US's long-term prospects, they might start shedding long-dated government debt. That, in turn, pushes yields higher.\nFurther, if inflation does materialize, the Fed's best weapon for fighting it is rate hikes. Yields also rise in expectation of that.\nThat's exactly what happened on Tuesday, with the 30-year yield rising as many as five basis points. Back on the fateful day of April 21, it spiked double that amount.\nSo watch the 30-year. The more it sharply increases, the more worried to be.\n(3) Stocks\nThis is perhaps the most obvious signal. Nothing expresses investor dissatisfaction more than a good, old-fashioned stock sell-off.\nIf investors don't like what Trump is doing, they let the equity market do their talking for them. And because it's the most high-profile asset, it captures all the headlines.","content_hash":"fe564562d2ae7e8b77ed4f3e962c3423","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2675,"method_rank":0}

TXN’s trailing and forward P\/E were 35.53 and 34.72 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nTexas Instruments Inc. (TXN) is a global semiconductor leader with a focused model built around analog and embedded processing chips, deeply embedded in the industrial and automotive sectors that account for most of its revenue. These end markets are prioritized for their long product lifecycles and secular growth opportunities, giving TXN durable demand visibility and positioning it as a foundational supplier to the global economy.\nThe Analog segment, the largest revenue contributor, provides chips that manage power and translate real-world signals like sound, temperature, and pressure, while the Embedded Processing segment delivers microcontrollers and processors that serve as the digital “brains” in electronic devices. With tens of thousands of products and more than 100,000 customers, TXN benefits from a highly resilient and diversified revenue stream that reduces dependence on individual clients or markets.\nA central pillar of its strategy is its commitment to internal manufacturing, with significant long-term investments in expanding 300-millimeter wafer fabrication capacity in the U.S. This vertical integration provides TXN with a structural cost advantage, as 300mm wafers are substantially cheaper to produce, while also enhancing supply chain control, product quality, and resilience against disruptions.\nThe company complements this operational strength with disciplined capital allocation, prioritizing investments in R&D and manufacturing to reinforce competitive advantages, and then returning all excess cash to shareholders through steady dividend growth and share repurchases. This consistent framework, aimed at maximizing free cash flow per share, has long aligned TXN with its investors and underpins its reputation as a shareholder-focused compounder in the semiconductor industry.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Texas Instruments Incorporated (TXN) by The Wolf of Harcourt Street in January 2025, which highlighted cyclical pressures, near-term earnings weakness, and ongoing 300-millimeter investments as long-term advantages. The company’s stock has appreciated about 4.9% since. This is because the long-term story remains intact.

This protocol is designed to facilitate easy digital payment processes for financial institutions and enterprises. For now, the project is in the private testnet, but it will be made available to the public in the coming months.\nGoogle’s GCUL Utilizes Python for Smart Contracts\nOn Aug. 26, Google Cloud’s Web3 Head of Strategy, Rich Widmann, announced that the firm is currently working on its blockchain network. This L1 has entered the private testnet phase, with its first pilot project involving the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group).\nAs recorded lately, more institutions are exploring faster and more transparent financial settlement systems. During the pilot phase of the GCUL, there will be a focus on two areas that have gained traction at this time: tokenization and wholesale payments.\nAccording to his post on LinkedIn, GCUL was conceived from a desire to provide financial institutions with a “performant, credibly neutral” blockchain platform, particularly one that enables Python-based smart contracts. While other majority blockchain ecosystems rely on Solidity or Rust, Google chose to integrate Python.\nThis move is a reflection of its attempt to make development more accessible to enterprise engineers who have proficiency in widely used programming languages. Ultimately, it could play a significant role in lowering the barrier to entry for TradFi institutions exploring on-chain deployment.\nWidmann described GCUL as a neutral infrastructure layer, while noting that this is “besides bringing to bear Google’s distribution.”\nBased on its design, this L1 blockchain is nothing like any existing network. For more context into its functionality, he explained that “Tether won’t use Circle’s blockchain, and Adyen probably won’t use Stripe’s blockchain. But any financial institution can build with GCUL.”\nIn a space where most Traditional Finance (TradFi) institutions are exploring ways to get into crypto, Google Cloud has taken a more direct step towards the blockchain infrastructure sector. More recently, firms on Wall Street have made major moves towards building their corporate treasuries with cryptocurrencies.\nInstitutional Adoption of Crypto Is the Trend\nIn July, Nasdaq-listed Upexi Inc. announced a $500 million equity line agreement with A.G.P.\/Alliance Global Partners, aiming to raise capital to expand its Solana treasury strategy. This arrangement allows the firm to issue shares at its discretion, although it remains subject to certain restrictions and closing conditions.","content_hash":"e799a4b23a59e1242e9a1cce76921307","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2630,"method_rank":0}

He described the platform as a credibly neutral, high-performance blockchain designed for institutions, supporting Python-based smart contracts to make it more accessible to developers and financial engineers.\n“Any financial institution can build with GCUL,” Widmann said, arguing that while companies like Tether may be unlikely to adopt Circle’s blockchain and payment firms like Adyen may hesitate to use Stripe’s, Google’s neutral infrastructure removes those barriers.\nHe also expanded on a comparative chart by fintech strategist Chuk Okpalugo, highlighting how GCUL differs from Stripe’s Tempo and Circle’s Arc, two other high-profile L1 efforts.\nIn setting out Google’s case for the Universal Ledger, Widmann drew contrasts with two other high-profile entrants.\nStripe’s project, Tempo, is rooted in its payments empire, effectively extending the company’s existing merchant rails into a vertically controlled chain. Circle’s Arc, by contrast, places its stablecoin at the center of the system, treating USDC as the protocol’s native fuel and promising lightning-fast settlement with built-in currency exchange.\nGoogle’s approach is different still: the Universal Ledger is designed as a shared infrastructure layer, intended to be credibly neutral and accessible to any institution rather than bound to a single payments ecosystem.\nTimelines also set the projects apart. Circle has already begun piloting Arc, while Stripe is targeting a launch next year. Google and CME, meanwhile, have completed an initial integration of GCUL, with broader testing to follow later this year and full services expected in 2026.\nThe distribution story reinforces those distinctions. Stripe can lean on more than a trillion dollars in annual merchant payment flows. Circle can count on USDC’s global footprint and liquidity integrations. Google brings the reach of its cloud platform, along with the promise of scaling a ledger that can support billions of users and hundreds of institutions.\nFeatures further differentiate the chains. Arc’s focus is speed and seamless foreign exchange, Tempo’s is merchant integration, and GCUL’s is programmability through Python-based smart contracts and institutional-grade tokenization.","content_hash":"dc405876c8e34aec650ea3db89914b70","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2630,"method_rank":0}

ADBE’s trailing and forward P\/E were 22.89 and 15.41 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nsabrisy\/Shutterstock.com\nAdobe Inc. (ADBE) is a leading software company specializing in content creation, document productivity, and digital marketing, with flagship products including Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Acrobat PDF. Its business model is overwhelmingly subscription-based, generating highly recurring revenue, with Digital Media contributing 74% of revenue and Digital Experience 25%, while the remaining 1% comes from legacy print tools.\nThe company’s revenue is geographically diversified, with 60% from the Americas and strong growth across EMEA and APAC. Over the last 18 months, Adobe’s stock has fallen nearly 50%, driven primarily by investor concerns over intensifying competition from AI-driven creative tools and rival platforms like Canva, as well as saturation in its subscription model, which limits organic growth. Despite these headwinds, Adobe retains several catalysts for a potential rebound. Its proprietary AI model, Firefly, enhances image generation and editing across its suite, while enterprise integration allows for upselling of AI tools such as Acrobat AI Assistant, which has already delivered 15% YoY growth in document subscriptions.\nValuation is increasingly attractive, trading at roughly 19× forward earnings and 7× sales, below major peers like Microsoft and Autodesk. Concerns about AI replacing Adobe’s core products are likely overblown, as professional designers still rely on Adobe for high-quality work, using AI primarily to iterate rather than replace workflows. With a user base of 750 million monthly active users, Adobe possesses unmatched distribution and a strong ability to integrate AI into existing products, positioning the company to maintain leadership in professional creative software while capitalizing on AI-driven growth opportunities.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Adobe Inc. by jackandjillonthehill in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s high-margin subscription model, strong free cash flow, resilient balance sheet, and growth opportunities in AI and digital content. The company's stock price has depreciated approximately by 5% since our coverage, reflecting short-term market volatility. Rebound Capital shares a similar perspective but emphasizes competitive pressures and AI-driven upsell opportunities.","content_hash":"ff519080bc6e3d7d44456821a58f967e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2622,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on VET. Vermilion Energy Inc.'s share was trading at $7.60 as of August 22nd. VET’s trailing and forward P\/E were 11.22 and 9.43 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nOver the past year, Vermilion Energy has made a series of strategic moves that have significantly strengthened its operational and financial profile, creating a compelling investment opportunity. The company acquired Westbrick, adding approximately 50,000 boe\/d, while divesting assets producing 16,000 boe\/d at a net cost of CAD 540 million (USD 389 million), with projected synergies of up to CAD 300 million NPV. If realized, these synergies imply an effective cost of roughly USD 4,500 per flowing barrel for the incremental 34,000 boe\/d, highlighting strong potential returns. Additionally, Vermilion’s European gas assets, including significant new and replacement finds, command premium pricing, further enhancing the value proposition.\nWhile oil and gas price volatility remains a key risk, Vermilion’s diversified international portfolio provides exposure to different pricing benchmarks, partially mitigating commodity risk. AECO natural gas prices, currently at 35-year lows, are expected to rebound with the recent commissioning of LNG Canada, which should absorb about 10% of Canadian natural gas production over six months, though geopolitical developments, such as the conclusion of the Ukraine conflict, could affect European price premiums. Oil prices, when adjusted for inflation, historically range between USD 61–78 per barrel, suggesting upside potential from current levels.\nThe company is currently trading near bear-case valuations, while a likely base-case scenario points to USD 12–15 per share as debt targets are met and share buybacks reduce outstanding stock. With management compensation heavily tied to share price appreciation, alignment with shareholders is strong, making Vermilion an attractive opportunity with significant upside relative to current market pricing.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Vermilion Energy Inc. (VET) by Unemployed Value Degen in March 2025, highlighting the company’s aggressive growth, European gas discoveries, and Westbrick acquisition. The stock has appreciated modestly since then as strategic consolidation and operational improvements played out. International_Lie372 shares a similar thesis but emphasizes valuation, synergies, and commodity price risks, providing a more detailed financial perspective.","content_hash":"1121fe20b5dcb038e95977e994a0d77f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2618,"method_rank":0}

Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the largest memory chip manufacturers in the world, whose products are key for AI GPUs. As a result, the shares have gained 35% year-to-date. They are up by 36% since Cramer’s September comments after having crashed by 27% during April’s DeepSeek selloff and soaring by 17% in August. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)’s shares rose in August after the firm increased its fiscal fourth quarter guidance. The shares have also struggled recently due to the firm’s CHIPS Act grants, which have been criticized by President Trump. Here is what Cramer said about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU):\n“Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is now in its 2025 fiscal year, where it’s expected to earn $9.59, with that number growing to nearly $13 the following year. In other words, Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is trading at less than 7 times next year’s fiscal earnings estimates. That’s insanely cheap—but remember, that often means people don’t believe in the estimates. That’s how it gets to seven times. I understand that, but I think the estimates are okay.”\nHowever, recently, Cramer advised viewers to wait when it came to Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). Here is what he said:\n“Okay, the problem that’s happened, and it’s very technical here, but they make a particular chip called a DRAM, and the DRAM pricing has been going down. And that’s what this stock trades with… not with the semiconductors, but with actual DRAM pricing. Until DRAM pricing stabilizes a little bit more, I’m going to say we have to wait. I wish I could be more aggressive because I happen to think that Sanjay Mehrotra is a terrific CEO, but it’s a commodity, not unlike, in some degree, oil. Now it… [has] this high bandwidth division that is very good for data centers, but it’s not enough to be able to move the needle, and that’s why I am waiting on the sidelines, Micron.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of MU as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

It tracks an index that measures the returns of stocks with high dividend yields. That approach means that this exchange-traded fund (ETF) can provide investors with a lucrative stream of passive dividend income.\nHere's a look at whether now is a good time to buy this top dividend ETF.\nAn easy way to boost your dividend income\nThe Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF holds over 580 stocks, most of which have above-average dividend yields. The fund currently has a 2.6% dividend yield. That's more than double the S&P 500's dividend yield, which at less than 1.2% is approaching its record low.\nVYM holds several notable higher-yielding dividend stocks. For example, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) is the fund's third largest holding, accounting for 2.4% of its assets. The oil giant's dividend yield is currently over 3.5%. Exxon also has an exceptional record of increasing its dividend. It has raised its dividend for 42 straight years. That's the longest streak in the oil patch and a milestone only 4% of companies in the S&P 500 have reached.\nThe fund's focus on investing in stocks with higher dividend yields enables it to generate more income for investors. For example, every $1,000 invested in the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF would produce about $26 of annual dividend income. That compares to around $12 in dividend income from a similar investment in an S&P 500 ETF such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO). While investors pay a slightly higher ETF expense ratio for YVM, at 0.06%, compared with 0.03% for VOO, it costs them only about $0.60 each year, compared with $0.30 annually for VOO. So they'll still collect a lot more dividend income with this ETF.\nA relatively more attractive valuation\nOne reason the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF offers a much higher yield compared to the broader market is that it holds companies trading at lower valuations. The 580 stocks currently held by the ETF trade at a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 19.6 and a price-to-book (P\/B) ratio of 2.8. That compares with a P\/E ratio of 27.6 and a P\/B ratio of 5.0.\nThat higher valuation is due in part to the S&P 500's bigger run-up over the past year compared with VYM:","content_hash":"887d023651a7161eb23dd15550acffc7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2614,"method_rank":0}

(NASDAQ:CLBT), the leading provider of digital forensics software used by law enforcement and government agencies worldwide, reported results that were about as constructive as we could have hoped for given the stock’s 50% drop from earlier in the year. Management cut revenue guidance by just 1% and raised EBITDA guide by 2%, while ARR was trimmed by ~4% (or $20M) due primarily to federal budget timing issues. While the ARR reset is concerning on the surface, we believe it is largely a prudent derisking exercise under the company’s new CFO, with cuts significant enough to reset expectations lower but not so large as to suggest systemic weakness. This leaves the stock positioned for potential beats in the back half of the year as federal contracts normalize. Importantly, gross margins remain exceptionally strong relative to software peers (subscription margins above 90%), billings growth has reaccelerated to 25% and now exceeds revenue and ARR growth, and free cash flow continues to outpace EBITDA by more than 30% thanks to low capex, favorable working capital dynamics, and R&D tax credits— underscoring CLBT’s pristine quality of earnings.","content_hash":"799ba7679bdab20729f6b04d223fadf2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2607,"method_rank":0}

Subscribe to our free daily Wealthmanagement newsletter.\n(Bloomberg) -- Long-dated US Treasuries were lagging the market and retained modest losses as President Donald Trump intensified efforts to oust Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, deepening concerns his attacks on the central bank’s independence and lobbying for lower interest rates will fan inflation.\nThe yield on 30-year bonds rose as much as five basis points to 4.94%, before trimming advance. In contrast, the two-year yield fell five basis points to a session low of 3.67% after a well received $69 billion auction at 1pm in New York.\nWhile the moves were relatively small, investors and strategists were speculating in their morning trading notes that price pressures may heat up if Trump succeeds in replacing Cook with a policymaker more inclined to lower borrowing costs. The President has repeatedly complained that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have been too slow to cut rates.\n“The President is going to remake the Board Governors of the Federal Reserve over the next year, and he’s doing so in very unconventional ways,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. That approach has “essentially usurped” the Fed’s forward guidance function for now, telling markets lower rates are coming, he added.\nTrump sought to remove Cook following allegations she falsified documents on a mortgage application. Cook said she will not resign and disputed Trump’s authority to fire her.\nThe push to dismiss Cook “is a good reminder that no institution in Washington can insulate itself from Trump’s bullying,” said Sarah Binder, political science professor at George Washington University. “Nor are claims of ‘independence’ sufficient to protect the Fed from Trump’s ambitions. The Fed needs defenders, especially bond traders.”\nWhat Bloomberg Strategists Say\n“The more the Fed cuts rates, the greater the threat that longer-dated yields will stay higher. It’s one thing to loosen policy in the face of well-entrenched disinflation, but quite another when price increases are running above target inflation.”\nRead more: Trump Moves to Fire Fed’s Cook, Setting Up Historic Legal Fight\nPressure on Cook follows an aggressive campaign by Trump to force Powell — whose term as Chair expires in May — to stand down early, with the search for his replacement already underway. Trump appointed Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran, a long-time supporter, to serve the expiring term of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned early this month.","content_hash":"88882fe9de68e80467e8d56b3e485744","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2597,"method_rank":0}

Their token prices will soar as $34 trillion in capital inflows from eurodollar and Global South deposits flood the stablecoin market, he argued.\nFor Ether.fi, Hayes predicted a 34-fold price increase for the DeFi yield protocol, driven by user appetite for its debit card product. Demand for interest-bearing stablecoins offered by Ethena and decentralised derivatives trading on Hyperliquid would trigger a 51-fold and 126-fold uptick in their respective token prices, according to Hayes.\nThe predictions suggest gargantuan upside for these DeFi protocols, but it hinges on transformative regulatory and technological shifts, as well as swift adoption — factors that aren’t assured.\nThese predictions rely on non-US banks losing implicit access to US Treasury support, which could force depositors to move to dollar-pegged stablecoins.\nThey also require tech platforms to integrate stablecoin payments in the Global South, while regulators in those countries fail to enact strict capital control laws to prevent capital flight.\nHayes is also a vocal supporter and backs some of the very projects touted in his essay.\nStill, the $280 billion stablecoin market is one of the hottest crypto sectors right now. Even if Hayes’ predicted financial migration of epic proportions is a little far-fetched, analysts expect further expansion for the market.\nEarlier in August, analysts at crypto investment company Keyrock and cryptocurrency exchange Bitso predicted that stablecoins could account for 12% of global cross-border payment volumes by 2030.\nThat’s a lofty target for stablecoins, considering that they made up less than 3% of the $195 billion in global remittances last year.\nCoinbase even forecasts that stablecoins will reach $1.2 trillion in market size by 2028, a 330% uptick in the next three years.\nStablecoin issuers are now scrambling to create their own blockchains to snap up a larger chunk of the transaction fees generated by the market as it expands.\nMarket commentators like Ben Reynolds, managing director of crypto infrastructure company BitGo, say launching a stablecoin chain gives the issuer “more control over settlement and compliance.”\nOsato Avan-Nomayo is our Nigeria-based DeFi correspondent.

NET’s forward P\/E was 222.22 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nPhoto by Austin Distel on Unsplash\nCloudflare delivered a strong Q2 2025, surpassing expectations on revenue and EPS, with revenue of $512.3 million up 28% YoY and operating profit and free cash flow also ahead of estimates. Growth accelerated for the first time in several quarters, driven by large customer momentum, with $100k+ customers up 22% and revenue from that cohort growing 35%. A highlight was a $15 million Workers AI contract from a fast-growing AI firm migrating workloads from a hyperscaler, exemplifying Cloudflare’s ability to win major AI deals, expand relationships, and move upmarket toward enterprise-scale contracts.\nCEO Matthew Prince outlined a strategy to capture massive enterprise workloads away from hyperscalers, positioning Cloudflare for 7-, 8-, and eventually 9-figure deals. The “Pool of Funds” contract model also turned into a growth driver, fueling a jump in Dollar-Based Net Retention to 114% as consumption accelerated, confirming the strategy’s effectiveness. Beyond near-term growth, Prince detailed “Act 4,” Cloudflare’s vision to become the transaction layer for the agentic AI economy, leveraging its global network and Workers platform to authenticate and process microtransactions at scale. This ambition underscores the company’s long-term optionality, adding to immediate tailwinds in SASE, AI inference, and enterprise adoption.\nWhile the stock’s valuation remains high at over 30x EV\/Sales, the breadth of structural growth drivers—expanding markets, accelerating customer momentum, and optional exposure to AI commerce—makes Cloudflare one of the few platform companies capable of sustaining long-term growth at scale. Execution remains the key risk, but Q2 showed mounting evidence of a new phase of acceleration, with the company well positioned to join the ranks of technology’s $100 billion giants.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Cloudflare, Inc. (NET) by Oliver | MMMT Wealth in April 2025, which highlighted its network effects, 20%+ growth outlook, and expected profitability inflection in 2025.

Sign up here.\nEthereum is riding high.\nNot only did it notch a new all-time high of $4,946 on Sunday, but Wall Street’s growing embrace of digital assets such as stablecoins is expected to drive the price to new heights.\nEthereum last reached a record high in November 2021.\nSince then, the amount of stablecoins on the blockchain has ballooned 74% to $143 billion, and real-world assets, tokenised versions of traditional financial assets like US Treasury bonds, have grown from practically nothing into a $7.6 billion market.\nIt’s a sign Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem is maturing, and investors are taking notice.\n“Stablecoins are the ‘ChatGPT’ of crypto,” Tom Lee, chair of Ethereum treasury firm BitMine, previously told DL News. “And Ethereum is the backbone. It’s legally recognised, and has zero downtime.”\nIt’s against this backdrop that Ethereum bulls celebrated the new record this weekend.\nWhile Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole remarks sparked the all-time high break, Ethereum treasury companies drove the bulk of the prior rally by gobbling up Ether at an unprecedented rate.\nThe growth in stablecoins and real-world assets on Ethereum is all part of a larger trend. As time goes on, less of the value on Ethereum is coming from speculative assets like DAO tokens or memecoins, and more is coming from traditional assets.\nActivity on more nascent blockchains, like Solana, is still dominated by speculation on memecoins. They also host a much smaller number of stablecoins, which might be among the reasons they haven’t received the same institutional interest.\nOf course, big technical improvements — such as Ethereum switching from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake — have happened in the interim. But these haven’t altered the blockchain’s main value proposition: Becoming a universal settlement hub for finance.\nTo be sure, the favourable crypto regulatory environment under President Donald Trump has also helped considerably.\nBack in 2021, then-SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s regulation through enforcement stance had Wall Street keeping its distance, lest it get caught in the crossfire.\nSo the big question now is, will the trend continue?\nIf you believe analysts, the answer is a resounding yes.\nCoinbase’s institutional arm predicts stablecoins will swell into a $1.2 trillion market by 2028, while Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, sees the dollar-pegged asset market hitting $2.5 trillion in “no time.”\nAs for real-world assets, the opportunity could be much bigger.","content_hash":"771081b1210d906644cdb4d4b2885568","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2586,"method_rank":0}

The rounds bring the company’s total valuation to $2 billion, according to CNBC.\n-\nThe tech allows for safe and reliable robot behaviors when managing scenarios that they have not been trained on and navigating dynamic, unstructured environments without prior maps, GPS or predefined paths, according to the news release.\n-\nThe startup’s “single software brain” for robots has been deployed in the U.S., Japan and Europe across hundreds of real-world industrial environments, including construction jobsites.\nDive Insight:\nThe firm’s latest funding round was oversubscribed, which means the company received more funding commitments than it planned, following rapid customer adoption for FieldAI’s general-purpose robotics intelligence, according to the news release.\nKaushal Diwan, corporate director of strategic investments and partnerships for WND Ventures, the venture capital arm of Redwood City, California-based DPR Construction, said that the raise is a sign that people can expect larger funding rounds, particularly for robotics, in the construction space.\n“AI is helping robots go from single-task to dynamic operation faster. All of these things will require a significant commitment from the investors,” Diwan said in an email. WND Ventures is not an investor in FieldAI, but DPR sites have helped test proof of concept for the firm.\nThe core of FieldAI’s platform is what it calls its Field Foundation Models, which are built specifically for embodied intelligence, and are physics-first, according to the company. Unlike conventional vision or language models retrofitted for robotics, FieldAI designs FFMs to grapple with uncertainty, risk and the physical constraints of the real world.\n“Rather than attempting to shoehorn large language and vision models into robotics — only to address their hallucinations and limitations as an afterthought — we have designed intrinsically risk-aware architectures from the ground up,” said Ali Agha, founder and CEO of FieldAI, in the news release.\nFieldAI specifically highlights the tech’s ability to capture real-time data on jobsites to generate accurate building information models.","content_hash":"a63835b156d8bacfb57ba9207fa72de7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2580,"method_rank":0}

The jump comes as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are little changed.\nTrump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, is teaming up with a major cryptocurrency exchange to launch a new company that will adopt a crypto accumulation strategy.\nTrump Media will add Cronos to its books\nThe new company will build a significant position in Cronos (CRO), the crypto token of Crypto.com, and go public via the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Yorkville Acquisition, with the ticker MCGA.\nThe venture's funding mix includes about $1 billion of CRO tokens, $200 million in cash, $220 million in warrants, and an equity line up to $5 billion from a Yorkville affiliate. Trump Media plans to buy roughly $105 million of CRO for its balance sheet, and Crypto.com will invest roughly $50 million in Trump Media stock.\nThis comes after Trump Media jumped on the crypto accumulation strategy bandwagon recently, purchasing large amounts of Bitcoin using a mix of debt and equity sales. The strategy was pioneered by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (doing business as Strategy) and is a high-risk move that could pay off if Bitcoin continues to rise in price significantly.\nTrump Media's valuation is divorced from reality\nThe latest move from Trump Media is its latest attempt to generate value. The company's main asset, Truth Social, is a money-losing machine. At the moment, Trump Media has annual revenue of a few million dollars and is losing money hand over fist, yet its stock carries a valuation above $5 billion.

Cook hasn't been charged with a crime, and it's unclear whether a DOJ investigation will result in charges being filed.\n\"We see mortgage fraud throughout the United States, it happens all the time, it's prosecuted all the time,\" Pulte said in an interview on FOX Business Network's \"Making Money With Charles Payne\" on Friday.\n\"In Ms. Cook's case, it appears from what we can tell, to be blatant mortgage fraud. She claimed to be living in the state of Michigan, she took out a loan. And then she went and took out another loan in Atlanta and said that both of them were her primary residence. That's a big no-no,\" Pulte said.\nTrump Removes Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook From Office, Citing Fraud Allegations\n\"You can't do that in our mortgage market. You have to be able to declare that it's a second home or investment property. You have to fill out these applications correctly,\" he explained.\nLenders will typically offer more favorable terms when a property is designated as a primary residence, such as lower interest rates, smaller down payments, higher loan-to-value ratios when borrowing against the property, and more lenient lending standards such as higher debt-to-income ratios.\nMortgage fraud can be prosecuted under federal and state laws, with penalties including prison sentences and large fines. Civil penalties can include the lender calling in the loan due immediately, raising foreclosure risk, and the borrower could be banned from obtaining future loans.\nThe referral comes amid the Trump administration's efforts to pressure the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates, which the president and his allies want to occur in the hope it will boost the economy and lower the cost of servicing the national debt.\nThe president moved to fire Cook on Monday, though it's unclear whether he has the legal authority to do so as this is the first time a U.S. president has attempted to remove a Fed governor. Under the laws enacted by Congress that govern the central bank, Fed governors may only be removed \"for cause\" which is generally understood to apply to malfeasance or misconduct.","content_hash":"c7a6566d791a47e8f3d120be10bd7200","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2578,"method_rank":0}

Since the stock is within 2% of its all-time high as I write, it's possible that O'Reilly Automotive stock will have already hit a new all-time high by the time you read this.\nO'Reilly Automotive stock isn't only reaching all-time highs -- it's also cruising past the returns for the S&P 500. Over the last five years, the S&P 500 has increased by 88%, which isn't bad at all. But investors made much more money by investing in O'Reilly, since its shares have climbed by 230% over this time.\nExperienced investors know that high-growth businesses usually outperform the market as O'Reilly Automotive stock has. But in this case, the company has only averaged about 9% annual top-line growth over the last five years. That's positive, but it's also somewhat modest for a stock that has performed so well.\nThe difference-maker for O'Reilly Automotive's shareholders is its stock buyback program. At the start of 2020, the company had about 76 million shares outstanding. But at the end of 2024, it had only 58 million -- a reduction of 24%.\nBy dropping its share count at a steady rate, O'Reilly's earnings per share (EPS) have increased enough to carry the stock to a strong market-beating performance.\nWhat's next?\nO'Reilly Automotive operates a retail chain of nearly 6,500 locations selling automotive repair and maintenance products. And there's really not much reason to believe that the stock won't continue to perform well for shareholders. Even in a somewhat slower sales environment, management expects to report a full-year increase for same-store sales in 2025.\nO'Reilly Automotive also continues to expect strong profit margins, and management will continue to buy back stock.

Today’s standout is Cronos (CRO), which has vaulted over 20% in the past 24 hours. Aave and Bitget Token show steadier moves, but attention centers on Cronos for its sharp move during this altcoin season.\nCronos (CRO): Exchange Token Surges, Driven by Usage and Derivatives\nCronos is trading near $0.20 today—a roughly 25% gain over the past day. Market cap stands at $6.52 billion, with a circulating supply of ~33.6 billion tokens and a max supply of 100 billion.\nThis jump stems from multiple factors. First, Cronos just announced its 2025-2026 roadmap to target “compliant, AI-accessible primitives for tokenization.”\nSecond, Canary Capital’s staked CRO ETF filing indicated institutional interest in token staking products. Third, Cronos’s July POS v6 upgrade—adding Cosmos SDK, IBC support, and a network “circuit breaker”—has boosted developer and on-chain activity, with gas usage rising 14%, and contract deployment up 33%.\nThese developments together explain today’s price action: increased derivatives access, ETF speculation, and infrastructure improvement have converged into sudden momentum. Cronos has drawn attention through both structural upgrades and trader flows.\nAave (AAVE): DeFi Backbone Holds Steady\nAave is trading near $334, with a daily trading volume around $800 million and a live market cap near $5.05 billion. Historical data shows that August’s price has moved from the low $260s early in the month to over $330 now.\nAAVE Price (Source: CoinMarketCap)\nAave remains central to DeFi lending and borrowing, with steady usage across protocols. Its price action has been less sharp than that of Cronos, suggesting lower volatility and reliance on continued platform activity. That gives AAVE a more muted role in today’s altseason momentum—still important, but not the driver.\nBitget Token (BGB): Utility with Deflationary Structure\nBGB is trading near $4.6, with a market cap of $5.2 billion. Its ecosystem role spans fee discounts, staking, Launchpad access, and travel\/dining payments. In April, Bitget introduced a gas-linked burn mechanism. In Q2, it burned ~30 million tokens (~2.5% of the supply), indicating commitment to deflation.\nRecent days show technical resistance: BGB was rejected near the ~$4.84 Fibonacci level, and lower momentum indicators appeared in RSI and MACD. Volume has declined, suggesting cautious sentiment. Still, its utility across centralized and on-chain services and ongoing burns gives it structural support.","content_hash":"cb93d1117fd6fb306b4165287bcbbe13","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2567,"method_rank":0}

However, concerns about rising discounting have been growing.\nPrice Action: LULU shares are trading lower by 0.49% to $201.44 at last check Tuesday.","content_hash":"43ff989d3ad388f2af2a64627e0a1d92","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2557,"method_rank":0}

The move broadens the Trump administration's cancellation of the de minimis exemption for shipments from China and Hong Kong earlier this year.\n\"President Trump's ending of the deadly de minimis loophole will save thousands of American lives by restricting the flow of narcotics and other dangerous prohibited items, and add up to $10 billion a year in tariff revenues to our Treasury,\" White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told reporters.\n\"This is a permanent change,\" said a senior administration official, adding that any push to restore the exemptions for trusted trading partner countries was \"dead on arrival.\"\nThe de minimis exemption has been in place since 1938 and was raised from $200 to $800 in 2015 as a means to foster small business growth on e-commerce marketplaces.\nBut direct shipments from China exploded after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods during his first term, creating a new direct-to-consumer business model for e-commerce firms Shein and Temu.\nMany of these packages entered without screening, and the Trump administration has also blamed the exemption for allowing fentanyl and its precursors to flow into the U.S.\nCBP has estimated that the number of packages claiming the de minimis exemption jumped nearly 10-fold from 139 million in fiscal 2015 to 1.36 billion in fiscal 2024.\nA second senior Trump administration official said that CBP has collected more than $492 million in additional duties on packages shipped from China and Hong Kong since their exemptions were eliminated on May 2.\nThe official said that full tariff rates will apply to all packages shipped by express carriers such as FedEx, United Parcel Service and DHL, with the firms collecting the duties and processing the paperwork.\nForeign postal agencies can opt to collect and process the duties based on the value of the package contents, or opt for the flat rate method by collecting a flat tax based on Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariff rates currently in place on goods from the country of origin.","content_hash":"97fb20d97c7d42ca14435ae9ebd6609e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2554,"method_rank":0}

From strategic investing to assembling a team of financial experts, rich retirees treat retirement as a phase of growth, not decline. Their habits aren’t just about having more money; they’re about using it wisely.\nHere are six things rich retirees do that middle-class one’s done and how you can start applying them to your own future.\nDiscover Next: I Asked ChatGPT How Much Money I’ll Need To Retire in 5 Years: Here’s What It Said\nTry This: 4 Affordable Car Brands You Won't Regret Buying in 2025\nKeep Investing\nRich retirees treat investing as a lifelong strategy, not something to stop at age 65. Rather than withdrawing funds randomly, they build a tiered income strategy that balances growth with stability.\n“They approach retirement as a business with a cash flow strategy,” said Jonathan Garini, investor and CEO at Fifth Element. “Instead of taking randomly from the accounts, they build a ladder of income tiers: short-term needs from bonds or cash-like investments, medium-term from medium-yield vehicles, long-term capital growth needs from investments in stocks or private placements.”\nGarini said rich retirees also diversify beyond traditional markets, embracing alternatives like private credit, structured notes and real estate — not just for returns, but to reduce public market volatility.\nFor You: How To Become Rich: 9 Fastest Ways, According To Experts\nUse Financial Pros\nWealthy retirees rarely manage their money alone. They rely on a trusted team that includes financial advisors, estate planners and tax pros. Middle-class retirees can benefit from this approach by seeking expert guidance to avoid costly mistakes and make more confident financial decisions.\n“The key difference is that they use this team proactively, not reactively,” said Chris Tipton, senior advisor at Balefire Wealth Management. “For instance, they’ll involve all parties in major decisions (like selling a business or gifting to heirs), ensuring alignment across legal, tax and investment strategies.”\nDiversify Income\nRich retirees often generate income from a mix of investments, rental properties, business ventures or royalties. Diversifying income beyond Social Security and a pension gives them more flexibility, security and freedom in retirement.\nThey also work with advisors to build predictable, long-term income through tools like fixed indexed annuities, helping ensure their money lasts as long as they do.","content_hash":"5918043eaa85a3d3862884b2347e2a03","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2553,"method_rank":0}

The government's unprecedented agreement with Nvidia is likely to face legal challenges due to the US Constitution’s ban on export taxes — a risk Nvidia acknowledged in its quarterly filing with the SEC.\n“Any request for a percentage of the revenue by the USG may subject us to litigation, increase our costs, and harm our competitive position and benefit competitors that are not subject to such arrangements,” the company said in its filing.\nWhile “a select number” of the chipmaker’s Chinese customers received licenses to buy the lower-power Nvidia chips in the past few weeks, the company hasn’t made any H20 sales based on those licenses.\n\"We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do,\" Kress said.\n“If geopolitical issues reside, we should ship $2 [billion] to $5 billion in H20 revenue in Q3, and if we had more orders, we can bill more,\" Kress said.\nGiven that Nvidia made no H20 sales in the second quarter, the chipmaker's China revenue dove to $2.8 billion during the three months that ended July 27, down from $5.5 billion in the first quarter and $3.7 billion last year. On average, China accounted for roughly 15% of the company’s revenue over the prior 10 quarters. In the second quarter, that share fell to 5.9%.\nNvidia began sales of its H20 GPUs (graphics processing units) — less powerful versions of its prior-generation Hopper chips compliant with tightening US trade rules — to China in 2024.\nKress told analysts the US government began reviewing licenses for sales of the H20 chips to China in late July.","content_hash":"d93de13e943f9b186258f6808d7f6391","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2551,"method_rank":0}

AT&T will remain EchoStar’s primary network partner as EchoStar continues to serve wireless customers.\nFor EchoStar, the deal alleviates Federal Communications Commission (FCC) pressure regarding unused spectrum and eliminates uncertainty around its 5G buildout requirements.\n“EchoStar and Boost Mobile have met all of the FCC’s network buildout milestones,” said Echostar co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen in a statement. “However, this spectrum sale to AT&T and the hybrid MNO (mobile network operator) agreement are critical steps toward resolving the FCC’s spectrum utilization concerns.”\nBefore this deal was announced, EchoStar’s market cap was approximately $8.6 billion. On Tuesday, it surged to about $14.5 billion.\nTo learn more, I reached out to Pascal Desroches, AT&T’s senior EVP and CFO, who shared his perspective on the deal in an email exchange.\nAT&T agreed to pay almost three times EchoStar’s entire market cap for these spectrum assets. Can you explain the valuation logic behind the purchase price relative to EchoStar’s market value, and how shareholders should think about the return on this investment?\nDesroches: This is a great deal for AT&T and its shareholders, and it furthers our goal of becoming America’s best connectivity provider. With this spectrum acquisition, we will generate an attractive return, driving long-term and sustainable shareholder value. In particular, we expect this transaction will drive incremental service revenues (including fixed wireless revenues, mobility revenues and fiber revenues) and adjusted EBITDA within the first 24 months of deal close and be accretive to adjusted EPS and FCF thereafter.","content_hash":"e4c29cf0887f2dfcd3fb5ff52db7d588","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2519,"method_rank":0}

It’s not the first brand to walk back a redesign\nCracker Barrel released a new logo earlier this month and, to put things lightly, it didn’t go over well. The restaurant chain lost nearly $100 million in market value as it faced outrage from across the internet.\nMost Read from Fast Company\n-\nEggs recalled after salmonella outbreak sickens nearly 100 people: Full list of products to avoid\n-\nHow large language models can reconstruct forbidden knowledge\nThe backlash was so intense that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 locations, reversed course less than 10 days later.\n“We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,” the company announced on its social media. “We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain.”\nCue the adage, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.\nHow has Cracker Barrel stock responded to reversal?\nThe late Tuesday announcement brought a spike in Cracker Barrel’s stock (Nasdaq: CBRL), with share prices increasing by about 6% through after-hours and into premarket trading Wednesday morning.\nThe shares had already closed up 6.35% after President Trump called on Cracker Barrel to make the change. Unsurprisingly, the White House quickly took credit after Cracker Barrel announced it would bring back its old logo.\nCorporate rebrands are often not well received\nMinimalist rebrands have become increasingly common (companies ranging from Yahoo to Intel to to Burberry have rolled out more simplified logos over the years), but backtracking on a new logo so quickly is rare.\nStill, Cracker Barrel isn’t the only American company to do a quick turnaround afterward. Two of the most notable instances took place 15 years ago.\nFirst, there was Tropicana, which back in 2009 replaced its iconic straw in an orange logo and distinct topography with a generic glass of orange juice. Customers were very underwhelmed. PepsiCo, its owner during the fiasco, completely undid everything except the orange lid.\nIn 2024, Tropicana underwent another rebrand, this time emphasizing its best features with a retro typeface and bright colors.\nThen there’s Gap, which debuted a new logo in 2010. It lasted for a matter of days before the retailer removed it and began crowdsourcing for an alternative.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.com\nSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http:\/\/fastcompany.com\/newsletters","content_hash":"34d18347e173ffdd417da2b5f414c0d5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2477,"method_rank":0}

Revenue grew 4.6% to $2.2 billion, ahead of the estimate, driven by stronger pricing and mix across both Packaging and Paper segments, which also lifted gross margin to 22.2%. Investors were further encouraged by the company’s Q3 EPS guidance of $2.80.\nFor the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect PKG's adjusted PS to grow 12.7% year-over-year to $10.19. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed.

Its market capitalization stands at $17.8 billion, reflecting strong growth and investor confidence. Operating within the consumer discretionary sector, Ralph Lauren is a key player in the apparel manufacturing, particularly in the luxury and lifestyle segments.\nRalph Lauren’s stock story this year is like a runway success. Its shares rose 26.9% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, outshining the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 9.9% gains over the same stretch. Over the past 52 weeks, RL stock has soared 71.3%, compared to the SPX’s 15.1% gain, leaving the benchmark far behind.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nTilray’s Stock Price Is Growing Like a Weed. Here’s Why, and What Comes Next.\n-\nDear Lucid Group Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for August 29\nZooming in further, Ralph Lauren’s performance similarly stands out within the sector. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) is up 25.4% over the past year and 4.2% in 2025, trailing behind RL stock.\nThe stock’s momentum can be attributed to a combination of strategic brand elevation, solid financial results, and strong consumer demand for its elevated-luxury positioning. In Q1 of fiscal 2026, released on Aug. 7, the company reported adjusted EPS of $3.77 - up 40% year-over-year (YoY) and beating Street’s estimates. Revenue grew 14% annually to $1.7 billion, led by a 21% jump in sales in Asia, including over 30% annual growth in China.\nThese results prompted an upward revision of full-year revenue guidance to low- to mid-single-digit growth. Also, Ralph Lauren’s brand elevation strategy and international expansion played a pivotal role.\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in March 2026, analysts expect Ralph Lauren to report EPS growth of 19.8% YoY to $14.77, on a diluted basis. The company has a stellar history of surpassing consensus EPS estimates. It has topped the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.\nWall Street sentiment toward RL stock remains positive, but slightly more bullish than a month back. The stock has a consensus rating of “Strong Buy,” an upgrade from the “Moderate Buy” rating. Of the 19 analysts offering recommendations currently, 14 are highly bullish, advising a “Strong Buy,” one suggests a “Moderate Buy,” three maintain a “Hold,” and the remaining one has a “Strong Sell” rating.","content_hash":"f161da80e4c74889d617961b68c3e282","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2427,"method_rank":0}

The firm remains bullish on the stock despite increasing competition in the creative tools market.\nThe firm acknowledges that a key area of investor concern has been the growing fragmentation in the creative market, especially in generative content creation tools.\nWorking with RBC Element, the firm’s in-house data science team, RBC has looked at the onging trends in the market and tracked metrics for products such as Express and GenStudio. The firm has concluded that the biggest opportunity lies in editing with AI instead of merely creating new content.\n“All you need to know: Over the past two-years we’ve seen an uptick in the number of creative tools on the market particularly in terms of generative content creation. As the market has become more fragmented, we have worked with RBC Elements™, our in-house data science team, to try to get a snapshot of the current trends in the creative market. This has been a key area of debate for investors where concern has been around the intersection of GenAI and competition where management has looked at additional metrics around Express and GenStudio to help quantify performance. Recent changes including embedding competitive models within Firefly allows for customer choice and aligns with our view that the long-term wallet share opportunity revolves around generative editing more than creation. We continue to look towards both tiered pricing and potential consumption revenue from more compute intensive models for video, 3D and vector as key sentiment drivers for investors looking for visibility around GenAI monetization.

Meanwhile, the board said in a brief filing that it prefers some processes be halted, but that it would defer to the judge overseeing the case.\nIt wasn't immediately clear how quickly new board members would be appointed.\nThe board was created in 2016 under the Obama administration, a year after Puerto Rico’s government declared it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load and later filed for the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n____\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https:\/\/apnews.com\/hub\/latin-america","content_hash":"2772b97a73ab3a4380da29636fce821d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2367,"method_rank":0}

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the top stocks to buy and hold forever. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is often seen as a textbook example of how to build and strengthen a moat over time. Its brand strength, device and services ecosystem lock-in, and customer loyalty enable it to generate recurring revenues, maintain strong pricing power, and consistently deliver robust cash flows. These factors make it one of the most resilient long-term investments in the market.\nMore recently, however, investor focus has shifted to Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) efforts in artificial intelligence, an area where it has lagged peers. On August 22, Bloomberg reported that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with Google to use its Gemini AI system to power an upgraded version of Siri. The talks come as the company looks to speed up its AI roadmap after setbacks in rolling out updated Siri features. Those delays have weighed on sentiment, with the stock down about 9% year-to-date and trailing both the broader market and other large-cap tech names.\nThe Bloomberg report also highlighted that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has explored similar options with Anthropic and OpenAI, but has yet to finalize a decision. Internally, two competing versions of the next Siri are being developed, one using Apple’s own models and another relying on external partners.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a dedicated Foundation Models team, but its AI initiatives are not yet at the scale of leading players such as OpenAI. CEO Tim Cook has stressed that Apple’s objective is not to be first but to deliver a competitive, high-quality product when it enters the market.\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells consumer electronics, software, and services, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and related services and digital platforms.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

The same backers are betting on this vacation home platform at just $2.90 per share.\nThe investigation will be conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, a national security statute that allows the president to impose tariffs if imports are deemed a threat, according to a Reuters report.\nThe industry, however, remains skeptical, with The American Home Furnishings Alliance having previously criticized the tariffs, saying that no amount of it “will bring back American furniture manufacturing,” while adding that the move might instead “harm manufacturing still being done in the United States.”\nHome Furnishing Stocks Feel The Heat\nFurniture and home furnishing stocks have witnessed steep declines after hours following this announcement, given the industry’s reliance on imports.\nSee Also: Dump Your Financial Advisors.

It is now ramping up production in the U.S. and sees the situation as an opportunity, as competitors fail to keep up with the high tariff costs.","content_hash":"7626a592f5326d1661127e17a32d3217","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2337,"method_rank":0}

That approach doesn’t work for me.”\nCopyright: fotomaximum \/ 123RF Stock Photo\nCramer has become more upbeat about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) recently. Here are his latest thoughts:\n“People just think that it’s the same old Cisco. Like they didn’t buy Splunk. Splunk gave them visibility, it gave them some really, really good cyber defense works. But it gave them contacts. And Splunk was everywhere. And I don’t think people realize how embedded Splunk was. Now you’ve got a company that could have an Oracle-like revaluation. And the Oracle-like revaluation is stunning.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of CSCO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which tracks the largest digital assets, gained 2.8% over the same period.\nThe move came as traders weighed two major developments: growing confidence in a September interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to extend its review of Grayscale’s proposed spot Cardano exchange-traded fund (ETF) until late October 2025.\nInvest in Gold\nADA traded in a tight but volatile $0.04 band, swinging between a low of $0.83 and a high of $0.88, according to data from CoinDesk Analytics. That spread of roughly 5% reflected heightened activity. At one point, the token broke sharply higher, surging from $0.84 to $0.88 on trading volumes that more than doubled the 24-hour average of 39.3 million.\nAfter the breakout, ADA settled into consolidation. Traders pegged resistance at $0.88, with new support forming around $0.85. Late-session action saw the price stabilize at $0.86, a level analysts say may point to institutional accumulation ahead of another potential rally.\nThe broader market backdrop has been choppy. Crypto assets fell sharply Monday as traders locked in profits from a weekend surge sparked by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s dovish remarks in Jackson Hole. Those comments fueled expectations of rate cuts, which typically support risk assets like cryptocurrencies by making traditional yields less attractive. By Tuesday, investors appeared to treat the pullback as a buying opportunity, helping altcoins rebound.\nLower interest rates often act as a tailwind for the crypto sector, where investors hunt for higher returns compared with government debt. Historically, such conditions have set the stage for “altcoin season,” periods where smaller tokens outperform bitcoin (BTC) during consolidation phases.\nMeanwhile, the SEC’s delay of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF was widely anticipated, as the regulator has slowed nearly all spot crypto ETF decisions. While the news briefly injected uncertainty, ADA’s resilience suggested traders were more focused on broader market momentum and capital rotation from bitcoin into altcoins.","content_hash":"5f65243837a7d33d41a61b59a5485373","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2233,"method_rank":0}

A new token project is inscribing the serial numbers of physical bullion stored in a secured vault directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, letting people purchase and trade the rights to real gold.\nTRIO, a Bitcoin-native marketplace created by OrdinalsBot, is behind the tokenized gold offering. The company announced Monday it has teamed with Swarm Markets to launch the Gold on Bitcoin collection, using the NFT-like Ordinals protocol to attach metadata from gold bars stored in a Brinks vault in London.\n“Every gold bar in Brinks has a serial number,” OrdinalsBot co-founder Brian Laughlan told Decrypt. “All you really need to do is attach that serial number to a digital asset—in this case, an Ordinal. It’s baked into the metadata. And that’s it: you’ve now got a tokenized version of gold.”\nEach token, Laughlan explained, is tied to the current price of a single ounce of gold. The tokens can be traded like any other Ordinals asset, but redemption of the physical bars requires know-your-customer verification through Swarm. KYC is necessary because physical gold is a regulated asset, and its transfer must comply with anti-money laundering and identity verification laws. After KYC is complete, the gold bars can then be sent to their owner.\nInvest in Gold\n“That's the reality of real-world assets,” he said. “They exist in the real world, so real-world laws apply.”\nOrdinalsBot launched TRIO in December. The platform supports trading of Ordinals along with Bitcoin meme coins in the Runes and BRC-20 token standards.\nNotable Ordinals collections include Runestone, which is tied to the DOG meme coin on Bitcoin, and Project Spartacus, which published the leaked U.S. military documents known as the Afghan War Logs onto the original blockchain.\nThe launch comes as tokenized gold emerges as one of the most active corners of the real-world asset market. By turning vaulted bullion into tradable digital tokens, projects aim to merge the reliability of gold with the accessibility of crypto token trading.","content_hash":"a9ac38ce9306f754e92ba30cad090407","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2049,"method_rank":0}

New data shows registrations jumped nearly 6% across the region the biggest monthly rise in more than a year offering a bit of breathing room to an industry that's been under pressure from rising costs, regulatory demands, and shaky consumer sentiment.\nPlug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles were the real drivers of momentum.

Tesla (TSLA, Financials) lost more ground marking the seventh straight month its market share shrank in Europe. It now sits at just 0.8%, down from 1.4% last July. Meanwhile, China's BYD showed up in the monthly figures for the first time and already edged past Tesla, claiming 1.2% of the market.\nIn raw numbers, BYD's sales exploded 225% year over year. Tesla's dropped 40%.\nThe European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) said a total of 1.09 million vehicles were registered in the EU, the UK, and the European Free Trade Association region. Battery electric, hybrid electric, and plug-in hybrid vehicles combined made up nearly 60% of new registrations a big jump from 51% a year ago.\nVolkswagen and Renault posted gains of 11.6% and 8.8%, respectively, while Stellantis saw a 1.1% dip.\nCountry by country, Germany was the standout with an 11.1% rise in total sales. The UK, France, and Italy all slipped into negative territory. But smaller markets picked up the slack Spain rose 17%, Poland 16.5%, and Austria surged more than 31%.\nStill, industry executives are sounding the alarm. ACEA's CEO Ola Kaellenius co-signed a letter this week urging the European Commission to ease up on 2035 zero-emission targets, calling them increasingly unfeasible.\nFor now, July's results offer a rare bright spot.

Yet, the stock tumbled by 7.6% in July after the firm’s earnings report saw it disappoint investors with its software revenue. Here is what Cramer said about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in August 2024:\n“I think IBM is doing great. Arvind Krishna has done a remarkable job with IBM.
