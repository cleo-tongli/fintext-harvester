Email pr@fool.com\nFull Conference Call Transcript\nErnie Herrman: Good morning. Joining me and Deb on the call is John Klinger. I'll start today with our second quarter results. I am extremely pleased with our outstanding second quarter performance and our above-plan sales, profit margin, and earnings per share results. Overall, comp sales for the second quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 4% and were strong across all of our divisions. Customer transactions were up at every division and drove our overall comp sales increase. As we have seen through so many retail and economic environments, consumers were drawn to our excellent values in brands. And going forward, we continue to see market share opportunities across each of our U.S. and international divisions.\nWith our profit results in the second quarter also well exceeding our plan, we are raising our full-year guidance for both pre-tax profit margin and earnings per share. John will talk about our results and guidance in more detail in a few minutes. I want to thank our global associates who drove these excellent results. Our teams across the company successfully executed our off-price business fundamentals to deliver an exciting assortment of merchandise at great value to our customers every day. This is a testament to the talent of our teams and the depth of their off-price expertise. Across our company, we saw our associates working together as one TJX to deliver on our value mission for consumers.\nAs we look to the second half of the year, I am very confident in our position of strength in retail. Our teams are energized by the opportunities we see to keep attracting shoppers to our retail brands and to build upon our success of prior years in being a gifting destination for consumers. We see outstanding buying opportunities in the marketplace for quality branded merchandise, which also gives me great confidence in our plans for the fall and holiday selling seasons. The third quarter is off to a strong start. We are confident in our full-year sales and profitability plans. And as always, we will strive to beat them.\nLonger term, we believe the strength and resiliency of our flexible off-price business model will continue to be a tremendous advantage. We feel great about our core businesses and the opportunities we see for growth with our newer vehicles. We are convinced we have a long runway ahead to capture additional market share worldwide and continue our successful global growth. I'll talk more about our second half opportunities and key strengths in a moment. But first, I'll turn the call over to John to cover our second quarter results in more detail.\nJohn Klinger: Thanks, Ernie. I also want to add my gratitude to all of our global associates for their continued hard work and commitment to delivering our customers great value every day. Now I'll share some additional details on the second quarter. As Ernie mentioned, our consolidated comp sales growth of 4% came in above our plan. Further, we saw comp increases in both our apparel and home categories, with home outperforming apparel. Second quarter pre-tax profit margin of 11.4% was up 50 basis points versus last year and well above our plan. Gross margin increased 30 basis points versus last year, primarily due to favorable hedges. Merchandise margin was flat despite higher tariff costs versus last year.\nImportantly, we are very pleased with our mitigation strategies, which allowed us to offset the tariff pressure we saw in the second quarter. SG&A decreased 30 basis points versus last year. This was primarily due to operational efficiencies as well as a benefit from the timing of certain expenses, some of which we expect to reverse out in the third quarter. Net interest income negatively impacted pre-tax profit margin by 10 basis points versus last year. Second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.10 increased 15% versus last year and was also well above our expectations. Lastly, we were extremely pleased that our second quarter pre-tax profit margin came in 90 basis points above the high end of our plan.\nThis was due to a combination of items, including lower than expected tariff costs, expense leverage on above-plan sales, and the timing of certain expenses. This was also partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and contribution to TJX's charitable foundations. Now to our second quarter divisional performance. Again, this quarter, customer transactions increased at every division. We see this as an excellent indicator of the strength of our value proposition across our retail banners. At Marmaxx, comp sales grew a strong 3%. A combination of a higher average basket and an increase in customer transactions drove the comp increase.\nIt was great to see strength in our store performance across all income demographics, which speaks to our broad-based appeal of our values. Marmaxx's segment profit margin was 14.2%, up 10 basis points versus last year. Our Sierra stores and U.S. e-commerce sites, which we report as part of this division, also saw strong sales results. We feel great about Marmaxx's performance, the initiatives underway for the second half of the year, and our long-term opportunities that we believe will allow us to drive sales and capture additional market share. At HomeGoods, comp sales grew a very strong 5% with strength at both our HomeGoods and HomeSense banners. Segment profit margin grew 10%, up 90 basis points versus last year.\nOur eclectic assortment of home fashions that we source from around the world are clearly resonating with customers. We are excited about what's in store for the back half of the year, and we're confident our customers will be too. We remain confident that we can continue to capture additional share in the U.S. home market. TJX Canada's comp sales increased an outstanding 9%. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis grew to a very strong 16%, up 100 basis points versus last year. Our retail banners in Canada, which consist of Winners, Marshalls, and HomeSense, have extremely high brand awareness and customer loyalty.\nWe see great potential for our Canadian banners for the rest of 2025 and long term, and for their continued successful growth across the country. At TJX International, comp sales increased a very strong 5%. Once again, we're very pleased to see sales strength in Europe and outstanding sales in Australia. Segment profit margin on a constant currency basis grew to 5.2%, up 80 basis points versus last year. With our leadership position and decades of international operating experience, we are confident we can continue to be an attractive shopping destination for value-seeking customers across Europe and Australia. Moving to inventory.\nBalance sheet inventory was up 14%, and inventory on a per-store basis was up 10% versus last year, as we've been buying into the excellent opportunities for quality, branded merchandise we've been seeing in the marketplace. We are confident that availability of merchandise will continue to be outstanding and that we are well-positioned to flow fresh assortments to our stores and online this fall and holiday season. As to capital allocation, we continue to reinvest in the growth of our business while returning $1 billion in the second quarter to shareholders through our buyback and dividend programs. Now I'll turn it back to Ernie.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you, John. Now I'd like to take a moment and highlight the opportunities we see to keep driving sales and traffic in the second half of the year. First, I am convinced that consumers will continue to seek out value and that we will remain a very attractive option for consumers seeking great brands, fashions, and quality merchandise at compelling prices. Our customer surveys tell us that our value perception remains strong, and we are laser-focused on keeping it that way. Again, product availability has been outstanding. Our global world-class buying organization of over 1,300 buyers sourced from an ever-changing universe of over 21,000 vendors across more than 100 countries.\nI'm extremely confident that our buyers will bring consumers the right assortment at the right values throughout the fall and holiday season. Next, we feel great about the product category initiatives underway for the back-to-school and holiday shopping season. Further, we have made our stores a year-round shopping destination for gifts and believe we are becoming more top of mind with shoppers with our consumable offerings. We believe that shoppers will be inspired to visit us frequently to see what's new. Lastly, we are planning exciting marketing campaigns that will continue to reinforce our value leadership.\nWe plan to continue to represent a broad range of shoppers in our advertising and leverage a wide variety of media channels to target a wide customer base. We believe these campaigns will help us continue to attract new shoppers, stay top of mind with our existing customers, and encourage cross-shopping of our retail banners. Beyond this year, we have great confidence in our key success factors that have served us so well through our nearly fifty-year history. We are convinced that these key characteristics of our business set us up extremely well for continued growth around the world over the long term.\nFirst, we are convinced that our position as a trusted value leader in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia will continue to be a tremendous advantage. We believe our value proposition of brand, fashion, price, and quality will continue to resonate with consumers. Our commitment to offer great value on every item every day to every customer will always be a top priority. Second, we aim to attract shoppers across a very wide customer demographic with our treasure hunt shopping experience. Our extensive assortments of good, better, and best brands allow us to offer merchandise to a broad range of income and age groups.\nWe believe our strategy of trading across a wide customer demographic differentiates us from many other retailers and is a tremendous advantage. Further, we continue to attract younger customers to our stores, which we believe bodes well for the future.\nJohn Klinger: Third, we believe the flexibility of our business will continue to be a significant benefit as we operate through the ever-changing macro and retail environments. The flexibility of our buying, store formats, systems, and supply chain allow us to merchandise stores individually with a rapidly changing curated mix of goods with a wide range of price points. Next, we see the long-term potential to open an additional 1,800 plus stores in just our current countries and Spain. We also see great growth potential with our joint venture in and investment in The Middle East. Importantly, I am extremely confident that there will be plenty of quality merchandise available to support our store growth plans.\nWe believe we can keep delivering the best merchandise values and shopping experience to our customers around the world. Lastly and most importantly is the longevity and knowledge of our talent, which I believe is unmatched. Throughout TJX, our management teams have deep decades-long off-price experience in the U.S. and internationally. We take great pride in our TJX University and other teaching and training programs and are laser-focused on succession planning to ensure we develop the next generation of leaders for our company. Additionally, our deep bench gives us great flexibility to rotate talent throughout the company to further develop our future leaders.\nI am also very proud of our culture, which I believe is a major differentiator and will continue to be another key component of our success.\nErnie Herrman: Summing up, we are extremely pleased to deliver another quarter of strong sales and profitability. We believe our performance and momentum in the first half of the year puts us in an excellent position for continued success for the remainder of the year. We feel great about our value positioning in the current environment and are confident that we will have an appealing assortment of merchandise in our stores and online throughout the fall and winter seasons. We have a strategic vision for long-term success, and I am convinced that we are set up well to capitalize on the opportunities we see to grow our company and capture market share around the world for many years to come.\nNow I'll turn the call back to John to cover our full-year and third-quarter guidance, and then we'll open it up for questions.\nJohn Klinger: Thanks again, Ernie. I'll start with our full-year fiscal 2026 guidance. We now expect overall comp sales to increase by 3%. We are increasing our full-year consolidated sales guidance to a range of $59.3 billion to $59.6 billion. This increase now reflects a significant benefit from favorable foreign exchange rates on the translation of our foreign sales to U.S. dollars, as well as the flow-through of our above-plan sales in the second quarter. We're increasing our full-year profitability guidance to be in the range of 11.4% to 11.5%. This would be flat to down 10 basis points versus last year's 11.5%.\nMoving to gross margin, we now expect it to be in the range of 30.5% to 30.6%, flat to down 10 basis points versus last year's 30.6%. We now expect full-year SG&A to be 19.4%, flat versus last year. We're now assuming net interest income of about $108 million, which we expect to deleverage fiscal 2026 pre-tax profit margin by 10 basis points. Our full-year guidance assumes a tax rate of 24.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.13 billion shares. As a result of these assumptions, we're increasing our full-year diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.57, up 6% to 7% versus last year's diluted earnings per share of $4.26.\nThis EPS guidance now includes our second quarter above-planned sales and a negative 1% impact to EPS growth due to unfavorable foreign exchange, versus a negative 3% impact on our previous guidance. Moving to the third quarter, we expect overall comp sales to increase 2% to 3%, consolidated sales to be in the range of $14.7 billion to $14.8 billion, pre-tax profit to be in the range of 12% to 12.1%, down 20 to 30 basis points versus last year's 12.3%. Gross margin to be in the range of 31.6% to 31.7%, this would be flat to up 10 basis points versus last year. SG&A to be 19.8%, 30 basis points unfavorable to last year.\nWe're also assuming net interest income of about $25 million, which we expect to deleverage third-quarter pre-tax profit margin by 10 basis points. Our third-quarter guidance also assumes a tax rate of 24.7% and a weighted average share count of approximately 1.13 billion shares. Based on these assumptions, we expect third-quarter diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.19, up 3% to 4% versus last year's $1.14.\nLastly, our implied guidance for the fourth quarter assumes that overall comp sales would be up 2% to 3%, pre-tax profit margin will be in the range of 11.7% to 11.8%, up 10 to 20 basis points versus last year, and diluted earnings per share would be in the range of $1.33 to $1.36, up 8% to 11% versus last year. As for tariffs, our third quarter, fourth quarter, and full-year guidance assumes that we'll be able to offset the incremental tariff pressure on our business this year. We're making an assumption that the current level of tariffs on imports into the U.S. will stay in place for the remainder of the year.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate Ernie's confidence in our plans for the second half of the year and our long-term opportunities. I also want to emphasize that we remain in an excellent position to continue to invest in the growth of the company while simultaneously returning significant cash to our shareholders. Now we're happy to take your questions. As a reminder, please limit your questions to one per person so we can answer as many questions as we can. Thanks. And now we'll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Matthew Boss.\nMatthew Boss: Thanks and congrats on another nice quarter.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you.\nMatthew Boss: Ernie, could you speak to the consistency of your comps despite the volatile macro backdrop and elaborate on the strength that you've seen to start the third quarter and excitement around product availability? And then for John, just maybe puts and takes on merchandise margins in the back half of the year relative to flat performance in the second quarter despite the impact of tariffs that you saw?\nErnie Herrman: Okay. Sounds good, Matt. Yeah. Consistency, you know, where I give the teams a lot of credit, and, again, we've talked about the broad range of the customer base that we go after. But what I really like to highlight, we mentioned it a little bit in the script, but our categories of business were healthy across all areas, meaning home, apparel, accessories, all of that was good. That, combined with our flexible business model, I think, allows us to execute in a more consistent fashion our comp sales. Because we're able to flex regardless of the and you mentioned availability. Yes. Availability has continued to be fantastic out there.\nBut, again, in terms of demand by family of business, whether you're dealing with, you know, ladies or men's apparel or kids' apparel or our accessories divisions, of which there are multiple families of business in there, our home business, because we're so flexible in the way we buy hand to mouth, we are able to go after the opportunities across all the different families of business, which then results in, I think, a more consistent comp sales performance.\nSo I believe we're sometimes able to escape, Matt, which I think is what you're getting at, is the volatility of, you know, having a quarter where all of a sudden your comps are, you know, four points off the prior quarter or whatever, which is not uncommon in retail. For us, it's less common. As you can see by the way, Marmaxx, you know, got a point better than Q1. As did, you know, a lot of our international division.\nSo I think the flexibility of the business model and at the same time, we're taking advantage, I think, of a marketplace out there where you've had store closures and perhaps less exciting execution across the board in retail brick and mortar specifically. And I think that helps us to bob and weave and take advantage of consistently keeping driving. To keep driving consistency in our sales. By the way, your point B of your first question when you mentioned availability, that is and I did mention that back as you know, a few months ago. It continues to be super strong availability as we go into Q3. Guess I'll hand it over to John then.\nJohn Klinger: Yeah. So, Matt, on the merchandise margin, not a tremendous amount to add to what our prepared remarks said. I mean, we still have foreign exchange that is negatively impacting us in the third quarter. And we do feel confident that we can continue to offset the tariff pressures, again, like we said, in the third quarter, fourth quarter, and back half of the year.\nMatthew Boss: Great color. Best of luck.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brooke Roach.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning, and thank you for taking our question. Ernie, as pricing in the industry has begun to increase, are you seeing an acceleration of market share gains as consumers look for value at TJX? What are your latest thoughts on pricing as you move into fall and holiday? Are you looking to maintain the percent gaps? Will you selectively raise prices in this inflationary environment? Thank you.\nErnie Herrman: Great questions, Brooke. And obviously, time is quite appropriate based on what's going on in the world around us. We have, you know, again, this is one of those funky situations where we don't top-down dictate prices. So we don't go in with the strategy that we're going to raise price per se. And in fact, and I think I've gone through this a few times, we kind of use other retailers around us to route the door pricing and our buyers work it backwards. So they look at what the out-the-door pricing is around, and then we say, yes. And by the way, this was part of your question.\nAre we going to our pricing percentage gap, is that going to change or not? So this is where the art form comes in and the secret sauce. We don't go by an exact percentage because sometimes on a say you have a women's top, for example, that's that we think the right phenomenal value on that is $19.99. And that top is being sold. That top's retail went up in another store, their out-the-door sale price is, you know, $35. And, oh, maybe we could go to 25. We may not go because and this is the art form.\nBecause in our mix, we have possibly made so many other great buys with all of the availability that's out there. That we have to now that buyer says, I have to compete in my own mix now for the customer. So then that's why it's absolutely a deal by deal, SKU by SKU, brand by brand situation, I don't know if that pricing in that case, the pricing percent gap might be higher. Or if we had to go up on that retail because of weekend because the retails around us went up, and maybe the percent gap is back to the same as where it was before.\nSo I never broad brush that we have a strategy overall on that because I know our buyers are doing deal by deal. One of the strengths of our buying teams is they are aggressively comp shopping, all of the competition, whether it's online, brick and mortar, vertical brands, department stores, specialty stores. And so, I give them a lot of credit, by the way. We've been navigating in the tariff environment by just staying simple and pure to that model. The other thing I'd point out, it's easy to forget, is that, remember, you know, ninety year give or take, you know, we're dealing the bulk vast bulk of, maybe 90% of what we buy, there's third parties.\nWe're not the direct importer. So, that's why our buyers can really pretty much just off the retail and work it backwards because we're not we're not starting with this is what we're paying, and those goods aren't in other retailers. We have to just mark it up off of what we're paying. So does that make sense?\nJohn Klinger: And, Brooke, the other thing I would add to that is that our customer surveys continue to show that we're continuing to offer exceptional value to the customer. Yeah. Very strong percept if anything, our perception on value of our customers has improved over the last couple of years. So, I mean, you're asking are so on to the right question, though, because this is this is really, motherhood and apple pie to us. In terms of what we concentrate on.\nErnie Herrman: Yeah. Yeah. Did we answer that, Brooke?\nBrooke Roach: Yes. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.\nErnie Herrman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson.\nLorraine Hutchinson: I wanted to build on Brooke's pricing question. Was pricing a key factor in your tariff mitigation in 2Q in a comp? And how has the customer reacted to some of these higher price points?\nErnie Herrman: Sure. Yeah. Lorraine, great also. It goes hand in hand with that. I mean, overall for TJX, transactions continue to drive the comp. For Marmaxx, it was basket and transactions. I think you're you're finding that, you know, our margins are healthy. Couple of things. One is to please don't underestimate. I wanna emphasize that tariff costs were higher, and they were a headwind for us. In Q2 and year over year. Just in the end, a little bit lower than we had expected. And so that you know, we had a bit of a bit of a savings there.\nWe also because of this environment, I would say the retail adjustments based on what the out-the-door happened in pockets I don't think there was as much of that as there was our merchants taking advantage of the market opportunities. Which allowed us to, in many cases, buy better to help offset the tariffs that way on the on the market goods. If that makes sense, Lorraine. In other words, you know, we were getting more hit on the tariffs directly on our own direct imports, but that's a small portion of our total.\nSo our buyers did a very good job on taking advantage of the mark, you know, in terms of market excess inventory by category back to the flexible flexibility there. We're also we manage we're able to manage our markdowns efficiently which also helps with our merchandise margin. And one team I'd like to give a lot of credit to is our planning and allocation teams. They are sometimes the unsung heroes because I'm always talking about right you know, rightfully so, having the right good. So we tend to talk I tend to talk about the buyers and the merchandise manager. Who are doing a phenomenal job in this environment.\nBut our planning and allocation division is amazing, and that applies to every division we're in, whether it's Canada, Marmaxx, HomeGoods, Sierra, Europe, Australia, every planning and allocation division is so good at balancing our mixes by category, family of business, by literally by district, by store. And so what happens and we keep getting better and better at so what happens there, we're able to manage our drive our sales. That's back to answering the consistency question that I think Matt had asked. And at the same time, help our merchandise margin by saving on markdowns by flowing the right amount of goods to the right stores.\nSo I think that's been a key component also, but taking advantage of market opportunities, I think, has allowed us to do the bulk of our dealing with the tariffs. Which are still a headwind no matter what. You know? They're still there.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Kernan.\nJohn Kernan: Hey, good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you. Thanks.\nJohn Kernan: So Ernie, some of the data we look at and other folks look at showed a nice acceleration in traffic. You know, it's back to school picked up in mid to late July and then through August. How would you characterize the comp progression throughout the quarter? I got a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nErnie Herrman: Yes. Mean, can take through that. We started the quarter strong, as we said in our opening remarks last quarter. June, there was a little bit of weather that negatively impacted us, but we came throughout of June even stronger in July. And, like we said, and they remarks today, we entered this quarter with strong sales. Yeah. So, John, to your question, we had a little bit of, I guess, call a little bit of a lull in the middle of the quarter. But other than that Oh, that's remarkable strong. Yeah. If I if I leave everyone with nothing else after this call, it's our balance and consistency, seems to be the hallmark of this quarter.\nAnd, again, the way we try to manage the business, is we try to avoid any major ups and downs, and, unfortunately, this quarter represented that.\nJohn Klinger: Yeah. And then John, just a quick follow-up. Obviously, nice upside to the pretax margin this quarter on a four comp. Is there any change to the rule of every 100 basis points upside of same store sales can give you ten or so basis points through to the bottom line. It seems like you've over the last few years, you've generally outperformed that. Curious if this becomes just more important what it is.\nErnie Herrman: For every point in comp, we would expect to get 10 to 20 basis points on the bottom line, and that's we feel that going forward, that's what you should model.\nJohn Kernan: Alright. Great. You.\nErnie Herrman: John, I want you to know that, John Klinger says that to me all the time. So you know.\nJohn Klinger: When I ask certain similar questions, I get the same answer. So.\nErnie Herrman: Yep. Good to know. Consistency.\nJohn Klinger: Yep.\nErnie Herrman: Yeah. Because yes. There you go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez.\nPaul Lejuez: Ernie, I think you mentioned consistency a couple of times, I think, related to your income demographic performance. Anything else that you can give, any more detail you could share, higher income, demos versus or lower income maybe just to build on that also, just regional differences, There's also a lot of question marks around the board stores. Any comments you can make about how those stores are performing?\nErnie Herrman: Yeah. Yeah. Sure. John and I both talked to us, but Paul, I mean, great question. I'll start off with talking about we're very we look at this all of the time consistently because of, a, yes, consistency and balance. Really, here, word is balance across all the different age groups and, income demographic groups. So our marketing team, another team that has really equipped us, I think, to take a strategic approach. Even our creative, by the way, on the marketing campaigns we have going right now is aimed at a wide age and income demographic group, which not all marketing is does for the different retailers.\nSo we have and as also, remember, we do always talk about in our merchandise mix going after good, better, best. Our marketing, we are very good at being balanced across the different age and income groups relative to we won't give you the exact numbers, but relative to The U.S. General population, we are very balanced in that respect. And if anything, our focus has been, and you've heard this before from us, we have had a focus. I think this is one of your questions. On, acquiring the younger age group as we go forward here. And we have been doing that for the last number of years.\nAnd even if I look at across our divisions, in the new customer base, which, again, is tends to be a smaller number, but our new customer base skews younger than the current customer base, which is good. And our current customer base also skews a little bit younger than the general population. So, this has been Yeah.\nJohn Klinger: I mean, it's it's the other thing is, I mean, we're giving the more reasons to come into our stores. The consumables that we offer that give a customer a reason to come in and you know, likely find something else in the store that they like. And as Arne talks about all the time, is the good, better, best mix. And appealing, really, the reason why we appeal to such a broad customer demographic. As far as, the border stores, so we look at our Canadian border. The nice thing is we've got stores on both sides. We have seen and, not talking about a lot of stores that we have on our borders.\nSo it's it's really hardly any impact, to the total. But we did see a little less cross border shopping So more of the Canadians were staying home and shopping winters versus coming over and shopping TJ Maxx. But again, very, very small impact.\nErnie Herrman: We do I'll also see a little lift on the same side of our Canada stores as you can right? Yeah. Those sales just, you know, they just transferred. They transfer over.\nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And then on the southern border?\nJohn Klinger: Again, we're not seeing a large impact. You look at our sales across the different geographies, it was pretty consistent across all the geographies in the country. So again, we're not seeing a large impact.\nErnie Herrman: You know, we see an impact when, if there's some natural disasters, for example, will and even in the news media gets more viewership, in a region, And so, for example, in California, we'd see a little dip on that you know, when that was going on, and that's what John and I typically are seeing. We're not seeing anything really radical along the Mexico border at all. And yeah. And, usually, the weather, like we saw in.\nJohn Klinger: In June, I mean, it when the weather subsides, we see things bounce back. Bounce back. Yeah.\nPaul Lejuez: Yep.\nJohn Klinger: Yep. Got it. You got it. Good luck.\nErnie Herrman: Yeah. Oh, and also, Paul, to that regional I know you're kind of on the regional question. Is we back to the planning and allocate our planning and allocation division, was they're also good at this, if we end up in a district, an area of, say, a dozen stores or a region, or in a certain geography where there's something going on or it's our planning allocation with our store ops, division, they're fantastic at reacting very Our field organization if there's something on you this happens.\nSo John and I are talking a high level but there is a lot of work that our teams in the field a planning allocation do to compensate any for any strange regional or local market Yeah.\nJohn Klinger: We turn our stores roughly once a month. Right. We do have the ability to react quickly.\nErnie Herrman: Which I think goes back to the, consistent, that all of these things help our consistency. Because we're able to then take goods and say, oh, I'll ship it to these other areas that are doing better. It helps offset the area that's a little weak, but we've been very happy with the balance of healthy business across the entire country and internationally. As you can see, very pleased with, Canada and Europe.\nPaul Lejuez: Thank you, guys. Good luck.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the results. As you think about the merchandise.\nErnie Herrman: Oh. Well.\nDana Telsey: You hear can you hear me okay?\nErnie Herrman: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We can. Yep.\nDana Telsey: Oh, great. Good after good morning, afternoon. Congratulations on the terrific results.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you, Dana.\nDana Telsey: Delivering a flat merchandise margin with tariffs is very impressive. And Ernie, as you mentioned the pricing mechanism of not only comparing against competitors, but even within the mix. How are you thinking about the merch margin going forward given the planning of tariffs? And just lastly, on store openings, closings, relocations, what are you seeing out there given the continued influx of available boxes? Thank you.\nErnie Herrman: So on John, do you wanna?\nJohn Klinger: Yeah. I mean, as far as merchandise margin goes, yes, we were pleased that in the third quarter that we were flat given tariff pressures. Markdowns did come in favorable we were happy to see. And going forward, again, we feel confident that we can continue to offset the tariffs that we have out there based on what Ernie said earlier in the call of how our buyers are executing. And just continue to execute just the overall margin, the pretax profit, just by executing the cost efficiencies that we saw in the second quarter continuing to go after those in the back half of the year as well.\nErnie Herrman: Yeah. Dana, I think a couple of highlights why we're feeling bullish on being able to deal with the tariffs as we go forward is the way we buy with and combined with the, the amount of availability out there right now and right. Which is really going to create more buying opportunities for our teams to even if the retail wasn't changing, they can buy better. Than we did before because of the amount of availability. And, and, yes, of course, the ability to adjust our ticket while maintaining, though, our value gap.\nAgain, back to we look at what the out the door is on the like for like item, and then we say, if that if that has gone up, you know, we will preserve the gap, and maybe we'll go up. And adjust it accordingly. Again, we don't lead the charge on that, though. And then our flexibility, by the way, gives us the ability to diversify our source which I think is another we are fortunate that we don't have a contract with the customer saying we have to have x amount of people know that when they come to us, we may not have a category in inventory. As much as we did the time before.\nOr we might have more of something else versus that time. Yep. So that flexibility to diversify in our store just by where the best values are that we opportunistically go after really helps our merchandise margin deal with any tariffs. Because if we run into a say there's a category that's highly tariff driven and we're not happy with the values, we'd be on that. We can just downplay that. Category. Whereas maybe other retailers, they're living off of it. We're we're so diverse in our families of business that we're able to do that. And we can also the last thing I'd leave you with is you know, how we talk about the 1,300 buyers.\nSo, you know, we have buyers. We have all these global buying offices in different locations over in Europe. And the Far East looking for excess inventories that nobody else has that. Nobody else has these satellite buying offices, like we have in all of these different locations that can source easier, flex, and faster sourcing in different countries. Yeah. Which can also allow us to flex against the tariff situation. So good question. I think that's why we're feeling o okay. And I'll leave you with it. It's still a challenge, but we feel like we have strategies to kind of deal with the challenge.\nJohn Klinger: And then getting to your, your store question, So we're still on track to hit our plan of just over a 130 net new stores. And so we're seeing a lot of great locations available to us. Going forward. That gives us optimism to continue a roughly a 3% net unit opening over the next couple of years. The other thing we're seeing a lot of success in, again, we can continue to see relocations as being a great, opportunity for us to relocate stores that there's a better shopping environment in the area that we can move to. And we're seeing improvement there. And then, of course, close to 500 remodels that we're planning on doing this year.\nAnd, again, that makes our stores the older stores, be able to compete similar to our younger stores? Because when the customer comes in, they're seeing a consistent shopping experience no matter what store they go into. And that's one of the things that you know, kind of separates us from some of our competition. You know, where, you know, the product mix just looks better when we maintain our store fit and finish. And so it all kinda warp walks hand in hand with the merchandise.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you, Dana.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Straton.\nAlex Straton: Perfect. Thanks so much. Congrats on another great quarter. Ernie, I had a question on Marmaxx specifically. I know you spoke to categories being super healthy across the business. But I'm wondering if you could kind of break that down for us at Marmaxx and how you think exposure can change over time. Seems like that's been a part of the margins story there. And then maybe just one quick one for John. It seems like that you're embedding more particular, gross margin degradation in the fourth quarter. I'm wondering if there's something specific happening in that quarter or why that's the case? Thanks so much.\nErnie Herrman: Yeah, Alex. So on Marmaxx, in terms of the families of it, as I think as I mentioned, our home business was, good there, which is nice to see. And, also, I'm proud of, you know, again, our HomeGoods and HomeSense businesses across the corporation and the home business within our full family stores across the corporation of Allgoods. So I don't wanna leave that out. But apparel has been, very healthy. And I think relative to the market, specifically in Marmaxx, relative to the market my guess is we're gaining market share. They're just looking at the results of the other apparel players, the way they've been trending over the last six months.\nAnd so I'm very proud of in the Pure Apparel, areas. And then as you know, we have and I can't give you the details by department, but I would tell you throughout our accessory areas, which, you know, we're an open book. If you walk in the store, we have many different areas and accessories that I believe we are the market in as well. So, you know, Alex, what I what I like about that is we're not just a, you know, it's not just one story why our business is so healthy. It's it's kind of widespread and that always allows us, I think, to feel good about where we're heading in the future.\nBecause if something slowed up, I can still fuel one of the other areas to take advantage of the market opportunities that are out there. So, you know, again, once again, our planning and allocation teams work hand in hand with the buyers in developing these plans by family of business, whether it's ladies apparel or, kids apparel or men's apparel. Which families of business in those apparel layers, which in our you know, whether it's in, footwear or our beauty area or handbags, we are very strategic and balanced about the way we plan it, but we can turn on a dime based on what happens in the market. So hope hopefully, that gives you some color there.\nJohn Klinger: Yeah. As far as Q4 margins, so we are improving by 20 basis points versus last year. But is your question more comparison to Q3? To Q4 Yeah.\nAlex Straton: Exactly. So there's two things that are happening on the Q3 to q comparison.\nJohn Klinger: The first one is that in Q3, inventory levels are probably at their highest during the year. So we've got inventory cap favorability. Then we bring the inventories back down in the fourth quarter. The other piece of it is this year with our shrink a cool. So this year, we've got a favorable comparison Q1, Q2, and Q3 that reverses out in Q4. And it's just the function of how we accrue versus last year where last year, we had, a favorable impact in Q4. So when you're when you're planning it, we're planning a shrink slightly favorable this year. So naturally, Q1, Q2, Q3 there's a favorable variance.\nIn Q4, it flips the other way to be slightly up on the full year. Is that clear?\nAlex Straton: Yep. Super clear. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih.\nAdrienne Yih: Yes. Good morning and congratulations. The store is both concepts look fabulous. Ernie, so the last time that we had sort of a path through at frontline of a real significant kind of price inflation was back kind of 2011 for the apparel retailers. And what we're seeing kind of since July, since these apparel retailers have thematically started to raise initial retailers or retails, we don't see a lot of pricing power. I gotta tell you. Like, we see hard pricing that looks really similar, hard prices similar to last year. And so, I guess, kinda if you can give us some perspective, I know what happened in 02\/2011. Got the sales, and you didn't get the margins.\nAnd then you guys cleaned up. Right after that, you guys cleaned up and picked up a lot of the disruption. So Right. You know, like I said, we don't see we see promos out there on fall goods, on apparel specifically. Can you talk about category pricing power? Maybe footwear is better than apparel. Or something like that? I know it.\nErnie Herrman: Right. Yeah. So without, telling you, know, again, for competitive reasons, we don't like to give what our strategy is, but let me give you the philosophy of it. Which is that we and I think apparel in general has been deflationary for years. So when I go back to your spot on when you talk about that it's been promotional for years. And the newness, in the world of apparel, as you if you look at it, it's been very spotty. You know, you have some pockets in ladies' businesses across the industry that have been good. I think men's has been very inconsistent, not great.\nSo long story short, what we do is we look at the pot our pricing I guess you'd call it the pricing power a likelihood of where things might go up around us. Again, it's not us driving the bus on that. Would probably be in other areas. We just won't talk about what those areas are. And so, and it'll vary by items within apparel. That might go up. But in general, what you're hearing and feeling would kinda be in sync with what I would guess. Again, I just cannot give you many specifics on that front. Other than to tell you that we will manage it as I described earlier on, case by case.\nThis is what's great about our model. Our buyers don't have to be, ahead of everybody in terms of deciding what the retail is. We just follow. And then we say, we're gonna follow, but we're gonna have the best value out there. And.\nAdrienne Yih: And then, John, a quick one for you on the horizon of kind of the flow through of tariffs. There's this kind of grace period. Right? If you ship it before August 9 and get it in before you know, October 5, that it's on the old tariffs. So how should we think about and I know you're not giving guidance, but how should we think about kind of impact probably not to you because of what Ernie just said, but impact to the sector kind of on the spring horizon, prices go up again. Right?\nErnie Herrman: At front? I'll jump in on that. I think, Adrian, I think so what's hap the thing I've been seeing across the board, anything we're tariffs are hitting, even if they're changing, is there's a gradual I can some of the retailers seem to be not moving the price directly with the first landing of the tariff. And it's going up its steps. So I think you're gonna see a more of a little bit of a gradual increase in pricing as the tariffs come in. I don't know if that's answering the question. I don't think you'll see step all of a sudden Right.\nWith the tariffs set, because I don't wanna, I think, turn off customers immediately by seeing a dramatic price shift. So I think they might they might they might absorb it initially for a little bit, and eventually, they'll get there. Again, that varies by retailer. And, again, the vendors could be negotiating with.\nJohn Klinger: Factories to also Not a doubt. Yep. Share some of the pressure. Yep.\nAdrienne Yih: Great. Fabulous. Best of luck.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you, Adrian.\nAdrienne Yih: Impressive as always.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Binetti.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. I'll add my congrats on the quarter.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you, Michael. Michael, by the way, we liked your headline. You had a great headline.\nMichael Binetti: Oh, thanks. We, we spent a lot of time being creative with the title.\nJohn Klinger: Thanks, man.\nMichael Binetti: When I maybe a few quick ones for the model. When I look at the fourth four comp in the quarter, slightly accelerating from the three in first quarter, did overall traffic accelerate? Or is it same as 1Q? And then on the merch margin, you said it was flat. With the inventory sorry, with the inventory hedge. Would merch margins have been down excluding that benefit? Or how should I think about the inventory hedge impact rest of the year?\nJohn Klinger: So as far as the four comp and what we saw for transactions, yeah, transactions again, were up across the board. I would say compared to Q1, probably the basket is maybe a little bit more. Particularly in Marmaxx. But then as far as your margin question, can you just ask that one more time? Sorry.\nMichael Binetti: Yeah. Yeah. You said it was flat. I know the inventory hedge was a component. On the gross margin. I didn't know if merch margin would have been down excluding that benefit. Just to help me think about the merch margin the rest of year.\nJohn Klinger: Yes. So the inventory hedge yeah, it was a slight it was it was the headwind that we did see. Going forward, you know, I think with the way the way you would look at it is that there probably is a little bit of a headwind in the back half, but not significant.\nMichael Binetti: Okay. And then can I just ask a little bit of a follow-up to another question? A little bit about the margin bridge on pretax expanded 50 basis points in second quarter. Guidance is for a little bit of compression, 25%, 35% in third quarter and then reaccelerate to expansion 10 to 20 basis points in fourth quarter. Can you maybe just help me connect those? Any unusual items to be aware of the rest of the year? Either this year or in the base?\nJohn Klinger: So as far as the bottom line pre-tax profit, so Q3 they're we obviously have some headwinds that average retail being one of them. The reversal of expenses from the second quarter, you know, mainly into third quarter is another headwind there. And then in the fourth quarter, again, we have you know, the benefit from the higher sales volume that between Q3 and Q4. But again, what we talked about before about Q3 and Q4, Q3 has the benefit from the inventory cap, and Q4 has the headwind from the from the shrink accrual. Does that make sense?\nMichael Binetti: Yeah. Couple things to work through. Okay. I appreciate it. We'll talk to you guys later on. Thank you.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Marni Shapiro.\nMarni Shapiro: Hey, guys. Congratulations. Great quarter in the store looked beautiful. HomeGoods for back to college. Honestly stunning. I have a quick question for me. You've mentioned gifting, I think, more than once in your prepared remarks, which is not always usual for you. So I'm assuming that you feel good about any buys that you've made in advance. In the holiday, and you were able to pack away some of that given how heavily tariffed holiday decor is. But are you seeing a change in consumer behavior in your stores that is kinda shifting your focus a little even more so to gifting?\nI mean, you guys have done an improved job year after year after year, but has something changed? Because you don't usually mention it this early in the year in your prepared comments.\nErnie Herrman: Right. No. Great question, Marni. Well, part of part of what's happened over the last couple of years, we've evolved in terms of actually going after gifting for not just a holiday. We've started going after the gifting seasons, whether it's Mother's Day, Father's Day, And, what's happened is more a lot of our merchants merchandise managers and their and their families of business have figured out product, to go after that's more appropriate to be gifted. I think you combine that with there's been momentum. If you look at Marni, you know, you shop our stores aggressively. I know you're right commenting on what you see there.\nYou go to holiday, and we if you look at our results in Q4, they've been, super consistent year after year. And I think what's been building year after year, what we're showing everybody is that we're very fresh as you go into holiday. As you get nearer to Christmas. And back again to our a combination of our merchants and our planning areas given the right product that's very giftable.\nWhere we think where some retailers have vacated some of those items in certain categories, even in apparel, And I think we tend to go after some of the I guess, market share opportunity categories where we feel like other retailers are away, and we can go after those gifting categories more aggressively. And for this back half and holiday, that's what I'm seeing our teams do. And that's across home and apparel and accessories. They're going, strongly after the categories that tend to spike during the gifting category. Combine that with the and you know this as well. I think you've commented on it.\nAs we've talked about is we're cool we are cool today be a gifting destination, Right? And I think I know you and I have, joked about that at the time, but true. We are people like giving a HomeGoods or a TJ Maxx or, every place we're in, our brands have become, very desirable to be gifting destination brands. And I give that's the whole team. That's whether you're up at Winners or in Europe or every division, marketing wise, store, store execution wise in terms of treating the well and most importantly, the product I think the whole thing is working right now in terms of more consumers wanting to buy gifts from TJX brands.\nMarni Shapiro: And can I just follow-up on that with the home your HomeGoods your HomeGood back to college was really next level? I've never seen you guys look that cohesive in your storytelling. So I'm listening to you talk about gifting. I'm thinking about what I saw in HomeGoods for back to college. And thinking that you guys from a merchant standpoint are really doing a better job storytelling and merchandising in store, that the buying was always there, but now combining it with the storytelling in store, is that kind of been where the unlock is around all of these holidays and events?\nErnie Herrman: Yes, Marni. Yeah. And I should have mentioned that. Our store teams and in conjunction, again, with the merchants executing for these seasonal time periods like a back to college. They're doing a great job in buying the product for those time periods. And then the stores excellent. The HomeGoods, store teams are doing an excellent job on pulling that together to make it really easy to shop. And it you know what that does. Right? Does somebody like you or me equate an impulse to purchase a two or three items instead of just one when you see it all put together that way.\nMarni Shapiro: I'm going broker [indiscernible] congratulations to you guys. This is a great quarter.\nErnie Herrman: Thank you very much, Marni. Really appreciate it. Mhmm. And that was our, last question. I would like to thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to updating you again on our third quarter earnings call in November. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

The growth rate across all business segments, including overseas and domestic reached or surpassed our upper limit of the guidance. Meanwhile, we also made significant progress in 2 strategic directions that is our IP strategy and the large store strategy. Coming next, I will share with you our quarterly performance highlights and our future strategic planning. In Q2, the overall GMV grew by 21%. Revenue grew by 23.1%. We achieved the first positive same-store sales growth in 4 consecutive quarters. This performance not only exceeds our prior expectation, but also be accelerated compared with Q1.\nMINISO and TOP TOY, our 2 brands also showed accelerated growth momentum in revenue in Q2. MINISO brand grew by 20%, while TOP TOY achieved robust revenue growth by 87%. In terms of the profitability, our gross margin was 44.3%. The GP margin improvement was mainly driven by the increased contribution from overseas revenue and the TOP TOY GP margin optimization. But adjusted operating profit this quarter was RMB 850 million, up by 8.5%, but adjusted operating margin of 17.2% improved compared with Q1. We expect operating margin will continue to improve by peak season sales in H2 of this year.\nComing next, I'm going to break down MINISO mainland China, MINISO overseas and TOP TOY to walk you through our business as a whole. First of all, for MINISO mainland China, the business continued to maintain high-quality growth. Revenue grew by 13.6%. In comparison, China's total retail sales of the consumer goods grew by 5.4% during the same period. The online retail sales of the physical goods grew by 6.3%. This shows that MINISO's mainland China business growth rate not only outpaced the overseas retail industry, but also exceed online channel growth, demonstrating our tremendous advantage of the offline store. Particularly speaking, domestic comparable same-store sales has been recovering steadily since the beginning of this year, turning positive in Q2.\nEntering into Q3, same-store growth momentum has been further accelerated. Going forward, consistently maintaining same-store sales performance that is our peers will become our long-term focus. Within this quarter, we achieved a net addition of 30 MINISO stores in China, including 7 MINISO LANDs. Last quarter, there might be some excessive concerns about the short-term impact of the channel upgrades. But from our perspective, this is the necessary move for long-term rapid growth. After 1 quarter of adjustment, store has quickly returned to positive growth. The number of the retail partner has reached a new height.\nMore importantly, MINISO mainland China achieved double-digit revenue growth despite moderate store additions, fully demonstrating channel upgrades can actually be the key high-quality growth driver of our business. Overseas market achieved RMB 1.9 billion revenue in Q2, grew by 28.6%. Among them, U.S. revenue growth was more than 80%, and which was benefited from the same-store improvement and also high-quality new store opened in this year. Due to the product metric optimization, U.S. same-store sales achieved a mid-single-digit positive growth in Q2. The 37 net new stores added to U.S. market also demonstrated good performance. The average store efficiency and the sales per square meter significantly higher than the existing stores lay a very solid foundation for our accelerated growth.\nTOP TOY achieved 87% Y-o-Y growth in Q2 with a net addition of 30 stores during Q2, reaching 293 in total. 283 are in China and 10 are in overseas markets, benefited from effective product differentiating strategy and product power improvement. Same-store sales grew in a low-single digit in Q2, with GP margin improved significantly. TOP TOY is also a leader in pop toy market, which is significant and distinctive in the market. Going forward, we will continue to expand our recognizable brand network, we'll continue to improve our private brands and proprietary IP business. Coming next, I will share with you 2 strategic initiatives behind our robust performance, including large store and proprietary IP.\nAs the end of June, MINISO has deployed 11 MINISO LAND stores nationwide, covering Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu. 11 MINISO LAND store achieved an average monthly efficiency of several million. Shanghai Nanjing East Road, global #1 store achieved a sale of RMB 100 million within 9 months of opening, breaking new records. The SPACE store opened in Nanjing, Deji in June represent another breakthrough for TOP POY to enter into luxury malls, open new opportunities for high-end luxury shopping malls and also continue to build same scenarios for differentiated IPs. With curated product combined with immersive spatial experience, MINISO LAND has achieved new breakthroughs in both attachment rate and ASP plus higher consumer conversion rate.\nSo the MINISO LAND not only set new performance record, but also achieved high sales per square meter with regular stores, then contributing above average single store GP margin. MINISO LAND store also achieved excellent profitability, but also served as a key base for our hit product and the modular zones. For MINISO IP LAND, it actually helped to launch new products and limited additions and which can actually form a flywheel of the large store, creating heat, traffic, [ propogandations ] and also regular store scaling up, delivering traffic and sales to store categories across all locations.\nMINISO LAND serves as a spearhead of the continued innovation and breakthrough, where flagship store is a cornerstone of our large store strategy. As of H1, we have already opened 200 flagship stores with a GFA of more than 400 square kilometers. Around half of them is being opened in 2024. Those larger store achieved sales as well as store efficiency above the average. We can see even for the past 2 quarters, we don't see the big change for absolute number of the stores. But actually, our channel structure has already been upgraded. We are not purely seeking for the quantity growth. We continue to optimize our channel mix and continue to seek for incremental growth opportunities.\nRegarding the overseas markets, particularly, I'd like to mention U.S., our largest direct operated country. The operation performance and brand momentum continued to improve with large store strategy. U.S. store opened in 2025 achieved a store efficiency 1.5x higher than the existing stores. Sales per square meter also be 30% higher. The rent-to-sell ratio is also better than existing stores. The core advantage leverage this is the diversified product portfolios, including the collectibles figures to the beauty products to the stationeries and gifts and the trendy toys for the whole family loves.\nLarge store can satisfy the interest and the needs of the whole group age of the family, becoming a one-stop shopping destination for trendy lifestyle products for the entire American family. But why can we be successful in operating the largest store strategy? I believe it's because of our excellent supply chain and product capacity. We attach great importance to proprietary product development. 90% of our revenue are coming from the proprietary product with a product development and design team of more than 1,000 people. We accumulated very strong 1,500 high-quality global suppliers. Only by so doing, we will be able to support a multi-category, fast refreshing and high-turnover trendy department store, large store model.\nGoing forward, as we continue to optimize and refine larger store strategy and with the ever-expanding global supply chain, and we're going to continue to have a balanced and stable development. No matter in mainland China or in overseas market, large store strategy serve as our key platform for deepen our IP strategy. Channels and contents are empowering each other. By creating new spatial experience, we greatly enrich IP meets and greets in-store pop-ups and limited product launch, all have the long-lasting memory for fans, significantly increase our integrated marketing and operational capacity for IP. Conversely, IP events and same marketing can also take more traffic to the checking activities.\nFor example, when MINISO landmark Melbourne store opened in July, we partnered with One Piece for an Australia-first launch, driving first-day store performance exceeding 500,000, achieved a new single store record for Australian market. MINISO has also become the collaboration leader in global licensed IP. In the near future, we will also leverage the product and operational capacity to actually work on the proprietary IPs to unleash greater value. For MINISO worldwide, we identified the potential pop toy artist IPs to build our MINISO's pop toy artist IP landscape. Through the dual-track parallel model with artist IP and pop licensed IPs, we will construct the IP ecosystem. Now we have already contracted 9 pop toy artists.\nFor example, for [ Yu Chan ], which has been launched in June, once being launched, it's been sold out on Mini program and we become hard to find in one store. [ Yu Chan's ] instant success marks a solid and successful step for MINISO in proprietary IP. The [ Yu Chan ] signing event held in July of this year attracted massive fan support. The mechanism will continue to be promoted, hosting signing event and exhibitions for the contracted artist at the world's top MINISO LAND stores, building deep appeal for the top-tier artists. [ Yu Chan's ] IP product will also meet overseas consumer with this year, steadily advancing our strategy of bringing 100 Chinese IPs overseas.\n[ Yu Chan's ]operational strategy fully demonstrates that in building proprietary IPs, MINISO poses unique resources, endowments, food category coverage, omnichannel penetration, global deployment and end-to-end operation. Looking worldwide, only MINISO poses the great flexibilities and scalabilities in products, the most control and innovation in channels and the most extensive and high-quality global store network. In operation, MINISO will leverage end-to-end advantage from signing artists to the design development or to marketing to production to sales of the product. We deeply empower artists at every stage, jointly operating and maximizing the IP value potential. Those are MINISO's highly differentiated resources and also the key for us to achieve leapfrog development and overtaking the competitors in proprietary IPs.\nOur investment in proprietary IP is not for short-term commercial deployment, but also a choice for long-term strategic development. I proposed the interest-driven consumption in 2020. IP is most important vehicle for interest-driven consumption. The initial success of this IP not only bring us product sales and brand exposure, but also allow us global channel partners to fully perceive the potentials of the IP consumption and the brand value of MINISO. I truly believe as IP and large store strategy continue to deepen as a synergy, we will create more marketing explosive moments and sales miracles. Now China IP market achieved a significant development, but we're just at the start, numerous development potentials are still ahead.\nLooking at the global development history from Disney to Warner to United States to Bandai and Sanrio and Nintendo in Japan, China will see more several platform-type IP companies. This is essential pathways to the great nation's rise and inevitable outcome of the culture confidence. In this market full of opportunities, MINISO with our unique advantage of full category coverage, omnichannel penetration, global deployment and end-to-end operation, we will secure our leading position in China's top-tier IP market. MINISO's future is to fully develop, thoroughly understand and deeply cultivate IP, achieving influence not only in China but also worldwide. By deepening collaboration with world top IP to ensure operational sustainability and stable growth.\nWe also built a differentiated, explosive and scalable sustainable growth driver through proprietary IP. Those are also the key to our confidence for the future growth. MINISO's new strategic vision is to become the world-leading IP design retail group. In terms of the channel network, we are already the world's largest IP product retailer. The full year 2025, we expect to generate more than RMB 38 billion in GMV and more than RMB 21 billion in revenue. We have already leading in market channel, supply chain, product design and marketing. Coming mean next, we will need to strengthen our proprietary IP capacity. I believe our vision will be finally realized.\nIn H1 of 2025, we have returned RMB 1.07 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, representing 84% of the H1 adjusted net profit. Going forward, we will remain to committed of distributing 50% of the annual adjusted net profit as dividends and also continue with dynamic share buybacks to provide predictable returns to the shareholders. That's all for me. Coming next, I will have Eason to introduce you H2 and interim financials, please.\nEason Zhang: Thank you. Thanks, Jack. Welcome, everyone, to the meeting. Coming next, please allow me to walk you through the financials. First of all, let's take a look at the revenue. In Q2, total revenue reached RMB 4.97 billion, up by 23%, exceeding the upper limit of our guidance, 18% to 21% previously. Breaking down by brand, MINISO brand Q2 revenue was RMB 4.56 billion, grew by 20%, among which MINISO mainland China revenue was RMB 2.62 billion, up by 14%, accelerated compared with last quarter, exceeding the low double-digit growth as we provided as guidance before. MINISO overseas revenue was RMB 1.94 billion, up by 29%, in line with our expectation.\nPOP TOY brand Q2 revenue was RMB 400 million, grew by 87%, continued high-speed growth momentum, exceeding our previous guidance of 70% to 80% growth. Looking at H1 of 2025, the total revenue of the group reached RMB 9.39 billion, up by 21%. As we urge into H2, we're confident that revenue growth will be further accelerated, progressing towards the guidance we provided to the market by the beginning of this year. From the regional breakdown, China mainland revenue accounted for 62% of the total and 65% in last year. Overseas revenue accounted for 38% and 35% last year with an increase of 3%.\nWell, regarding the same-store performance, building on Q1 2025 significant narrow down same-store decline in Q2, the same-store performance improved significantly because last year, we do have Chihuahua (sic) [ Chiikawa ] explosive sales as a high baseline. But even so, we still reached a positive same-store quarterly growth in Q2. In H1 of 2025, same-store sales declined in a low-digit number -- low single-digit number, representing tremendous improvement compared with H2 of 2024. This benefited from our channel upgrades, product mix optimization, new product launch and operational improvement. Getting into Q3 and MINISO mainland China same-store performance further accelerated compared with Q2.\nThe year-to-date monthly MINISO same-store growth has already turned positive looking into H2, and we're going to assure you there will be a positive growth here. MINISO has been able to achieve positive same-store sales in China, such a competitive of a market, which again proves our strong resilience of the business model and our organizational strong execution capacity, vitalities and lending capacity, we have systematically compiled some of the same-store growth experience and started to export them to overseas market in Q2, combining local market condition to help the overseas market to fully understand the strategies and experience for same-store improvement strategy in China.\nAnd you can also see that for Q2, overseas MINISO same-store performance has already improved from a mid- to high-single-digit decline in the previous quarter to a low-single-digit decline in Q2. European market same-store and the North America market same-store achieved a single -- mid-single-digit growth, which also strengthened our confidence for the overseas business growth. In terms of the store growth, in Q2, we have already achieved a net addition of 30 stores, which is more optimistic than our expectation. Internally, we see brand updates channel first. Our channel upgrade could be traced back to 2023, Q3 when we first opened our first large store in Beijing Road in Guangzhou.\nStarting from then, we discussed how can large store strategy to help to improve the product assortment, improve efficiency and store models. The landmark event was opening of the MINISO LAND in Shanghai Nanjing East Road in Q3 of 2024. And now we're actually reaching the peak after the MINISO SPACE at Nanjing Deji Plaza in Q2 of this year. To date, we are pleased to share that large store now accounted for 5% of our total domestic China -- mainland China MINISO store count, contributing to a mid-double-digit growth percentage growth. And for example, all 30 stores we added in Q2 were all MINISO LAND and flagship stores.\nMore importantly, we now have initially formed a channel metrics covering 7 layers of the stores. We were not going to rely on small store to conquer the market. We're going to have MINISO LAND, flagship stores, regular stores, pop-up stores to create incremental opportunities. For full year 2025, MINISO mainland China store count will continue to see healthy growth. We believe the net addition would be 100 to 150. The structure would be flagship stores and MINISO LAND. We also have some regular stores, but we will still go to the lower-tier markets.\nWell for MINISO as a single brand in China market, we're going to achieve expectedly more than RMB 60 billion sales for this year, already positioned us as a large consumer brand. However, in 2025, we hope we can achieve a mid- and double-digit scale growth for the full year without significantly increasing net store count. Behind this is our comparable same-store sales achieving healthy positive growth and our new store being very high quality. In overseas market, there are 94 new additions in Q2. The store continue to expand. As of H1, overseas store count grew by 189. And for the full year, we plan to add over 500 stores as new adds for the full year.\nHowever, we're going to be quite cautious. We expected around 40% of the overseas new stores would be directly upgraded, but we revised this number to be 35% now. In other words, we'll have a more reasonable CapEx. And the team will have more energies to focus on the operational optimization of the existing stores going all out for the H2 performance peak. Let's also talk about GP margin. Q2 increased 0.4 percentage compared with last year, reaching 44.3%. H1 of 2025, GP margin was 44.3% up by 0.6 percentage compared with 2024.\nIn addition to the GP margin improvement for the increased contribution from overseas revenue, as mentioned earlier, the effective implementation of our IP strategy also enabled our overseas business GP margin improvement. TOP TOY brands product structure optimization also enhanced TOP TOY brands GP margin. Looking to the future, GP margin may fluctuate due to category structure changes between quarters and business seasonalities, but still, the rising contribution from the overseas revenue and increasing IP sales contribution will still seem to be upward. We're going to be quite cautious in handling GP margins.\nAs you may know, with our brand operating IP strategy and the realization, our GP margin has increased from 27% to 44% now -- has been reminded to many of you in the previous earnings calls, we're going to pay much attention of balancing product volume and price. Going forward, we will be more firmly to our consistent value for money position on non-IP product lines. Starting from the beginning of this year, we have already made GP margin adjustment to some of the categories, both in China and overseas market, achieving better sales performance, improving our GP margin. We're -- as we stabilize in the GP margin, we will make such an adjustment in the near future.\nRegarding expenses in Q2, total expenses increased by 38%. Selling expense grew by 43%. administrative expense grew by 19%. Selling expense accounted for 23%, 3 percentage higher than the same period of last year. The Y-o-Y growth is related to our investment in directly operated stores. For example, like the labor cost, lease-related costs, depreciation and amortization grew 56.3%, seeing significant de-acceleration from the previous quarter, 71.4%. This benefited from our refined operation and strict expense management. In Q2, directly operated store revenue grew by 78.7%, still higher than the Y-o-Y growth rate of the direct operated store-related expenses.\nAdministrative expenses growth was slightly slower than the revenue growth, which was mainly attributable to the increased employee cost, which related to our business deployment. As I mentioned, our existing investment for directly operated stores is to have more sales opportunity to ensure our success of the future business, especially in strategic overseas market like U.S. We believe our upfront investment in directly operated stores would be released the sales potential still in H2 of this year. And the profit optimization will continue to be made. And for our YH investment going to have impact on our financial statement starting from this quarter. And we're going to take the equity method for settlement.\nAnd the YH is going to impact our net profit by RMB 119 million, which will be excluded from the non-IFRS financial indicators. Majority of that are going to come from our 29.4% of the shareholding. In addition, there will be some optimizations. And the amortization is going to be around RMB 5 billion every quarter. Well, regarding profitability, the adjusted operating margin was 17.2%, up by 0.6 percentage points from Q1, down by 2.3% on Y-o-Y basis. The decline was narrowed compared to Q1. The trend quite be positive. Let me just break down the reason by business segment and why I'm so confident for the margin improvement. Let's take a look at MINISO brand first.\nOur mainland China franchise business being quite stable in margin. And in China, we also have the warehouse store and e-commerce store. The margin was lower than the franchise business model, but the impact is controllable. The decline in overseas operating margin was due to structural changes in revenue. We have more contribution from directly operated stores. We expect the margin to improve after entry into H2 of this year. We believe the profitability of our overseas directly operated store can be improved further. We will improve operational margin by enhanced efficiency, refined operation and maintain high growth. Let's also talk about TOP TOY. A significant GP margin improvement was seen in this quarter.\nWe made some upfront investment for example, like product R&D, overseas expansion and IT, which is actually a healthy operational investment. In mid- and long term, a 20% operating margin would be considered a comfortable target. But as we grow, we need to allow new business sufficient time and space to grow. The Q2 adjusted net profit was RMB 690 million, but adjusted net margin was 13.9%. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 14.7%, but adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.1%. In terms of the working capital, channel inventory turnover remained steady and efficient. As of June 30, our inventory turnover days was 93 days, used to be 102 days for the previous quarter.\nBreaking down by brand and region, MINISO overseas and TOP TOY remained stable quarter-by-quarter. And the mainland China MINISO see significant shortening of inventory turnover days. On the procurement side, we actually structured SKU management, strengthen category standardization, implemented dynamic inventory monitoring. On the inventory management side, we established full chain product life cycle labeling system, having the seasonal marketing to implement differentiated promotional strategies, which can also lay a solid foundation in improving our cash flow and also releasing working capital efficiency. As H1 of this year, our cash reserve stood at RMB 7.47 billion, remained robust. Our net cash flow from operating activities was RMB 1.01 billion, including RMB 260 million in Q1, RMB 750 million in Q2.\nOur business cash flow showed very significant improvement on M-o-M and Q-on-Q trends, benefiting from our working capital efficiency improvement. Our capital allocation strategy is going to still be balanced. Today, we announced the 2025 interim dividend for about RMB 640 million, accounted for 50% of our adjusted net profit, which will be paid after September. We believe under the existing market condition, our share price is significantly lower than its intrinsic value.\nWe repurchased a share of more than RMB 340 million in H1 of this year, representing 1% of outstanding shares, which means the repurchase amount in H1 of this year already exceeds the total repurchasement of the entire last year, the highest purchase amount in any half year today or the repurchase share would be canceled. In H1 of this year, returns to the shareholders through share repurchase and dividends has already been RMB 1.07 billion, accounted for 84% of adjusted net profit. That number used to be 55% last year.\nThe Board has also agreed to plan to utilize authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting held in June of this year to repurchase up to 10% of the total outstanding shares. We will continue the repurchasement in the open market through Hong Kong repurchase plan and rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan in the near future. We believe repurchasement in the best interest of the company and the shareholders and also show our confidence for our future business development. As we urge into Q3, we remain optimistic about the continued acceleration. The revenue growth would be 25% to 28%, significantly higher than H1. Same-store sales going to have a low single-digit growth. But adjusted operating profit will have a double-digit growth.\nAdjusted operating margin continue to improve and the decline expected to continue to narrow. Looking to 2025, our full year revenue growth will be no more than 25% -- no less than 25% with quarterly growth accelerated, where at the same time, we expect in 2025, adjusted operating net profit would be RMB 3.65 billion to RMB 3.85 billion, used to be RMB 3.4 billion same period of last year. Adjusted operating margin would be improved on Q-on-Q. Thank you. Let's conclude our presentation. We are happy to take your questions now.\nOperator: The first question comes from Goldman Sachs, please.\nMichelle Cheng: Congratulations on the company for the performance exceed expectation. I have a question regarding the U.S. business. In Q2, I see sales go beyond expectation and the fees control has been quite managed well. You also mentioned about the large store and product adjustment. Is it possible for Jack to -- you to share with us? For your new team in U.S. market, what are those things we do right to have such good growth? What would be the key strategies in H2 in the U.S. market, especially for the profit margin, no matter for H2 or for the full year, what would be the profit for the self-operated -- directly operated stores in the U.S.?\nMy second question is regarding the opening of new stores. What about the net store addition for U.S. And we really would like to hear more from you, Jack and Eason, regarding the U.S. business.\nGuofu Ye: For U.S. business improvement, it may come from the following factors. First of all, we continue to improve the quality of the stores, only open large stores and leveraging our multi-category advantage. Secondly, we're going to have a centralized store opening. Around 2 weeks ago, in Austin, Texas, we opened 3 stores together, which actually released the brand perception. So first of all, we opened large stores. And secondly, we will be concentrated in one region to open more stores rather than have fragmented store openings as what we did past. Thirdly, we're also working on the trendy toys, for example, for Sanrio and Disney.\nAnd in the past, we also have the blind box and the figures, which are also showing great momentum of the growth. And fourthly, we also have the localized team for MINISO, our U.S. CEO is a localized figure with more than 20 years working experience in retail market. We started to become our U.S. CEO starting from last year. So large store, concentrated new store opening and product power improvement and localized team would be the 4 key pillar to help us to improve our U.S. operations. Looking into H2 of this year, our key is to continue to build our same-store improvement. We now have enough store account.\nWe have to make sure the store performance or each store performance need to be improved. But still, we need to have the right product, especially for 20 toys. We opened the large stores. Each store covers 600 to 800 square meters. We use 100 of that square meters to become the trendy store dedicated area in order to continue to engage the young people to come to our stores and making sure our stores become more appealing in the local market. Our second strategy is the holiday strategy, especially during the weekend and holidays, we make sure we have the right and comprehensive product and operations.\nThirdly, we need to have the refined operation and also right scheduling of the logistics. We actually identified the localized team and very professional. They are good at refined operation. So those are the 3 strategies we have in the U.S. We believe in the next 6 months, we're going to continue with those strategies. In H2, I have to mention to all of you, the trendy toy has been growing very fast in U.S. We have every confidence that in the near future, we're going to have the new sales target, especially coming from the [indiscernible] and the plush product.\nFor U.S., the net addition we have for this year would be 80, 8-0, much lower than what we have last year, but we hope we can continue to improve the quality and efficiency of the larger stores. Some of the new store efficiency is much higher than the existing stores. So that's the reason. The upper limit of the new store has been further elevated, where for new store opening strategies, we'd like to have concentrated all the regional stores. For example, in Texas, we have 3 stores being opened at the same time then to help to polish our brand perception. It's also good for marketing.\nAnd all of a sudden, it can make sure the brand have explosive exposure in one region. In one region, no matter which plaza you go for, you see the MINISO large stores with good store performance. Regarding the U.S. market, I will ask Eason to walk you through the same-store performance.\nEason Zhang: Thank you. Thanks, Michelle. As I have already shared with all of you last in Q1, we see a high baseline. In Q1 of last year, the same-store growth was 30%. In Q1 of this year, the high baseline pressured our Q1 performance of 2025. But after getting into Q2 or especially Q3, we see same-store improvement has already been accelerated. In Q2, in U.S., the same-store performance has already a positive number. It's already a mid- to high single-digit growth. In Q3, it's continued to be accelerated with the profit margin in H1 of this year, profit margin of the same-store remained flat compared with last year.\nStarting from July of this year, with our team's concerted efforts, operating profit of the store has already been significantly improved. So we can foresee -- we have every confidence to continue to improve the profit rate of the U.S. stores.\nOperator: Next question. Let's welcome Anne Ling from Jefferies, please.\nKin Shun Ling: My first question that is regarding mainland China business. Same-store performance in mainland China has already been improved. I would like to know what would be the driver for the same-store performance improvement in mainland China? Is it because of the volume? Or is it because of the APS? And my second question, I do notice MINISO also have some O2O. For example, in taobao.com, I also see your stores. So for your same-store performance improvement, is it because it's benefited from the e-commerce platform promotionals? Is it because you actually launched more activations on O2O channel? This is my first question. My second question regarding the overseas business.\nIs it possible for the management team to help me to break down the sales contribution from each region? For example, U.S., Europe and Asia, what about the sales contribution to the total sales? Then what would be our future growth strategy? As the company has already mentioned about U.S., we are also quite interested to know other parts of the overseas market. My third question is regarding TOP TOY. I really would like to know your overseas TOP TOY growth. How many overseas stores do we have? What would be our strategy there? Because TOP TOY is also for trendy toys.\nIf the overseas market MINISO and TOP TOY, the 2 brands, how we're going to differentiate the 2 in the overseas market?\nEason Zhang: Thanks, Anne. I'm Eason. I will ask Jack to help to respond to the first question on the same-store improvement for domestic China or mainland China stores.\nGuofu Ye: Okay. Thank you. Please allow me to share with you. For mainland China same-store performance improvement, I think we do have a very special initiative. We have an initiative called the Chief Growth Officer that has been responsible for the store performance growth. We actually have the product center to take the lead, leveraging this special task force to well-connect product, operations, digital center and also our stores and product have seamless operations to improve our operation. And secondly, we also improved the product as product and commercial and operation has been well connected. Our execution efficiency has been further improved. Now we have a special taskforce in charge of that. It's already go beyond the departments.\nSo the popular products could be shipped to the store as quickly as possible. Secondly, we do have the popular hits dedicated area. For some of our stores, they will also be optimized from small to large by improving the GFA with more products on the shelf, and we will also be able to have a popular hits area. My third point, we actually leverage the traffic advantage in festival seasons. We find out the traffic during the holidays has been particularly high, especially for family trips. The mom and the kids can all purchase what they like within MINISO. This is indeed the thing we did. So first of all, we have a well-connected mechanism for product and operation.\nAnd also, we continue to optimize our product. That's the reason we will be able to improve our mainland China same-store performance in H1 of this year.\nEason Zhang: Okay. I'm Eason. Please allow me to respond to the same-store improvement. Is it coming from ASP or traffic? In Q2 of this year, the mainland China, the same-store growth was a single-digit number. First of all, ASPs be the key. If you take a look at H2 or Q4 of last year, why same-store performance has been declining? The reason is because of the traffic. This is also many of the retailers being challenged now. The same-store performance has been pressured because of the traffic shortage. Last year, we do see the traffic shortage. But for this year, we don't see that too much.\nSo in H1 of this year, it seems many people believe the same-store performance improvement are coming from APS. It seems that still the traffic has been declining, but actually compared with H2 of last year, the traffic decline has already been narrowed or improved. So I surely believe our conversion rate has been gaining momentum for improvement. Another point I have to talk about is the impact from O2O to same-store performance. In mainland China, for our regular store, we have O2O for a few years. Compared with last year, O2O is not having incremental contribution to the same-store performance improvement. Still, the key reason is because we have a robust offline performance.\nRegarding sales contribution from each region, let me just share with you our terminal GMV. Overseas GMV, Asia country, excluding China, accounted for 1\/3. Latin American countries, another 1\/3. Europe plus North America together accounted for another 1\/3, where for other regions and countries, be a single-digit contribution of the total GMV. Your third question is regarding how TOP TOY be differentiated from MINISO on positioning in overseas market. Jack, would you mind to answer the question?\nGuofu Ye: Yes. I think TOP TOY is a professional trendy toy brand. Its pricing is targeting the primer market, where for MINISO, we are actually covering both lifestyle product, but also the trendy product. So TOP TOY is actually a professional store for trendy toys, where within MINISO, it's all-in-one store, but also have the trendy store corners. So for MINISO, we actually have a dedicated area for the trendy toys, where for TOP TOY, it has a food store for the trendy toys. For the MINISO, the price is more user-friendly. And also the strategy and positioning for TOP TOY and MINISO differs a lot.\nKin Shun Ling: For overseas market, are you still going to have a net addition of 100?\nGuofu Ye: No, I was talking about the total number of TOP TOY in overseas market. It's still going to be more than 100. Where for TOP TOY, the account is going to be 70% to 80% growth for this year. But for this year, we're going to seek for high-quality growth. The store number net growth would be 50 to 60, but still the performance growth would be 70% to 80%.\nOperator: Next, please. Samuel Wang from UBS, please.\nSamuel Wang: I'm Samuel from UBS. I have one question. My question is regarding the proprietary IP or collaborative IP with artists. I'd like to ask you for the artist IP or [ Yu Chan's ] sales. What about the [ Yu Chan's ] sales to the overall contribution of the artist IP-related sales? What will be your overall target? How it's going to contribute to your total sales? For artists IP, you probably need to have a new business model as IP operation. So for that, is there any plan or strategies that the company can share with us? This is my first question regarding artists IP. My second question if possible, and the management team to share with you.\nIn the past, we're working with global large IP, but now we do artist IP. Why do we have such a shift? My second question is also targeting the overseas markets. I have already clearly noticed in U.S. market in Q2, same-store performance turned positive, where for other overseas market, same-store performance are still a bit pressured. For overseas market, what are those markets go beyond expectation? What are those lower than expectation? For those markets being pressured, what would be the forthcoming measures?\nGuofu Ye: Thank you. I'm Jack. Let me just share with you artist IP strategy. Yes, indeed, it's a strategic move. In the past, what MINISO do is only in the global IP licensing. But starting from now, or starting from 6 months ago, we have already started our new strategy. Now I can officially announce the dual drive strategy. On one side, we have international IP. But at the same time, we're also going to develop our own proprietary IP. Yesterday, I see the release from POP MART, which makes me quite excited. On one side, I see the consumer buying, the consumer actually buying the trendy toys. And secondly, I see the capital market also buying in the trendy toys.\nWe can see trendy toys is in the infancy stage in China. The market is expanding now. MINISO has a great growth momentum here as we build our proprietary IP and [ Yuyu Chan ], our first proprietary IP has been quite successful and it's already short of supply now and the production cannot catch up with the demand. Proprietary IP would be our key strategy. Why we can do IP right? In the past, we didn't notice how important it is. But now we started to understand the value of the proprietary IP. And MINISO has every opportunity to do proprietary IP right.\nIn the past, when we were working with global IPs, we indeed enjoy great advantage for product development, marketing and the channel, but we are indeed back of the proprietary IP. But as long as we started to take actions on proprietary IP, I believe the future would be full of promise. We now contracted 9 artist IPs. [ Yu Chan ] is actually our first one. And I truly believe for this year, Yu and going to actually make a very good sales. And the next year is going to -- the sales is going to be RMB 100 million for Yu. I can surely inform the market.\nWe have already understand the grid methodology for the proprietary IP operations. Even for TOP TOY and we actually acquired IP for [indiscernible], it's great was RMB 100 million. Now for this year, it can reach RMB 250 million and likely to be RMB 600 million next year. So no matter for TOP TOY or MINISO, we are continuing expanding our proprietary IP. For example, we contracted the artist IP like Yu, and we also acquired [indiscernible] IP. Those 2 IPs surprised us with beyond expected outcome. We're going to engage more new IPs.\nWhen Chinese GDP capital is more than USD 10,000, I think the rise of the great nation rest with the rise of the culture, especially the IP. I think the IP culture in China is just at the start. It has a great prospective. It's going to generate a GMV of more than RMB 300 million, RMB 400 million in China and our RMB 30 million overseas shipment, while at the same time, our proprietary IP also going to have further shipment to overseas market. We never mentioned this before, but let me tell you, proprietary IP is something we explore and continue to grow. I can surely share with all of you.\nWe have been quite successful in being the proprietary IP business model where what would be the advantage of MINISO in building proprietary IPs because for MINISO Group, it's more like having another growth driver or another way that can help us to be truly differentiated, having very nice growth and replicable experience. We're going to continue to engage artist IPs. The cost is not high. It's not a high spending, where for some of the artists, we will be able to help them to run their business and grow their business as a whole. Now in China, only us and another 2 to 3 competitors may be capable of doing so.\nFor example, like MINISO and TOP TOY that are all under our umbrellas, where for short-term performance contribution and the profit, we rather would like to improve the quality of the IP and IP value. We have every confidence in proprietary IP. I hope you can keep an eye on MINISO for our proprietary IP strategy. Thank you.\nEason Zhang: Thanks for Jack. You feel quite passionate when talk about proprietary IPs. This is indeed one of your most like topic recently. You can see it still show great mission and vision as a great entrepreneur. And we also would like to welcome you to join us for the Hong Kong offline roadshows. Jack will share with you more on the proprietary IP and IP strategy. Samuel, you also raised another question. What are those overseas market go beyond expectation? What are those on lower than expectation? Let me talk about it in this way. We have our business in more than 100 countries and regions worldwide.\nFor some of the market, they may have the ForEx, local retail, macroeconomic impact or even some of our customers may have some hurdles locally. Sometimes the performs good, sometimes not. In H1 of this year, in U.S., in Canada or in Australia, we do notice a very nice growth, especially in Canada. You see we have localized team in U.S. And in Canada, we also have a seasoned local retail expert to lead our localized team. When our Canada leader took the office, the sales result was looking quite well. The sales growth was a triple-digit number or even grow by more than 100%.\nWhere for Australia, in our prepared remarks, we have already mentioned our flag -- pop-up stores with the new large stores being opened in Australia. But what are those markets who may grow that's our expectation. There are a few I can share with you. The first one is Latin American market. The revenue was declining in H1 of this year, but actually, the GMV on the retail was growing due to a few reasons. First of all, Latin American market, the local customer is someone we worked long term with greater trust and who is adjusting inventories in H1 of this year, which has been completed now.\nAnd secondly, for Mexico market, the local currency fluctuates a lot for the past 12 months. The adjusting using USD to purchase our product. So ForEx is one thing that impacts the Mexico business. But you can see that for Mexico or even for Latin American countries, the performance was quite steady for the past few years. There are some small markets, not a big contributor of our business. The performance is go beyond our expectation. For example, Chinese Hong Kong, many of the traffic go directly to mainland China market. The leasing fees for the retail industry has been quite high, but the Hong Kong business accounted for a very small part of our total business.\nSo overall speaking, from H1 of this year from Q1 to Q2, the market was going up. In Q3, we see the trend being further accelerated.\nOperator: Next question, let's welcome [indiscernible] from Huatai Securities, please.\nJunhao Fan: I have 2 questions. First question, tariff impact, which has been started in Q2, and you also made some proactive adjustment for U.S. business, where you actually -- or your supply chain plans for the tariff measures, is there any updates whether the price adjustment to tariff impact your sales? We'd like to hear more details. My second question for the mainland China business in higher-tier cities, you have the IP strategy, where for lower-tier cities, you have the money for value strategy. What about its performance now? What will be the same-store performance in higher-tier and lower-tier cities? Any difference?\nGuofu Ye: Thank you. Let me have to respond to your second question first regarding the same-store performance in higher and lower cities. Overall speaking, in H1 of this year or starting from beginning to now, the same-store performance in higher-tier cities outperformed the lower-tier cities. You were talking about the tariff impact. Starting from April this year, U.S. tariff is always something that the market has been concerned about. Let me give you the result first. Tariff didn't impact our margin for U.S. business. In order to take care of the tariff, we make the following acts. First of all, starting from 2024, right before political situation changes in U.S., we already have some strategic inventories in U.S.\nSecondly, we leverage our integrated supply chain management in U.S. We have already deployed the direct sourcing in U.S. We do have many direct sourcing in the U.S. On one side, it can help to be the countermeasure of the tariff impact. and also help us to have the localized product R&D and also sourcing to take care of the local consumer needs. Thirdly, we also make some tax plan for the tariff. So here now, you can see all those measures are working very well. Our margin are not impacted by tariff at all.\nJunhao Fan: Very comprehensive introduction. Congratulations on the company's ever improved performance.\nOperator: Next question, [indiscernible] from Yangtze River Securities.\nUnknown Analyst: My name is [indiscernible]. I have 2 questions. The first question that is the self-operated business and also the distributor business in the overseas market, what would be the growth for both? And second question, recently, we noticed the company has been taking many actions regarding IP. So I'd like to ask you for MINISO LAND, what about the growth now? And how it's going to drive the offline sales in mainland China? And secondly, what would be the future IP development regarding the business cadence?\nGuofu Ye: Sorry, due to the Internet connection rate, can you repeat your second question? Let me help to respond to the first question. For the overseas direct sales and the distributor business model in Q2, overseas market growth was 29%. The direct sales is higher than distributor model growth. And actually, we have a division of the BU. On has been called direct sales. Another one has been called as agency business or the direct business. But later, we find out both business are working complementary. Even in the direct sales business, we have the franchise stores or even in the distribution model, we have some self-directed stores.\nSo the division won't be able to truly tell the growth of our overseas business. So that's the reason internally, actually, we sell -- we keep less attention to such division. But generally speaking, the direct sales growth rate is higher than the distribution model.\nUnknown Analyst: The second question is regarding proprietary IP. What would be the cadence of the proprietary IP? And then what about MINISO LAND?\nGuofu Ye: Thank you. Proprietary IP is a key driver for us. In the past, we only have one thing to count. That is the global IP licensing. But now we take the parallel tasks. Proprietary IP and global IP are all quite important for the company. We're going to continue to develop proprietary IP and continue to unleash its value potential and resources. The second question you were talk about is MINISO LAND. It's actually a success really surprised us, go beyond our expectation. For our Shanghai Nanjing East Road store within 9 months, the sales is already more than RMB 100 million. And recently, we also have a few MINISO LAND stores proved to be quite successful recently.\nSo what are those benefits for MINISO LAND bring to us? We will be able to engage a large number of the trended toys artists to contract with us, to work with us. I mean the cooperation is also in-depth cooperation for MINISO LAND. The fundamental logic is IP cooperation. And actually, for MINISO LAND, IP-related contribution are more than 80% or even 90%. For example, for Turkey, 30 shopping mall, we are the only one to provide the blind box and trendy toys. But why we can work with 30 shopping mall is because they believe we are the international brand. We have international IP.\nAs we move into the luxury shopping malls, we're not only going to do international IP, but also the domestic territory IP. Artists can work with us for proprietary IP and continue to improve their exposure. This can also help to further collect and also engage more IP artist resources. MINISO LAND and also the MINISO fans and space, those are the 3 product lines. We're going to really engage in making the IP business right and comprehensive, where for those proprietary IP artists, we're going to create them a good and open platform for cooperation. I believe it will become a very solid foundation for us to develop our proprietary IP business.\nSo for MINISO Land, we're not only going to have it in China, but also in overseas markets.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Thanks for all the participants. Here comes to the end of today's call. See you next quarter. Thank you.\nTrump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush\nThe Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech.

Oracle, a software company that had long struggled to find its niche in this market, gained a foothold through scoring major customers. Today, it’s helping power Elon Musk’s xAI from a data center in Utah, assembling a cluster of tens of thousands of AI chips for Nvidia Corp. near Singapore and recently inked what is likely the largest single cloud deal ever with OpenAI, the leading artificial intelligence company.\nOracle is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars to develop unprecedentedly large data centers amid energy and material shortages. That includes a plan to spend more than $1 billion a year just to power one new megasite in West Texas with gas generators rather than wait for utility connection, according to people familiar with the plans.\nWith all of this spending, Oracle recorded a negative annual cash flow for the first time since 1990. And questions remain about the longevity and margins of offering infrastructure to train AI models.\nOracle, founded in the 1970s, had long faded from tech prominence. On the road to its return in the AI era were internal battles to convince Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz to invest in the cloud, recruitment of key customers like TikTok and the rise of a brash executive named Clay Magouyrk. Bloomberg spoke with more than 30 current or former employees and customers to understand how Oracle can deliver on its towering promises. They detailed spiraling costs, accelerated timelines to satisfy OpenAI, regulatory roadblocks and the hiring of hundreds of former Amazon cloud staffers, speaking anonymously to discuss the inner workings of a famously private and litigious company. Oracle declined to comment.\nBuilding a Cloud\nAs cloud computing picked up steam in the late 2000s, Ellison had little reason to be excited. Oracle’s namesake database, which is purchased outright and installed directly on customer servers, is one of the world’s great cash businesses. Adopting a cloud sales model, where users rent access to software, would almost certainly come with lower profits and a need to collaborate with rivals.\nAfter years of writing off the cloud as marketing, Oracle’s tone changed as its business came under fire. Amazon.com Inc. pushed cheaper database options on its cloud customers. Application rivals like Salesforce Inc. promised easier installation and updates. Ellison saw the need to get Oracle’s Fusion apps — commonly used for finance and resource planning — on the cloud, according to people familiar with his thinking at the time.\nThere were competing efforts through the 2010s within Oracle to build a cloud for internal and customer use. An initial attempt, led by Thomas Kurian and launched in 2012, saw limited success.\nA separate group, made up largely of Amazon alumni led by Don Johnson, pushed an approach called bare metal, in which clients wouldn’t have to share their servers with other renters, allowing Oracle to target privacy-focused users. The group also focused on building smaller data centers, which let them expand in countries that weren’t yet viable for industry leaders.\nThe bare metal approach won the blessing of Ellison, who remains a key decisionmaker despite handing off the CEO title more than a decade ago. The new product came to be known as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, or OCI. Kurian departed the company in 2018 after his approach was sidelined. He then joined Google to lead its competing cloud service and remains in that position.\nWhen offering the new product, Oracle had to overcome a long-held reputation for aggressive sales strategies. Major pitches for OCI include cheaper pricing thanks to a simplified set of products and good integration with other clouds. Oracle salespeople often take jabs at Amazon Web Services’ sprawling set of tools, telling customers that paying for Amazon’s cloud means subsidizing expensive moonshots like its satellite project, Kuiper.\nAn Amazon spokesperson said that “more customers continue to choose AWS than any other cloud provider because we deliver unmatched choice, pace of innovation, security, and reliability.”\nBreakthrough Customers\nIn the pandemic era, a handful of transformative customers joined Oracle’s platform. Zoom Communications Inc., struggling to handle a massive spike in demand during lockdowns, selected Oracle Cloud to help handle traffic from consumers. The company secured a nearly $2 billion commitment from Uber Technologies Inc. in 2023.\nBy far the biggest win in this period was TikTok. The ByteDance Ltd.-owned social media company needed to expand its US infrastructure while under scrutiny from lawmakers over its links to China. Oracle, a company versed in national security whose chairman and CEO were supporters of the Republicans then in power, seemed a natural choice.\n“OCI is like before and after TikTok,” said Tony Grayson, a former Oracle executive who led the company’s data center build-out around the time. The new customer forced the company to think on a scale it never had before, Grayson said. In 2022, TikTok announced that all US user traffic would flow through Oracle servers.\nAnnual revenue from the new customer rapidly passed $1 billion and, for a period, TikTok’s business was larger than the entire rest of OCI combined, according to people familiar with the figures. Oracle also built experience in AI infrastructure, running thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units — chips used for AI work — for TikTok even before the ChatGPT craze.\nManagement by Ridicule\nWithin Oracle, there was long disagreement about the purpose of OCI. Some leaders saw it as a way to shield the database business and modernize applications. Others sought to compete with Amazon and Microsoft Corp. for general cloud work and grab a piece of a market worth hundreds of billions each year.\nIt wasn’t easy to convince CEO Catz of the expansive vision. She expressed skepticism due to high costs of operating data centers and lower margins of the business, people familiar with her thinking said. This cost consciousness fueled OCI’s initial focus on small data centers. But she and other traditional company leaders became convinced as massive deals such as TikTok, and later OpenAI, materialized.\nInternal accolades have flowed to Magouyrk, the division’s leader. The 39-year-old has rapidly climbed company ranks and reports directly to Ellison. He was one of OCI’s first employees after a stint at Amazon and recently relocated to Nashville, where Oracle has pledged to move its headquarters. In June, he was promoted to president, and is seen by company leaders as a potential successor to his 81-year-old boss.\n“Sometimes you look back and say — I’m not sure that I was entirely qualified at each step of the way,” Magouyrk said on the podcast in July 2023. “But it seems to have worked out so far.”\nThose who have worked with him describe Magouyrk as highly effective and conflict prone. He once told an executive that his actions were “f---king stupid,” in a room full of leadership, according to allegations in a 2021 lawsuit that claimed a toxic work culture at OCI. Blunt bosses are typical in a company run by Ellison, who once described his leadership style as “management by ridicule.”\nIn the early days of OCI, the division was known as “Sparta.” It could pay its workers more than other parts of Oracle, was based out of Seattle rather than the Bay Area, and adopted the AWS practice of constantly shedding lower performers.\nOCI’s importance has grown as the cloud has become a bigger part of the company’s business. Today, about 23,000 employees report up through Magouyrk. Over the last two years, more than 600 workers have joined from Amazon, according to an analysis by Workforce.ai. Amazon’s recent five-days-a-week return-to-office rule has made the poaching easier, as OCI remains largely a hybrid or remote workplace, people at the company say.\nUnprecedented Scale\nToday, AI is the biggest driver of OCI’s growth. The majority of Oracle’s backlog, or booked deals, are tied to customers training or deploying AI models with GPU-based servers, according to a person familiar with the figures.\nOpenAI is slated to become Oracle largest customer and has marketed the work as “Stargate,” an effort first announced in January at the White House alongside President Donald Trump. The companies have struck deals for more than 5 gigawatts of computing power, an unprecedented sum and enough energy for millions of American homes.\nWork for OpenAI is happening on an aggressive timeline. The data centers are targeted for completion by early 2027, with many servers running as soon as next summer, according to people familiar with the plans. Facilities are being designed for training AI models with the assumption that they could also to power the applications of those trained models, which is called inference.\nProviding infrastructure for AI training is generally thought to be a lower margin business than inference because it requires more advanced semiconductors and cooling. Exact timing and design details for the OpenAI work could still change, the people said.\nFinding data center developers and power providers to support this project at palatable prices has been a challenge, people involved with the development said. Costs for many goods and services have gone up over the last year owing to tariffs and vendors capitalizing on intense demand. Plus, it can take years to get approval and infrastructure to draw the scale of electricity needed from local grids.\nThe site Oracle plans to power entirely with gas generation is located in Shackleford County, Texas, near another Oracle server farm in Abilene. It is being developed by Vantage Data Centers, partly owned by DigitalBridge Group Inc. and Silver Lake, and will have a compute capacity of 1.4 gigawatts, making it among the largest known sites.\nPart of OCI’s popularity with AI firms is its long-standing focus on bare metal servers. This has become the standard arrangement for AI work, and Oracle was first among major vendors to offer it. Users and employees also point to Oracle’s networking quality and willingness to do high levels of customized work.\nSemianalysis, a popular industry analyst, listed Oracle Cloud near the top of its rankings for AI infrastructure vendors in March, citing its cost-effectiveness, networking quality and strong customer service.\n“They’re aggressive on price, which definitely helps,” said David Talby, CEO John Snow Labs, which trains and deploys AI models in health care. His company picked OCI in part because the offering had high performance and was well optimized for use with Nvidia AI chips.\nAnother of Oracle’s largest AI customers is Nvidia, which uses OCI for internal development and to power its own cloud infrastructure service. The chipmaker, codenamed “pathfinder” internally, rents capacity from an Oracle cluster of H100 chips in Japan and from a data center being built on Indonesia’s Batam Island. Oracle is also in talks with Meta Platforms Inc. and Musk’s xAI for further capacity, according to a person familiar with the plans.\nOracle’s cloud business is still orders of magnitude smaller than Amazon, Microsoft and the No. 3 provider, Alphabet Inc.’s Google. But plenty of room for growth exists. The market generated almost $100 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter and is expanding about 25% year over year, according to Synergy Research Group.\nThe big question is how Oracle will fund this development and what it does to the company’s profitability, said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Bernstein. Still, the company hasn’t had to borrow money to develop its centers like smaller rivals such as CoreWeave Inc.\n“We believe the margin will rebound and cash flow will be substantial once they get through this investment phase,” Moerdler said, comparing this moment to Microsoft’s cloud transition under Satya Nadella. “Oracle is going through a business model transformation that is even more impactful over a shorter period of time.”\n(Adds detail on Vantage Data Centers ownership in 30th paragraph.)","content_hash":"a73bd4d2d08573c22f927f3095e64b20","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":12343,"method_rank":0}

Traders are pricing in about 91.5% odds of a cut late Friday morning compared to 70% earlier in the day and 85% a week ago.\nLaura Bratton\nPowell opens door to September rate cut, says economic outlook 'may warrant' change in Fed's stance\nYahoo Finance's Myles Udland and Jennifer Schonberger report:\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell began speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday, where he is delivering what is expected to be his final speech at the annual gathering of central bankers, policymakers, and economists.\nInvestors will examine Powell's remarks for clues about the state of the economy and the potential for interest rate cuts next month. The central bank is grappling with whether to hold interest rates steady in September to counter inflation or lower rates in light of weaker labor market data.\nAdditionally, Powell is expected to describe changes to the central bank’s policy framework. The Fed is expected to drop its average inflation targeting policy, which sets an inflation rate goal for the Fed to achieve over the long run. It was put in place pre-pandemic, when inflation ran low and Fed officials wanted to avoid deflation.\nUS stocks rose at the open on Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech in Jackson Hole at 10 a.m. ET.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose around 0.6%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up about 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) inched up nearly 0.1% — with those gains coming after another downbeat day for stocks Thursday.\nThe US benchmark indexes are still on track for a weekly loss after tech stocks got beaten up by AI trade doubts.\nGrace O'Donnell\nNio stock rises after the Tesla rival unveils affordable SUV\nChinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NIO) revealed its new ES8 SUV on Thursday, sending US-listed shares of the Tesla (TSLA) rival 5% higher in premarket trading on Friday. The stock was the No. 1 trending ticker on Yahoo Finance on Friday morning.\nThe SUV is one of Nio's most affordable yet, with prices starting at 308,800 yuan (approximately $43,000) with a battery subscription plan. The plan allows customers to pay lower upfront costs for the vehicle and then upgrade batteries for a monthly fee.\nDeliveries are scheduled to begin in late September.\nGrace O'Donnell\nUS sectors in spotlight ahead of Fed's Jackson Hole gathering\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., today is expected to provide investors with a signal on whether an interest rate cut is coming next month, which could have wide-ranging implications for many parts of the economy.\nReuters broke down how some of the most rate-sensitive stocks have fared since the Fed kicked off its rate-cutting cycle in September 2024:\nIntuit Inc. (INTU) stock fell 6% before the bell on Friday after forecasting first-quarter revenue growth below analysts' estimates on Thursday.\nWorkday's (WDAY) stock dropped on Friday before the bell after the software company raised its full-year subscription revenue forecast on Thursday, but a forecast in line with expectations for the current quarter pushed the human resources software provider’s shares down.\nAMD (AMD) shares fell 1% in premarket trading following the news that Nvidia (NVDA) has told partners to halt work on H20 chip for China.\nGrace O'Donnell\nZoom stock jumps as Enterprise revenue accelerates\nShares of Zoom (ZM) jumped 5% in premarket trading on Friday after the communications software provider posted earnings that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year outlook.\nZoom CEO Eric Yuan highlighted artificial intelligence as a driver of its strong quarter, with its AI agents underpinning profit growth.\nThe company posted earnings per share of $1.16, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates for $0.72, per S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue rose 5% to $1.2 billion, bolstered by 7% growth in Enterprise revenue. The company's monthly churn rate remained flat year over year at 2.9%.\nDespite Friday's gain, the stock is still down 10% year to date, underperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 8% gain.","content_hash":"c7dfac8f11674c0ce426e64ed963e5a1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":12085,"method_rank":0}

His administration’s approach to semiconductors, steel, and trade has reimagined the federal government not merely as a regulator, but as a shareholder, royalty collector, and boardroom presence.\nInvestors, used to treating presidential policy as a macro backdrop, are now modeling presidential moves as direct inputs to cash flow — much the way they would with a hard-charging CEO. To some, Trump seems to be governing less like a president and more like the CEO of “America Inc.” — and markets are scrambling to price in the risk.\nSemiconductors have become the prime example. Nvidia and AMD don’t just live and die by product cycles anymore — they live and die by the president’s terms. They’re now dealing with the Oval Office like it’s a majority shareholder. The Commerce Department is rationing export licenses to China deal by deal. Product lines are subject to last-minute restrictions and whims. And earlier this year, the administration allowed the two companies to resume selling compliant artificial intelligence chips into China — but the permission wasn’t free. The “deal” came with a 15% revenue skim , a cut funneled directly back to Washington. The arrangement turned U.S. export controls into something more familiar to traders — a royalty stream, structured like a licensing agreement.\nIntel has become the bellwether for how far Washington is willing to push. Trump has demanded CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation , calling him “highly conflicted” over reported ties to Chinese tech firms — a move that sent Intel’s stock down about 3% that day. Shortly thereafter, the Trump administration opened talks to convert some of Intel’s CHIPS Act funding into a 10% non-voting equity stake . Lately, Intel’s stock has traded less on its product roadmap than on subsidy announcements, export restrictions, and speculation about Washington joining the shareholder register. For investors who are used to parsing earnings reports and supply chain forecasts, the adjustment has been stark: Intel could soon be a semi-public utility with the Treasury Department waiting in the wings.\nThe Trump administration’s steel governance deal follows the same pattern. To clear Nippon Steel’s acquisition of U.S. Steel, the administration negotiated a “golden share” that carries no dividends but comes with veto rights over key decisions and the ability to appoint a board member. In governance circles, that structure is more often associated with China or Russia, where state prerogatives are written into corporate bylaws — not Pittsburgh. But the White House has insisted the special share was the price of protecting national security — while still allowing foreign investment. Former Commerce and Treasury official Jim Secreto told Reuters that the golden share approach was “both risky and unprecedented.” Wall Street Journal columnist Greg Ip gave the model a shorthand: “state capitalism with American characteristics.”\nTrade diplomacy under Trump has been recast in corporate terms.\nThe Japan deal was touted as a $550 billion package of investment and procurement, with the president initially suggesting that the U.S. would capture 90% of the profits. A parallel deal with the EU tied tariff relief to promises of $750 billion in American energy purchases and $600 billion in capital commitments. Trump described those pledges not as contracts or policy targets but as “spending power” he could direct — the language of a chief executive talking about cash on hand. Whether or not the figures withstand accounting scrutiny — both Japan and the EU have pushed back on the president’s claims — the framing has been unmistakable: Markets are being told to treat these arrangements as revenue streams under presidential discretion.\n“[The president] still thinks he’s running the Trump Organization,” economist Justin Wolfers said on MSNBC, calling the president the “stock-picker-in-chief” of the country. “A commander in chief is not meant to go through the economy company by company,” the economist said. “You’re meant to set the rules and then let people compete.”\nTrump’s actions are shifting how markets digest presidential behavior. Policy pronouncements aren’t being treated as distant guardrails any longer; they’re being priced as line-item impacts on corporate income.\nMarkets can price almost anything — as long as it’s legible. What’s rattling investors isn’t just what the Trump administration is doing but how it’s doing it: via bespoke deals, direct revenue participation, and governance rights that outlive a press conference. The semiconductor headlines have been a laboratory. Nvidia and AMD re-rated when license paths to China reopened. But sell-side models also took down net revenue assumptions to reflect the skim, and buy-side notes began referring to a policy beta that’s separate from the usual demand and pricing risks. Intel became a different kind of proxy because permanent government ownership implies a different hurdle rate, a different oversight cadence, and different optionality for everything from capacity expansions to mergers and acquisitions.\nExecutives, meanwhile, are working the other side of the equation. If Trump is the country’s CEO, they’re the division heads trying to stay on his good side, hedging through proximity.\nApple CEO Tim Cook arrived at the White House with a 24-karat glass plaque and a $100 billion U.S. investment bump; Apple shares rose after Trump declared that companies manufacturing in the U.S. — like Apple — would be exempt from the new 100% chip tariff. Cook narrated the gift as if he were unboxing a limited-edition iPhone for the commander in chief. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has steered clear of rhetorical fights while highlighting his company’s role in building domestic AI infrastructure whenever export rules get tightened or loosened. Elon Musk, whose companies depend heavily on federal contracts and subsidies, has alternated between public feuds and private rapprochement.\nBanks have felt the sharper edge of the CEO presidency. In early August, the White House rolled out an executive order aimed at so-called discriminatory “de-banking,” and the president publicly warned of “payback” for what he called politicized account closures. JPMorgan and Bank of America shares fell on those headlines, not because of an immediate earnings impact but because presidential displeasure itself became a tradable risk.\nNone of these risks is theoretical. Disney, CBS, and elite law firms have already tasted what adversarial executive attention looks like. Corporations with direct exposure to licenses, grants, or discretionary approvals are behaving like division heads inside a conglomerate by managing upward.\nThe result is a financial sector that operates less like an independent market referee and more like a courtier class. Praise loudly, hedge quietly, and never assume that the separation between government policy and personal vendetta will hold.\nFor now, markets are shrugging. The S&P 500 is still buoyed by AI optimism, resilient consumer demand, and the prospect of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Investors have learned that betting against Trump can be costly — his bark doesn’t always match his bite, and volatility has often been a buying opportunity. But the warning lights are blinking. Lisa Shalett, the chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said that the equity risk premium has fallen to “very low levels, leaving almost no room for disappointment.” BlackRock’s investment directions told clients, “We don’t see volatility dissipating in a headline-driven market.”\nThat’s Wall Street code for “brace yourself.”\nFor all the adapting, some old-fashioned market discipline remains. When the talk of an Intel stake arose, traders marked the stock lower on the risk of dilution. When the president taunted big banks, their shares sagged. When tariffs escalated, earnings estimates were cut and indexes sank. As one Reuters “Trading Day” wrap put it, investors have become “restrained” in reacting to Trump’s unorthodox mix, but the complacency itself is a risk. Mohamed El-Erian said more starkly on Bloomberg TV that “U.S. exceptionalism is under threat” from policy uncertainty.\nU.S. presidents have intervened in markets before. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama rescued banks and automakers in 2008–09, but Obama insisted that the government exit GM’s equity as soon as possible. That government intervention in business was an emergency and rules-based with, importantly, an end date.\nUnder Trump, the arrangements look more like operating agreements, written into the very fabric of balance sheets and corporate charters. That shift blurs the line between emergency management and structural control, leaving investors unsure whether today’s deal is a stopgap or the newest operating model. Mergers that once hinged on regulatory approval now carry the added uncertainty of whether the president himself sees strategic or political advantage. In practice, Wall Street is treating Washington less like a regulator and more like an activist shareholder who could change the rules overnight.\nAnd hovering over all of it is Trump’s actual CEO record — the casinos that filed for bankruptcy, the Trump Shuttle that collapsed within four years, and the Trump University debacle that ended with a $25 million fraud settlement. In each case, Trump relied on debt, hype, and leverage; and in each case, when the projects soured, creditors and investors were left holding the bag. In some ways, the White House today looks like another iteration of the Trump Organization model: headline-grabbing deals financed by someone else’s capital, risk pushed down the line, and an operator who rarely stays for the cleanup.\nThe difference, of course, is scale. This time, the collateral isn’t just a busted casino or a failed airline. It’s the credibility of the U.S. market system itself. The checks are still there — courts, Congress, corporate lobbying — but markets are discovering that none of them blunt the day-to-day volatility of a CEO presidency. Investors are learning to parse the tweets, read the room, and hedge against the next surprise directive. In a sense, the U.S. has become a kind of meme stock. One that’s too big to ignore and too volatile to trust, and one that’s traded on a mix of fundamentals and personality.\nAmerica Inc. effectively has a new CEO, and Wall Street has started treating the president the way it would treat any corporate boss. They parse his words, hedge their exposure to his next move, and prepare portfolios for the next surprise call that reframes the quarter. But the longer the boss runs the balance sheet, the harder it is to trust the books. Markets are waking up to the realization that in America Inc., the spoils may follow strategy, but the risk flows from the CEO’s impulse.","content_hash":"9bbad3868dacd3d90a7ace0cdbdc3e7c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":10966,"method_rank":0}

Compared with their concerns in the spring, retail executives struck a measured tone and said they don't expect their costs, or customers' prices, to jump dramatically.\nWalmart had given one of the strongest warnings in May, as CFO John David Rainey said he expected some prices to rise during the summer. In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, however, Rainey said the nation's biggest retailer has raised prices on some items, but in other parts of its stores has kept prices down or expanded discounts.\n\"There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs,\" he said. \"There are other areas where we've had to pass some of those costs along. But when you look across the basket of items, we're certainly trying to keep prices as low as we can.\"\nScot Ciccarelli, a retail analyst for Truist, said retailers are raising prices \"but not nearly to the degree that might have been expected in early April\" when Trump first announced his steep tariffs on dozens of countries.\n\"Most of the companies are kind of downplaying the impact of tariffs,\" he said. \"They've all talked about substantial mitigation efforts, whether that is diversifying sourcing, whether that is pushing price back to vendors.\"\nHere are three takeaways from a busy couple of weeks of retail earnings.\nConsumer spending is steady — with some exceptions\nThe drumbeat of steady, but selective, U.S. consumer spending continued this quarter.\nAt Walmart, the nation's largest grocer by revenue, sales of private-label items, which tend to cost less than national name brands, were roughly flat, Rainey told CNBC. When customers trade down to those cheaper brands or smaller packs of items, it can signal U.S. households feel strapped for cash.\nAs companies closely watch the consumer, Rainey said Walmart has seen shopper behavior that's \"very consistent.\"\n\"They continue to be very resilient,\" he said.\nWalmart and Coach parent company Tapestry both raised their sales outlooks for the full year. Both companies said they saw healthy sales of discretionary items, such as clothing and handbags.\nSales of fashion items, including ladies' apparel and shoes, accelerated at Walmart in the quarter, Rainey said.\nOne of Coach's handbags, the large Kisslock bag that costs $695, sold out within minutes of launching in July, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said last week on the company's earnings call.\nYet some categories are still a tough sell. And lower-income shoppers have been more sensitive to price changes.\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said Thursday that the effect of tariffs on spending \"has been somewhat muted.\" Still, he added some shoppers have noticed and responded when prices creep up.\n\"As we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters,\" he said. \"Not surprisingly, we see more adjustments in middle- and lower-income households than we do with higher-income households and discretionary categories where item prices have gone up.\"\nSales at Home Depot and Lowe's improved as the quarter went on, with the strongest in July. Still, the companies weren't ready to predict a turnaround for home improvement.\nLowe's CEO Marvin Ellison attributed some of the recent pickup in demand to better weather and said \"it's too early for us to call that a trend.\" Higher mortgage rates and borrowing costs have dinged homeowners' willingness to tackle a major renovation or move to a new home, which tends to spur home projects.\nOther brands had more dire warnings about spending. On the company's earnings call, Crocs CEO Andrew Rees described the backdrop for the second half of the year as \"concerning\" and said its retail orders are weak.\nHe described Crocs' customers as \"super cautious.\"\n\"They're not purchasing. They're not even going to the stores, and we see traffic down,\" he said, adding that's also true at its outlets, which draw more lower-income households.\nRetailers have blunted the effects of tariffs ... so far\nRetailers have jumped into action to try to minimize cost increases from tariffs or avoid them altogether.\nThose tactics have included importing goods from a wider range of countries, getting items to the U.S. early and stocking up on high-frequency purchases or fresh merchandise that consumers are more likely to buy, even at higher prices, according to interviews of retail executives and earnings calls.\nYet as Walmart showed, retailers have been strategic about price increases — to not only avoid spooking customers, but also to dodge potential scrutiny from the White House. Trump criticized Walmart in May after the company warned it would have to raise prices.\nSharkninja, which makes a wide range of items including blenders and hairstyling tools, has \"increased sell price on products, but done it very, very carefully,\" CEO Mark Barrocas said in an interview. And in some cases, it had to roll back part of those price increases, he said.\nThe company has also reduced discounting and raised the price of new merchandise when it debuts. For example, Sharkninja initially planned to launch a new infrared skin care mask called CryoGlow at $299, but instead decided to price it at $349, he said.\nFor Walmart, Target and Tapestry-owned Coach, importing goods early and having merchandise in warehouses before tariffs took effect have helped them curb the hit from higher rates.\nHome Depot Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told CNBC most of the imported products the company sold during the quarter landed ahead of tariffs. And Home Depot is taking more steps to blunt the effects: More than half of what the company sells comes from the U.S. and it aims to import no more than 10% from any single country by the end of the year.\nYet the tariff bill is still adding up. Walmart's McMillon said he expects higher costs from duties to continue through the second half of the fiscal year. Other companies also provided specific estimates of how much the higher duties will cost them.\nEven as Tapestry posted sales growth, its shares tumbled last week after it said costs from higher duties would total $160 million this upcoming fiscal year and ding profits.\nWhile Trump's tariff policy appears more settled than in the spring, tariffs on some countries could still rise.\nMany of Trump's tariffs on countries began in early August, but one of the key rates still hangs in the balance. He delayed higher tariffs on China for 90 days last week. Those had jumped as high as 145%, but are now at 30% as negotiations continue.\nTarget acknowledged the trade uncertainty with its own strategy. It gave a wider than usual range for its full-year earnings per share outlook.\nStrong brands, new moneymakers matter more than ever\nStrong brand loyalty and lucrative new businesses have made it easier for some companies to weather the uncertainty.\nAs homeowners postpone larger projects, Home Depot and Lowe's have bulked up their business among home professionals to attract steadier traffic and prepare for when demand picks up again. Along with reporting earnings this week, Lowe's announced it's buying Foundation Building Materials for $8.8 billion, marking its second acquisition of a home professional-focused company in recent months.\nHome Depot announced its own pro-focused deal earlier this summer and made the largest acquisition in its history when it bought SRS Distribution last year.\nWalmart also has benefited from newer revenue streams, especially its advertising business and third-party marketplace. Global advertising grew 46% in the most recent quarter, including ad-enabled smart TV maker Vizio, which it acquired last year.\nIts marketplace revenue grew by 17% year over year. That business includes sellers who get charged a commission and often pay for services, such as ads on Walmart's site to promote their products or fulfillment services to have the big-box retailer store pack and ship orders to customers.\nThose \"more diversified set of profit streams,\" which have higher margins than selling a gallon of milk or a T-shirt, make Walmart's earnings steadier even as the company faces profit pressures, Rainey said on the company's earnings call.\n\"We are more than just a standard brick-and-mortar retail business,\" he said on the call.\nFor some brands, customer demand is high enough to help offset tariffs or allow them to charge more.\nSandal maker Birkenstock, for instance, \"saw no pushback or cancellations\" after its tariff-related July 1 price increases, CEO Oliver Reichert said on the company's earnings call.\nCoach, which has driven up its average price of items over the past five years and reduced its level of markdowns, can better \"absorb a lot of these input costs,\" Coach CEO Todd Kahn told CNBC.\nOn the flip side, tariff costs have hit some brands harder, especially if they don't have the new products customers seem to want or are skittish about what sales will look like later this year. High-performing companies with massive scale such as Walmart often have leverage with vendors to pass on costs — but other businesses might not.\n\"If you're a struggling brand, or you're not really growing your business with a vendor, that vendor has less incentive to absorb incremental costs, whether it's from tariffs or supply chain or whatever,\" Truist's Ciccarelli said.\nTarget said its profit margins in the quarter were hurt by the costs of cancelling orders. Crocs also said it is reducing orders for the back half of the year.\nCrocs took another unusual step: Rees said the company is taking back older inventory from retailers that sell its Heydude shoe brand and swapping it out with fresher styles.","content_hash":"a716a0950c2fb5fd79dcfc7a14676e65","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":10203,"method_rank":0}

Other major names felt similar shocks, highlighting underlying investor doubts: Oracle, in the midst of aggressive AI investments and a strategic pivot that included mass layoffs in its cloud division, saw its shares drop nearly 6%. Chipmakers integral to the AI boom struggled as well: Advanced Micro Devices fell 5.4%, Arm Holdings lost 5%, and Nvidia, the sector’s dominant force, slid 3.5%.\nSoftBank, whose outsize bets on AI have defined its recent strategy, dropped more than 7%—amplifying concerns about a broader tech correction and underscoring Wall Street’s uneasy relationship with the so-called next big thing. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman even admitted AI is in a bubble.\nThe abrupt selloff echoes broader skepticism about the sustainability of sky-high valuations seen in AI-focused companies. But experts say that while investors are right to be cautious, the underlying technology isn’t going away—and this is a short-term drop during a long-term transformation.\nBehind the market jitters, a recent report from MIT said approximately 95% of company generative AI pilot programs resulted in “little to no measurable impact” on revenue or profits. While a handful of startups have thrived, the vast majority of corporate efforts have stalled, caught in flawed enterprise integrations and learning gaps. The research, encompassing 150 executive interviews, 350 employee surveys, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments, paints a sobering picture: Outside exceptional cases, generative AI projects have yet to justify the vast spending across the sector.\nMIT’s lead author, Aditya Challapally, told Fortune failure may lie less in the underlying tools than in enterprise execution, citing issues around workflow adaptation and resource allocation. In contrast, nimble startups have rapidly scaled revenues—validating the potential of the technology when well integrated, but also highlighting a gulf between hype and reality for larger companies.\n“There’s no doubt that when MIT reports a 95% failure rate in AI pilot programs, it’s alarming,” Mike Sinoway, CEO of AI-powered search software company Lucidworks, told Fortune. “But the problem has less to do with the underlying technology and more with how companies are approaching it.\n“In our own research, polling over 1,600 AI practitioners and leaders and validating this with bot analysis, we found 65% of teams are rolling out AI without the fundamental tech infrastructure in place,” he said. “Trying to build cutting-edge applications atop weak foundations is like building an F1 car on a go-kart engine—you simply won’t get results. So while a 95% failure rate might seem like a sign of a bubble, once organizations focus more on what AI actually needs to succeed, we’ll begin to see the traction everyone is expecting.”\nChase Feiger, CEO of Ostro, an AI-powered platform for life sciences brands, agreed current volatility is part of a typical tech cycle. “Talk of an AI bubble isn’t new,” Feiger told Fortune.\n“Every major tech shift goes through a stage where hype runs ahead of business fundamentals,” he said. “Some companies are burning money on inference costs, offering ‘all-you-can-eat’ models that cost thousands to run but bring in only hundreds in revenue—a pattern reminiscent of Uber’s early years. That overinflation explains market caution, but the underlying technology isn’t overhyped. In health care, for example, AI is transforming drug development, patient care, and physician decision-making.\n“The correction will come. But over the long haul, the winners will be those who prove AI delivers durable value in complex, high-stakes environments,” Feiger added.\nHarvard professor Christina Inge told Fortune the duality at work is nothing new.\n“Investors are right to be cautious,” she said. “Not every company claiming to be ‘AI-driven’ is creating real value; a lot of it is smoke and mirrors, with some tools amounting to incremental improvements on non-AI tech. Correction is inevitable, as history shows.\n“But the technology isn’t going away. AI is already making a difference in health care, marketing, logistics, and finance. And we’re only scratching the surface. In the long run, I expect the impact of AI to rival the Industrial Revolution. There’s a lot of froth in the market right now, but the bigger story is just beginning. In other words: short-term bubble, long-term transformation.”\nThat view is echoed by Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities.\n“What we’re seeing isn’t a bubble, but the foundation of a new economy,” Boloor told Fortune. “There will be volatility—inevitable with a sector this hot—but the fundamental reality is every industry will be transformed by AI. Just look at Microsoft and Meta this quarter: Azure hit its biggest revenue numbers ever, Microsoft Cloud crossed $46 billion, and Meta monetized not just attention but intelligence, with 22% revenue growth and 38% profit growth, while spending $70 billion in capex. The demand is not hypothetical—it’s scaling now.\n“We’re not at the peak of AI. We’re at an inflection point.”\nSiamak Freydoonnejad, cofounder of Sprites AI, which makes an AI-powered marketing agent, says, however, deciding whether or not we’re in an AI bubble “misses the point” entirely.\n“Stock prices may have outpaced fundamentals, but inside enterprises, AI is already infrastructure,” Freydoonnejad told Fortune.\n“No one who’s seen campaign launch speed improve by 70% is going back to the old way,” he said. “Some vendors did slap ‘AI’ on legacy products to cash in, but those valuations will be corrected—and deservedly so. What matters is which firms are using AI not as a shallow trend but as the basis for their entire product. Real efficiency gains are showing up for companies embedding AI deeply in their workflows. The market is about to sort out those with substantive results from those selling only promises.”\nOmar Kouhlani, CEO of Runmic, which uses AI to design revenue strategies for sales teams, told Fortune infrastructure spending reveals the true momentum.\n“Big Tech just raised AI spending guidance to $360 billion–plus for 2025, up sharply from previous estimates. I watch those numbers more closely than day-to-day share price changes,” he said.\n“This isn’t a rejection of AI, it’s a market becoming more selective,” Kouhlani continued. “The crash is separating real AI revenues from companies that only have AI PowerPoints. We’re not in another dotcom bust. The infrastructure is being built now, and expectations are adjusting faster than the technology itself.”\nUsha Haley, the W. Frank Barton Distinguished Chair in International Business and professor of management at the Barton School of Business at Wichita State University, argues that cycles of bubbles and corrections are intrinsic to tech revolutions. “Historically, every breakthrough technology comes with bubbles,” Haley told Fortune. “AI is already delivering productivity gains, even as it erodes some jobs. We’ll see some correction and consolidation, but not a collapse. The strongest players will emerge into a changed landscape. Regulation and stochastic shocks could alter outcomes, but competitive environments—not monopolies—will point to future leaders.”\nFabian Stephany, a lecturer at the University of Oxford, sees evidence for both sides: “To some extent, yes, there is an AI bubble. But long-term fundamentals are exceptionally strong,” he told Fortune. “Many firms use AI for marketing more than substance, which has inflated valuations. Yet stock-market gains this year are overwhelmingly linked to real advances in AI at companies like Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Broadcom. Nvidia alone accounts for 26% of the S&P’s advance, underscoring real market transformation.”\nDavid Brudenell, executive director at Decidr, which builds an AI-powered operating system for businesses to automate workflows, told Fortune that “correction is necessary” as it “separates speculation from structural value.” And David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation, agreed: “Pullbacks are normal after rallies stall.\n“Major players like Palantir and Microsoft failed to hold breakouts after strong earnings. That’s a sign the good news may be priced in,” Russell told Fortune. “Markets move ahead of fundamentals, but excessive prices punish those chasing the froth. In the weeks ahead, sentiment could shift to other macro factors.”\nThe expert consensus is clear: While stocks have pulled back, the fundamentals behind AI remain strong. Most believe the recent rout is an overdue market sorting—separating hype from reality, speculation from enduring value. Even MIT’s cautious findings are seen as a spur rather than a death knell.\nNow, all eyes will turn to Nvidia, which reports quarterly earnings next week. But broadly speaking, what the market is experiencing isn’t a sign of crisis, but a marker of growing pains.\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft. An editor verified the accuracy of the information before publishing.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","content_hash":"c989b151ccb4ab40d47ff020dc3ce648","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":9531,"method_rank":0}

Concerns about consumer spending are weighing on stocks after Walmart reported weaker-than-expected Q2 EPS. Also, higher bond yields are undercutting stocks, with the 10-year T-note yield up +3 bp to 4.32% after Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said inflation risks are marginally higher than risks to the labor market and \"modestly restrictive\" monetary policy is still appropriate.

The US is working to set up a meeting between President Putin and Zelensky, and if that meeting goes well, President Trump said he'll look to follow up with a trilateral summit with the leaders. The outcome of the negotiations could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.\nThe focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal. Later today, July existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m\/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, \"I'll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we'll be setting sometime next week, week after.\" Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 79% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 51% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 93% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 83% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.45%. China's Shanghai Composite rallied to a new 10-year high and closed up +0.13%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 fell to a 1-week low and closed down -0.65%.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) today are down -5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +3.3 bp to 4.324%. Sep T-notes are under pressure today on hawkish comments from Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, who said \"modestly restrictive\" monetary policy is still appropriate due to inflation risks. T-notes added to their losses today after the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI expanded by the most in three years.\nLosses in T-notes are limited on Fed-friendly US economic news that showed weekly jobless claims rose more than expected to a 2-month high, and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey fell more than expected.\nFed Governor Lisa Cook said she intends to remain at the Fed despite calls from President Trump for her to resign over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. If Cook is fired or resigns, Mr. Trump could appoint another Fed Governor who favors his lower interest rate policies.\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving higher. The 10-year German bund yield is up +2.5 bp to 2.742%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +3.0 bp to 4.702%.\nThe Eurozone Aug S&P manufacturing PMI unexpectedly rose +0.7 to 50.5, stronger than expectations of a decline to 49.5 and the fastest pace of expansion in 3 years. The Aug composite PMI unexpectedly rose +0.2 to a 15-month high of 51.1, stronger than expectations of a decline to 50.6.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nWeakness in chip stocks is a drag on the overall market. Intel (INTC) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) are down more than -2%. Also, ON Semiconductor (ON), ASML Holding NV (ASML), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Qualcomm (QCOM), and GlobalFoundries (GFS) are down more than -1%.\nWalmart (WMT) is down more than -4% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials after reporting Q2 adjusted ESP of 68 cents, weaker than the consensus of 74 cents.\nMaplebear Inc (CART) is down more than -3% after Wedbush downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral with a price target of $42.\nSharkNinja Inc.

SoFi's remittance product, which is expected to roll out later this year, will allow users to send U.S. dollars through the SoFi app, with recipients receiving local currency deposits abroad, using Lightspark's Universal Money Address (UMA). Lightspark’s UMA provides access to a global payment rail designed for speed and scale. Transfers will display upfront exchange rates and fees, addressing longstanding pain points in traditional remittance services. The launch follows SoFi’s reentry into crypto, after halting services in 2023 during its transition to a national bank. Earlier this year, it revealed plans to offer international remittances through blockchain and stablecoins and allow users to invest in crypto. — Jamie Crawley Read more.\nBITLAYER ENTERS SOLANA WITH YBTC: Bitcoin DeFi project Bitlayer has partnered with Kamino Finance and Orca to bring its bitcoin-backed token, YBTC, to the Solana ecosystem. This integration is intended to combine Bitlayer's security with Solana's speed and scalability, aligning with Bitlayer's goal of expanding the Bitcoin DeFi sector. It will provide bitcoin holders with native BTC exposure and yield opportunities, said Charlie Hu, co-founder of Bitlayer. YBTC, pegged 1:1 with BTC, is central to Bitlayer's BitVM bridge, which is designed for trust-minimized bitcoin transfers by eliminating centralized intermediaries. The token serves as a direct representation of users' locked BTC within the Bitlayer ecosystem, enabling seamless interoperability between Bitcoin and decentralized finance applications. By holding YBTC, Solana users can maximize yields through Kamino’s institutional-grade earn vaults, which provide auto-compounding and optimized BTC-denominated returns, helping assets grow effortlessly. — Omkar GodboleRead more.\nVALANTIS ACQUIRES stHYPE: Valantis, a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol, has acquired Staked Hype (stHYPE), the second-largest liquid staking token (LST) on Hyperliquid. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. stHYPE, which launched as the first LST on HyperEVM, currently holds about $180 million in total value locked (TVL), according to the stHYPE website. Following the deal, stHYPE’s operations, development, and scaling will be managed by Valantis Labs. Addison Spiegel, founder of Thunderhead, the team behind stHYPE, will serve as an advisor to Valantis. Liquid staking has become a central pillar within Hyperliquid’s ecosystem. According to DeFiLlama, liquid staking accounts for more than half of Hyperliquid L1’s $2.26 billion in DeFi TVL. The acquisition builds on Valantis’ earlier launch of LST-specific DEX pools for both stHYPE and hHYPE, which together have attracted nearly $70 million in TVL and processed more than $500 million in trading volume. — Oliver KnightRead more.\nHYPERBEAT GETS $5.2M IN SEED: Hyperbeat, a protocol powering yield infrastructure on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange, has closed a $5.2 million oversubscribed seed round co-led by ether.fi Ventures and Electric Capital. The raise will be used to build out their yield infrastructure for traders, protocols, and institutions that are tapped into the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The round also drew investments from Coinbase Ventures, Chapter One, Selini, Maelstrom, Anchorage Digital, and community backers via the HyperCollective. Hyperbeat serves as the native yield layer for Hyperliquid, building permissionless financial infrastructure that allows anyone to earn, stake, and spend directly from their on-chain portfolio. It unlocks yield generated by Hyperliquid’s funding rates—previously accessible only to sophisticated market participants—and packages it into simple, tokenized vaults.

The company says it will also use Dogecoin’s DogeOS layer 2 to stake in DeFi products, aiming to boost miner returns beyond standard rewards. — Sam Reynolds Read more.\nUnknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option\nRegulatory and Policy\nThe crypto industry is mounting a counteroffensive against Wall Street bankers’ bid to rewrite the U.S.’ new stablecoin law, arguing that attempts to roll back core provisions of the GENIUS Act would tilt the field toward traditional banks. In a letter to Senate Banking Committee leaders dated Aug. 19, the Crypto Council for Innovation and the Blockchain Association urged lawmakers to reject proposals from the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute and state banking groups that called for stripping out Section 16(d) of the law and banning yield programs offered by affiliates of stablecoin issuers. Section 16(d) allows subsidiaries of state-chartered institutions to conduct money transmission across state lines in support of stablecoin issuer activities, ensuring holders can redeem their tokens nationwide without needing separate state licenses. Banking groups warned earlier this month that allowing state-chartered, uninsured institutions to issue stablecoins and operate nationwide would amount to regulatory arbitrage, bypassing state licensing regimes. — Sam Reynolds Read More\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve's newest vice chair who supervises Wall Street banking, Michelle Bowman, made a crypto speech on Tuesday that could have been uttered by one of the industry's own policy wonks, advocating that banks get behind the digital assets surge and that the Fed give the sector rules that won't get in crypto's way. At the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium, Bowman warned banks that don't embrace the shift toward crypto \"will play a diminished role in the financial system more broadly,\" and she further underlined what's already been an obvious change in crypto sentiment from U.S. banking regulators. \"Your industry has already experienced significant frictions with bank regulators applying unclear standards, conflicting guidance, and inconsistent regulatory interpretations,\" she said. \"We need a clear, strategic regulatory framework that will facilitate the adoption of new technology, recognizing that in some cases, it may be inadequate and inappropriate to apply existing regulatory guidance to address emerging tech.\" — Jesse Hamilton Read more.\nUnknown block type \"divider\", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option","content_hash":"c843b8d6adb0f4ab65fd657beeaf0eab","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8565,"method_rank":0}

In my column today, I look ahead to Powell's eighth and final Jackson Hole speech. If market moves following his previous seven are any guide, investors should be in for a bumpy ride.\nIf you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.\n1. Trump calls on Fed Governor Cook to resign 2. Fed's dilemma between AI and housing: Mike Dolan 3. Big investors ditch tech ahead of expected Septemberstocks slump 4. US tech-stock stumble shows vulnerability in AI 5. UK inflation heat puts Bank of England back in thespotlight\nToday's Key Market Moves\n* STOCKS: Wall Street in the red, again led by techselloff. Nasdaq sheds 0.7%. China closes at a 10-year high,Europe gains too, but benchmark EM falls. * SHARES\/SECTORS: Target slides 6% after firm announcesinsider Michael Fiddelke as new CEO. Intel falls 7% and othertech firms fall on news the government is eyeing stakes inchipmakers. * FX: New Zealand dollar falls 1% after dovish RBNZ ratecut, bucking broader trend of U.S. dollar weakness. * BONDS: U.S. yields down ever so slightly, recoveringafter the Fed minutes. The 20-year auction was mixed. * COMMODITIES: Safety bid lifts gold 1%, oil reboundsaround 1.5% on U.S. inventory drawdown.\nToday's Talking Points:\n* Trump interference. Investors are increasingly concerned about the involvement - or interference - from President Donald Trump and his administration in many aspects of the economy, private sector business, and independent policymaking.\nTrump on Wednesday called for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign over mortgage allegations, which could pave the way for another Trump appointee at the Fed inclined to lower interest rates. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, meanwhile, is said to be looking into the government taking equity stakes in Intel and other chipmakers in exchange for grants under the CHIPS Act.\nThis comes on the heels of Trump's recent sideswipe at Goldman Sachs's CEO and chief U.S. economist, criticism of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, his firing of a senior statistics official, and months of verbal attacks on Powell for not cutting rates.\n* Tech fatigue. After leading Wall Street's charge this year to new peaks, U.S. tech shares are now losing steam and dragging broader indexes lower. Whether that's simply rotation and diversification, unease over the megacap concentration, or doubts about the huge AI spend, air is coming out of the tech balloon.\nThe S&P 500 tech sector is down nearly 5% in the last five trading days. But a bit of perspective is required - the sector rallied 60% between April 7 and August 13.\n* Fed minutes. With just two days to go until Powell's last Jackson Hole speech, investors on Wednesday had the minutes of the Fed's July 29-30 policy meeting to pore over.\nThe minutes appear to show that the two policymakers who dissented against the central bank decision to leave rates unchanged appear not to have been joined by others in voicing support for lowering rates at that meeting. \"Almost all participants viewed it as appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25% to 4.50% at this meeting,\" the minutes read.\nMaybe the bar to cutting rates is higher than thought? But bear in mind, the weak July payrolls data were released two days after that decision.\nJackson Hole speech could pack a punch\nFinancial markets are taking in a collective breath ahead of Powell's eighth and final keynote Jackson Hole speech as Federal Reserve chair. If the moves following his last seven are any guide, investors should buckle up for a bumpy ride.\nFed-watchers will be focused squarely on whether Powell signals that he's willing to cut interest rates at the central bank's September 16-17 meeting. His public comments in recent months have been relatively hawkish, but those were all before the release of the weak July employment figures that fired up easing expectations.\nRates futures traders are pricing in an 85% probability of a quarter-point cut next month, with another 25 basis points of easing expected by year's end. Powell's words on Friday could provide significant clarity about whether these positions are \"in the money\" or not.\nGiven that traders are betting so heavily on an imminent move, the \"pain trade\" will be if Powell holds the line that policymakers need to see more incoming data before resuming the easing cycle put on hold in December.\nInvestors have reason to be cautious. History shows Powell's Jackson Hole speeches tend to move markets a lot, especially the bond market. And even though Powell is often considered a policy dove at heart, his Jackson Hole set-piece speeches have usually pushed yields higher, not lower.\nWATCH BOND YIELDS\nIn the month following each of Powell's last seven Jackson Hole speeches, the 10-year Treasury yield has risen by an average of 21 bps, according to Reuters calculations. The dollar has risen 1.4% and the S&P 500 has fallen nearly 2%, on average, over the same period.\nStretching that out, the S&P 500 has risen an average of 2.3% between the late-August speech and year-end, the dollar has gained 0.4%, while the 10-year yield has climbed 27 basis points on average.\nBut these averages mask some much bigger moves, especially in the month after the central bank jamboree in Wyoming.\nThe stand-out example is 2022, when Powell, in his Monetary Policy and Price Stability speech, invoked former Fed Chair Paul Volcker, warning of the \"pain\" that households and businesses were likely to face from the tight policy needed to slay inflation.\nIn the following month, the S&P 500 tanked 12%, the dollar rallied 5%, and the 10-year Treasury yield soared 75 bps.\nBond yields climbed at least 20 bps in the month following three other Powell Jackson Hole speeches, in 2018, 2021, and 2023, the latter being another where Powell signaled a readiness to keep rates higher for longer.\nKEY CONSIDERATIONS\nInflation today is not as lofty as it was two years ago, but, sitting around 1 percentage point above the Fed's 2% goal, it is higher than Powell would like. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Fed's dual mandate, unemployment remains at a historical low of 4.2%.\nThis year's theme at Jackson Hole is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\" Powell has stated that the unemployment rate is the best measure of the labor market. But that does not mean today's low unemployment rate will automatically lead to a hawkish speech - history shows that when unemployment starts to rise, it can move quickly, leaving the Fed woefully behind the curve.\nMarkets are probably prepared for some large price swings, whichever way Powell leans.\nTHE LAST TIME\nIt's also likely that Powell will use the platform to defend his tenure, just like his predecessors: Alan Greenspan in 2005, Ben Bernanke in 2012, and Janet Yellen in 2017. Given the unprecedented public pressure Trump has placed on Powell to cut interest rates this year, why would the Fed chair not seize this opportunity to have his say?\n\"He may offer some soft guidance that rates may move lower at a coming meeting. But this is his last speech at Jackson Hole. He may never again have a platform this influential to offer his view of how his history should be written,\" economists at UBS wrote on Friday.\nWill he sign off with a bang? Markets are locked and loaded.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* Australia, Japan, India PMIs (August, flash) * South Korea producer inflation (July) * UK public finances (July) * UK, euro zone PMIs (August, flash) * Canada producer inflation (July) * U.S. weekly jobless claims * U.S. Philly Fed business index (August) * U.S. PMI (August) * U.S. $8 billion auction of 30-year TIPS * U.S. earnings - Walmart * Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

The company will also launch its first wristband that will allow users to control the glasses with hand gestures, the people said.\nConnect is a two-day conference for developers focused on virtual reality, AR and the metaverse. It was originally called Oculus Connect and obtained its current moniker after Facebook changed its parent company name to Meta in 2021.\nThe glasses are internally codenamed Hypernova and will include a small digital display in the right lens of the device, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential.\nThe device is expected to cost about $800 and will be sold in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, the people said. CNBC reported in October that Meta was working with Luxottica on consumer glasses with a display.\nMeta declined to comment. Luxottica, which is based in France and Italy, didn't respond to a request for comment.\nMeta began selling smart glasses with Luxottica in 2021 when the two companies released the first-generation Ray-Ban Stories, which allowed users to take photos or videos using simple voice commands. The partnership has since expanded, and last year included the addition of advanced AI features that made the second generation of the product an unexpected hit with early adopters.\nLuxottica owns a number of glasses brands, including Ray-Ban, and licenses many others like Prada. It's unclear what brand Luxottica will use for the glasses with AR, but a Meta job listing posted this week said the company is looking for a technical program manager for its \"Wearables organization,\" which \"is responsible for the Ray-Ban AR glasses and other wearable hardware.\"\nIn June, CNBC reported that Meta and Luxottica plan to release Prada-branded smart glasses. Prada glasses are known for having thick frames and arms, which could make them a suitable option for the Hypernova device, one of the people said.\nLast year, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg used Connect to showcase the company's experimental Orion AR glasses.\nThe Orion features AR capabilities on both lenses, capable of blending 3D digital visuals into the physical world, but the device served only as a prototype to show the public what could be possible with AR glasses. Still, Orion built some positive momentum for Meta, which since late 2020 has endured nearly $70 billion in losses from its Reality Labs unit that's in charge of building hardware devices.\nWith Hypernova, Meta will finally be offering glasses with a display to consumers, but the company is setting low expectations for sales, some of the sources said. That's because the device requires more components than its voice-only predecessors, and will be slightly heavier and thicker, the people said.\nMeta and Ray-Ban have sold 2 million pairs of their second-generation glasses since 2023, Luxottica CEO Francesco Milleri said in February. In July, Luxottica said that revenue from sales of the smart glasses had more than tripled year over year.\nAs part of an extension agreement between Meta and Luxottica announced in September, Meta obtained a stake of about 3% in the glasses company according to Bloomberg. Meta also gets exclusive rights to Luxottica's brands for its smart glasses technology for a number of years, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC in June.\nAlthough Hypernova will feature a display, those visual features are expected to be limited, people familiar with the matter said. They said the color display will offer about a 20 degree field of view — meaning it will appear in a small window in a fixed position — and will be used primarily to relay simple bits of information, such as incoming text messages.\nAndrew Bosworth, Meta's technology chief, said earlier this month that there are advantages to having just one display rather than two, including a lower price.\n\"Monocular displays have a lot going for them,\" Bosworth said in an Instagram video. \"They're affordable, they're lighter, and you don't have disparity correction, so they're structurally quite a bit easier.\"\n'Interact with an AI assistant'\nOther details of Meta's forthcoming glasses were disclosed in a July letter from the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to a lawyer representing Meta. While the letter redacted the name of the company and the product, a person with knowledge of the matter confirmed that it was in reference to Meta's Hypernova glasses.\n\"This model will enable the user to take and share photos and videos, make phone calls and video calls, send and receive messages, listen to audio playback and interact with an AI assistant in different forms and methods, including voice, display, and manual interactions,\" according to the letter, dated July 23.\nThe letter from CBP was part of routine communication between companies and the U.S. government when determining the country of origin for a consumer product. It refers to the product as \"New Smart Glasses,\" and says the device will feature \"a lens display function that allows the user to interface with visual content arising from the Smart Features, and components providing image data retrieval, processing, and rendering capabilities.\"\nCBP didn't provide a comment for this story.\nThe Hypernova glasses will also come paired with a wristband that will use technology built by Meta's CTRL Labs, said people familiar with the matter. CTRL Labs, which Meta acquired in 2019, specializes in building neural technology that could allow users to control computing devices using gestures in their arms.\nThe wristband is expected to be a key input component for the company's future release of full AR glasses, so getting data now with Hypernova could improve future versions of the wristband, the people said. Instead of using camera sensors to track body movements, as with Apple's Vision Pro headset, Meta's wristband uses so-called sEMG sensor technology, which reads and interprets the electrical signals from hand movements.\nOne of the challenges Meta has faced with the wristband involves how people choose to wear it, a person familiar with the product's development said. If the device is too loose, it won't be able to read the user's electrical signals as intended, which could impact its performance, the person said. Also, the wristband has run into issues in testing related to which arm it's worn on, how it works on men versus women and how it functions on people who wear long sleeves.\nThe CTRL Labs team published a paper in Nature in July about its wristband, and Meta wrote about it in a blog post. In the paper, the Meta team detailed its use of machine learning technology to make the wristband work with as many people as possible. The additional data collected by the upcoming device should improve those capabilities for future Meta smart glasses.\n\"We successfully prototyped an sEMG wristband with Orion, our first pair of true augmented reality (AR) glasses, but that was just the beginning,\" Meta wrote in the post. \"Our teams have developed advanced machine learning models that are able to transform neural signals controlling muscles at the wrist into commands that drive people's interactions with the glasses, eliminating the need for traditional—and more cumbersome—forms of input.\"\nBloomberg reported the wristband component in January.\nMeta has recently started reaching out to developers to begin testing both Hypernova and the accompanying wristband, people familiar with the matter said. The company wants to court third-party developers, particularly those who specialize in generative AI, to build experimental apps that Meta can showcase to drum up excitement for the smart glasses, the people said.\nIn addition to Hypernova and the wristband, Meta will also announce a third-generation of its voice-only smart glasses with Luxottica at Connect, one person said.\nThat device was also referenced by CBP in its July letter, referring to it as \"The Next Generation Smart Glasses.\" The glasses will include \"components that provide capacitive touch functionality, allowing users to interact with the Smart Glasses through touch gestures,\" the letter said.\nWATCH: Elon Musk asked Zuckerberg to join xAI bit for OpenAI","content_hash":"e117ad1b1873b270e3d5dd9bbf9b0c4e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8469,"method_rank":0}

It straddles cannabis, craft beverages, hemp-based wellness, and even entertainment — building a portfolio that spans more than 40 brands across 20 countries. Yet, for all its global reach, TLRY stock often behaves like a risky roll of the dice.\nLast week, TLRY stock ripped more than 70% higher before paring back some of the gains by Friday, Aug. 15. The spark came from President Donald Trump floating the idea of reclassifying marijuana to Schedule III. That’s a seismic shift that could unlock broader medical use, loosen restrictions, and finally bring cannabis companies out of regulatory purgatory. Meanwhile, Tilray deepened its European footprint, collaborating with Italian pharma player Molteni, underscoring its ambition beyond North America.\nSo, given Tilray's volatility — tangled in speculation, partnerships, and politics — is TLRY stock still signaling a buy for investors? Or is it better left on a cautious wait-and-watch hold?\nAbout Tilray Stock\nCanada-based Tilray Brands has evolved into one of the world’s largest cannabis companies by revenue, standing at the crossroads of innovation and disruption. Following its 2021 merger with Aphria, the company expanded its horizons under CEO Irwin Simon, blending medical cannabis, wellness products, and craft beverages into a diversified portfolio.\nOperating across 20 countries, Tilray’s global footprint and bold acquisitions have positioned it as a dynamic player in the rapidly shifting cannabis and alternative wellness space. Its current market capitalization sits at $1.16 billion.\nTLRY stock has been a tale of extremes, mirroring the turbulence of the cannabis sector itself. Once a market darling after its 2018 debut, shares have steadily eroded, falling 45% over the past 52 weeks and down 23% year-to-date (YTD) as investors question its acquisition-driven strategy and mounting losses. Pressure mounted further recently when Tilray disclosed that it sought a Nasdaq compliance extension, amplifying concerns about financial durability.\nYet, recently, sentiment around Tilray has flipped dramatically. Riding a wave of speculation and fresh catalysts, TLRY stock has climbed 66% in the past month and delivered a staggering 127% surge in three months.\nThe rally accelerated on Aug. 13, when shares spiked more than 31% following news of a strategic partnership to expand its medical cannabis footprint in Italy. Adding fuel to the momentum, growing optimism over potential cannabis reclassification has injected new life into the broader sector, positioning Tilray at the center of investor excitement.\nTLRY stock is priced at just 1.53 times forward sales, sitting below both its sector peers and its own historical median — a valuation gap that hints at untapped potential, if the growth story holds steady.\nA Closer Look at Tilray’s Q4 Results\nTilray Brands’ fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 earnings, released July 28, painted a picture of a company caught between ambition and uncertainty. Revenue slipped 2.4% year-over-year (YOY) to $224.5 million, missing estimates, while net loss widened to $1.30 per share, a steep drop from the $0.04 loss a year earlier. Adjusted EPS fell 50% YOY to $0.02, a reminder that profitability still lies somewhere down the road.\nThe cannabis segment took the heaviest hit. Net revenue dropped to $67.8 million in Q4, reflecting Tilray’s strategic decision to protect margins by raising selling prices and pulling back from lower-yield categories. For fiscal 2025, cannabis net revenue declined 9% YOY, dragged by delays in international medical permits and a conscious retreat from vapes and wholesale channels — moves that shaved roughly $15 million off sales but preserved long-term margins.\nDespite the misses and dips, there were bright spots. Tilray’s international cannabis business surged 71% YOY, hitting a record $22.4 million in Q4, proof that global expansion is gaining traction. At the same time, gross margins improved meaningfully to 44% in Q4 and 40% across fiscal 2025, showcasing tighter cost discipline and operational efficiencies.\nOn the broader revenue front, Tilray delivered a record $821 million in fiscal 2025, up 4% annually, thanks largely to diversification. With the Canadian market oversaturated and sales slowing, and U.S. legalization still frozen, Tilray leaned on non-cannabis streams like beverages, wellness, and distribution, which made up nearly 70% of total revenue.\nBeverages soared 19% YOY to $240.6 million in fiscal 2025, propelled by acquisitions from Anheuser-Busch (BUD) and Molson Coors (TAP), cementing Tilray as one of America’s biggest craft brewers. Hemp-based THC drinks and wellness products climbed 9% to $60.5 million, strengthening Tilray’s grip on the hemp market with 60% U.S. share and 80% Canadian share.\nLooking ahead, Tilray expects adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2026 to land between $62 million and $72 million, implying growth of 13% to 31% annually. A lot hinges on Project 420, Tilray’s initiative to integrate its craft beer assets, streamline operations, and expand its global supply chain. If executed well, the plan could unlock efficiency gains and strengthen the firm's cultivation footprint across key markets.\nTilray’s road ahead is not expected to be smooth — at least not in the near term. Analysts monitoring the company expect losses to be -$0.03 per share in Q1 fiscal 2026, with full-year losses projected to deepen to -$0.11 per share, marking a sharp YOY decline. But there is light further down the road. By fiscal 2027, losses are forecast to shrink 45% YOY to $0.06 per share. Tilray’s turnaround may be slow, but it is not stalling.\nIs Tilray’s Two-Pronged Push a Catalyst or a Mirage?\nIf Trump follows through on moving marijuana to Schedule III, the ripple effects for the struggling and loss-making Tilray could be immense. Such a shift would acknowledge cannabis’ medical value, remove it from the same legal cage as heroin, and lower barriers for research, prescribing, and financing.\nFor Tilray, it could mean smoother regulatory pathways, expanded access to U.S. markets, and a surge of institutional investment once the stigma lifts. The move would not immediately erase challenges, but it could reshape the growth story for cannabis operators, and place Tilray in prime position to capitalize.\nAdding to the momentum, the strategic partnership with Molteni aims to expand cannabis extract availability and strengthen medical cannabis education across Europe, potentially deepening Tilray’s foothold in a fast-growing therapeutic market while reinforcing its leadership in the European cannabis landscape.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Tilray Stock?\nThe consensus rating on TLRY stock remains at a “Moderate Buy” based on the eight analysts with coverage. Among them, three recommend a “Strong Buy,” while the remaining five analysts advise a “Hold” rating.\nWall Street is not promising fireworks just yet. Tilray’s recent dips have bruised sentiment, but whispers of a rebound linger. With a mean price target of $1.27, TLRY has a rebound potential of 13% from the current levels. Meanwhile, the $3 Street-high target implies the stock could surge as much as 191%.\nFinal Thoughts on Tilray\nTilray is not a “set-it-and-forget-it” kind of stock. It is an unpredictable player on Wall Street, swinging between thrilling rallies and gut-punching dips. With a 60-month beta of 1.85, volatility is baked into its DNA. Shares recently surged, powered by reclassification chatter and a new partnership, but let’s not forget the widening losses, slowing core sales, and the Nasdaq extension request hanging over TLRY stock.\nThis story is equal parts promise and volatility, a high-stakes ride where conviction matters more than timing. For risk-takers who can stomach the volatility and trust the growth bets, there’s upside potential. For the cautious, sitting back and watching from the sidelines might be the smarter move in August — at least until the dust settles.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Following BTC’s all-time high above $124,000 last week — fueled by dovish Federal Reserve rate-cut expectations and dollar weakness — the cryptocurrency is facing a technical pullback amid macroeconomic headwinds, including tempered rate-cut optimism and Treasury signals against expanding U.S. crypto reserves.\nWith supply nearing its limit and institutional inflows rising, Bitcoin’s current consolidation reflects a recalibration, balancing volatility with structural demand. Long-term investors view it as an opportunity, while short-term traders navigate tight ranges, setting the stage for potential re-acceleration as the market matures and corporate crypto strategies deepen.\nAt the center of it all is BTC mining, the energy-intensive process where powerful computers solve complex puzzles to verify transactions and release new coins. That’s where the fintech powerhouse Block (XYZ) enters. Known for Square, Cash App, Afterpay, TIDAL, and crypto ventures like Bitkey and Proto, Block recently launched Proto Rig, a modular mining system, and Proto Fleet, open-source management software, designed to cut costs, extend hardware life, and streamline operations.\nSo, does Block’s mining push signal long-term upside? Or is caution the wiser move?\nAbout Block Stock\nBlock is Jack Dorsey’s fintech vision turned reality — a company weaving together Square’s merchant tools, Cash App’s banking ease, Afterpay’s buy now pay later (BNPL) service flexibility, TIDAL’s artist empowerment, and crypto ventures like Bitkey and Proto. Its mission is to expand global economic access.\nFrom payments to music to Bitcoin mining, Block is not just building apps. It is creating an interconnected ecosystem where money, commerce, and creativity flow more freely for sellers, consumers, and creators worldwide. Its market capitalization currently stands at $45.7 billion.\nShares of XYZ have been on a roller coaster ride, full of ups and downs. From its 52-week peak of $99.26, the stock has tumbled under the weight of higher interest rates, profitability concerns, stiffening competition, and shaky macroeconomic sentiment. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, XYZ stock is still down 15%.\nStep back, however, and the picture looks brighter, with shares up 11% over the past year. In the near term, momentum is building as well. Over just the last three months, XYZ stock has surged 26%, hinting at a potential turnaround story in motion.\nBlock’s valuation reads like a discount sale in a pricey neighborhood, trading at 1.9 times sales. For investors with the stomach to ride near-term turbulence, the setup whispers “undervalued” for long-haul investors. XYZ is not screaming cheap, but in a frothy fintech landscape, this looks like a risk worth underwriting.\nA Closer Look at Block’s Q2 Results\nBlock's second-quarter earnings report, released on Aug. 7, told a mixed story. Revenue came in at $6.05 billion, down 1.6% year-over-year (YOY) and shy of Wall Street’s target. However, adjusted EPS rose 32% annually to $0.62. Beneath the top-line miss, gross profit surged 14% YOY to $2.5 billion, outpacing analyst estimates and proving Block’s core engines are humming.\nSquare, Block’s original business, handled $64.25 billion in gross payment volume (GPV), up 10% YOY. That’s no small feat considering its competitors like Toast (TOST) and Fiserv’s (FI) Clover are clawing for market share. Meanwhile, Cash App is maturing into something more than a peer-to-peer wallet. Some 8 million users now treat it as their primary bank, generating more profit than average users. Add Borrow, Block’s fast-growing lending arm with $18 billion in annualized originations, and one can start to see the financial ecosystem CEO Jack Dorsey is building.\nNever one to shy from tech bets, Dorsey highlighted how internal artificial intelligence (AI) tools like “Goose” are reshaping Block’s DNA. Developers are shipping products like Cash App Pools, a group money-pooling feature that even works with Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Pay. This product velocity is exactly what Block is betting on to keep ahead of rivals.\nOn the Square side, fresh go-to-market pushes are delivering paybacks in just five to six quarters. New hardware like Square Handheld and AI-powered dashboards are positioning the brand to win across restaurants, retail, and services. Add $58 billion in Bitcoin transactions in Q2, and one has a company positioning itself at every intersection of digital money.\nMeanwhile, management lifted full-year gross profit guidance to $10.17 billion, implying 14% YOY growth, and forecast a healthy 20% adjusted operating margin. Q3 guidance looks solid, too, with gross profit growth pegged at 16%.\nBut it’s not all smooth sailing. Q3 adjusted operating margins are expected to dip temporarily to 18% as Borrow scales, and rising processing costs will squeeze Square’s near-term profitability. Cash App’s user growth has also plateaued, forcing Block to double down on density and acquisition strategies. And expanding lending inevitably raises exposure to credit risk, even with its proprietary scoring model keeping losses under 3%.\nAnalysts covering Block predict a 54% annual decline in Q3 EPS to $0.26. Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, the bottom line is anticipated to be $1.03 per share, down 69% YOY. Still, that could rebound by 105% annually to $2.12 per share in fiscal 2026.\nBlock’s Big Bet on Mining Efficiency\nAs Bitcoin prices climb, efficiency in mining becomes even more critical, and that’s exactly where Block’s new tools come in. The Proto Rig is a modular mining machine that lets operators swap out individual hashboards instead of scrapping entire units. This shift transforms mining rigs from short-lived, three-to-five-year assets into decade-long infrastructure, slashing upgrade costs by 15% to 20% each cycle.\nMeanwhile, the Proto Fleet software unifies multiple management functions that miners previously juggled across different programs, streamlining operations, improving uptime, and cutting troubleshooting headaches.\nTogether, these innovations address mining’s biggest pain points — high costs, downtime, and inefficient hardware. For Block, this is not just a product launch. It is a strategic play to capture market share as institutional adoption drives Bitcoin’s value higher. By making mining more sustainable and profitable, Block is positioning itself to ride the crypto boom while reinforcing its broader mission of expanding access to the digital economy.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Block Stock?\nInvestor sentiment has been highly active around XYZ stock following the company's Q2 results, with analysts offering significant commentary on its performance. Mizuho lifted its price target to $88 from $71 and maintained an “Outperform” rating. The firm sees Square’s point-of-sale volumes surging, especially in the $500,000 cohort, calling Square the “comeback kid of 2025.”\nArgus joined the optimism and wasn’t far behind, boosting its target to $84 from $59, crediting strong momentum in restaurants and retail, plus margin expansion, and saying the S&P 500 inclusion only sweetens the deal.\nJefferies took a slightly cooler stance on XYZ stock, trimming its target to $90 from $95 while sticking with a “Buy\" rating. The firm likes Square’s U.S. growth trajectory but flagged Cash App’s growing reliance on lending as a concern. Overall, the Street sees Block making a real comeback story with Square, but the jury is still out on whether Cash App’s lending push fuels growth or risk.\nXYZ stock has an overall “Moderate Buy” rating. Among the 43 analysts covering shares, 26 recommend a “Strong Buy,” four analysts advise a “Moderate Buy,” eight stay on the sidelines with a “Hold” rating, and five analysts have a “Strong Sell.\"\nBlock’s mean price target of $82.39 hints at 12% upside potential from here. The Street-high target of $105 implies that XYZ stock could rally as much as 43%.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

They introduce new companies to public trading and provide investors with fresh opportunities. Because IPO activity is closely tied to broader economic conditions, it serves as a useful barometer of market health. With that in mind, let’s look at what 2025 has brought to the IPO landscape.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nLooking at the raw numbers, IPOs are up this year. For the first half of 2025, we’ve seen 109 new public offerings, compared to 81 in the first half last year. At the same time, those offerings have raised $17.1 billion, a drop of $1.7 billion compared to last year. Tech companies are leading the pack in IPOs right now; they make up slightly more than one-third of the total new offerings and about half of the total proceeds. The financial services sector ranks second in both categories. Overall, new stocks are entering the market from a wide range of business sectors.\nThis is sure to pick up interest from the Street’s analysts, and as usual, the stock pros are coming through. The analysts at Swiss banking giant UBS have taken a look at two new IPO stocks – and they have come down to a firm recommendation on which one is the superior stock to buy. We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to get a look at the broader Wall Street view of each. Here’s a closer look at them, and at the UBS comments.\nNIQ Global Intelligence(NIQ)\nThe first new IPO stock we’ll look at, NIQ Global Intelligence, is a Chicago-based consumer intelligence company that is a leader in the related fields of market research and consumer insights. The company boasts that it delivers the ‘Full View,’ that is, the most comprehensive consumer insights available. NIQ focuses on understanding consumer buying behavior and on revealing new pathways to expand positive trends. The company makes use of advanced analytics and state-of-the-art platforms to put together a comprehensive data resource.\nThat broad reach shows up in the numbers. NIQ’s intelligence spans more than 90 countries, covering some 85% of the world’s total population and accounting for over $7.2 trillion in consumer spending. Each week, the company processes 3.1 trillion data records. Importantly, NIQ doesn’t just collect data, it packages it into actionable insights. Some 23,000 client companies, including most of the Fortune 100, rely on NIQ’s services to sharpen their understanding of customers and markets.\nTo further strengthen its position, NIQ has pursued acquisitions as a way to broaden its capabilities. Most recently, it announced the purchase of Mtrix, a Brazilian software company that specializes in visibility for indirect distribution supply chains. This deal highlights NIQ’s push into Latin America, signaling management’s intent to diversify both its customer base and its geographic exposure.\nThese expansions feed directly into NIQ’s product suite. Beyond gathering and analyzing data, the company provides enterprise clients with tools that translate insights into strategy, helping businesses track market shifts, anticipate consumer behavior, and refine branding.\nAll of this set the stage for NIQ’s IPO on July 23. The company priced shares at $21 and raised $1.05 billion by selling 50 million shares. Trading since then has been choppy, with shares slipping to $16.94, leaving NIQ with a market cap of $5.15 billion about a month after the debut.\nInvestors also got their first look at NIQ’s post-IPO financials when the company reported 2Q25 earnings on August 14. Revenue came in at $1.04 billion, up 5.6% year-over-year, though the bottom line showed a GAAP EPS of -$0.14.\nThis stock has caught the eye of UBS analyst Kevin McVeigh, who notes the strength of the company’s product offering as a chief advantage.\n“We believe NIQ offerings are crucial to clients’ understanding of what\/when\/how much consumers are buying with its Intelligence solution [~80% revenue], while also providing a comprehensive view of why consumers are buying a product with Activation solution [~20% revenue]. Amid highly recurring revenue – Intelligence 2024 97% gross retention + 104% net retention – we model ~5% organic constant currency revenue 2024-27E CAGR… With the stock trading at $17.40, the market implied 2027 adj. EBITDA is ~$0.9b vs. UBSe of ~$1.1b, making us believe that the market is not capturing the impact of revenue growth and\/or efficiencies,“ McVeigh opined.\nOn that basis, McVeigh assigns NIQ with a Buy rating and a $24 price target, implying ~42% upside over the next year. (To watch McVeigh’s track record, click here)\nIt’s clear from the consensus rating, a Strong Buy based on 10 Buys and 2 Holds, that Wall Street generally agrees with McVeigh’s bullish view on this one. The $22.88 average price target suggests a potential gain of 35% for the year ahead. (See NIQ stock forecast)\nMcGraw Hill(MH)\nFrom tech-based consumer research, we’ll switch over to a more traditional mode of information dissemination – textbook publishing. While it may not draw headlines the way cutting-edge analytics do, textbook publishing is still a multi-billion-dollar industry with deep connections to schools, universities, and training programs. And in this specialized world, McGraw Hill has stood out as a leading player for more than a century.\nThe company was founded in 1888, and today produces textbooks and other educational materials for everything from grades pre-K through 12 to trade schools to colleges and universities to professional training entities. McGraw Hill has a global footprint and has marketing, sales, and distribution operations in over 100 countries, with textbooks and materials published in more than 80 languages. If you have kids in school, at any level, there is a strong chance that they are using, or have used, a textbook published by McGraw Hill.\nThe company, once publicly traded under the ticker MHP, was taken private in a $2.5 billion Apollo Global Management deal in 2012 – only to return to the markets in July with a high-profile IPO. The debut wasn’t smooth: shares opened at $17, below the targeted $19–$22 range, raising $414 million. Since then, they’ve slipped another 14%, leaving McGraw Hill with a market cap of $2.79 billion.\nThe company’s first earnings report as a public entity offered some early context. Covering the last quarter before the IPO, fiscal 1Q26 showed $535.7 million in revenue, up 2.4% year over year, and a swing to modest profitability from a prior loss.\nThose results provided a baseline, but UBS analyst Joshua Chan remains cautious, noting that McGraw Hill operates in a highly competitive industry where even a market leader can struggle to expand gains.\n“In order to deliver targeted 5%+ revenue growth over time, we think share gains and execution are needed in this tougher market which has some demographic\/policy headwinds and where substitution\/AI remain lingering questions. Some evidence of share gains is seen in recent years, which is encouraging. But with growth being inherently lumpy (K-12 adoptions), F2026 being a down year, and the company being a newly-public entity, we think near-term risk\/reward is balanced,“ Chan opined.\nOther analysts, however, are more optimistic. Since the IPO, McGraw Hill has drawn 12 ratings, with 11 of them recommending Buy. That consensus gives the stock a Strong Buy rating, with an average price target of $20.18 – a projected 38% gain from current levels. (See MH stock forecast)\nHaving laid out the facts, it’s clear that the UBS analysts see NIQ as the superior stock to buy for investors interested in the latest IPOs.\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

Two-year Treasury yields have also matched their highest level since August 1 as some Fed officials - including Cleveland Fed boss Beth Hammack, Atlanta's Raphael Bostic and Kansas City's Jeffrey Schmid – expressed doubts about the wisdom of a September cut, with inflation still well above target and business surveys showing renewed vigour in the U.S economy.\nU.S. stock futures steadied early Friday but only after this week’s tech stock wobble resulted in five straight daily loss in the S&P 500. The dollar notched its best level in about 10 days, with the yen at its weakest since August 1 on softer Japanese inflation data.\n* Powell's Jackson Hole speech is typically a scene-setter for Fed policy over the year ahead and is expected to touch on changes to the average inflation targeting strategy as well as defending Fed independence - something in the spotlight again this week after administration demands for board member Lisa Cook to resign over alleged mortgage fraud. With minutes from the latest meeting and the latest Fed speeches showing no consensus on an urgent shift of stance, Powell is unlikely to signal a resumption of easing just yet - with no cast-iron case emerging from the latest sweep of economic data.\n* Chinese stocks appear to be on a roll, with the Shanghai benchmark reclaiming 3,800 for the first time in a decade on domestic tech excitement. Tokyo's Nikkei was flat and the yen weaker on the inflation update there, but political paralysis in Japan is putting pressure on the bond market, with 10-year bond yields hitting the highest since 2008 and 30-year yields rising further to all-time peaks. With persistent calls for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to step down after recent elections, things could come to a head next week when the ruling Liberal Democratic Party releases a report on reasons for the poor poll.\n* Even as last weekend's excitement about a Ukraine peace deal has gone cold and Germany's second-quarter GDP was revised lower, European stocks were firmer on Friday - with some optimism about details of the U.S.-EU framework trade agreement released on Thursday and what it means for auto and pharma stocks. But Poland's WIG index posted its biggest decline in more than four months, falling 2.9% after the government proposed a hike to corporate income tax.\nToday's Market Minute\n* Investors are bracing for volatility as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell walks a fine line between curbing inflation and supporting the labor market, with thin August trading poised to magnify any market moves from his Jackson Hole speech on Friday.\n* Vladimir Putin is demanding that Ukraine give up all of the eastern Donbas region, renounce ambitions to join NATO, remain neutral and keep Western troops out of the country, three sources familiar with top-level Kremlin thinking told Reuters.\n* The Trump administration is considering a plan to reallocate at least $2 billion from the CHIPS Act to fund critical minerals projects and boost Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's influence over the strategic sector, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n* Is the U.S. economic outlook so weak that it warrants multiple interest rate cuts? Or are U.S. markets pulling in huge inflows from abroad because the country's outlook is so attractive?

Among the most pressing challenges US banks face today is a dramatic rise in fraud during online account openings. While digital banking enables faster, more convenient customer onboarding, it has also opened the door to even more sophisticated attacks—driven primarily by artificial intelligence (AI). Cybercriminals are now exploiting generative AI, deepfakes, and social engineering tools to bypass traditional verification systems, leaving financial institutions scrambling to secure their front doors.\nAccording to 2024 data, identity fraud cost US consumers a staggering $47bn, up $4bn from 2023, with synthetic identity fraud as one of the fastest-growing threats. While this figure reflects identity fraud across all sectors and not banking specifically, it underscores the broader landscape in which synthetic identity fraud—one of the fastest-growing threats—has become a pressing concern for financial institutions. As US banks push for more seamless digital experiences, they must also adapt to this evolving fraud landscape or risk losing customer trust, financial stability, and regulatory compliance.\nUnlike traditional fraud tactics, AI-powered schemes operate with alarming realism and scale. Fraudsters today are using generative AI tools to craft synthetic identities—combinations of real and fictitious personal data that mimic legitimate applicants. These identities often evade detection by outdated verification systems reliant on static data points like social security numbers or past addresses.\nEqually concerning is the ongoing rise of deepfake technology. In 2024, there was a reported 1,300% increase in deepfake attacks compared to the previous year, with bad actors using AI-generated video and voice impersonations to bypass remote onboarding systems. These techniques allow fraudsters to simulate live video calls, fool identity checks, and even deceive customer service agents or facial recognition systems.\nAnother emerging trend involves injection attacks, where hackers infiltrate mobile banking or onboarding apps and feed fraudulent images or video into the identity verification process. These attacks are particularly dangerous when criminals gain access to an app’s camera interface and override it with pre-recorded or manipulated footage. Unlike traditional deepfakes, injection attacks can bypass even advanced liveness detection and biometric verification systems, making them a growing concern for mobile-first financial services.\nAI-powered phishing bots and advanced social engineering tactics are also being used to gather information or directly manipulate customers into disclosing sensitive credentials. Once an account is fraudulently opened, instant payment platforms allow criminals to quickly move funds, often before banks have any chance to flag or halt the transactions.\nBut the threat doesn’t stop there. Evolving malware such as “banking trojans” and “keyloggers” are targeting online applications and capturing credentials mid-process. The increasing use of digital wallets has further expanded the attack surface for financial institutions.\nThese developments are occurring in tandem with rising supply chain risks. Many banks rely on third-party vendors for identity verification, document processing, or onboarding services—often without full visibility into those vendors' cybersecurity measures. This creates additional blind spots where attackers can slip through.\nTo counteract these trends, US banks must look to international examples where stronger identity frameworks have helped reduce fraud. In regions like the EU and parts of Asia, financial institutions and governments have implemented digital identity ecosystems anchored in biometrics, eIDs, and real-time document authentication. Countries like India, for instance, have successfully embedded digital identity verification into public and private sector services, which has curtailed fraud and built citizen trust in online platforms.\nBiometric authentication—including facial recognition, fingerprint scans, and voice analysis—adds a dynamic layer of verification that is difficult for even AI to replicate convincingly. Combined with liveness detection (which ensures that a human, not a spoofed video or image, is present), this technology can block deepfake and synthetic identity attacks at the point of onboarding.\nEqually important is real-time document authentication. This involves verifying government-issued IDs against live camera feeds and secure databases, using forensic analysis to flag signs of forgery. When integrated with biometric systems, document checks provide a multi-factor authentication framework that drastically reduces fraud risk.\nFor financial institutions, this means investing in identity solutions that are interoperable across both digital and in-person channels. A customer who opens an account online should be subject to the same level of scrutiny as one who walks into a branch. Unifying these systems not only improves security but also helps banks deliver consistent and trusted customer experiences.\nCompliance is another key driver of security investment. Regulatory bodies are placing increasing emphasis on Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, customer due diligence, and fraud prevention. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and EU’s AML Regulation are examples of frameworks pushing banks to modernise their onboarding and verification systems. Rather than view compliance as a constraint, forward-looking institutions see it as a roadmap for digital change.\nThe cost of fraud goes far beyond monetary loss, as it erodes customer confidence. In a time when consumers expect seamless and secure experiences, a single data breach or wave of fraudulent account activity can permanently damage a brand’s reputation. According to industry data, 90% of consumers say security is their top priority when opening a bank account online, surpassing convenience and speed.\nTo reassure customers and regulators alike, US banks must take proactive steps. Investing in next-generation identity verification platforms is a significant piece. These systems must be capable of detecting not only known fraud patterns, but also subtle anomalies that indicate emerging threats.\nEducation is also important—both for customers and employees. Customers should be informed about new authentication measures, how their data is protected, and how they can report suspicious activity. Employees, especially those in customer service and onboarding roles, must be trained to recognise deepfakes, manipulated documents, and social engineering tactics.\nUltimately, the key to combating banking fraud lies in building layered, adaptive security—integrating real-time identity verification, biometrics, behavioural analysis, and threat intelligence into a unified platform. This approach not only meets evolving regulatory demands but also positions banks to scale digital operations without sacrificing trust.\nEdgar Salib is the Global Vice President of Veridos America, a joint venture between Giesecke+Devrient and Bundesdruckerei\n\"Why banks are struggling against AI-driven fraud for online bank account openings\" was originally created and published by Retail Banker International, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

His background spans firms of varying sizes and scales, from global tier 1 banks to early-stage start-ups. He currently serves as the Regional Director for Binance in the UK.\nYou’ve had a career spanning tier 1 banks, the FCA, Rain, and now Binance. What first drew you into the crypto space?\nI was drawn to crypto by its potential to fundamentally change how value is created, transferred, and accessed globally.\nMy experience in banking, regulation, and fintech showed me how financial systems evolve, and crypto felt like the next phase in that evolution. It blends technological innovation with the promise of open, borderless markets.\nThe opportunity to help shape infrastructure that is secure, compliant, and built from the ground up was compelling, and that intersection of innovation and responsibility continues to motivate me.\nWhich role taught you the most about the delicate balance between innovation and regulatory compliance?\nAcross my career, I’ve come to see innovation and compliance not as opposing forces but as complementary. My time in regulatory bodies gave me a strong understanding of the principles behind policy, while industry roles have shown me how those principles can be applied to real products.\nThe most sustainable approach is to build with regulation in mind from the start, protecting users and supporting market trust. This requires constant engagement between innovators and regulators, which aligns with Binance’s philosophy.\nHow significant is the UK’s clarification on staking for the country’s crypto market?\nThe UK’s clarification that staking is not a collective investment scheme is an important milestone.\nIt reopens access to products for qualifying professional users and signals a balanced regulatory stance that values innovation while protecting consumers.\nWith 12% of UK adults having owned crypto, this development could encourage institutional capital and strengthen the UK’s position among markets advancing adoption through clear regulation.\nFor professional investors, it provides the regulatory clarity and infrastructure needed to re-enter the market with confidence.\nHow has the FCA’s view on crypto changed since you helped draft early AML\/CTF standards?\nThere’s been a noticeable global shift from focusing solely on risks and enforcement to recognising crypto’s potential within a supervised framework.\nWhen AML\/CTF rules were first applied to the sector, the priority was rightly on addressing financial crime in a new and fast-moving space. Those protections are still essential, but there’s now more emphasis on enabling responsible innovation.\nCountries are developing tailored frameworks, engaging more deeply with the industry, and acknowledging that crypto, if built on strong compliance, can support the broader financial system.\nHow does the UK’s approach differ from other major jurisdictions Binance operates in?\nIt’s difficult to make direct comparisons because each jurisdiction’s approach is shaped by local legal and policy considerations.\nThe best frameworks are those that reflect domestic priorities while allowing global participation.\nIn the UK, as elsewhere, we support a model that enables growth without compromising user protection. The focus on both innovation and compliance is central to building lasting trust in the digital asset industry.\nHow are Earn products for professional users tailored differently from those for retail?\nFor qualifying professionals, Earn products are designed with scale, complexity, and compliance in mind. In the UK, access is restricted to professionals only, enabling them to use products like Liquid Staking, On-Chain Yields, and Crypto Loans within a regulatory framework.\nThese offerings are built to fit into institutional strategies and offer liquidity, competitive yields, and governance opportunities, all underpinned by Binance’s infrastructure.\nWhich Binance Earn products are most popular among the UK’s professional investors today?\nWe’re seeing strong demand for our liquid staking products, particularly WBETH and BNSOL.\nWBETH now represents 20% of the global market with more than $9 billion in value, and BNSOL is the second-largest SOL liquid staking token with about $1 billion in total value locked.\nThese products are integrated across Binance’s ecosystem and offer yields, liquidity, and governance capabilities, all within a compliant structure. For UK professionals, they serve as institutional-grade tools that align with broader market strategies.\nWith various yield options available, how do you help clients choose based on risk and strategy?\nAs an exchange, we don’t provide financial advice.\nWhat we do is offer a broad range of products that meet diverse risk profiles and strategies, from flexible and fixed terms to staking and loan-based options.\nClients assess what works for their portfolios, and we focus on making our offerings competitive, accessible, and aligned with user needs.\nWhat’s driving WBETH and BNSOL’s rapid growth, and how are you expanding their utility?\nTheir growth mirrors the strength of the Ethereum and Solana ecosystems. They simplify access to staking rewards by removing the need to run validator nodes, while allowing users to maintain liquidity and exposure.\nBeyond their yield, we’re expanding their use across Binance and the wider DeFi space through protocol integrations, platform support, and partnerships that broaden their use cases.\nIn a crowded staking and yield market, what is Binance focusing on next?\nOur priority is user-focused innovation that enhances flexibility, security, and accessibility. We expect the next wave of products to include more personalised and adaptive yield strategies, such as varied lock-up terms, multi-asset options, and integrations with DeFi for hybrid yields.\nWith Earn access now extended to professionals, what are Binance’s next steps in the UK?\nWe’re focusing on re-engaging UK professionals through targeted outreach and tailored product offerings.\nThis includes liquid staking solutions like WBETH and BNSOL, as well as structured yield tools that fit into institutional strategies.\nWe’re also working directly with family offices, high-net-worth clients, and institutions to provide secure, compliant access to advanced investment tools. These efforts answer a growing demand for sophisticated products in a regulated environment.\nWhat are your top UK priorities over the next year, and how do you see the UK’s crypto scene evolving?\nGlobally, crypto is at a critical juncture, with institutional uptake, clearer regulation, and real-world use cases all progressing in tandem. Developments like the CLARITY Act and Bitcoin ETF flows in the US show the sector maturing, with focus shifting from speculation to application.\nIn the UK, our goal is to be the leading digital asset platform. With regulatory momentum from the FSMA changes and recent FCA guidance, we expect increased institutional involvement.\nWe plan to expand access to institutional-grade products within the existing framework and continue investing in compliance talent and systems. With permissions in over 21 jurisdictions, we’re one of the most regulated exchanges globally.\nThe UK is likely to see closer ties between traditional finance and crypto, and more emphasis on compliant innovation, a direction we are actively supporting.","content_hash":"033a90b63e3cb80036945f76edc78298","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7527,"method_rank":0}

But the smartest ones know better. They use it as a control point. Because the rate con doesn’t just say where a load goes—it outlines how your money moves. It’s the one document that touches your driver, your dispatch, your accounting, your customer, and your broker. It’s your contract. And if you don’t walk your driver through it—every single time—you’re leaving profit, clarity, and control on the table. This playsheet breaks down exactly how to build a five-minute, simple walkthrough system that protects your revenue, cuts confusion, and keeps you moving clean.\nIn a business where seconds matter and paperwork piles up, it’s tempting to treat the rate con like just another piece of admin work. But here’s what happens when you don’t review it clearly with your driver:\n-\nThey miss pickup windows because the wrong time was assumed.\n-\nDetention doesn’t get paid because proof wasn’t collected.\n-\nLumper fees get advanced but not reimbursed because instructions were skipped.\n-\nClaims get denied because a single instruction was missed.\nNone of these are driver problems. They’re leadership problems. Every one of these issues is preventable—if the expectations are clearly communicated before wheels move.\nTakeaway: If you don’t walk the driver through the rate con, you’re not leading—you’re gambling.\nWhether you’re the dispatcher, the fleet owner, or the one behind the wheel, the answer is the same: the person who controls the rate con owns the walkthrough.\nIf that’s you, it’s your job to make sure your team knows:\nAnd you don’t do that with a quick “You good?” over the phone. You do it with a repeatable, five-minute conversation that runs the same way every time. Think of it like a pre-trip inspection for your back office.\nThis process works whether you’ve got one truck or ten. It doesn’t take long. But it does take discipline. Here’s what your walkthrough must include:\nStart with the basics—but verify everything.\n-\nPickup and drop-off addresses\n-\nAppointment windows or FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)\n-\nCompany names (sometimes different from shipper\/receiver)\n-\nContact phone numbers for check-in\nExecution Tip: Cross-check city and ZIP code. Brokers frequently copy\/paste wrong info. Don’t send a driver 40 miles off track because nobody checked.\nDrivers must know what they’re hauling before they show up. This prevents refusals, trailer issues, and missed instructions.\n-\nLoad weight\n-\nType of freight (dry, reefer, flatbed, hazmat, etc.)\n-\nPallet count\n-\nTemperature requirements (if applicable)\n-\nLive load vs. drop and hook\n-\nDriver assist expectations\nExecution Tip: If the rate con says “driver assist” and your driver isn’t informed or equipped, that’s a liability. Confirm and agree before dispatch.\nMoney clarity avoids phone calls, resentment, and missed pay. Break it down line by line.\n-\nLinehaul pay\n-\nFuel surcharge\n-\nAccessorials: detention, layover, TONU, assist\n-\nAdvances (note if issued, pending, or rejected)\nExecution Tip: Explain accessorials as conditional pay. “You don’t just get $150 for detention—it activates only after X, and with Y proof.”\nEven if your driver isn’t asking, walk them through it.\nLet them see the math:\nGross Pay ÷ Miles = RPM\nExample:\n“This is 720 loaded miles at $2,185. That’s $3.03 a mile before fuel. This is a margin load, so timing and paperwork matter.”\nExecution Tip: Drivers who understand margin take ownership. They’re less likely to miss appointments or fumble PODs because they know their performance protects profit.\nThis is where most carriers lose money—not because detention didn’t happen, but because nobody followed the rules to claim it.\nLayover rules (written approval? flat fee?)\nExecution Tip: Print or preload a detention log sheet in the truck. Don’t leave it up to memory. If the shipper signs nothing, your claim has nothing.\nSome drivers miss these because they’re in tiny text blocks buried at the bottom. That’s not an excuse—it’s a leadership check.\n“Driver must call within 1 hour of pickup”\n“Must use specific lumper service”\n“No partial deliveries allowed”\n“Carrier waives detention without prior written approval”\n“POD must include consignee signature and trailer number”\nExecution Tip: Highlight these in advance, especially if you use a TMS or PDF markup tool. Pre-mark them before dispatch.\nDon’t leave invoicing delays to chance. Confirm:\n-\nWhat POD or BOL documents are required\n-\nWhether they must be scanned, uploaded, or emailed\n-\nDeadline to submit\n-\nContact person for invoicing questions\n-\nWho signs, where, and how\nExecution Tip: If the broker requires paperwork before delivery (e.g., signed rate con, W9, insurance), make sure it’s already submitted and logged. Don’t wait until Friday at 4:45 p.m.\nIf it’s not written down, it’s not a process. Here’s how to make this walkthrough part of your everyday system:\n-\nAttach a Walkthrough Checklist\nUse a simple seven-point list like the one above and attach it to every dispatch order—paper or digital.\n-\nTrain Drivers to Expect the Conversation\nMake it part of your dispatch rhythm. Every load gets a walkthrough, no matter how short or familiar. You’re setting a standard.\n-\nUse a Shared Log\nWhether it’s a shared Google Sheet or a checkbox in your TMS, track that the walkthrough happened. Timestamp it. Add a note if anything needed clarification.\n-\nReview Weekly\nCheck which loads had missed accessorials, POD issues, or missed appointments. Trace it back—was the walkthrough done? If not, adjust.\n-\nKeep It Tight\nThis isn’t a 30-minute meeting. It’s a structured, no-fluff five-minute briefing. Respect your driver’s time—but don’t skip the process.\nLet’s break this down by loss category:\n-\nFinancial Loss: Missed accessorials can eat 20–40% of a load’s profit.\n-\nReputation Damage: One missed pickup can cost you a lane—or a customer.\n-\nDriver Frustration: Repeated surprises lead to turnover and mistrust.\n-\nCompliance Risk: Failure to meet contract terms opens the door for disputes or claims.\nIf you’re not reviewing rate confirmations clearly, these aren’t occasional risks—they’re guaranteed outcomes.\nHighlighter Takeaway: Every dollar lost to avoidable confusion is a system failure. Not a one-time mistake.\nThis isn’t about being a micromanager. It’s about being a professional.\nIf your driver doesn’t understand the load they’re running, the timeline they’re expected to hit, or the conditions under which you’ll get paid, then you’ve already lost control of the load before it begins. A rate confirmation is your playbook. Your job is to make sure everyone on the field knows it—before kickoff.\nThe best fleets—regardless of size—don’t run on hope. They run on process. They win because their drivers are prepared, their back office is synced, and their systems are consistent. The five-minute walkthrough isn’t optional. It’s fundamental.\nIt prevents the rework, the finger-pointing, and the missed pay. It turns “I didn’t know” into “Got it—on it.” It moves you from chaos to control.\nWalk the rate con. Every time. No exceptions.\nThe post How to Walk a Driver Through a Rate Confirmation the Right Way appeared first on FreightWaves.","content_hash":"ac8960a2bea2a38449cd2f0bc66bc109","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7237,"method_rank":0}

This meeting has since led to the possibility that the US may take an ownership stake in Intel (INTC) , an idea that's sparked concerns that US investments may translate into corporate favoritism.\nThis week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a former hedge fund manager who trained under legendary stock picker Stanley Druckenmiller, pushed back on those worries.\nTreasury Secretary Bessent defends US investment in Intel\nPresident Trump has previously discussed the potential for the US to create a sovereign wealth fund to profit from US business investments similar to those of other countries, including Saudi Arabia.\nHe's already created a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile funded by seized or forfeited cryptocurrency.\nThe idea has drawn praise for its potential to provide a return on government dollars given to companies via grants, and concern over whether it could create an unlevel playing field for rivals.\nSecretary Bessent attempted to alleviate some of those concerns in a CNBC interview on August 19.\n\"The last thing we are going to try and do is take a stake and then try to drum up business,\" said Bessent. \"There is no talk of trying to force companies to buy from Intel.\"\nBessent argued that providing financial stability to Intel, and perhaps other companies in the future, is a matter of national security.\nIn recent years, the US government has paid significant attention to the high-tech industry over the risks associated with selling next-gen technology to countries, including China, which could potentially use that technology against us.\nFor instance, earlier this year, Nvidia and AMD faced additional restrictions limiting the sale of artificial intelligence chips to China, resulting in steep write-offs. Last month, those semiconductor companies agreed to share 15% of their China revenue on those chips with the U.S. in exchange for new export licenses.\n\"99% of the advanced chips in the world are made in Taiwan,\" said Bessent. \"For national security, we have to stop that single point of failure.\"\nCommerce Secretary is all-in on an Intel stake\nThe seeds for an investment in Intel were planted by the Biden Administration's $52.7 billion CHIPS and Science Act in 2022, legislation designed to provide grants to semiconductor manufacturers to build \"fabs,\" large semiconductor manufacturing plants, on US soil.\nIntel was the largest recipient of CHIPS Act grants, receiving $7.9 billion. When those funds were awarded in November 2024, the White House said they would \"directly support Intel’s expected U.S. investment of nearly $90 billion by the end of the decade\" and that \"The Department will disburse the funds based on Intel’s completion of project milestones.\"\nIntel's progress toward boosting US manufacturing has slowed amid mounting losses and Tan's pivot toward cost-cutting, including layoffs.\n\"We need to make our own chips here,\" said Lutnick on CNBC. \"Why are we giving a company worth $100 billion this kind of money? What is in it for the American taxpayer? The answer Donald Trump has is we should get an equity stake for our money.\"\nLutnick is the US Commerce Secretary and a former Wall Street veteran who was CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. The White House has confirmed that Lutnick is negotiating with Intel on an equity stake, according to Reuters.\nThe mechanics of such a deal aren't fully fleshed out, given that the CHIPS Act doesn't require companies to provide equity to receive grants.\nNevertheless, the White House is committed to pursuing this approach, possibly expecting that companies will decide the upside of US ownership outweighs any risks.\n\"Instead of just giving grants away, we should get benefits,\" said Lutnick.\nWhat's next for Intel amid losses?\nI remember when Intel was one of the stock market's hottest stocks during the Internet boom. However, over the years, Intel has lost luster to smaller, faster-moving rivals like Nvidia, which has turned a niche of making super-fast graphic processors for gaming into the most coveted chips used to train and operate AI chatbots and agentic AI apps.\nIntel's annual revenue over the past five years has sharply declined:\n2020: $77.9 billion.\n2021: $79 billion.\n2022: $63 billion.\n2023: $54.2 billion.\n2024: $53.1 billion.\nNvidia's annual revenue over the past five years has skyrocketed:\n2020: $10.9 billion.\n2021: $16.7 billion.\n2022: $26.9 billion.\n2023: $27 billion.\n2024: $60.9 billion.\n\"Nvidia has blown Intel away in creating a market for AI-capable processors while Advanced Micro Devices has stolen Intel's lunch in the PC and gaming markets,\" wrote veteran analyst Stephen Guilfoyle on TheStreet Pro. \"Making matters worse, Intel's foundry business has struggled to make inroads in a market dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor.\"\nLast quarter, Intel's sales were flat, while Nvidia's grew 69% year over year. Intel lost 10 cents per share in the second quarter, while Nvidia made 81 cents per share, up 33% from one year ago.\nCatching up to Nvidia won't be easy, given that Nvidia commands roughly a 90% share in the AI chip market, even if it gets an influx of government cash.\nHowever, that doesn't mean Intel can't continue to win business providing silicon for other uses, such as industrial or consumer technology, like desktops and laptops, or that it can't win in supplying CPUs that help AI work more efficiently. For instance, its Xeon 6776P processor is the host CPU for NVIDIA's high-end DGX B300 server for AI workloads.\nIt also doesn't mean that Intel's renewed cost-consciousness won't translate into stock-friendly earnings growth.\n\"We are also taking the actions needed to build a more financially disciplined foundry,\" said Tan in Intel's second-quarter earnings release.\"\nWall Street's average estimate is for earnings per share to rise to 66 cents per share in 2026 from 12 cents in 2025 and revenue to reach $53.8 billion, up from $52.01 billion.\n\"Intel needs to crack the $27 level to break out of a long flat base that stretches back to early August 2024,\" wrote Guilfoyle. \"My target price for the stock should the federal government and Softbank take on sizable equity stakes is $33. I am long these shares.\"\nStill, Intel's stock is already up 26% this year, suggesting that at least some of this optimism is currently priced into its stock.\nAccording to TipRanks, only one Wall Street analyst rates it a \"buy\", 26 rate it a \"hold,\" and 3 rate it a \"sell.\" Hardly a resounding vote of confidence.","content_hash":"996b0cfa953d62bd140db23e6731237c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7134,"method_rank":0}

These disclosures detail the stocks that Wall Street's \"smart money\" has been buying and selling -- giving investors a rare window into where professional money managers see opportunity.\nFew names in the investing world command more attention than Warren Buffett, whose leadership at Berkshire Hathaway has transformed it into one of the most respected and consistently market-beating portfolios of the modern era.\nAccording to its most recent 13F filing, Berkshire recently initiated a position in UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH) during the second quarter. The move comes at a time when UnitedHealth stock has been under heavy selling pressure -- weighed down by a string of negative headlines that have driven the stock 40% lower as of Aug. 18.\nLet's unpack why Berkshire's bet on UnitedHealth aligns squarely with Buffett's investment philosophy, and explore whether now is a good time to follow the Oracle of Omaha's lead.\n1. UnitedHealth fits squarely into one of Buffett's favorite industries\nOne of Buffett's favorite sectors has long been financial services, especially insurance companies. Berkshire's portfolio includes insurance giants like GEICO and Chubb, underscoring his conviction in the industry.\nHealth insurers share many of the underlying business characteristics that make insurance such an attractive industry to Buffett. They provide mission-critical services while also collecting billions in premiums up front, long before claims are paid out. This structure gives insurers a unique combination of financial stability and durability, qualities that Buffett prizes.\n2. Buffett loves moats\nSome of Berkshire's largest holdings include Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, Moody's, and Visa. While these companies span different industries, they share a common thread: massive brand equity that makes them difficult to dislodge.\nBuffett has always favored businesses with durable economic moats. In the health insurance space, the idea of a moat is reinforced by and industry dominated by just a few major players -- with UnitedHealth being the largest among them.\nRight now, however, UnitedHealth's brand moat shows some small cracks in the armor, creating what Buffett likely views as a rare opportunity to invest in an industry leader while sentiment remains sour.\nRecurring insurance premiums paired with strong brand equity translates into powerful unit economics -- notably in the form of consistent free cash flow generation.\nFor UnitedHealth, its vertically integrated model -- spanning insurance, healthcare services, and data analytics -- enables the company to produce tens of billions in annual cash flow.\nThis fits neatly into Buffett's preference of favoring businesses with steady, predictable cash flow. Despite some recent hiccups, management has signaled confidence that growth will resume by next year -- suggesting even stronger cash flow and profitability metrics could arrive sooner than many anticipate.\n4. UnitedHealth Group literally pays you to own the stock\nOne way UnitedHealth puts its excess cash to work is by paying -- and steadily growing -- its dividend payment. This is a feature that Buffett undoubtedly appreciates. Known for his unwavering patience, Buffett often holds on to core positions for years, if not decades.\nOver time, that discipline has transformed some of Berkshire's greatest growth bets into reliable income streams -- with dividends serving as a reward for simply staying the course, even during periods of pronounced volatility.\n5. The company is buying back shares, and...\nAnother way UnitedHealth is delivering value to shareholders is through consistent stock buybacks. Companies often buy back their own stock as a signal that management thinks shares are undervalued.\nTo put this into perspective, it's worth examining what UnitedHealth insiders have doing with their own shares -- a telling indicator of how those closest to the business view its long-term potential.\n6. ... so are insiders; what could this suggest?\nAccording to SEC filings, several insiders at UnitedHealth -- including CEO Stephen Hemsley -- have collectively purchased roughly $30 million of stock in recent months, right in the middle of the sell-off.\nWhen combined with the company's aggressive share buybacks, this insider activity sends a clear message: Management is confident in UnitedHealth's ability to engineer a turnaround and views the stock as a bargain right now.\n7. UnitedHealth Group stock is dirt cheap\nThe chart benchmarks UnitedHealth Group against a set of managed care and insurance peers based on the price-to-earnings (P\/E) multiple.\nAt just 13x earnings, UnitedHealth sits squarely in the middle of this cohort. On its own, that doesn't reveal much. But zooming out, the picture becomes more clear: After months of valuation compression, UnitedHealth stock is now trading near five-year lows.\nThis suggests that investors are pricing UnitedHealth as a low-growth (or even no-growth), high-risk opportunity rather than the industry leader it truly is -- one that would typically command a premium.\nAgainst this backdrop, Buffett's move makes perfect sense. He likely sees glaring misalignment between perceived risk and actual risk -- most of which is already reflected in the price.\nUnitedHealth remains a fundamentally strong business that has undergone a historic valuation derate. In Buffett's eyes, that looks less like trouble and more like an opportunity. Put simply, buying UnitedHealth stock at this moment is classic Buffett value investing.\nFor these reasons, I think now is a lucrative opportunity to follow the Oracle's lead and scoop up shares of UnitedHealth stock for a bargain, too.\nShould you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UnitedHealth Group wasn’t one of them.

In a letter to Nasdaq, the group raised concerns about compliance with executive compensation rules and shareholder transparency.\nThe SOC Group, formerly known as the CtW Investment Group, works with pension funds sponsored by a coalition of unions representing over 2 million members; many of those funds are Tesla investors.\nIn a letter dated Aug. 19, 2025, addressed to Erik Wittman, deputy general counsel and head of enforcement at Nasdaq, SOC expressed “serious concerns” about Musk’s new compensation package. Specifically, SOC said it was concerned that Tesla’s board circumvented Nasdaq listing rules when awarding Musk a “2025 CEO Interim Award,” disclosed earlier this month. The group claims this equity award should have required a shareholder vote, as stipulated under Nasdaq’s rules, given that it materially amended compensation plans.\nTesla’s board approved Musk’s new equity package under the company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, largely as compensation for his previously awarded—and overturned—$56 billion options package from 2018, known as the “2018 CEO Performance Award.” That older award was (twice) overturned by the Delaware Chancery Court owing to questions regarding board independence—a decision currently being appealed at the Delaware Supreme Court.\nFortune’s Shawn Tully reported that the new package will only apply if Musk and Tesla lose on appeal in Delaware. He also noted that unlike with the $56 billion award, the newer $29 billion award includes restrictions that protect shareholders: The shares vest on the second anniversary of the grant, or early August 2027, only if Musk serves for the entire period as CEO or chief of product development or operations. Musk can’t sell any of those vested shares until five years later, or on Aug. 3, 2030.\nFortune’s Amanda Gerut reported that, such restrictions notwithstanding, the package lacks hard performance targets for Musk. Brian Dunn, director of the Institute for Compensation Studies at Cornell University, told Fortune that experts sometimes refer to these as “fog-the-mirror grants.” In other words: “If you’re around and have enough breath left in you to fog the mirror, you get them.”\nThe objections lobbied by SOC Investment Group in its letter have nothing to do with either feature of the grants. The group argues that the Tesla board dodged shareholder approval for the package, in contravention of Nasdaq listing policy.\nTejal Patel, executive director of the SOC Investment Group, told Fortune in an interview that the “real issue is the fact that the original plan … was pretty clear in the disclosures that the company did not intend to include Elon Musk in that plan.” Acknowledging that such issues are usually raised with the Securities and Exchange Commission, she added: “Admittedly, this is the first time I’ve flagged something like this to Nasdaq, [and that’s] because it was a very specific listing standard.” Her understanding of the Nasdaq standard is that “this is exactly what it was designed to avoid.”\nShareholders likely ‘did not believe’ they were voting to approve a new Musk package\nThe SOC Investment Group emphasizes that when Tesla shareholders approved the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, company disclosures explicitly excluded Musk from eligibility, stating that his compensation would be exclusively tied to the extraordinary 2018 award. “When shareholders voted on the 2019 Plan it is likely that, based on the available disclosures and research, they did not believe they were voting on an equity plan that would cover compensation to Mr. Musk,” the SOC letter notes, “precisely because of the ‘truly extraordinary’ nature of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.”\nThe SOC letter also notes that Tesla’s 2019 proxy statement repeated multiple times that the 2019 plan was not intended to cover awards to Musk. Furthermore, the letter mentions that major proxy advisory firms indicated that the 2018 CEO Performance Award was “intended to be the sole means of compensation for Mr. Musk, relying on the Company’s disclosures.”\nTherefore, SOC writes, the 2025 CEO Interim Award “appears to expand the class of participants under the 2019 Plan in manner that would be sufficiently material to require a separate shareholder vote.”\nThe letter also warns that Tesla’s board has indicated further interim awards could follow, potentially bypassing shareholder votes while the Delaware case, the so-called Tornetta litigation, is pending. The SOC letter urges Nasdaq to act to “restore ‘the rightful balance between shareholder and management’s interests,’” prevent dilution, and ensure executive compensation transparency.\nSOC has “real concerns over director independence,” Patel told Fortune. “This is sort of the outcome of having a board that is not independent.” She said her group is concerned with issues over a lack of director independence and the juggling of responsibilities by Elon Musk, and matters have “come to a head in the last several months.” This timeline overlaps with Musk’s brief engagement as a special advisor to the White House, including extensive involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The new compensation plan, if anything, “was an opportunity for the board to get Musk to focus on Tesla, and instead” they’ve arrived at this package, she said. She also noted that the conditions under which Musk would receive the same pay, even if he was a chief of product development or operations, is “pretty unheard-of.”\nThe group has also urged Tesla shareholders to vote against the reelection of certain directors, such as Kimbal Musk and James Murdoch, citing concerns about lack of board independence from Elon Musk and alignment with shareholders’ interests. Similar to its current letter to Nasdaq, it has requested investigations by regulators into Tesla’s governance practices, arguing that the company’s board favors Musk’s interests over those of public shareholders. For example, the group asked the SEC to probe Tesla’s plan to shrink its board in 2022.\nThe group has also joined with other investors in co-filing shareholder resolutions calling for Tesla to adopt comprehensive labor rights policies, including noninterference with worker organizing and compliance with global labor standards. SOC has been involved in webinars and resolutions highlighting risks related to Tesla’s approach to unions and labor issues across several countries.\nTesla has not publicly responded to the letter and did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft. An editor verified the accuracy of the information before publishing.","content_hash":"dab9dcc3db20a574ec5683553173cfd6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6940,"method_rank":0}

Some key elements of this strategy involve simplifying things when you can and diversifying your investments across different markets and industries. Arguably, the best way to accomplish this is with exchange-traded funds (ETFs), groups of individual stocks that trade under a single ticker symbol.\nVanguard is a leading provider of investment funds and is a trusted name that has been around for decades. Here are five Vanguard ETFs that, when combined, represent a fantastic and diverse starting point for a long-term portfolio. Investors can own shares of all five for under $2,000, and each has a minimum investment of just $1, making such a position easy for investors to add to over time, no matter the budget.\n1. Vanguard S&P 500 ETF\nThe S&P 500 is the best-known U.S. stock market index, tracking 500 prominent U.S. companies. You could think of it representing America's economy, which includes the leading technology companies, a group known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. But investors who want to get stock performance equal to the S&P 500 have a small issue to contend with. You can't invest in the S&P 500 directly. The workaround is to invest indirectly through the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO).\nStock prices fluctuate, and the S&P 500 is no different. The index fluctuates from year to year, occasionally experiencing severe downturns. Yet it has always recovered, and it has produced 8% annualized returns on average over nearly a century. No investment is entirely risk-free, but the S&P 500's track record makes it arguably the safest investment fund you'll find for as long as America is a global economic powerhouse.\n2. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF\nDividends are often an indicator of an excellent business, especially if it can increase that dividend year after year. It's usually a sign of a company that generates more profits than it needs, so it shares them with investors. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(NYSEMKT: VIG) focuses on large U.S. companies that cut you increasing dividend checks over time.\nAs a result, the ETF's dividend has risen over the years, too. Its dividend yield won't wow you at just over 1.6%, but a growing dividend adds up over the years if you're patient. Investors may also like the ETF's light exposure to the Magnificent Seven: Microsoft and Apple are the only two Magnificent Seven stocks in the fund, making it a great complement to some of the other ETFs on this list.\n3. Vanguard Information Technology ETF\nIf you want to lean into technology and innovation, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) can help. It's a pure play on the technology sector, spread across all sorts of sub-markets, including various types of software, semiconductors, and infrastructure. While the ETF holds over 317 stocks, its top three holdings, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, make up over 40% of the ETF, so you'll probably want to feel good about those companies if you're going to invest in this fund.\nFortunately, the ETF is quite diverse after those three. The fourth-highest-weighted stock, Broadcom, is only 4.69% of the fund, and the weightings drop quickly from there. Investors will like the ETF's low expense ratio of just 0.09%, which is far below that of most technology ETFs. For instance, the popular Invesco QQQ ETF charges 0.20%, more than twice as much, despite having underperformed the Vanguard Information Technology ETF over the past decade.\n4. Vanguard Real Estate ETF\nDiversification is about more than choosing different corporations. Real estate is a classic investment, but few people have the funds, knowledge, or desire to buy properties. The Vanguard Real Estate ETF(NYSEMKT: VNQ) is an excellent addition to any long-term portfolio for the real estate flavors it brings to the table. The ETF holds real estate investment trusts (REITs), companies that acquire and lease real estate and distribute their taxable income to shareholders as dividends.\nThe Vanguard Real Estate ETF holds over 150 REITs across various property types, including residential and commercial buildings, data centers, industrial facilities, and hospitals. Real estate is typically an income investment, and the ETF reflects that. It currently has an adjusted effective yield of 2.8%. Investors can supercharge how their money compounds by reinvesting the dividends.\n5. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF\nLastly, it's hard to call a portfolio diverse if almost everything in it is from the United States. Sure, many U.S. companies do business globally, but there are many elite businesses based in other countries. The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF(NASDAQ: VXUS) gives investors instant ownership of over 8,600 non-U.S. companies from various developed and emerging countries worldwide.\nThe ETF's top holdings include well-known foreign giants like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Nestlé. It takes all the work out of having to sift through foreign corporate documents, which are often in other languages, making the ETF's teeny-tiny 0.05% expense ratio a bargain. By adding the Vanguard Total International ETF to your portfolio, you are genuinely investing in the global economy.\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

(AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door ever so slightly to lowering a key interest rate in the coming months but gave no hint on the timing of a move and suggested the central bank will proceed cautiously as it continues to evaluate the impact of tariffs and other policies on the economy.\nIn a high-profile speech closely watched at the White House and on Wall Street, Powell said that there are risks of both rising unemployment and stubbornly higher inflation. Yet he suggested that with hiring sluggish, the job market could weaken further.\n“The shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he said, a reference to his concerns about weaker job gains and a more direct sign that the Fed is considering a rate cut than he has made in previous comments.\nStill, Powell’s remarks suggest the Fed will proceed carefully in the coming months and will make its rate decisions based on how inflation and unemployment evolve. The Fed has three more meetings this year, including next month, in late October, and in December, and it's not clear whether the Fed will cut at all those meetings.\n“The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,” Powell said. That suggests the Fed will continue to evaluate jobs and inflation data as it decides whether to cut rates.\nThe stock market jumped in response to Powell's remarks, with the broad S&P 500 index rising 1.5% in midday trading.\n“We see Powell’s remarks as consistent with our expectation of” a quarter-point cut to the Fed's short-term rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients. The Fed's rate currently stands at 4.3%.\nPowell spoke with the Fed under unprecedented public scrutiny from the White House, as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted Powell and has urged him to cut rates, arguing there is “no inflation” and saying that a cut would lower the government’s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.\nTrump also says a cut would boost the moribund housing market. A rate cut by the Fed often leads to lower borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing, but it doesn't always.\nWhile Powell spoke, Trump elevated his attacks, telling reporters in Washington, D.C. that he would fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down over allegations from an administration official that she committed mortgage fraud.\nIf Cook is removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed's governing board. The Fed has long been considered independent from day-to-day politics. The president can't fire a Fed governor over disagreements on interest rate policy, but he can do so “for cause,” which is generally seen as malfeasance or neglect of duty.\nLater Friday, Trump told reporters, referring to Powell, “We call him too late for a reason. He should have cut them a year ago. He’s too late.”\nPowell spoke at the Fed’s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, a conference with about 100 academics, economists, and central bank officials from around the world. He was given a standing ovation before he spoke.\nCook, who is also attending the conference, declined to comment on the president's remarks.\nIn his remarks, the Fed chair underscored that tariffs are lifting inflation and could push it higher in the coming months.\n“The effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible. We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts,” Powell said.\nInflation has crept higher in recent months though it is down from a peak of 9.1% three years ago. Tariffs have not spurred inflation as much as some economists worried, but they are starting to lift the prices of heavily imported goods such as furniture, toys, and shoes.\nConsumer prices rose 2.7% in July from a year ago, above the Fed’s target of 2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 3.1%.\nPowell added that higher prices from tariffs could cause a one-time shift to prices, rather than an ongoing bout of inflation. Other Fed officials have said that is the most likely outcome and as a result the central bank can cut rates to boost the job market.\nThe Fed chair said it is largely up to the central bank to ensure that tariffs don’t lead to sustained inflation.\n“Come what may, we will not allow a one-time increase in the price level to become an ongoing inflation problem,” he said, suggesting deep rate cuts, as Trump has demanded, are unlikely.\nRegarding the job market, Powell noted that even as hiring has slowed sharply this year, the unemployment rate remains low. He added that with immigration falling sharply, fewer jobs are needed to keep unemployment in check.\nYet with hiring sluggish, the risks of a sharper downturn, with rising layoffs, has risen, Powell said.\nPowell also suggested the Fed would continue to set its interest-rate policy free from political pressure.\nFed officials “will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach.”\nPowell dedicated the second half of his speech to announcing changes to the Fed's policy framework that was issued in August 2020. The framework, which has been blamed for delaying the Fed’s response to the pandemic inflation spike, provides guidelines on how the Fed would respond to changes in inflation and employment.\nIn 2020, after a decade of low inflation and low interest rates following the financial crisis and Great Recession in 2008-2009, the Fed changed its framework to allow inflation to top its 2% target temporarily, so that inflation would average 2% over time.\nAnd after unemployment fell to a half-century low in 2018, without pushing up inflation, the 2020 framework said that the Fed would focus only on “shortfalls” in employment, rather than “deviations.” That meant it would cut rates if unemployment rose, but wouldn’t necessarily raise them if it fell.\nThe Fed reviewed its framework this year and concluded that it was tied too closely to the pre-pandemic economy, which has since shifted. Inflation spiked to a four-decade high in 2022 and the Fed rapidly boosted interest rates afterward.\n“A key objective has been to make sure that our framework is suitable across a broad range of economic conditions,” Powell said.","content_hash":"3174a8da934fdcdf5bcd68e3729c8223","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6532,"method_rank":0}

The Canadian athletic apparel maker rode the pandemic athleisure boom to record sales, but that momentum has cooled. Today, the story looks very different. Revenue growth has slowed significantly, competition in the premium sportswear category is intensifying, and U.S. consumers are tightening their budgets on discretionary items. Adding to the strain, tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump are weighing on costs, forcing the company to trim its full-year profit outlook.\nAmid the turbulence, one surprising buyer has stepped in. Michael Burry, the legendary investor who famously predicted the 2008 housing crash — a move that inspired Hollywood’s “The Big Short” — has decided this beaten-down stock deserves a place in his portfolio. According to Scion Asset Management’s second-quarter 2025 13F filing, Burry scooped up 50,000 shares worth nearly $11.9 million, giving the stock a 2.1% weighting in his portfolio.\nFor someone with a reputation for spotting opportunities where others see trouble, this is undoubtedly a notable vote of confidence. And the move has investors talking. Lululemon may be battling softer demand and tariff headwinds, but does Burry’s stake make LULU stock a buy now?\nAbout Lululemon Stock\nValued at about $23.7 billion by market capitalization, Lululemon designs and sells athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories for activities like yoga, running, training, tennis, and golf. The company operates 770 stores across over 20 markets, working closely with local athletes to gather feedback that helps refine fabrics and functional designs.\nThis hands-on approach keeps Lululemon at the forefront of innovation in sportswear, blending performance and style for a wide range of activities. However, the apparel landscape is constantly shifting, and LULU shares are feeling the impact. Consumers are turning to rival brands and dialing back spending on athleisure compared with the pandemic peak, hitting the company’s sales momentum.\nLULU stock has tumbled sharply, down nearly 54% from its 52-week high of $423.32 set this January and down 48% in 2025. By contrast, the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has managed a modest 8.4% gain over the same period, highlighting just how starkly Lululemon has lagged behind the market. Yet, Michael Burry’s recent stake in the company seems to have lifted investor sentiment, with LULU climbing almost 1% over the past five days.\nThe steep selloff has made Lululemon stock look increasingly appetizing from a valuation perspective. At just 14 times forward earnings, the stock sits well below the sector median and far under its own five-year average. That significant gap in valuation makes LULU appear far cheaper than both its peers and historical norms, putting it back on the radar for value-focused investors.\nLululemon Slides After Q1 Earnings Report\nLululemon dropped its fiscal 2025 Q1 earnings report on June 5, and the market wasn’t impressed. LULU stock plunged nearly 20% the next trading session as investors focused less on the earnings beat and more on the cracks beneath the surface. Revenue came in at $2.37 billion, up 7% year-over-year (YOY) and just a hair above Wall Street’s $2.36 billion estimate. EPS landed at $2.60, up 2.4% YOY and narrowly ahead of the $2.59 forecast.\nAt first glance, that might seem like a win, but a closer look tells a different story. Comparable sales growth came in at a soft 1% globally, weighed down by a 2% drop in the Americas, a region that remains Lululemon’s core market. Bright spots did appear overseas, where international sales surged 19%, underscoring the company’s global expansion strategy.\nOn the margin front, gross margin improved 60 basis points annually to 58.3%, but operating margin slipped to 18.5% from 19.6% a year ago. Higher tariffs, climbing costs, and swelling inventory levels were the main culprits. And that inventory figure was a real red flag. Stockpiles ballooned 23% YOY to $1.7 billion by the end of Q1, sparking concerns that markdowns may be looming in the coming quarters.\nLululemon still boasted $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents at quarter’s end and tapped into shareholder returns, repurchasing shares worth $430.4 million. It also added three net new company-operated stores, bringing the total to 770 worldwide. Yet, despite these positives, the negatives were too loud to ignore. The inventory build, shrinking operating margin, and weak domestic sales overshadowed the international momentum.\nInvestors were further rattled when Lululemon cut its full-year EPS guidance to a range between $14.58 and $14.78, down from the earlier forecast of $14.95 to $15.15. Revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 was unchanged at $11.15 billion to $11.3 billion, but management cited a “dynamic macroenvironment” as the reason for the more cautious outlook.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Lululemon Stock?\nWhile LULU stock is struggling, Wall Street hasn’t lost faith, maintaining a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 31 analysts offering recommendations, 13 advocate a “Strong Buy,” one leans toward a “Moderate Buy,” 13 urge investors to “Hold,” two analysts call for a “Moderate Sell,” and two more stick with a “Strong Sell.”\nThe average analyst price target of $289.72 represents potential upside of 47%. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $500 suggests a 155% rally from current levels.\nFinal Thoughts\nLululemon stock may be under pressure, but Michael Burry’s entry is a strong vote of confidence that the story isn’t all bearish. The athleisure giant continues to expand its international footprint, and steady buybacks underscore management’s confidence in long-term value creation. With shares trading at a steep discount to both peers and historical norms, the bar for a turnaround is far lower than in the past. That said, for patient investors, Lululemon could be a compelling bet.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Its $2 trillion size is equivalent to $355,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.\nIts operations, and changes to them, generally keep a low profile, something it is currently struggling to do.\nTraditionally, the four biggest parties in parliament try to work to agree changes to the fund via a \"supermajority\" to avoid changes every time there is a change of government.\n\"The fund is now invested in close to 9,000 companies globally ... the more visible this fund is out in the world, the higher the risk to its reputation,\" said Mahmoud Farahmand, a lawmaker from the opposition Conservatives who sits on the parliamentary finance committee that oversees it.\nHOSTILE INTERPRETATION\nWhile fund officials say they can navigate the current public challenges, they worry in private.\nReuters obtained the minutes from a Dec. 6 meeting under a freedom of information request that has not been reported previously.\nThey show fund operator Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the Council on Ethics and the finance ministry debated how to balance ethical investment while avoiding it being misinterpreted as hostile government action.\nThe Council noted a \"challenge with companies that have a dominating state owner and the risk of politicising the fund,\" the minutes showed.\n\"For these companies, the recommendations will be perceived more as direct criticism of the authorities. This is valid in Europe as well as in emerging markets.\"\nThe meeting's participants are named at the top of the documents while statements are attributed to one of the three organisations in attendance.\n\"Norges Bank pointed out ... that states that own companies, especially in authoritarian regimes, could be a challenge for the fund in the future\".\nThe Council on Ethics and NBIM declined to comment. The finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\nPUBLIC SPAT\nIn public, Finance Minister Stoltenberg has come under unusually harsh criticism from parliament's highest supervisory organ, the Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs, for his responses to its questions.\n\"The most arrogant response I have read in four years on the committee,\" its head, opposition lawmaker Peter Froelich, told public broadcaster NRK.\n\"Instead of answering factual questions, the finance minister provides a lengthy lecture on matters the committee is well aware of.\"\nETHICAL GUIDELINES\nThe fund follows ethical guidelines introduced in 2004 under Conservative finance minister Per-Kristian Foss and implemented by his left-wing successor, Kristin Halvorsen.\nThe guidelines stipulate, among other things, that the fund cannot invest in companies involved in serious violations of individuals' rights in war or conflict situations.\n\"Public support for saving money this particular way is dependent on the ethical guidelines being followed,\" Halvorsen told Reuters. \"There would be less public support for it if people did not trust that the money is managed properly.\"\nConservative party leader Erna Solberg, who governed Norway between 2013 and 2021, said keeping the fund's investments politically impartial was a long-standing priority.\n\"Having this principle that investments are done without political influence has been important for us,\" she told a meeting with foreign correspondents on Aug. 6.\nFinance Minister Stoltenberg this month told a town hall in the southern city of Arendal that the fund had always faced challenges.\n\"We will be confronted with challenges sometimes. We have been in the past, we are now and we will be in the future.\"\n\"We have managed, for 30 years, to do something that no other country has been even close to doing: take the revenues from our natural resources, save all the money, and ... only use the financial return.\"\n(Reporting by Gwladys Fouché in Oslo and Arendal; editing by Jason Neely)","content_hash":"3f102a0b77c17c1e4c18fd2a5efe1967","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6216,"method_rank":0}

It comes with the territory when you are the greatest investor of our time. I don't like some of the stocks that he owns, but I am fond of Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI), Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU), and Lennar(NYSE: LEN) as Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) holdings.\nBuffett's iconic holding company added to his stake for one of the three stocks in the second quarter. He also added to another one earlier this month. All three are among the more than three dozen publicly traded companies in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. They are the three names that I believe are no-brainer stocks to buy right now.\n1. Sirius XM Holdings\nThere was a lot of chatter last week about the stocks that Berkshire Hathaway was trading during the second quarter. Lost in the news cycle was Buffett's company quietly adding to his already sizable position in Sirius XM long after the quarter ended. Unlike the quarterly updates that Berkshire Hathaway announces every three months, its sizable stake in Sirius XM requires it to file every transaction shortly after it happens.\nBerkshire Hathaway had a 35.5% stake in the satellite radio monopoly at the end of the second quarter, but four purchases between July 31 and Aug. 4 have boosted its stake in Sirius XM to a whopping 37% of the media stock. It's worth noting that Buffett's company made these trades after the stock took a hit after posting poorly received financial results on the morning of July 31. Berkshire Hathaway isn't afraid to buy the dip, something that it has done often with Sirius XM as it has shed nearly a quarter of its value over the past year.\nSirius XM is going through some growing pains, though with revenue declining slightly for the third consecutive year it's probably better to diagnose this as \"lack of growing\" pains. It is serving satellite and streaming content to 33 million subscribers. Retention is within historical standards, shedding 1.5% of its audience every month. The challenge has been getting new listeners on the platform, a tricky feat given sluggish car sales and younger drivers turning to cheaper content through smartphone apps streaming through their connected cars.\nI still like Sirius XM despite the slow fade-out. It continues to crank out annual free cash flow north of $1 billion. It's a money machine that returns money to its shareholders through stock buybacks and a generous dividend. Sirius XM's quarterly payouts currently yield a healthy 4.7%.\nThis doesn't mean that investors are just collecting dividend checks while parked in quicksand. Sirius XM is trying to make its platform more appealing to younger listeners. With it unlikely to extend its contract with Howard Stern after 20 years, Sirius XM has been investing in rising talk show and podcast talent. The stock is cheap, trading for 8.4 times this year's projected earnings and 7.5 times next year's target.\n2. Nu Holdings\nOne of Buffett's more exotic holdings is Nu Holdings, the Brazilian company behind fintech and digital banking speedster NuBank. You may not be familiar with NuBank, but 60% of the adult population of its home country has an account with the branchless bank. It also has a presence in Mexico and Colombia.\nUnlike the market's poor reaction to Sirius XM's second quarter, investors cheered Nu's performance last week. The stock soared 9% on Friday after delivering a better-than-expected 29% revenue increase in U.S. dollars. Adjusted earnings climbed 34%.\nThe enthusiasm for Nu has continued this week. Three analysts have upgraded Nu this week, including a rare double upgrade from Citi on Tuesday. Analyst Gustavo Schroden sees the business and its earnings momentum accelerating. He previously had a sell rating on the shares, but is bumping it up two steps to a buy. Citi's Schroden is now a believer when it comes to investing in Nu, doubling his target price from $9 to $18 in the process.\n3. Lennar\nAn interesting trend among the 12 stocks that Berkshire Hathaway bought last quarter was a play on residential real estate construction. He bought into a pair of homebuilders and a leading steel manufacturer. One of the two developers was Lennar.\nI'm conflicted on the real estate play. There is certainly room for building more homes, but if mortgage rates head lower in the coming months it's going to open the floodgates of existing homeowners to put their properties on the market. It's been the thin inventory of older homes for sale giving developers a lot of pricing power with their new properties.\nLennar's revenue is expected to inch lower this year with a sharper fall in profitability. Lennar is trading for 15 times this year's earnings, but that multiple was in the single digits a year ago when the stock was lower and its net income was higher. On a bright note, Lennar trades at a more compelling 13.5 times next year's expected earnings. It's also expected to return to modest top-line growth in 2026. I'm not as bullish on Lennar as I am with Sirius XM and Nu, but if Berkshire Hathaway sees an opportunity in Lennar I'm going to pay attention.\nShould you buy stock in Sirius XM right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sirius XM wasn’t one of them.

A surge this year helped to reduce the monthly deficit to just £1.1bn last month, the lowest July borrowing in three years.\nBut Alex Kerr, at Capital Economics, said the July data masked a more gloomy outlook for the public finances. He said: “July’s undershoot is not as good as it looks and even if this undershoot persists, the Chancellor will probably need to raise taxes by between £17bn and £27bn at the Budget later this year.”\nWhile headline borrowing, at £60bn so far this year, is in line with official forecasts, what matters for the Chancellor is her borrowing target. Reeves’s fiscal targets discount borrowing for investment and focus on how much is needed to fund day-to-day spending. And on that measure, she is failing.\nBorrowing has been driven by higher public spending this year, thanks to surging debt interest, higher welfare payments and growing public sector pay. If the Chancellor is to miss her fiscal targets, it will be because she has failed to keep a lid on public spending.\nThe ONS said spending on debt interest was £41.4bn in the first three months of the year. This was 26.7pc – or more than £8bn – higher than the same period a year ago and comes against a backdrop of rising interest rates.\nDennis Tatarkov, at KPMG, said the figures showed the “longer-term picture for public finances remains challenging, as spending pressures, especially the cost of servicing debt, continue to mount”.\nHe added: “While interest debt costs were below projections in today’s data, rising inflation points to increases in the cost of index-linked borrowing later this year.”\nMeanwhile, the ONS said public sector pay so far this year stands at £74.4bn, up £8.5bn – or 13pc – compared with a year ago, while spending on welfare is currently running £1.4bn above forecast.\nSpending is likely to keep rising over the coming year after Reeves was forced to backtrack on welfare reforms that were planned to take effect in 2026.\nThe Chancellor must now find £5bn in tax rises or spending cuts to cover the about-turn on welfare, as well as a decision to restore winter fuel payments of up to £300 for most pensioners.\nWelfare spending could yet rise further. The annual uprating in benefits is usually pegged to September’s rate of inflation, which is currently forecast to peak at 4pc by the Bank of England.\nElliott Jordan-Doak, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the “litany of policy U-turns” had only “compounded the Government’s fiscal woes”.\nTax receipts, while strong in July, have also disappointed so far this year. Income tax receipts, which account for £1 of every £4 that flows into the Treasury, are currently running £1.4bn below official forecasts.\nThe OBR will have to make a judgment in the autumn about whether this slight underperformance is likely to continue. If it concludes that the answer is yes, it means Reeves is unlikely to get as much as she hoped – another blow.\nDisappointing income tax receipts have so far been mostly offset by a rise in National Insurance contributions following the Chancellor’s £25bn tax raid last October. “Compulsory social contributions”, as the ONS terms it, increase by £9.5bn to £63.8bn.\nUltimately, however, any shortfall in tax receipts would be dwarfed by the impact of a possible OBR downgrade to the UK’s long-term growth prospects and productivity. Economists have said that downgrades from the over-optimistic OBR are overdue.\nWhatever happens, economists believe more tax rises are on the way. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) has warned that Reeves faces a black hole of up to £50bn. The Chancellor is now examining increases to both inheritance and property taxes as a result.\nMartin Beck, at WPI Strategy, said Thursday’s borrowing figures suggested Niesr’s estimate was wide of the mark, but added that he still expects tax hikes this autumn.\nHe said: “The Chancellor’s decision to leave herself with just a £10bn buffer against her main fiscal rule was always a high-stakes gamble. That cushion is probably shrinking, so tax rises this autumn still look likely.”\nDoak added that the public finances remained “chronically weak”.\nHe said: “We think the Chancellor will need to resort to ‘sin’ and ‘stealth’ tax hikes, duty increases, and a pensions tax raid in order to meet her fiscal rules if she wants to meet her pledge of keeping headline tax rates unchanged.\n“We expect the bulk of those tax hikes to be backloaded towards the end of the forecast period, minimising any short-term growth implications. But that will buy the Chancellor only precious little time. The public finances are unsustainable in the long run and delaying action now increases the risks of needing to make sharper adjustments in the future, which would be more disruptive for economic activity.”","content_hash":"269473124edcb0dd55947a1c3b2e7f5d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6186,"method_rank":0}

But revenue rose, guidance climbed, and the retail giant once again reminded Wall Street that it’s better at surviving storms than celebrating streaks.\nAdjusted earnings came in at 68 cents, short of the 73 cents analysts expected, sending the stock down about 3% in premarket trading. But revenue jumped nearly 5% to $177.4 billion, U.S. comparable sales rose 4.6%, and Walmart raised its full-year forecast for both sales and profit. The picture was less a stumble than a reminder of what makes the company hard to knock over: When profit is pressured by tariffs, labor costs, or insurance claims, Walmart has multiple levers to pull — and it’s not shy about using them.\nCEO Doug McMillon acknowledged that tariffs are steadily increasing costs and that the cumulative effect of higher costs is beginning to affect shopping patterns. He said, “As we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we’ve continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters.” But he added that, with the way things have played out so far, “the impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.”\nBut if tariffs were the headwind, Walmart’s answer was the same tailwind it has relied on for decades: everyday low prices.\n“With regard to our U.S. pricing decisions, given tariff-related cost pressures, we’re doing what we said we would do,” McMillon told investors. “We’re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can.” This quarter, his answer — and the company’s — was to lean into the brand’s oldest promise: low prices. In practice, that meant 7,400 “Rollback” discounts during the quarter, a not-so-subtle reminder to shoppers that Walmart intends to be the last place inflation shows up.\nMcMillon said that shoppers’ spending has “been generally consistent” and that “the impact of tariffs has been gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments… have been somewhat muted.” Still, shoppers overall have been spending somewhat cautiously, leaning toward needs over wants, but tariff-related price increases have caused middle- and low-income shoppers to rein in their spending even more. The pattern is clear: smaller baskets, sharper focus on value, and a consumer leaning harder into Walmart’s core strengths.\nR.J. Hottovy, the head of analytical research at Placer.ai, said Walmart is one of “retail’s winners” during the quarter. He added, “Placer.ai data shows consumers are extremely price-sensitive in 2025, with many retailers who raised prices seeing a negative impact on foot traffic. Walmart’s scale and leverage with suppliers, however, should allow it to manage tariff-related price increases better than its competitors.”\nMost retailers would see that as a warning flare. Walmart is treating it as a competitive weapon. Its scale allows it to swallow some of the added costs and still plaster those “Rollback” tags across aisles, daring rivals to keep up. Groceries, memberships, and ads buffer margins, letting Walmart absorb blows others can’t. Ahead of the earnings report, Jefferies’ Corey Tarlowe described those share gains as “durable momentum,” pointing out that tariffs may nick profits but also accelerate the company’s ability to pull traffic away from mid-tier competitors.\nBut those rollbacks weren’t a magic trick. Groceries and health products carried the quarter, providing steady traffic while more discretionary categories lagged. Membership income climbed more than 5%, helping pad recurring revenue. E-commerce surged 26% in the U.S. and 25% globally, with store-fulfilled delivery now accounting for nearly half of the company’s growth. Advertising revenue — the kind of high-margin side hustle that most retailers dream about — jumped 46% worldwide.\nChief financial officer John Rainey described the quarter as one of quiet share gains with growth across all income cohorts in the quarter. He stressed that inventory levels remain healthy enough to keep the company nimble in a shifting economy.\nAnalysts largely sided with management’s framing. JPMorgan said the report doesn’t fundamentally change its positive outlook on the stock. Wall Street wants to know how long Walmart can keep absorbing costs before it feels the pinch, yet the stock largely remains rated a “Buy.” With analysts calling out its pricing power, Walmart has turned tariffs into both a moat and a marketing message; higher costs may be a storm, but it's one the company seems built to weather better than anyone else. The quarter may have ended Walmart’s EPS streak, but it didn’t change the story.\nThe contrast with rivals only sharpens that point. Target, once seen as Walmart’s trendier twin, has been struggling with slower foot traffic and tariff exposure in apparel and home goods. Home Depot and Lowe’s are contending with stalled home-improvement spending . Even Costco, whose membership model is its shield, has seen sales growth flatten as households stretch their budgets.\nWhat ties the sector together is a pivot to more resilient revenue streams: loyalty programs, advertising, and delivery services. But where others are experimenting, Walmart is scaling. With more than 90% of U.S. households shopping at its stores each year, the company has a platform that can turn side bets into profit engines. Its ad business now looks less like a pilot project and more like a media arm. Its e-commerce growth suggests it’s no longer just chasing Amazon but carving out a different model, with stores doubling as fulfillment hubs and groceries anchoring digital loyalty.\nThat’s why the market’s fixation on the earnings miss may seem out of step with the substance of the quarter. Profits slipped. But sales rose, forecasts climbed, customers kept coming, and Walmart kept widening the gap with peers. For most retailers, a 3% dip in premarket trading would sting. For Walmart, it was almost comic relief — a reminder that even when it trips, it keeps outpacing the field.","content_hash":"132f015e6ce0a44437c5467d9279637b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6185,"method_rank":0}

But while that extra income feels great hitting your bank account, many gig workers get a rude awakening come tax season.\nShang Saavedra, founder of Save My Cents and a nationally recognized personal finance expert, has seen this story play out countless times. After helping people navigate financial challenges for more than 19 years, she knows exactly why freelancers and gig workers often face shocking tax bills. But more importantly, she knows how to avoid them.\n“If you’re self-employed, get ahead of taxes — work with a great CPA and make sure you’re taking every qualified deduction available,” Saavedra said. Here’s her expert guidance on handling taxes when you’re earning income outside the traditional W-2 system.\nThe Hidden Tax That Catches Everyone Off Guard\nWhen asked why so many freelancers end up shocked by their tax bill, Saavedra points to a tax that most people have never heard of: self-employment tax.\n“When switching from W-2 to freelancer, there’s one extra tax you may not be aware of — self-employment tax,” she explained. “When you were W-2, your employer paid that tax, which is their half of your Social Security and Medicare taxes. But when you’re self-employed, you pay both your portion and your self-employed version.”\nIt’s true: While W-2 employees split their Social Security and Medicare contributions 50\/50 with their employer, self-employed individuals pay the full 15.3% themselves. On top of regular income taxes, this additional burden can turn a profitable side hustle into a financial headache quickly.\nFor example, if you earned $10,000 from freelancing, you’re looking at roughly $1,530 in self-employment tax alone, before even calculating your regular income tax obligations. Many gig workers discover this only when filing their returns, leaving them scrambling to cover unexpected bills.\nThe tax shock goes beyond just the numbers. In fact, it’s psychological. When you’re used to receiving a W-2 paycheck with taxes automatically deducted, seeing your full gig income hit your account can create a false sense of wealth.\n“You’re typically considered self-employed, so you have to actively set aside taxes as you make your income; it’s no longer going to be automatically deducted from your paychecks,” Saavedra explained.\nThis shift from automatic tax withholding to manual tax planning requires a complete mindset change. Instead of thinking about your gross freelance income as “your money,” you need to immediately set aside 25% to 30% for tax obligations. That $5,000 month from your side hustle isn’t really $5,000 — it’s closer to $3,500 after taxes.\nPlanning Ahead: The Smart Freelancer’s Strategy\nSaavedra’s approach to tax planning for freelancers focuses on being proactive rather than reactive. Her strategy involves two key components: professional guidance and quarterly payments.\n“Get ahead of it by working with a great CPA to ensure that you are also taking as many qualified deductions as possible by being self-employed,” she recommended. “There are so many options out there for you to lower your taxable income. Have them help you estimate your taxes so you can pay them quarterly.”\nWorking with a CPA isn’t just about filing your annual return; it’s about creating a year-round tax strategy. A good accountant can help you identify deductions you might miss, such as home office expenses, internet and phone use, business insurance, and professional development or training costs.\nThe quarterly payment system is equally important. Instead of facing one massive tax bill in April, spreading payments across four quarters means tax obligations are more manageable — and helps avoid IRS penalties.\nSystems and Tools That Actually Work\nWhen it comes to practical tools for managing taxes as a gig worker, Saavedra keeps it simple but effective.\n“I use Gusto to run payroll for myself,” she shared. Treating yourself like an employee of your own business helps automate tax withholdings and ensures you’re consistently setting money aside. This habit is key to staying organized — and sane — during tax season.\nBeyond payroll systems, successful gig workers typically use separate business bank accounts, expense-tracking apps and automatic savings transfers to a dedicated tax savings account (again, aiming for 25% to 30% of your income). Having these things in place will help make tax season more bearable.\nAvoiding the Penalty Trap\nBeyond the shock of owing taxes, many gig workers get hit with penalties for underpayment. The IRS expects you to pay taxes throughout the year, not just at filing time. If you owe more than $1,000 when you file, you might face penalties unless you’ve made timely quarterly estimated payments.\nSaavedra’s quarterly payment strategy helps avoid this trap entirely. By estimating your annual tax liability and dividing it into four payments, you stay current with your obligations and avoid surprise penalties.\nThe Deduction Advantage\nOne silver lining of gig work taxation is the expanded deduction opportunities. Unlike W-2 employees who typically take the standard deduction, self-employed individuals can often deduct business-related expenses to significantly reduce their taxable income.\nCommon deductions that gig workers often miss include health insurance premiums (if you’re self-employed and pay your own), retirement account contributions and expenses related to your business. (That could mean a car if you drive for rideshare apps, or office equipment if you work from home.)\nThe key here is documentation. Keep receipts, track mileage, log expenses and maintain clear records. When in doubt, ask your CPA whether an expense qualifies as a business deduction.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates’ Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

His tone? Definitively dovish. It's no surprise that the market is flying in response, especially the stocks that really need rate cuts to stoke profits. While Powell was sure to highlight the upside risks to inflation, he also indicated he believes it's most likely that the Trump administration's elevated tariffs will be a one-time hit to prices rather than the start of an inflationary spiral — though he was sure to note that a \"one-time\" hit doesn't mean you get it \"all at once\" as the higher duty rates trickle through supply chains and distribution networks. Another key part of Powell's message Friday is that the employment picture — the other part of the Fed's dual mandate along with stable prices — is getting more precarious than it was a few months ago. The July jobs report and revisions to prior months showed a material slowing in job creation, something Powell mentioned Friday. \"Overall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,\" Powell said, before issuing this notable comment: \"This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising. And if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\" Add these two things up, and you get a market with increased confidence that the Fed will likely cut rates at least twice times this year, with an increased likelihood that we see a third. The Fed's first chance to do so is in late September. According to the CME FedWatch Tool , the odds of a September cut jumped to 91%, up from 75% yesterday, while the odds of a third cut before year end now stand at about 40%, up from the 25% odds being priced in Thursday ahead of Powell's speech. The odds of only two cuts has held relatively steady in the mid-to-upper-40% range. The key statement backing this change in odds is more than likely Powell's comment: \"With policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\" Indeed, even though Powell noted tension on both sides of the Fed's mandate, when we read between the lines of his commentary on tariff-driven inflation pressures and labor market conditions, it seems clear the greater concern is the jobs market. On Thursday, we wrote that while lower rates are usually more supportive of high-flying tech stocks because they give investors clearance to pay more for each dollar of future earnings, a dovish stance would be especially positive for the so-called cyclical stocks that benefit from increased economic activity, which cheaper borrowing costs tend to spur. In the end, Powell managed to thread the needle perfectly and, as a result, all three major averages are rallying at least 1.5%. When we look underneath the hood of the S & P 500, the leading sector is consumer discretionary — and that makes sense because lower rates means more money discretionary money in consumers' pockets. The sectors on its heels all benefit greatly from lower rates as well: real estate, industrials, and materials. Shares of homebuilder Lennar are up nearly 6%, and Club name Home Depot is cruising too. Industrial machinery marker Caterpillar is up more than 4.5%, and Club stock DuPont , which is in the materials cohort, is up almost 4%. The economically sensitive Dow Jones Industrial Average is outperforming the S & P 500 and touching fresh all-time highs following Powell's speech. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq is performing about in line with the Dow on Friday, it still may actually finish the week in the red. That's because it got dinged up earlier this week during a market rotation out of momentum stocks like Palantir into rate-sensitive cyclical stocks — many of which are in the Dow, leading to the blue-chip index's relative outperformance in the first part of the week. As the Nasdaq lost 2.1% over Tuesday and Wednesday's sessions, the Dow was basically flat. The lesson in all this: You can't always lean on the textbook. Yes, lower rates are beneficial to equity valuations, and that has historically been better for growth stocks, many of which are in the tech cohort, because it clears the way for investors to focus more on future earnings. This dynamic held true during the near-zero rate days of the pandemic. However, in the real world, we have to consider what other investors are thinking about — you need to be as much a psychologist as you are a financial statement analyst. In the current moment, the thought process is not that a September rate cut will allow folks to pay 300 times earnings for Palantir instead of 250. Rather, investors need to be focusing on which companies will see their earnings estimates revised higher into year-end, an enticing setup that gets investors interested in those stocks. Right now, it's the cyclical names, like those tied to the housing market that are most likely to get those upward revisions on the back of a dovish Fed speech. That's why you're seeing Home Depot jump more than 4%, ahead of Palantir and even fellow portfolio stock known for its momentum-driven nature in Nvidia .

A phenomenon where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200 DMA, the intersection points to sustained weakness for the target security. At the same time, there’s a contrarian philosophy that suggests that because the bearish pressure may have been fully digested, the subsequent moves could be bullish.\nSuch sentiments align with legendary investor Warren Buffett’s commonly cited aphorism: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” This is great and all but it raises an important question — how do you know which ideas are worth pursuing and which ones to avoid?\nIn my estimation, identity and access management specialist Okta Inc (OKTA) — which recently flashed the death cross — is a prime candidate for a contrarian trade.\nOn the surface, circumstances don’t look pleasant for OKTA stock. Aside from pinging Barchart’s Death Cross screener, OKTA has effectively earned the ire of the platform’s Technical Opinion indicator, which rates shares as an 88% Sell. Investors are also edgy, with the tech service set to release its second-quarter earnings results on Aug. 26.\nMost pressingly, though, OKTA stock has plunged 27% in the past three months, according to Barchart content partner Zacks Investment Research. This sustained negativity has been reflected with the flashing of the death cross — and there doesn’t seem to be much hope that the stock can turn things around.\nNot surprisingly (especially with earnings around the corner), the Expected Move calculator provides a massive differential for the Aug. 29 expiration date: the upper price is projected to land at $100.69 while the lower price may fall to $81.37. Of course, the issue here is that there’s no telling which side of the spectrum is more likely to win out.\nThat’s where a different approach may shed light on the topic.\nUsing Path Dependency to Narrow Down an Options Strategy for OKTA Stock\nPrimarily, retail traders — especially those interested in options — utilize volatility-dependent analytics. This approach depends heavily on formulations derived from or influenced by the Black-Scholes model for pricing options. Essentially, the idea is that every optionable stock features a baseline magnitude of volatility. As exogenous factors (such as earnings reports) loom on the horizon, accelerants are baked into the volatility assumptions.\nThat’s part of the reason why expected move calculators feature conical shapes: the analysis is about estimating a range of pricing possibilities based on volatility calculations. These are also the same calculations that help determine whether an option is cheap or expensive.\nHowever, the challenge is that while an option may be technically cheap relative to volatility expectations, we don’t know which outcome is likelier: the bullish scenario or the bearish. To get a better understanding of how the target security may conditionally move, we can deploy path dependency — using the stock’s actual pricing geometry to estimate where it may end up in the future.\nNow, the problem is that conditional probabilities are difficult (if not impossible) to extract because share prices fluctuate wildly. Therefore, we need to impose epistemological continuity in both the input and output variables. To do this, we can treat price action not as scalar signals but as discrete objects or states. In this manner, recurring patterns pop out, allowing for effective analysis.\nFor example, in the trailing 10 weeks, the market voted to buy OKTA stock four times and sell six times. During this period, OKTA incurred a downward trajectory. We can label this discrete state as 4-6-D. Now, we have a falsifiable signal upon which we can conduct probabilistic analysis through the study of past analogs.\nSince January 2019, the 4-6-D sequence has flashed 37 times. Notably, in 64.86% of cases, the following week’s price action results in upside, with a median return of 4.93%. As a baseline, the chance that a long position in OKTA stock will rise on any given week is only 52.45%. Therefore, assuming that the implications of the aforementioned sequence pan out, there’s a clear incentive to consider a bullish debit strategy.\nAt the same time, even if the bulls maintain control of the market over the next 10 weeks, the overall price geometry risks tilting in the negative direction. Subsequently, it may be better to trade OKTA stock rather than view it as a long-term investment opportunity.\nBuying Call Spreads the Smart Way\nBased on the market intelligence above, arguably the most viable idea is the 92\/95 bull call spread expiring Sept. 19. This transaction involves buying the $92 call and simultaneously selling the $95 call, for a net debit paid of $145 (the most that can be lost in the trade). Should OKTA stock rise through the short strike price ($95) at expiration, the maximum profit is $155, a payout of nearly 107%.\nAre there higher-paying call spreads available? Yes, in my opinion, you could go for a spread with a short leg of $97.50. One such trade currently features a payout of just over 134%. However, the challenge here is that the delta between the strike price and the positive projected pathway is very tight. Such tightness leaves little margin for error if exogenous factors unexpectedly impact OKTA stock.\nEither way, much rides on the empirical reliability of the 4-6-D sequence. Running a one-tailed binomial test reveals a p-value of 0.0881, meaning that there’s only an 8.81% chance that the implications of the signal could materialize randomly as opposed to intentionally.\nGiven the open and entropic nature of the stock market, that’s a compelling metric to chew on.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Built by the combined efforts of seven countries (hence, \"international\") and staffed by a rotating crew of astronauts from more than two dozen countries (so really international), it's taken 27 years to put the ISS together in its present form -- and more than $100 billion.\nAnd yet, at age 27 and counting, the ISS is getting a bit long in the tooth. Most of the nations that built ISS have agreed to send it back down to Earth sometime after 2030, where it will (mostly) burn up in the atmosphere, with the remnants crashing into the sea.\nAt that point, we're going to need a new space station.\nOr space stations.\nAnd quite a lot of money to build them.\nHelp wanted: One (or more) new space stations\nIn fact, America and a handful of other countries are already planning to build not just one but potentially as many as four new privately owned space stations to replace the ISS. The companies aiming to build these stations include relatively unknown, private companies Vast Space and Axiom Space, as well as consortia of much larger, better-funded, and more well-known space companies -- several of which are publicly traded, allowing you and me to invest in them.\nThe latter includes the \"Orbital Reef\" team, which is everyone from Boeing(NYSE: BA) to Redwire(NYSE: RDW) to Sierra Space and Blue Origin (the extremely well-funded space company founded by megabillionaire Jeff Bezos).\nA second team, dubbed \"Starlab,\" is led by recent initial public offering (IPO) Voyager Technologies(NYSE: VOYG), with help from an array of partners, including Airbus(OTC: EADSY), Northrop Grumman(NYSE: NOC), and even Hilton Hotels(NYSE: HLT).\nMoney needed...and probably a few IPOs\nSo far, so good. Lots of high-quality, name-brand space companies -- and non-space companies -- are stepping up to fill the gap in orbital space stations before it even appears.\nBut here's where things get dicey.\nUp till now, NASA has been helping these four teams of companies along in their work as they design and begin building prototypes of the stations they hope to put in orbit. But as SpaceNews reported last week, NASA is privately planning \"to revise its plans for the second phase of its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destination, or CLD, program.\"\nAnd by \"revise,\" I mean maybe reduce funding or at least change how the money is doled out.\nTo date, NASA has committed nearly $530 million to the Axiom, Orbital Reef, and Starlab projects, with plans to spend a further $2.1 billion over the next five years. (If that sounds like a lot of money, recall that the ISS cost nearly 40 times more.) NASA has been keeping prices low by awarding Space Act Agreements that are essentially public-private partnerships where costs are shared between NASA and its contractors.\nBut citing a projected $4 billion shortfall in its funding from the government, on July 31, NASA released an internal memo expressing a desire to revise Phase 2 of CLD. Apparently, Phase 2 was originally envisioned as a series of fixed-price contracts in which:\nNASA would pay a fixed price for an item or service.\nA contractor would agree to perform the work for that price.\nIf the cost exceeded the fixed price, the contractor would \"eat the cost.\"\nNow, NASA seems to want to continue awarding Space Act Agreements, similar to those already being used in Phase 1, in Phase 2 as well. Under this method, NASA will share costs with its contractors (Boeing, Blue Origin, Voyager, and so on), but the companies will also bear much of the cost themselves -- and ultimately end up owning the space station(s) once built.\nAs SpaceNews explains it, NASA plans to award \"at least two\" Space Act Agreements \"to mature space station designs through critical design reviews and then to flight demonstrations.\" If both designs are approved, this could result in at least two private space stations being built (largely at the companies' own expense).\nWhat this means for investors\nRemember that the memo is not yet public, and even the space companies themselves \"are still studying the implications of NASA's memo,\" trying to figure out what's happening. But assuming all this is correct, here's what it means for investors: NASA is pulling back on its financial commitment to building replacement space stations, and companies may need to find more money on their own.\nHow will they do that?\nOne obvious possibility is to raise money from investors through one or more IPOs of stock. Already, we've seen Voyager Technologies go this route, raising some $380 million from an IPO in June. The Orbital Reef team has a strong financial backer in Jeff Bezos and Blue Origin. Still, I wouldn't be shocked to see a second IPO from that team as well. And Axiom and Vast have significantly fewer resources to draw upon independently.\nGiven a sufficient demand from the IPO market, I suspect we'll see IPOs from one or both of these companies as well. Stay tuned.\nShould you buy stock in Voyager Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Voyager Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Voyager Technologies wasn’t one of them.

The company ranks first among smart vacuums by global market share, according to IDC Research. Last week, it reported a nearly 79% revenue surge in the first half of this year. About half of sales came from outside China.\nIn an exclusive interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Quan predicted that human-like robots will become part of many households by 2030, thanks largely to advances in generative artificial intelligence.\nAnd before then, he expects, Roborock can make its latest, high-end cleaner with an AI-powered robotic arm so cheap that the mass market will be able to buy it — for at most a few hundred U.S. dollars.\n\"If we only focus on the premium segment, in the end, other than being the best robotic vacuum cleaner company in the world, we will have nothing,\" Quan said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He noted that robot vacuums still don't have a very high household penetration rate.\nChina, the largest market for the robot vacuums by value, has a penetration rate of only 5.6%, while the United States, the second-largest market, has a 22% penetration rate, according to Euromonitor estimates for 2025. The firm predicts penetration in the U.S. will tick up to 24.1% over the next two years, and edge down to 5.5% in China.\nCompetition in the robotic vacuum + robotic arm category heated up earlier this year at the U.S. Consumer Electronics Show, with Roborock and at least two other Chinese competitors releasing demos. The AI-powered arm removes obstacles from the cleaner's path as it rolls autonomously around the house.\nSo far, only Roborock has started selling one, called the Saros Z70 — but with a hefty price tag of around $2,600 on amazon.com. The site shows 141 reviews and a 4.6 rating. Roborock did not share specific sales figures.\nInitial reviews of the Saros Z70 from U.S. tech sites such as Mashable and Wired weren't impressed, especially given the price, but hoped for more capable versions in the near future. Both recommended that consumers stick with the more traditional Roborock Saros 10R — which retails for $1,600.\nRobot vacuum cleaner companies should develop products that \"bridge cutting-edge technologies and mainstream price points to accelerate adoption,\" said Jin Liu, senior analyst of small appliances at Euromonitor International.\nBut even if the price comes down, it would only be a small step toward having a robot help with cooking and other household chores.\nVacuum cleaners are the \"only successful application [of robots] in our homes to date,\" said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation (A3). \"This is after four decades of talking about how we're going to have robots in our home.\"\n\"What made the [robot] vacuum cleaner so successful is it didn't cost that much,\" he said. For the same thing to happen for humanoids to enter homes, he said, there needs to be a compelling quality for the price.\nHumanoids, such as those from Chinese startup Unitree, still cost tens of thousands of U.S. dollars and don't have clear household use cases yet.\nNavigating tariffs\nDespite its mass market ambitions, Roborock said that because of tariffs, it had to raise the Saros Z70 price by $700 from the original $1,899.\nQuan said Roborock started working with suppliers late last year in Vietnam, where he said the company can fulfill all its North American orders.\nLooking ahead, he said the company is considering global supply chain partnerships, but not necessarily to invest in building its own factories. Roborock's plans for a Hong Kong listing are primarily to raise capital for international expansion, Quan said, noting the company is also expanding beyond vacuums.\nDespite Roborock's 79% revenue surge, the company more than doubled its spending, largely on research and development, steepening the company's losses in the first half of the year.\nQuan said the company has hired nearly 100 AI experts this year and is still hiring — with an eye to add a total of nearly 200 AI experts this year. He said many of the new hires have overseas education or work experience.\nThe company built a dedicated AI lab in Shanghai and a research institute in Shenzhen, soon after Roborock's founding in 2014. When asked about computing power, Quan said there are many solutions and that buying Nvidia chips aren't the only option.\nAs for improving the AI-powered robotic arm and making it cheaper, \"the challenge lies primarily with the algorithm and data,\" he said, not the hardware.\nHumanoid apps\nAs AI becomes more critical for household robots, Quan has an even bigger vision.\n\"If this robot in your home needs to clean, then it will have to integrate the cleaning knowledge that Roborock has accumulated over the years in algorithms, models, data and training,\" he said. \"Then it can be installed onto the robot like an app.\"\n\"This robot may be Tesla's, or Unitree's, or someone else's, ... but in the area of cleaning, it will be inseparable from Roborock,\" he said, claiming the company has the best data on cleaning tasks. Another company might have the best data for robots to cook, he said.\nThe humanoid market will likely reach $5 trillion by 2050, with $800 billion in China alone, according to Morgan Stanley estimates.\n\"With humanoids, if they can't do more than one thing, then they're competing against an existing form factor that can do one thing very well,\" Burnstein said. But ne noted companies around the world expect there's a big market for safe, affordable humanoids that can cook, clean, help the elderly and do other things.\n\"We're not there yet with the technology, but maybe we'll get there and maybe that multitasking would be the differentiator potentially,\" he said. \"So you wouldn't need 5 robots. You might just need one.\"","content_hash":"06047cfccc5456ca697d4d17e0e28ecf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5976,"method_rank":0}

Founder Phillip Nadjafov told TechCrunch that investors have bought into Oway’s concept because his company has already developed a way to cut the cost of shipping a pallet across the U.S. by 50%, using a clever mixture of new and somewhat old technologies.\nThere’s artificial intelligence, of course, in the form of machine learning that Oway developed to help find and match cargo with empty trailer space and a convenient destination (or a short detour). Oway is also automating a lot of the standard shipping and insurance documentation that goes with freight.\nBut Oway’s ride-share cargo pitch is made possible by what’s known as “electronic logging devices” (ELDs) that are installed on the trucks that traverse our country.\nELDs became government mandated around a decade ago, part of a push to make trucking safer and more efficient by eliminating paper logbooks. This makes it harder for shippers and drivers to skirt the federal rules on maximum driving time, theoretically cutting down on fatigue.\nThe devices have been a source of contention for many drivers worried about excessive surveillance. And there’s some evidence that the promised safety benefits may be offset by an increase in aggressive driving since drivers can’t fudge their hours as easily.\nBut the devices are nonetheless the cornerstone of what Oway is doing, because ELDs also made it possible to keep tabs on the exact location of a truck in real time.\nWith this information, Oway can work with shippers to identify destinations close to an already-planned route. When there is empty space on the trailer — which there often is, according to Nadjafov — Oway can help customers place cargo in those trailers at a fraction of the typical cost.\nThe result is Oway claims it can bring the cost of moving a sub-2,000-pound pallet between Los Angeles and Dallas from about $350 down to as low as $140.\n“You shouldn’t need to … buy a whole 50-something-foot truck to move [something] across the country in order to get good pricing,” he said. “If you have a single box over 100 pounds you want to move across the country, you should be able to, now, with current technology … do that. And this is a huge problem we have in America.”\nThat disconnect, Nadjafov argued, creates higher shipping rates and consumer prices, but also leads to more emissions and more idle time for truckers. He believes Oway can solve this and is already working with big companies with thousands of vehicles in their fleets, though he said he can’t disclose who they are because they’ve asked for the relationships to stay private for now.\nThe way Nadjafov pitches it, Oway’s business model combines some of the best aspects of the two main ways freight gets shipped by trucks in the U.S.\nOne model is known as “full truckload,” which involves truck trailers being packed with goods, often in service of one shipper. These shipments typically go from point A to point B, offering quicker delivery but at a higher price.\nThe other model is what’s known as “less-than-truckload” shipping, which typically involves multiple shippers sharing space on a single truck. This lowers the cost, but it takes longer, as the goods often have to bounce between multiple trucks and warehouses before making it to their destination.\nNadjafov’s promise is that Oway can achieve the speed of full truckload shipping with the cost and dynamism of less-than-truckload shipping. What’s more, by shipping more goods on direct long-haul routes, that freight is less likely to get damaged since it’s not being unloaded and reloaded as it goes from a truck to a warehouse and back again.\nOway is doing all this in a “decentralized” way, Nadjafov describes, meaning it is not trying to buy out entire trailers’ worth of space and is even working with other brokers in the industry on top of the carriers and shippers.\n“We want Oway to be flexible so that one day new businesses and industries could be built on the novel applications of this infrastructure,” he said.\nNadjafov said Oway has already received interest from companies in other countries, but his startup is focused on the U.S. for now — in part because Oway is only 12 people, and because of how reliant this country is on trucking.\n“Trucking is a trillion-dollar industry and the empty space phenomenon itself is a $100 billion problem,” he said. “It’s going to be, I think, a very transformative movement for the entire commerce and logistics sector of America over the next 10 years, because I believe that this will be basically the de facto way that most businesses are going to move things around.”\nUpdate: This story has been updated to reflect more current market rates for moving goods between LA and Dallas.\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

In turn, Deere's target audience has pulled back on its willingness to buy new agricultural equipment.\nDeere has also been hit by tariff costs, estimating that it could take a $600 million hit for the fiscal 2025 year. The company has already seen $300 million in tariff expenses year to date.\nJust after reporting its earnings, the company confirmed to CNBC that it announced 238 layoffs across its Illinois and Iowa factories, adding to thousands who have been laid off over the past year. The company cited decreased demand and lower order volumes as the main factors behind the job reductions.\n\"As stated on our most recent earnings call, the struggling ag economy continues to impact orders for John Deere equipment,\" Deere told CNBC in a statement. \"This is a challenging time for many farmers, growers and producers, and directly impacts our business in the near term.\"\nThe manufacturer employs more than 70,000 people globally.\nStill, Deere has identified enough green shoots to point to a less-troubling future.\nOn its most recent earnings call, company executives emphasized the growth in demand in both Europe and South America after seeing weakness in North America. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Deere's president of its worldwide agriculture and turf division said the company remains confident in its future.\n\"We think there's positive tail winds from both what we see in the trade deals, and we think there are positive tail winds from what we see in tax policy,\" Cory Reed said on the call.\nAnd in June, the company released a statement that \"myth busted\" any claims that Deere might need to shut down its U.S. manufacturing due to the fall in demand. Instead, the company said it was making a \"bold move\" to invest $20 billion into U.S. manufacturing over the next 10 years.\nIt follows a similar string of announcements from companies trying to shore up their \"Made in the USA\" bona fides since President Donald Trump took office. Before the election, Trump threatened Deere with 200% tariffs if it moved production to factories in Mexico.\n\"Over the next decade, we will continue to make significant investments in our core U.S. market,\" CEO John May said in the statement in June. \"This underscores our dedication to innovation and growth while staying cost-competitive in a global market.\"\nWhat Wall Street is saying\nDespite the struggles in the broader agricultural sector, Wall Street analysts on the whole remain optimistic about Deere's road ahead.\nOppenheimer analyst Kristen Owen wrote last week that she remains bullish on Deere and expects increased confidence into 2026, telling CNBC that she believes the company is taking an \"appropriately cautiously optimistic outlook.\"\nEven Truist analyst Jamie Cook, who lowered his target after Deere's earnings last week and emphasized an uncertain outlook for 2026, said he still believes this year marks a bottoming for the company's earnings per share.\nThe company's stock has seen a nearly 30% increase over the one-year period.\nLooking at Deere's history and the hit that the farming industry has taken over the past few years, D.A. Davidson analyst Michael Shlisky told CNBC he can't imagine the company going much lower from here.\n\"The way I'd say it is 2025 could be the worst, the lowest number of tractor sales in the history of modern agriculture,\" he said, with the potential for the trend to swing upward becoming imminent.\nWhile the optimism might not be directly translating to sales today, Shlisky said the \"hints\" of progress are enough to make him excited about the company's future, including the growth in Europe and South America.\n\"When parts of the world are doing better, the parts that aren't doing as well are likely to follow,\" Shlisky said.\nWhile not commenting directly on the latest round of layoffs, Shlisky said he doesn't think investors would be surprised to see the necessary cost-cutting measures at this point in the company's trajectory.\nSimilarly, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note that while demand may be decreasing, they stand behind a thesis that Deere earnings have bottomed and that the company remains an \"attractive opportunity longer term.\"\nAnalyst Angel Castillo told CNBC that Deere and the agricultural sector at large are cyclical, so while the short-term remains uncertain, the long-term outlook for the company is likely to bounce back, noting that precision agriculture in particular is likely to take off.\n\"This is one of the unique areas where we think even if there's more challenges next year, as we kind of expect, the earnings downside risk is much more de-risked or already captured by expectation,\" Castillo said.\nWith its latest cost-cutting measures, Deere is saving itself by not overproducing or creating a supply chain issue, Castillo added.\n\"The reality today is that we're still in an uncertain environment, and I think they're managing in a disciplined, rational way to try to make sure not to create a worse environment,\" he said.","content_hash":"639816957f6a4c41113ae049beabeaff","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5703,"method_rank":0}

Indeed, one sector that looks poised for a rebound is consumer goods. After a beatdown resulting from tariff news earlier this year, many of these companies are trading at reasonable valuations, even as their fundamentals and brand power hold up.\nWith that in mind, let's look at two consumer goods stocks that might be worth a $1,000 investment today.\n1. Lululemon\nLululemon Athletica(NASDAQ: LULU) has spent two decades building one of the strongest brands in athletic wear. Because of its prestige, customers are still willing to pay triple-digit prices for leggings, as well as line up for limited product drops. Direct-to-consumer sales, which make up about half its revenue mix, continue to carry rich margins and keep brand control in-house.\nBut it's not all smooth sailing for the athleisure icon. Indeed, one might even say easy growth is behind it. Management expects net revenue to be in the range of $11.1 billion to $11.3 billion for 2025, representing 5% to 7% growth. That's a far cry from the pandemic days when double-digit growth seemed to be the norm. Its North America segment is stagnant, and same-store sales aren't delivering fireworks like they used to. International is growing fast, especially in China, but it's not big enough to move the whole needle.\nThis slowdown in revenue growth has done more than just take a little air out of Lululemon's stock. It's let out over half the balloon. Shares are down to about $205 (at time of writing) from $390 to $410 earlier this year, even though annual revenue is still inching higher. Analysts expect annual revenue to reach $12.74 billion two years from now, a respectable gain, even if that's not the hypergrowth that Lululemon investors were used to in the past.\nStill, even as revenue growth slows, there's a bull case to be made for sticking with Lululemon for the long term. The stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio, currently around 13.4, is a major discount to its historical average. That gap alone suggests that the market has priced in slowing growth, which leaves room for expansion if margins hold steady and earnings keep climbing.\nA loyal customer base gives Lululemon pricing power that few apparel brands can match, and underpenetrated markets (like menswear and overseas) remain long-term levers the company can pull. It might take some time, but growth in those lanes could push earnings higher and sentiment back toward a premium valuation if management can execute well.\n2. MercadoLibre\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) is what you'd get if Amazon and PayPal merged, then set up shop in Latin America. Indeed, it's the dominant marketplace in a region where e-commerce and digital banking still have years -- maybe even decades -- of growth ahead.\nThe bull argument for MercadoLibre goes something like this. E-commerce penetration across the company's key markets -- such as Brazil and Mexico -- still trails developed economies, to say nothing of its expected expansion into smaller, still-unpenetrated Latin American countries (like Ecuador and Peru). Meanwhile, millions in Latin America lack bank accounts or credit access, and cash remains common. As more households shift from cash to digital money, its financial arm -- Mercado Pago -- could easily become an \"on-ramp,\" turning first-time users into repeat payers, and repeat payers into credit customers.\nCurrently, MercadoLibre dominates the Latin American market. According to data collected by eMarketer, it moves more merchandise than its next 15 competitors put together. And yet -- and this is a big one -- over two-thirds of online spending in Latin America is still up for grabs. That's a big opportunity for MercadoLibre, which will have the infrastructure and brand power to capture a huge chunk of it.\nOf course, we can't overlook potential headwinds. Currency and policy changes can make individual quarters lumpy, while tariffs and civil unrest in key markets could also cause hiccups and down periods. What matters for the long haul, however, is whether active buyers, total payment volume, and ad revenue can keep outgrowing costs, while take rates (the percentage or revenue that MercadoLibre keeps from each transaction) and margins hold steady.\nIf those dots connect -- and by the looks of it, they should -- MercadoLibre could be positioned to join Amazon in the trillion-dollar club in the next 15 years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in MercadoLibre right now?\nBefore you buy stock in MercadoLibre, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MercadoLibre wasn’t one of them.

However, the drugmaker may not be able to pull that off in 2025, because several setbacks this year have sunk its stock price. As of this writing, its shares are down 9% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up 9%.\nLilly is on track for its worst annual performance in a long time, but does that mean investors should steer clear of the stock? Let's find out.\nValuation matters\nIn the second quarter, Eli Lilly once again posted financial results that made it the envy of its similarly sized peers. Revenue increased by 38% year over year to $15.6 billion, while adjusted earnings per share came in at $6.31, 61% higher than the year-ago period. Yet the company's shares fell. What gives?\nThose strong results were already somewhat baked into the stock price. Even after its post-earnings dip, Lilly was recently trading at 30.6 times forward earnings, much higher than the 16.4 average for the healthcare industry. At these levels, it's hard to impress the market, whether with robust but expected financial results or with clinical progress.\nThe main reason Eli Lilly's shares dipped significantly after the earnings announcement is that the company also released other news on the same day. It posted data showing that its oral GLP-1 candidate, orforglipron, led to an average weight loss of 12.4% in a phase 3 study.\nThe race for oral GLP-1 drugs is heating up. This market is important because many patients prefer oral formulations of their medications, while pills are also cheaper for pharmaceutical companies to manufacture and store. However, orforglipron's phase 3 data was not quite up to the market's expectations, leading to the sell-off.\nLilly's shares also dropped significantly after its first-quarter earnings because of poor bottom-line guidance for the rest of 2025. Given the healthcare leader's rich valuation metrics, the market expects excellent execution across the board, whether in financial results or clinical and regulatory progress. But the company has had several missteps this year on those fronts, at least by its lofty standards, and that's why it hasn't performed well this year. Is it time to give up on the stock?\nWhere does Eli Lilly go from here?\nCan Lilly recover? In my view, despite the recent setbacks, its prospects remain attractive. True, there could be more volatility for the stock in the near term, considering that it's trading at a premium compared to its similarly sized peers. However, it's worth noting that Lilly has earned this premium by consistently posting incredibly strong financial results and making significant breakthroughs in the market for GLP-1 drugs, as well as in other areas.\nEli Lilly's best-selling drug is tirzepatide, sold under the brand names Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for obesity. Combined, they generated over $8 billion in sales in the second quarter, and over $14 billion through the first six months of the year -- and this for a compound that was approved only three years ago. It's an incredibly rare feat for a medicine to reach these levels of sales quickly -- or at all.\nHowever, it should maintain that momentum. According to some projections, Mounjaro and Zepbound could combine for nearly $62 billion in sales by 2030, making Eli Lilly the world's leading pharmaceutical company by revenue in the process.\nMeanwhile, Eli Lilly has other exciting products in its lineup that are already blockbusters, or should join those ranks down the line. Cancer medicine Verzenio posted $1.3 billion in sales in the second quarter, up 12% year over year. Newer products, including Ebglyss for eczema, should eventually contribute too.\nLilly's pipeline is strong, especially in its core areas of diabetes and obesity. Orforglipron could still be a hit. Retatrutide, a GLP-1 medicine with a novel mechanism of action -- it mimics the action of three gut hormones, versus two for tirzepatide -- also looks promising.\nClinical setbacks happen to every drugmaker. However, Lilly's extensive pipeline and expertise in developing therapies in specific areas make it likely to secure some important clinical and regulatory wins in the next few years. And the company should continue posting excellent financial results in the meantime.\nFinally, Eli Lilly is a solid dividend stock. All of these factors make it look like a buy, at least for investors who are in it for the long haul.\nShould you buy stock in Eli Lilly right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

The President was never inappropriate with anybody,\" she told Blanche. \"In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.\"\nMaxwell also said she was unaware of any efforts by Epstein to blackmail people he knew over any interactions they may have had with women or girls in his orbit.\nMaxwell said she could not recall specifics about an album of well-wishes she compiled for Epstein's 50th birthday, the existence of which was revealed after The Wall Street Journal reported that a \"bawdy\" letter sent to Epstein bore Trump's signature.\nTrump denied sending that letter and is suing the Journal for defamation over its report.\nMaxwell told Blanche said she did not remember the names of anyone who sent in letters, saying, \"It's been so long.\"\nAsked if she recalled Trump submitting a note, she said, \"I don't.\nMaxwell, who has asked the Supreme Court to take her appeal of her conviction, had been serving her sentence in a federal prison in Florida.\nBut after her interview with Blanche, she was transferred to a less-restrictive federal lockup in Texas, a move that was blasted by victims of Epstein.\nMaxwell, in her interview, poured cold water on Trump's efforts to closely link former President Bill Clinton to Epstein. Trump has suggested that Clinton visited Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands multiple times, which Clinton has denied. Epstein is known to have sexually abused many victims on that island.\nClinton \"absolutely never went\" to the island,\" Maxwell said.\n\"And I can be sure of that because there's no way he would've gone — I don't believe there's any way that he would've gone to the island, had I not been there,\" Maxwell said.\n\"Because I don't believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein. Did they speak? Did he go? Yes, but that's very different from going to spend time on an island.\"\nClinton, however, is known to have traveled on Epstein's private jet multiple times.\nMaxwell's attorney David Markus, in a statement about Friday's release of Blanche's interview, said, \"Ghislaine Maxwell is innocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted, in this case.\"\n\"The only reason she was ever charged is that she served as a scapegoat after Jeffrey Epstein died in prison,\" Markus said. \"Ms. Maxwell did not receive a fair trial. Jurors lied to get on the jury, and the outcome was tainted from the start.\"\n\"The materials newly released by the Department of Justice make this clear. Ms. Maxwell answered every question,\" the attorney said. \"She did not refuse to respond and did not dodge any question.

However, cuts to research funding in Boston and federal jobs in the nation’s capital could provide some challenges in the second half of the year.\nOn the West Coast, San Francisco was a standout performer with blended rent growth of 5.8% — the top in EQR’s portfolio. “This is a great example of where we saw a recovery in full force and drove very robust seasonal price acceleration, including the pullback on concessions,” Manelis said. “Tech jobs are steady with a lot of continued AI focus in the market.”\nSteady job growth in the tech sector, along with the return-to-office policies of employers like Amazon and Starbucks, is boosting Seattle. “As expected, supply pressure was felt in the city of Seattle and [the] Redmond submarket, which impacted some of our new lease pricing power,” Manelis said. “But the good news is that most of the concentrated deliveries are behind us.”\nAs other REITs noted, Los Angeles continued to underperform expectations, though occupancy is good. “Lackluster job growth, driven by a pretty weak entertainment sector along with the quality-of-life issues, are keeping pressure on demand,” Manelis said.\nSun Belt exposure\nIn Q2, EQR purchased an eight-property portfolio in Atlanta, giving it 22 assets and economies of scale in the metro area. “This is a market we have been favoring in our recent acquisition activity as we expect supply here to decline more quickly than in other Sunbelt markets,” Parrell said.\nOverall, EQR’s largely urban same-store portfolio of seven assets in Atlanta is performing within expectations for EQR.\n“The urban areas are experiencing a lot of new supply and concession use, but it appears that this submarket found the bottom as we have had a few months of stability with early signs of potential improving conditions,” Manelis said. “Our non-same-store properties … are more suburban focused, will join the same-store set next year and are performing at or slightly better than our underwritten expectations and clearly better than our urban Atlanta properties.”\nModest job growth and high levels of supply, especially downtown, are issues in Denver. “Concession use is heavy in the overall market,” Manelis said. “We have a good pace on our leasing volume, but a fair bit of price sensitivity and deal shopping is impacting new lease growth and making us prioritize retention and renewal rates.”\nBY THE NUMBERS\nEQR feels good about Dallas, where its newer non-same-store acquisitions won’t be competing with as much supply, according to Manelis. “Demand is strong due to better-than-average job growth in the market, but concessions are plentiful as the market absorbs supply, particularly in select submarkets,” he said.\nSupply is a constant theme throughout EQR’s expansion markets, including Austin, Texas, but those metros also are known as job engines.\n“Maybe with the exception of Atlanta, we don't think next year is necessarily the year that all these markets are going to turn around that we're in,” Parrell said. “We think the Sun Belt recovery is much more about absorption than about delivery dates and that the lease-up will take some time.”","content_hash":"326390d78bd35b0c6cfd660eeac66ff1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5453,"method_rank":0}

Over the last few weeks, Nvidia has been in the news regarding its China business, and most recently, Reuters reported that the company is developing a new chip for China.\nIn this article, we’ll look at some of the recent developments related to Nvidia’s China business and examine the company’s outlook.\nSuccessive U.S. Governments Have Clamped Down on NVDA’s Exports to China\nWhy Nvidia’s chips have been the building blocks for artificial intelligence (AI) models, they have also added a new dimension to the U.S.-China rivalry. President Joe Biden’s administration imposed restrictions on Nvidia’s export of advanced AI chips to China, citing fears over their dual military use. President Donald Trump’s administration went a step further and blocked the exports of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China. Nvidia had specifically designed these chips for China to meet the guidelines set by the U.S. government, and after the ban, it booked a charge of $4.5 billion in the first quarter of its fiscal 2026.\nWhy Is China an Important Market for Nvidia?\nChina was once Nvidia’s second-largest market, but U.S. export control restrictions have taken a toll on its business there. During the fiscal Q1 2026 earnings call in May, CFO Collete Kress said, “Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said multiple times that the export restrictions would only fuel chip innovation in China as rivals, particularly Huawei, catch up.\nWhile the Trump administration has allowed Nvidia to resume H20 exports to China, the company will need to share 15% of its China revenues with the U.S. government.\nThe unusual agreement left markets perplexed, as the ostensible reason the U.S. banned exports of advanced AI chips to China was because of national security concerns, and a cut in revenues does not help address that. Many see legal challenges to the revenue share agreement, and separately, lawmakers across the political divide have been critical of the export resumption.\nReports suggest that Nvidia is developing a new AI chip for China. Tentatively named B30A, it is said to be based on the company’s Blackwell architecture and would be more powerful than the H20, which is currently its most advanced chip sold in China.\nIn its response to the reports of the new chip for China, Nvidia said, “We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow.” It emphasized, “Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use.”\nChina Does Not Looks Too Welcoming of Nvidia’s H20\nMeanwhile, the Chinese government hasn’t been too welcoming of the H20 chip these days and has cautioned domestic companies against using these over fears of a U.S. government “backdoor.” Nvidia has denied any such claims, but it remains to be seen whether Chinese companies defy the government warning to buy the H20.\nNVDA Stock Forecast\nWall Street analysts are meanwhile not too perturbed by these concerns and have started raising Nvidia’s target price ahead of its upcoming earnings report. TD Cowen raised Nvidia’s target price to $235 and sees a “clean narrative” for the stock despite concerns over its China business.\nCantor Fitzgerald raised its target price from $200 to $240 as analyst C.J. Muse sees “seemingly insatiable” demand for AI compute. Mizuho raised its target price from $192 to $205, while Morgan Stanley raised its from $200 to $206. All three brokerages expect Nvidia to beat consensus estimates when it reports its fiscal Q2 2026 earnings next week.\nShould You Buy NVDA Stock?\nWhile Nvidia’s China business is shrouded in uncertainty, the company’s non-China business is doing incredibly well. The June quarter earnings calls of other Big Tech companies, which include the so-called hyperscalers, showed that companies are not slowing down their AI capex, and if anything, they are doubling down amid early signs of monetization.\nSovereign AI is yet another growth driver for Nvidia, as, given the growing importance of AI, major countries want to have more control over the technology. Huang has been globe-trotting for a reason and has been pitching sovereign AI on his trips to the Middle East and the European Union this year.\nNvidia trades at a forward price-earnings (P\/E) multiple of 45.2x, which does not look bloated in the context of the strong earnings growth that the company brings to the table.\nMoreover, markets never fully priced in a normal business environment for Nvidia in China, and any sales in the country would be incremental to Nvidia’s top line and bottom line despite the 15% revenue share with the U.S. government.\nOverall, while the noise over the China business might put pressure on Nvidia stock in the near term, I continue to stay invested in the company and will use any further weakness to add to my positions.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: NVDA.

Samsung and Amkor did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nA separate report from Reuters, citing sources, said that Nvidia had asked Foxconn — officially known as Hon Hai — to suspend work related to the H20s. Foxconn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn response to an inquiry from CNBC, an Nvidia spokesperson said, \"We constantly manage our supply chain to address market conditions.\"\nThe news further throws the return of the H20s to the China market in doubt, after Washington said it would issue export licenses to allow the export of the chip to China, after their shipments had effectively been banned in April.\nLast month, the Cyberspace Administration of China had summoned Nvidia over national security concerns related to the H20s and had asked the company to provide information on the chips.\nBeijing has raised concerns that the chips could have certain tracking technology or \"backdoors,\" allowing them to be operated remotely. In May, Republican U.S. Senator Tom Cotton and a bipartisan group of eight U.S. House representatives introduced the Chip Security Act that would require semiconductor companies like Nvidia to include security mechanisms and location verification in their advanced AI chips.\nSpeaking to reporters in Taiwan on Friday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged that China had asked questions about security \"backdoors,\" and that the company had made it clear they do not exist.\n\"Hopefully the response that we've given to the Chinese government will be sufficient. We're in discussions with them,\" he said, adding that Nvidia had been \"surprised\" by the queries.\n\"As you know, [Beijing] requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20s, for some time and I've worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses, and so hopefully this will be resolved,\" he said.\nNvidia, in its statement shared on Friday, said \"The market can use the H20 with confidence.\"\nIt added: \"As both governments recognize, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure. China won't rely on American chips for government operations, just like the U.S. government would not rely on chips from China. However, allowing U.S. chips for beneficial commercial business use is good for everyone.\"\nLast month, China had reportedly sent notices to major tech companies and AI developers urging them against the use of the H20s, especially for sensitive uses, particularly for government-related purposes, in what had appeared as a soft mandate. The Information later reported that Beijing had told some firms, including ByteDance, Alibaba and Tencent, to halt orders of the chips altogether, until the completion of a national security review.\nIt had been seen as a major win for Nvidia when Huang announced last month that the U.S. government would allow sales of the company's H20 chips to China. He had been lobbying against U.S. chip restrictions, which had impacted Nvidia's business in the lucrative market.\nIn his comments on Friday, Huang also disclosed some of his discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump over the company's overseas business, saying that he had \"informed the president of the importance of the American AI tech stack.\"\n\"You know, this is the beginning of a new industrial revolution, and during this time, AI developers, AI models, and AI applications supporting the American tech stack is very important,\" Huang said.\n\"I also explained that AI is going to advance around the world, with or without the United States, and it is important for us to maximize our AI export technology at a time when this industry is important,\" he added.\nNvidia said it had taken a $4.5 billion writedown on its unsold H20 inventory in May, after export restrictions kicked in, and said sales in its last financial quarter would have been $2.5 billion higher without any curbs.\nThe national security scrutiny the H20s are now facing from the Chinese side highlights Nvidia's difficulties in conducting its business amid trade uncertainty between Washington and Beijing.\nQingyuan Lin, a senior analyst covering China semiconductors at Bernstein, told CNBC in an email that if China completely bans the H20s, it would put Nvidia's over $20 billion of annual sales in China at risk.\nAssuming the company is still allowed to sell less advanced chips than H20 in the market, it should be able to capture some revenue in 2026, but demand will be further limited in 2027 as local supply capabilities ramp up, he added.\nChip industry analysts have also said Beijing's actions appear to reinforce its commitment to its own chip self-sufficiency campaigns and its intention to resist the Trump administration's plan to keep American AI hardware dominant in China.","content_hash":"c760e22d5481ede448f9d90caec2aa65","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5365,"method_rank":0}

It’s not about demand, nor is it about China, or even the usual AI narrative.\nInstead, it’s a potential shift that could change how quickly Nvidia is able to ramp up sales, while fattening up its margins in the process.\nMoreover, with expectations sky-high already, this quiet revamp could be an overlooked driver, making Nvidia’s Q2 earnings print one to watch more closely.\nWho is analyst John Vinh?\nJohn Vinh, managing director and equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, has a keen eye on the chip space and AI-infrastructure supply chains.\nAmong the stocks he covers closely is Nvidia, along with other chip names, and he has become a trusted voice on the sector.\nOn TipRanks, he attracts a 5-star rating, with an impressive 60% success rate and an 18.9% average return per rating. This makes him one of the top-ranked tech analysts tracked on the platform.\nFor perspective, Dan Ives of Wedbush fame has just a 49% success rate on the platform.\nKeyBanc’s John Vinh raises Nvidia target ahead of earnings on \"yields,\" not just AI\nAhead of Nvidia's Q2 earnings report on August 27, KeyBanc’s John Vinh lifted his Nvidia price target to $215 from $190, on the back of better manufacturing yields.\nSpecifically, Vinh cites the GB200 server rack yields nearing an incredible 85%, which means that more systems are breezing through QA and shipping faster.\nThat improved throughput has him raising his full-year rack shipment forecast to 30,000 units, up from 25,000.\nSimply put, Nvidia’s backlog is being converted into sales at a much quicker pace, on the back of more efficient execution at the factory level.\nSupply is catching up, too.\nBlackwell B200 availability has surged at an eye-catching 40% in Q2, and it's set to climb another 20% in Q3.\nThe rollout of Blackwell Ultra is also accelerating, potentially making up 50% of Blackwell shipments by October, resulting in a more diverse product mix.\nOn numbers, Vinh now sees Q2 sales at $47.1 billion (consensus estimate at $45.7 billion) but trims Q3 to $50.4 billion (consensus estimate at $53.5 billion), excluding China due to license uncertainty.\nIf we include China, he sees even greater upside of $2 billion to $3 billion, driven by H20 and RTX6000D (B40) shipments.\nWhy Nvidia is an AI juggernaut\nNvidia dominates the AI hardware stack with a whopping 80% market share, covering chips, systems, networking, and sticky CUDA software.\nThat grip naturally shows up in its financials. Nvidia posted $130.5 billion in FY2025 sales, more than 50% from last year, with U.S. hyperscalers deploying millions of accelerators in training and running their AI models.\nBlackwell is a big part of that impressive lead.\nNvidia’s new Blackwell B200\/GB200 platform is a beast, packing 208 billion transistors, a fresh Transformer Engine, and NVLink “super-highways” that let 576 GPUs act like one giant brain.\nThe result is that it efficiently delivers 30-times quicker inference and much speedier AI responses, like almost instantaneous chatbot replies.\nMemory is another massive leap. Blackwell uses HBM3e (High Bandwidth Memory 3e special stacked DRAM right next to a potent processor for ultra-fast data access), handling up to 288GB per GPU.\nAnalysts feel Blackwell could contribute 80% of Nvidia’s high-end shipments in 2025, while Nvidia is set to control north of 70% of HBM supply.\nNvidia Q2 preview: what to watch\nNvidia is set to report its fiscal year 2026 Q2 results Aug. 27, and here’s what Wall Street expects:\nRevenue: $45.7 billion to $45.9 billion (management guided for around $45 billion in sales)\nEPS: Roughly $1\nGross margin: 71.8% (marker); 5-year average is 66.2%.\nThe big swing factors?\nThe first is Data Center momentum, which has been massive over the past several quarters, particularly at $39.1 billion in Q1.\nSecond, there’s the early Blackwell ramp with more B200 chips flowing in and GB200 racks passing quality checks a lot quicker, pulling revenue forward.\nFinally, there’s the plumbing, where networking gear like NVLink switches and full racks are moving abroad with memory (HBM) and packaging bottlenecks.\nWall Street models expect Nvidia to beat Q2 numbers, where some see Q2 revenue hitting closer to $47 billion, but Q3 staying near $50 billion to $52 billion, depending on geopolitics.\nChina is still the wild card\nInvestors shouldn’t expect a clean boost from China in Nvidia’s guidance just yet.\nThe U.S. only started issuing H20 licenses on August 8, and reports surfaced from Beijing, where it discouraged its use for sensitive work.\nMeanwhile, Nvidia is cooking up a more robust Blackwell-based “B30A,” but still needs customer testing and volume.\nOn top of that, Washington is weighing a 15% revenue-share tax on China's AI-chip sales from Nvidia and AMD.\nAccording to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, despite the hurdles, the Commerce Department is still focused on getting the deal done.\n“The legality of it, the mechanics of it, is still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce, and I would defer you to them for any further details on how it will actually be implemented.”","content_hash":"f3c9cba10a21a9910f65be3892c4f0b1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5356,"method_rank":0}

The result is that \"the balance of risks appear to be shifting\" between the Fed's twin goals of full employment and stable prices.\nWhile he noted that the labor market remains in good shape and the economy has shown \"resilience,\" he said downside dangers are rising. At the same time, he said tariffs are causing risks that inflation could rise again — a stagflation scenario that the Fed needs to avoid.\nWith the Fed's benchmark interest rate a full percentage point below where it was when Powell delivered his keynote a year ago, and the unemployment rate still low, conditions allow \"us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,\" Powell said.\n\"Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" he added.\nThat was as close as he came during the speech to endorsing a rate cut that Wall Street widely believes is coming when the Federal Open Market Committee next meets Sept. 16-17.\nHowever, the remarks were enough to send stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed a gain of more than 600 points following the public release of Powell's speech while the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury note saw a 0.08 percentage point fall to around 3.71%.\nIn addition to market expectations, President Donald Trump has demanded aggressive cuts from the Fed in scathing public attacks he has lobbed at Powell and his colleagues.\nThe Fed has held its benchmark borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5% since December. Policymakers have continued to cite the uncertain impact that tariffs will have on inflation as a reason for caution and believe that current economic conditions and the slightly restrictive policy stance allow for time to make further decisions.\nImportance of Fed independence\nWhile not addressing the White House demands for lower rates specifically, Powell did note the importance of Fed independence.\n\"FOMC members will make these decisions, based solely on their assessment of the data and its implications for the economic outlook and the balance of risks. We will never deviate from that approach,\" he said.\nThe speech comes amid ongoing negotiations between the White House and its global trading partners, a situation often in flux and without clarity on where it will end. Recent indicators show consumer prices gradually pushing higher but wholesale costs up more rapidly.\nFrom the Trump administration's view, the tariffs will not cause lasting inflation, thus warranting rate cuts. Powell's position in the speech was that a range of outcomes is possible, with a \"reasonable base case\" being that the tariff impacts will be \"short lived — a one-time shift in the price level\" that likely would not be cause for holding rates higher. However, he said nothing is certain at this point.\n\"It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks,\" Powell said. \"Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\"\nIn addition to summarizing the current conditions and potential outcomes, the speech touched on the Fed's five-year review of its policy framework. The review resulted in several notable changes from when the central bank last performed the task in 2020.\nAt that time, in the midst of the Covid pandemic, the Fed switched to a \"flexible average inflation targeting\" regime that effectively would allow inflation to run higher than the central bank's 2% goal coming after a prolonged period of holding below that level. The upshot is that policymakers could be patient with slightly higher inflation if it meant insuring a more comprehensive labor market recovery.\nHowever, shortly after adopting the strategy, inflation began to climb, ultimately hitting 40-year highs, while policymakers largely dismissed the rise as \"transitory\" and not needing rate hikes. Powell noted the damaging impacts from the inflation and the lessons learned.\n\"As it turned out, the idea of an intentional, moderate inflation overshoot had proved irrelevant. There was nothing intentional or moderate about the inflation that arrived a few months after we announced our 2020 changes to the consensus statement, as I acknowledged publicly in 2021,\" Powell said. \"The past five years have been a painful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of necessities.\"\nAlso during the review, the Fed reaffirmed its commitment to its 2% inflation target. There have been critics on both sides of the issue, with some suggesting the rate is too high and can lead to a weaker dollar, while others seeing a need for the central bank to be flexible.\n\"We believe that our commitment to this target is a key factor helping keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored,\" Powell said.","content_hash":"0532851674a78c6eba79b6f36020c24f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5321,"method_rank":0}

According to CEO Natalie Wolfsen, the new locations follow a “workforce strategy” change over the past 18 months that included several rounds of layoffs.\nIn an interview at WealthManagement.com's New York City office, Wolfsen said the changes helped right-size the firm’s approach to remote vs. in-office work and transition from a closed suite of services.\n“You can only foster communities that allow you to do transformative things if you’re not siloed in your organization and deeply connected to your clients,” Wolfsen said.\nWhile Wolfsen stressed that she could “never say never” about potential future staff changes (noting that Orion operates in a “market-tied” industry), she acknowledged that the workforce strategy has “reached a point of its fruition” based on the company’s current standing.\nOrion conducted several rounds of layoffs before and after Wolfsen took the top post in 2024, leaving her role as CEO of AssetMark. In 2023, when founder Eric Clarke was still CEO, one round of layoffs was described as the “final action” in bringing several teams together from prior acquisitions.\nLast July, Orion introduced its back-to-office plan for employees, which includes three days a week in the office and “choice weeks,” in which employees can work wherever they want for a week at a time (each employee gets eight choice weeks per year and can take up to four weeks consecutively).\nAccording to Wolfsen, the choice weeks help employees travel on vacation with family while continuing to work or help an elderly parent recovering from a medical issue.\nAdditionally, earlier this month, Orion opened a new office in Lehi, Utah, moving to what the firm described as “the heart of Utah’s thriving tech corridor.” According to Orion, the location is closer to major business hubs. Wolfsen added that Lehi and the firm’s headquarters in Omaha, Neb. and Berwyn, Penn., were the company’s three largest locations.\nMeanwhile, the San Francisco office will focus on innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence and serve as “a support function for all of Orion and all of our locations,” said Orion Advisory Technology President Reed Colley, who is based there.\nCEO Wolfsen also tied the layoffs to her strategy to open Orion’s offerings to advisors with a la carte service options across its advisor technology and wealth management offerings, instead of the approach of a more closed system, or large-bundled offering she had inherited.\n“There was a strategy that we were going to have a closed system at Orion, where we were going to encourage people to only use our CRM, our financial planning,” she said. “When I came on as CEO, I changed that. ... Sometimes you just have a skill mix mismatch of the people that were really right for a strategy of the past, but are not right for the strategy of the future.”\nWolfsen said the move to a more flexible subscription model allows Orion to stay competitive across the range of advisor models while also attracting advisors for potential upgrades.\n“I’m a big believer in competition at all positions, and so sometimes financial advisors just want to use our CRM,” she said. “We [also] have an integrated client experience that we think is great, where they can be more efficient and effective, and they’ll grow in our ecosystem.”\nOne of those new heads is Colley, who joined Orion through the acquisition of his Summit Wealth Systems. Colley founded Black Diamond and then sold it to Advent Software—later acquired by SS&C. He put Orion’s focus on more open, flexible systems in the context of the industry’s broader shift toward fee-based or fee-only models.\n“So much of this goes back down to how you’re charging your clients and how that was such a revolutionary shift from closed systems and proprietary systems to more open systems,” he said. “All of that is great because it’s more choice for the end investors … but at the same time, you’re trying to get these economies to scale and scope as the markets mature.”\nMeeting the needs of enterprise-level and solo advisors will be an evolving challenge for advisor technology firms. Wolfsen said that, currently, Orion works with about 25,000 advisory firms, most of which are RIAs, and includes 17 of the 20 largest firms.\n“They’re all doing really inspiring things, as are the local entrepreneurs, who are building their own business,” she said. “The way that the industry is evolving is just incredibly fascinating right now, because you start from a history that was largely wirehouse, and then everything disaggregated, and now we’re kind of moving back.”\nDespite the changes to the sector, Wolfsen said advisors remain “highly independent,” and her goal is to offer them options within an integrated system.\n“Because we’re open API everything and we integrate with 500 providers, it means that we can appeal to a really broad part of the market,” she said. “I don’t think we’ll ever move away from that strategy. I mean, you never say never in this world, but it’s just fundamental to my beliefs about competition and remaining competitive, so that you’re constantly pressed to get better.”","content_hash":"dbbbde55204e5ebf00f5ad22b1b367f3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5278,"method_rank":0}

Xpeng Motors (XPEV), however, stands out among startup Chinese EV companies this year with YTD gains of 93%.\nThe company has impressed with strong deliveries, which rose to a record high last month, as well as an improvement in its financial performance. The company’s Q2 2025 earnings, released earlier this week, were also better-than-expected and helped justify its YTD outperformance over peers like Nio (NIO) and Li Auto (LI) as well as U.S.-based rival Tesla (TSLA).\nIn this article, we’ll examine why XPEV might continue its rally in 2025 and beyond.\nWill XPEV Stock Rise More in 2025?\nI have been bullish on XPEV for some time now, and the stock hasn’t disappointed me. Here are the five reasons I believe Xpeng Motors might continue its rally.\n1. Delivery Ramp Up with New Models\nThe company’s new models have been quite successful, and it is looking to launch several new models beginning with the refresh of the P7, for which it has received the highest preorders in its history. During the Q2 earnings call, Xpeng Motors’ CEO He Xiaopeng expressed optimism that the P7 would be among the top three selling models in the RMB 300,000 segment. He predicted that the company’s monthly deliveries, currently in the 30,000s, will surpass 40,000 beginning in September as it starts delivering the refreshed P7.\nIn December, Xpeng will introduce its X9 Kunpeng Super Electric Edition, its first extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) with an electric range of 450 kilometers and a combined range of 1,500 kilometers. EREVs are quite popular in China, and Xpeng Motors intends to launch more of these in the coming years. EREVs would help Xpeng Motors expand its total addressable market and would eventually lead to higher deliveries.\n2. International Expansion\nDespite tariffs in several regions, including Europe, Xpeng Motors’ overseas sales more than tripled in the first half of the year to 18,000 units, and it is now the top-selling Chinese startup EV brand in 10 markets, including Norway and France. Notably, Chinese automakers are gaining traction in Europe even as Tesla (TSLA) continues to lose market share there, in part due to CEO Elon Musk’s political entanglements.\n3. Strategic Partnerships\nXpeng Motors has expanded its partnership with Volkswagen (VWAGY) and expects the IP licensing revenues from the partnership to increase in the second half of 2025. The company is also open to global partnerships for its Turing artificial intelligence (AI) chip. The Volkswagen partnership and any further such deals would help buoy XPEV’s margins and cash flows.\n4. A Clear Path Toward Profitability\nXpeng Motors’ vehicle gross margins were 14.3% in Q2, 3.8 percentage points higher than the previous quarter. It marked the eighth consecutive quarter of an increase in margins, which is no small feat considering the price war in China. The company reiterated its guidance of achieving profitability in the final quarter of this year.\n5. Advancements in Autonomous Driving and Humanoids\nWhile currently none of the players in the EV race, including Tesla, have full L4 autonomous driving capabilities, Xpeng Motors is hopeful of mass-producing L4-capable vehicles in 2026. It also plans to launch pilot robotaxi services in some regions. During the Q2 earnings call, Xiaopeng said the company is “actively preparing for mass production” of its humanoid in the back half of next year. At the AI Tech Day later this year, Xpeng will unveil its next generation of humanoids. Xpeng Motors’ stock could see further rerating as it advances its autonomous driving and humanoid business.\nXpeng Motors’ Stock Forecast\nSell-side analysts have also been warming up to Xpeng Motors, and it now has a “Strong Buy” rating from 53% of analysts as tracked by Barchart, while the corresponding number three months back was under 44%. Xpeng Motors’ mean target price of $23.38 is 14.8% higher than the Aug. 20 closing price, while the Street-high target price of $30 is 47% higher.\nXpeng Motors trades at a forward enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 1.27x, which is higher than Chinese peers like Nio, Li Auto, and Zeekr (ZK). However, I believe Xpeng Motors has earned the right to trade at premium valuations due to its strong execution. Also, its progress in autonomous driving and robotics – which apparently are the key drivers of Tesla’s valuations – warrant a higher multiple. While not an apples-to-apples comparison, the corresponding multiple for Tesla is 10.19x. I believe Xpeng Motors (XPEV) is one Chinese company that comes quite close to Tesla in strategy as well as ambitions and has the potential to become the “Tesla of China” - a classification once reserved for Nio.\nOverall, I find Xpeng Motors as one of the best ways to play the EV, autonomous driving, and humanoid story in China and see the stock rising higher from these levels.\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: XPEV, LI, NIO, TSLA.

Autos will face the same rate, but only after the EU makes legislation changes to reduce its industrial duties.\nHowever, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic on Thursday suggested the framework was just the beginning, leaving the door open for future changes to the deal.\nMissing details\nDespite providing some much-needed clarity, there are still various smaller, yet crucial, aspects missing from the current framework.\nA muted market reaction from pharmaceuticals on Thursday highlighted investor skepticism and there was no mention of the wine and spirits sector in the deal.\n\"A lot of the details remain to be worked out,\" Penny Naas, who leads on the German Marshall Fund's allied strategic competitiveness work, told CNBC, pointing to for example so-called 'rules of origin.'\n\"These rules determine where value is most added to a product that contains multiple parts from multiple countries, and when it can be labeled 'European' or 'American,'\" she explained. Naas noted that these rules come into play when it comes to for example transshipments — a process in which goods might originate from one country, but are then sent to another for final shipment to the U.S.\nCarsten Brzeski, ING's global head of macro, meanwhile pointed out uncertainties \"stemming from formalities and procedures at customs,\" which he says are particularly impacting small and medium-sized enterprises.\nSome companies are already facing issues in this regard, with firms having to \"recruit tariff specialists in order to clarify the new customs requirements,\" he said.\nTrump's flip-flopping\nAnother concern is U.S. President Donald Trump's history of fact-paced changes of heart and policy shifts, Antonio Fatás, professor of economics at the European Institute of Business Administration (INSEAD), told CNBC.\nThe president for example doubled steep steel tariffs overnight, and later quietly expanded their scope.\nElsewhere, Switzerland was victim to the president's erratic decision making, with the country reportedly having been extremely close to a deal, which was then however pulled by Trump as he slapped 39% duties on Swiss exports to the U.S. almost overnight.\n\"The real issue for business is how to define a long-term strategy with a country that is no longer a reliable partner,\" Fatás said. \"What used to be the most reliable partner for Europe has now become one of the most volatile, if not the worst, when it comes to economic policies,\" he added.\nThe German Marshall Fund's Naas also flagged this as a risk for businesses.\n\"This deal does not include any enforcement provisions, nor will it be codified by Congress, which means it could change at the direction of the U.S. President,\" she said.\nNaas pointed to Section 232 tariffs as an example, with Trump having changed tariff rates on some products \"at a moment's notice, and the Administration has expanded the scope to cover other products without warning.\"\nTo trust or not to trust?\nBusinesses are therefore left with a key question: to trust or not to trust the deal.\nWhile Thursday's statement adds some clarity, the deal \"remains fragile and could quickly dissolve,\" ING's Brzeski said in a note after the announcement. \"The agreement contains numerous elements that could spark future tensions and escalation. Implementation, monitoring and enforcement of many of the intentions is not always clear,\" he added.\nNaas echoed the calls for caution. While the U.S.-EU agreement appears \"more likely to be stable\" than some of Trump's other tariff policies like sectoral duties, it \"will require the EU to remain on \"good behavior\" or else risk a sudden change,\" she said.\nIn addition to the uncertainties about the stability of the U.S.-EU deal, businesses are also contending with questions regarding various global shifts in the market, according to Gregor Hirt, multi-asset chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors.\nHe told CNBC businesses are facing several key questions: \"Is the US heading toward a recession or even worse, stagflation, and how resilient will companies' margin be in this kind of environment, especially considering the high market valuation in the US? Moreover, what further tools do policymakers have to counter a potential downturn, for example in terms of deregulation or specific sector 'incentives'?\"\n\"And, finally, how will the shift away from global trade liberalisation and institutionalize framework affect long-term investment and supply chain strategies?\" Hirt said, adding that these tariff-related issues are also key for companies ability to plan in the current environment.","content_hash":"eaafe501b7e5174467b3e2f2bb68af94","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5082,"method_rank":0}

Ample opportunity led workers to quit their jobs in record numbers for new employment, commanding big payouts from companies eager to attract talent.\nNow, amid high interest rates and economic uncertainty, job openings have fallen and employers are hiring at their slowest pace in more than a decade.\n\"Maybe employers are not feeling that they need to offer their new workers higher wages in order to get them, and workers have lost some bargaining power in the labor market,\" Groshen said.\nThe quits rate — the rate at which workers are voluntarily leaving their jobs — has also declined sharply. It has hovered around 2% since the start of the year, according to data from the U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Outside of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic, levels haven't been that consistently low since early 2016.\nThis is the primary reason why wage growth for job stayers has eclipsed that for job switchers, said Allison Shrivastava, an economist at the job site Indeed.\nA depressed quits rate suggests workers aren't voluntarily leaving their jobs to find better ones because they don't have confidence in doing so, Shrivastava said.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nTrump immigration policy may be shrinking labor force\nWorking longer to afford retirement is a risky plan\n'Job hugging' has replaced job-hopping\nIn this \"frozen\" labor market, in which there's not a lot of voluntary job-hopping, workers who are forced to leave a job involuntarily are more likely to accept a new job that doesn't pay as well, she said.\n\"They're more in a situation of taking what they can get,\" Shrivastava said.\nLong-term unemployment is increasing\nThis is especially true for workers who are considered long-term unemployed, economists said. Long-term unemployment is a period of joblessness lasting at least six months.\nAbout 25% of all jobless individuals in July were long-term unemployed, the highest share since February 2022, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nSuch people are generally no longer eligible for unemployment benefits, economists said.\n\"They may be willing to take a job for a lower wage than they were at the beginning,\" Groshen said.\nOverall, the best way for workers to improve their wages in aggregate is still probably by switching jobs, Shrivastava.\n\"But the opportunity to switch your job right now is not really there,\" she said.\nThere are ways for jobseekers to set themselves up for success in a tough hiring market, career experts said.\nAmong them: Find creative networking opportunities — conferences, seminars, lectures or book signings where other attendees are likely to be in your profession. Jobseekers can look internally for a new job placement, which may be easier than seeking out something external. They can focus on upskilling and reskilling to land a new job more easily when the market rebounds.","content_hash":"1b870daa94c34fe2939b0f8e34f584b3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5062,"method_rank":0}

The move marks Palihapitiya’s first new SPAC in several years, and a bid to reinsert himself into a market that has shown signs of life in 2025 after a deep post-boom slump.\nThe House Always Wins: You’ve Been Warned\nWhat makes this comeback different is the tone. The prospectus pointedly cautions retail investors by invoking the now-viral line that there’s “no crying in the casino,” and urging small investors to view any participation as a small, fully risk-losable slice of a diversified portfolio. That warning — aimed straight at the same crowd that turbocharged Palihapitiya’s prior deals — is unusual for SPAC marketing, and underscores how the post-mania reckoning reshaped sponsor rhetoric.\nThe disclosure, in its entirety, warns retail investors:\n“... we believe that this investment is most suitable for institutional investors, and retail investors should approach with caution, if at all. We believe that retail investors should only participate if (a) this investment is a small part of an otherwise diversified portfolio, (b) this investment is a quantum of capital they can afford to completely lose and (c) if they do lose their entire capital, they will embody the adage from President Trump that there can be ‘no crying in the casino.’”\nNo More Hefty Kick-SPACs\nThe economic deal also departs from traditional SPAC economics. According to coverage of the filing, Palihapitiya’s sponsor promote is 30% rather than the customary 20%, but it vests only if the merged company trades at least 50% above the $10 IPO price (or earlier upon a change of control). Santander U.S. Capital Markets is listed as the underwriter. Those features attempt to answer a common critique from the last cycle — namely, that sponsors profited handsomely even when public investors suffered.\nContext matters here. The SPAC window has indeed reopened in 2025, aided by choppy traditional IPO conditions and a fresh round of serial sponsors. By mid-year, SPACInsider tallied 63 SPAC IPOs (19 in Q1 and 44 in Q2), and SPACs accounted for roughly 39% of all U.S. IPOs through June — far from the 2021 frenzy, but a decisive rebound from the 2023–2024 drought.\nSEC and the City\nRegulation is tougher, too. The SEC’s 2024 final rules now strip most blank-check deals of the forward-looking statements safe harbor, and demand enhanced projection and sponsor-conflict disclosures in both SPAC IPOs and de-SPACs. These changes are meant to align de-SPACs more closely with traditional IPO standards, and any AEXA deal will have to thread that needle.\nPalihapitiya’s record will loom over this effort. He helped bring SoFi (SOFI) public in 2021 — a rare bright spot in the SPAC market and a stock that, at various points, has traded above its $10 base price—but many of his other high-profile de-SPACs, like Virgin Galactic (SPCE), Opendoor (OPEN), and Clover Health (CLOV), later slid well below their debut prices. Two of his vehicles — Social Capital Hedosophia IV (IPOD) and VI — were ultimately liquidated in 2022, returning about $1.5 billion to investors after failing to find targets before their deadlines. The mixed legacy has made him both a symbol of the boom’s promise and its pitfalls.\nStill, Palihapitiya’s pitch is consistent with the argument he has made since his first SPAC in 2017: that blank-check vehicles can broaden access to public capital for innovative companies and serve as a “viable alternative” to banker-driven IPOs, especially in volatile markets.\nWhether investors embrace AEXA will hinge on three things many SPACs struggled with last cycle: identifying a target with durable fundamentals; persuading shareholders not to redeem en masse; and structuring a transaction that can thrive under new SEC rules and higher-for-longer rates. The unusually blunt note to retail buyers in the prospectus suggests the sponsor knows the burden of proof is higher this time.\nIn short: the “SPAC King” is back, but the court has changed. AEXA bundles a hot-button investment theme — “American exceptionalism” — with a tighter regulatory regime, a chastened investor base, and sponsor economics meant to look more aligned. Whether that alchemy can produce a durable public company, and not just a headline, will be the real test of Chamath’s second act.\nOn the date of publication, Caleb Naysmith did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The pound has gained around 7.2% against the U.S. dollar in the year to date, while losing 4.3% against the euro, with some significant bumps along the way. GBP= YTD line GBP\/USD 'Bizarre behavior' Part of the picture is dollar weakness arising from a broad rotation out of U.S. assets , which has benefited both sterling and the euro. But the economic and geopolitical backdrop entangling the U.K. in recent months have clouded the picture for the British currency. Earlier this year, the U.K. became the first country in the world to sign a trade deal with the Trump administration following the president's unveiling of his so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Meanwhile, stronger-than-anticipated economic growth , rising consumer confidence and business momentum helped stir a tone of cautious optimism among some investors. On the downside, markets have been contending with Britain's lackluster labor market , concerns about the country's finances and political U-turns from the ruling Labour party. In emailed comments on Friday, Arturo Bris, a professor of geopolitics and finance at Switzerland's IMD Business School, labeled the British pound \"the currency that presents the most bizarre behaviour during 2025.\" \"That the U.K. reached a relatively favorable tariff deal with the U.S. helps [the case for the pound],\" Bris told CNBC. \"However, in the middle of political turbulence, post-Covid difficulties of the British economy, and growing pessimism about the future of the U.K. economy, capital has flown out of the country … showing that British money is looking for safer markets.\" Following a hotter-than-expected inflation print earlier this week, markets began to reduce their bets on the Bank of England continuing its rate-cutting cycle this year, with capital markets now overwhelmingly expecting the central bank to keep rates steady through 2025, according to LSEG data. The pound's trajectory since then has created fresh difficulty for FX traders, according to Kamal Sharma, a senior FX strategist at Bank of America. \"As you'd expect, as the market pared back rate cuts, sterling rallied — and then suddenly, out of nowhere, we saw quite a big move in the opposite direction,\" he said over a phone call. \"Trying to pinpoint that is difficult.\" Sharma noted that, for much of the year, markets had taken a bearish position on sterling — but he argued that, in his view, the pessimism was \"probably excessive\" and anchored in a view that \"the U.K.'s fiscal position remains quite perilous.\" Amid rebellion from some lawmakers within her own party over proposed welfare cuts, U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves has limited fiscal capacity to fund her spending plans, leading to widespread speculation that tax rises are inevitable . Analysts polled by Reuters earlier this month broadly expected the pound to reach $1.37 by the end of January — but forecasts among top contributors varied from $1.22 to $1.42. For his part, BoA's Sharma has a price target of 0.82 euros per pound by the end of the year and sees Cable reaching $1.40. Sterling was last seen trading at around 0.865 euros and $1.156. \"The [economic] data is now starting to show some signs of stabilizing,\" he said on Friday. \"We still think there will be some more rate cuts in the U.K. in November, but ultimately, this is about terminal rate pricing as well … there's lots of positives for the euro, both against the dollar and against sterling.\" He said markets appeared to be looking ahead to 2026 as the \"seminal game-changing event for the European economy,\" thanks to huge fiscal spending plans from Germany , ramped-up defense spending and a potential improvement to the integration of regional capital markets. \"With the pound, it does seem that the market is taking a very much a glass half empty rather than glass half full approach — I think it is all pretty excessive, but from an outsider's perspective and non-U.K. perspective, it's a compelling reason to be short sterling,\" Sharma added. He said he was taking the view that sterling would benefit from U.K. goods being subject to lower \"reciprocal\" U.S. tariffs than any other nation. \"What this all boils down to is we need more growth,\" Sharma told CNBC. \"If we can deliver a bit more productivity in the next couple of months, that may encourage investors to dial back some of that pessimism.\" Javier Corominas, director of global macro strategy at Oxford Economics, meanwhile took a more pessimistic approach to sterling than Sharma. \"We expect GBP\/USD to consolidate at current levels over the summer, before converging to the 1.25-1.30 range in Q4,\" he said in a July 8 note, to which he pointed CNBC when asked on his views on Friday. \"GBP\/USD was driven by dollar weakness, rather than underlying pound strength in H1. Our fundamental valuation anchors now point to an overvalued pound.\"","content_hash":"ab6856a82a8fd311f573500af5484381","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5025,"method_rank":0}

Intel's stock soared following the remarks, finishing the trading day up nearly 6%. The stock was trading down around 1% in after-hours trading following Intel's confirmation of a deal.\n\"The government's investment in Intel will be a passive ownership, with no Board representation or other governance or information rights,\" Intel said in its announcement. \"The government also agrees to vote with the Company's Board of Directors on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.\"\nA struggling American tech giant whose CEO came under political scrutiny\nIntel has seen its market share decline as foreign rivals like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company grow.\nThe company is attempting a turnaround, and its CEO recently found himself caught up in political crosshairs.\nTrump met with Intel's CEO earlier this month at the White House after calling for Tan's \"immediate\" resignation due to his reported investments in Chinese companies. Following the meeting, Trump sounded a much different tone, praising Tan's \"amazing story.\"\nTrump talked about some of his recent deal discussions with Tan in his White House remarks on Friday.\n\"I said, you know what, I think the United States should be given 10% of Intel,\" Trump said. \"And he said, I would consider that. I said, well, I'd like you to do that because Intel's been left behind as, you know, compared to Jensen.\"\n\"I said I think it would be good having the United States as your partner. He agreed. And they've agreed to do it, and I think it's a great deal for them, and I think it's a great deal,\" Trump added.\n\"He walked in wanting to keep his job, and he wound up giving us $10 billion to the United States. So we picked up $10 billion,\" Trump said. \"And we do a lot of deals like that. I'll do more of them.\"\nEarlier in the week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the US would not use any stake in Intel to pressure companies.\n\"Yeah, the last thing we're going to do is put pressure, is to take a stake and then try to drum up business,\" Bessent said during an interview on CNBC.\nTrump has repeatedly criticized the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, but like his predecessor, he wants to increase the share of semiconductors made in the US.\n\"A revitalized US chip industry will generate thousands of high-paying jobs, reinforce our technological leadership, and protect our supply chains from disruption by foreign rivals,\" reads Trump's AI Action Plan, which was published last month.\nSemiconductors are difficult to manufacture, especially the more advanced a chip becomes. Still, they are a major component in everything from smartphones to AI. Global chip shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened concerns that the US is too reliant on foreign production for the cornerstone of modern technology. Intel is one of just a handful of US companies that both manufactures and designs chips.\nThe US taking a stake in Intel illustrates the White House's growing support for aggressive intervention into the private sector. The US holds a so-called \"golden share\" in United States Steel Corp, and the Pentagon announced in July that it would take a $400 million preferred equity stake in MP Materials Corp, a US-based rare earth producer.\n\"As the only semiconductor company that does leading-edge logic R&D and manufacturing in the US, Intel is deeply committed to ensuring the world's most advanced technologies are American-made,\" Intel CEO Tan said in the Friday announcement.","content_hash":"b52fb08ecb8370a012ec448a5bc66af5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4977,"method_rank":0}

Only three companies have ever achieved this valuation: Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. However, there's one company that I think is bound to join this group soon, and it's nearly unstoppable: Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\nAlphabet is one of the top companies in the world, yet it isn't respected as much as many of its big tech peers because its core business is seen as vulnerable to disruption. However, it is proving each quarter that it will be just fine, making it inevitable that Alphabet will be a member of the $3 trillion club shortly.\nGoogle Search is still doing well despite investors' fears\nAlphabet is the parent company of many brands, but its most notable is Google. The Google Search engine accounted for over half of Alphabet's revenue in Q2, so this platform must continue doing well. However, the market is uncertain of that outcome.\nMany are worried that generative AI will replace Google Search, and there is already some anecdotal evidence that Google Search lost some users. Still, there is a massive chunk of the population that hasn't made the switch and is unlikely to, especially after Google integrated AI search overviews, which combine a generative AI summary with a traditional search experience. So far, this approach seems to be working, as Google Search's revenue rose 12% year over year in Q2. Growth like that normally doesn't occur in failing businesses, so the calls for Google's downfall were likely premature.\nAlphabet's other properties are also seeing a lot of strength, most notably Google Cloud. Google Cloud is Alphabet's cloud computing wing, and it's seeing a ton of demand thanks to tailwinds in the AI realm. Its servers have become the top option for many in the AI world, including competitor OpenAI, the producer of ChatGPT. Google Cloud increased revenue by 32% in Q2 and posted an operating margin of 21% in the quarter. While it only makes up about 14% of Alphabet's total revenue, this is a key division to watch as its rapid growth will allow it to become a much larger part of Alphabet's revenue over the next five years.\nOverall, Alphabet is posting solid results, with revenue rising 14% year over year and diluted earnings per share (EPS) rising 22%. There aren't many big tech companies that can match those results, yet Alphabet still trades at a discount due to fears of generative AI disrupting its business.\nAlphabet's stock is cheap compared to its peers\nAlphabet's stock is rather cheap, trading for 20.5 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's 24.1.\nUnlike many of the other big tech stocks, Alphabet doesn't have a valuation risk, making it an intriguing buy today. Furthermore, if Alphabet's valuation were to rise to 24 times forward earnings, it would be worth $2.9 trillion, almost breaking the $3 trillion threshold.\nAfter a few more successful quarters, this will easily allow Alphabet to cross over the $3 trillion threshold. If Alphabet were somehow to earn a premium in the market, it would allow for even more upside.\nOn another point, Alphabet generates the most profits of any big tech company.\nSo, if all stocks had the same valuation, Alphabet would actually be the largest company in the world.\nWhile I don't envision this scenario happening, it's critical to know that even with all of the challenges Alphabet faces, it's still the most profitable company in the world and produces a ton of free cash flow that can easily be reinvested in its product to ensure that it stays on top. Writing Alphabet off now is causing many investors to miss a no-brainer stock, and it could easily be worth $3 trillion by the end of the year, if not sooner.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Four justices, all conservatives, said they would have granted the Trump administration's application in full, while four others — conservative Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's three liberals — would have denied it in full.\n\"As today's order states, the District Court likely lacked jurisdiction to hear challenges to the grant terminations, which belong in the Court of Federal Claims,\" Barrett wrote in a concurring opinion. But, she added, \"the Government is not entitled to a stay of the judgments insofar as they vacate the guidance documents.\"\nThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a collection of agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services that receives billions of dollars from Congress to fund medical research at universities, hospitals and other institutions.\nWhen President Donald Trump took office in January, he vowed to end so-called diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies, saying that rather than fostering equality as intended, they are a form of discrimination, primarily against white people. He has also taken aim at policies recognizing transgender rights, including access to gender transition care.\nThe NIH then conducted a review of grants and determined that more than 1,700 of them were not consistent with Trump's directives and terminated them, including studies into HIV prevention and gender identity among teens.\nThe moves were challenged by 16 states led by Massachusetts and the American Public Health Association, among others.\nAfter a trial, U.S. District Judge William Young in Massachusetts ruled that the government had failed to follow correct legal processes in implementing the policy, in violation of a law called the Administrative Procedure Act.\nIn rushing to implement Trump's agenda, NIH \"simply moved too fast and broke things, including the law,\" Young wrote.\nHe also said that DEI was \"an undefined enemy,\" noting that government lawyers had not been able to explain exactly what it meant.\nRead more NBC News\nYoung found that there was \"pervasive racial discrimination\" and \"extensive discrimination\" against gay, lesbian and transgender people in how grants were selected for termination. He also found \"an unmistakable pattern of discrimination against women's health issues.\"\nYoung declined to put his ruling on hold, as did the Boston-based 1st U.S Circuit Court of Appeals, which also kept the grants intact.\nIn asking the Supreme Court to intervene on behalf of the Trump administration, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the case is similar to another that arose in Massachusetts in which a judge blocked Trump administration plans to terminate teacher training grants on anti-DEI grounds.\nThe Supreme Court in April blocked that ruling on a 5-4 vote.\n\"This application presents a particularly clear case for this court to intervene and stop errant district courts from continuing to disregard this court's rulings,\" Sauer wrote.\nLawyers for the states pushed back on Sauer's narrative, saying it \"bears little resemblance to reality, with Young's ruling a \"run-of-the mill\" example of a court intervening when the government violates the law.\nThe justices Thursday disagreed over whether the April decision governed the outcome in the latest case.\nIn a brief opinion, Roberts, who dissented in the earlier case, said it was different, with Young's findings \"well within the scope of the district court's jurisdiction.\"\nBut conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, in his own separate opinion, criticized Young for failing to abide by the April decision.\n\"Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court's decisions, but they are never free to defy them,\" he wrote.\nThe Trump administration has regularly turned to the Supreme Court when its broad use of executive power is challenged in court and has prevailed in the majority of cases. Trump and his allies have also harshly criticized judges who have ruled against him.","content_hash":"3fd9cd589deae4896a1353e48b83b2f5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4852,"method_rank":0}

The investigation began during the Biden administration, but did not go further before President Joe Biden left office in January.\nTen FBI agents were seen exiting Bolton's office on M Street, with boxes in hand, around 1:40 p.m. ET.\nA person close to Bolton told NBC News they believe the raids are in response to Bolton's frequent criticism of the Trump administration, which includes his book \"The Room Where it Happened.\"\n\"It's retribution, pure and simple,\" that person told NBC.\nBolton served as Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019.\nAn FBI official told NBC on Friday, \"The FBI is conducting court authorized activity in the area. There is no threat to public safety.\"\nThat statement indicates a judge signed a search warrant for Bolton's residence in Bethesda, just outside of Washington.\nIt was not known if Bolton was home at the time of the raid there, which began at around 7 a.m. ET. A woman who appeared to be Bolton's wife was at the residence. He showed up at the home mid-afternoon Friday.\nAbout a half hour after the raid began, Bolton tweeted about Russia and its war on Ukraine, writing that Trump will continue pushing for meetings on the conflict \"because Trump wants a Nobel Peace Prize, but I don't see these talks making any progress.\"\nFBI Director Kash Patel tweeted, \"NO ONE is above the law… @FBI agents on mission\" at the same time his agents were raiding Bolton's home.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi retweeted Patel's tweet, writing, \"America's safety isn't negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.\"\nAnd Patel's deputy director at the FBI, Dan Bongino, in his own post on X wrote, \"Public corruption will not be tolerated.\"\nTrump later told reporters that he did not know about the raid, but that he expected to be briefed about it later Friday.\nThe president also said he is \"not a fan of John Bolton,\" and called him a \"lowlife.\"\nThe New York Post first reported the raid.\nPatel ordered the investigation into Bolton, according to the Post, which cited a Trump administration official.\nTrump lashed out against Bolton on Aug. 13 after his former advisor criticized the president for agreeing to host a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss how to end Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\"Very unfair media is at work on my meeting with Putin. Constantly quoting fired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton, who just said that, even though the meeting is on American soil, 'Putin has already won,'\" Trump wrote on Truth Social that day. \"What's that all about? We are winning on EVERYTHING.\"\nOn Aug. 17, after he met with Putin, Trump wrote, \"This war can be ended, NOW, but stupid people like [Sen.] Chris Murphy, John Bolton, and others, make it much harder to do so.\"\nTrump canceled Bolton's protective detail from the U.S. Secret Service after he was sworn in for his second term in the White House in January. Bolton had been under Secret Service protection because of plots by Iran to kill him.\nTrump was previously indicted in federal court in Florida on charges related to his retention of classified government records at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach after leaving the White House in January 2021, and with his efforts to thwart their recovery by government officials.\nTrump said on Sept. 10, 2019, that he had effectively fired Bolton the prior evening.\n\"I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions, as did others in the Administration,\" Trump wrote in a tweet that day. \"Therefore I asked John for his resignation, which was given to me this morning. I thank John very much for his service.\"\nThe Justice Department dropped that case in late 2024, shortly after Trump was elected president, because of a department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.\nThe Justice Department sued Bolton in 2020 in an effort to block the publication and sale of his book \"The Room Where it Happened,\" which was a damning account of his time as Trump's national security advisor. The lawsuit was filed during Trump's last year of his first term.\nA Justice Department lawyer told a judge that year that the book was \"a flagrant breach of\" Bolton's agreement not to write about classified matters.\nThe department dropped the lawsuit in June 2021, five months after Biden took office.\nBolton served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the administration of President George W. Bush.","content_hash":"c1b99a92384fe5e836791d3a682d1a26","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4845,"method_rank":0}

New Delhi has pushed back, saying the U.S. administration requested the purchases to keep the markets calm, while pointing to the U.S. and European Union's continued trade with Russia.\nRussian embassy officials in New Delhi reportedly said Wednesday that oil shipments to India will continue despite U.S. pressure, adding that Moscow hoped a trilateral meeting with India and China would take place soon.\n\"Despite the political situation, we can predict that the same level of oil import [by India],\" Roman Babushkin, the charge d'affaires at the Russian embassy in India, told a press briefing.\n\"Russia has been a close strategic partner of India since the 1970s and the Trump administration's tariff threats are not going to change that,\" said Daniel Balazs, a research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.\n\"On the contrary, it might even act as a catalyst,\" Balazs added, prompting New Delhi to agree to a trilateral meeting that Moscow sought to broker with China.\nIndia was the second-largest buyer of Russian oil, importing 1.6 million barrels per day in the first half of this year, up from 50,000 bpd in 2020, though still trailing China's 2 million bpd imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nWashington has not placed secondary tariffs on China for its Russian oil purchases. When asked about China's role in Russian oil purchases, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that Beijing's imports were considered to be less egregious because it had already been a major buyer even before Russia invaded Ukraine.\nBy contrast, Washington has escalated criticism of India in recent days, accusing the nation of profiteering from cheap Russian crude and threatening higher tariffs on Indian goods.\nCeasefire on the line\nTrump's true agenda appears to have little to do with Washington's stated goal of curbing Moscow's oil revenues, but extracting leverage from these trading partners, according to several geopolitical experts. These include securing a trade deal with New Delhi while pushing Putin for a ceasefire pact in Ukraine.\nLast week, Trump rolled out a red carpet to greet Putin on his first visit to the U.S. in about a decade, sharing a ride with him in the presidential limousine to the venue. The meeting was held in Alaska, which was once a part of Russia.\nThe meeting did not appear to have produced meaningful steps toward a ceasefire in Ukraine and the Russian government has reiterated its opposition to any short-term ceasefire deal with Ukraine.\nSpeaking at the joint news briefing Thursday, Lavrov said he had briefed Indian officials on those talks.\n\"India's approach continues to emphasize dialogue and diplomacy as essential to resolving differences,\" Jaishankar said.","content_hash":"7ab8be83b9846585f46cb456e75d344b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4531,"method_rank":0}

It's Fed day. Wall Street will be hyper-focused on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell has to say today during his speech at the central bank's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In a piece yesterday afternoon , we looked at how this week's market scrambled conventional wisdom on what a Fed rate cut would mean for tech stocks. 2. Lots of Nvidia headlines swirling this morning: CEO Jensen Huang said the AI chipmaker is in talks with the U.S. government to ship a chip more advanced than the H20 to China. However, The Information reported that Club name Nvidia told suppliers to stop production of components for the H20 chip due to China's security concerns. 3. Off-price retail chain Ross Stores reports a mixed quarter with a slight revenue miss and earnings per share above the Street. Comparable store sales increased 2%. Club name TJX Companies' earnings this week were far cleaner and stronger. 4. TJX was highlighted by The Wall Street Journal alongside Walmart and fellow Club stock Amazon as three relative retail winners during the trade war. The WSJ's reasoning: They can keep costs down and \"ease the burden on stressed-out consumers.\" While we couldn't agree more, we'd add Club name Costco to the list too. Retailers need scale and value to thrive right now. 5. Intuit shares fell 6% this morning despite the TurboTax and QuickBooks owner reporting better-than-expected quarterly results. The board also approved a new $3.2 billion share repurchase program and increased the dividend. 6. Workday was also unable to shake off the negative sentiment around enterprise software. The HR management software provider beat quarterly expectations, but analysts say the subscription guidance raise was due to an acquisition, not strengthening results. Club stock Salesforce has also been a victim of the AI-related overhang on enterprise software. 7. Piper Sandler raised its price target on Club name Broadcom to $315 a share from $300 and reiterated its overweight buy rating on the custom AI chipmaker. Analysts continue to see Broadcom as an AI winner and well-positioned into the October quarter on both its chip business and software unit led by VMWare. 8. Alphabet's Google Cloud won a six-year, $10 billion contract from Meta Platforms to help support its AI infrastructure. Meta, which we've long owned for the Club, previously relied on Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure for cloud services, in addition to its own data centers. 9. More Meta news: The Instagram parent has poached Apple AI executive Frank Chu for its Superintelligence Labs even as it slows the pace of AI hiring, Bloomberg News reported . Chu is at least the sixth AI-focused Apple employee to bolt for Meta, Bloomberg said. While Apple share have perked up lately, investors still crave better AI strategy and implementation. 10. Barclays upgraded Ulta Beauty to an overweight buy rating from equal weight and raised its PT to $589 from $518. Analysts see upward earnings revision coming over next few quarters as the company's turnaround efforts take hold under new CEO Kecia Steelman.

Justice Department attorney Ed Martin also urged Chair Jerome Powell to fire Cook from her post and confirmed a criminal investigation will take place.\nThe central bank official rejected the idea of resignation Wednesday, saying in a statement she has \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"\nCleveland Fed President Beth Hammack told CNBC on Friday that she stood by Cook, noting: \"I know Lisa Cook to be an outstanding economist and a person of high integrity, and I think it's critically important that the Fed maintains its independence on monetary policy so we can ensure great outcomes for the American public.\"\nThe latest developments have fanned concerns on Wall Street surrounding the Fed's independence. Trump has notably been a vocal critic of Powell, nicknaming him \"too late\" with regards to the timing of modifying interest rates and accusing him of being \"political.\"\nAlthough Trump has said that it's \"highly unlikely\" he would fire Powell before his term as chair is up in May 2026, the president has already started considering several candidates to succeed him and just last week threatened to allow a \"major lawsuit\" against Powell to proceed while pushing for lower rates yet again.\nThe Fed, which has maintained a strictly data-dependent stance, has kept rates steady since December.\nTrump also pressed Cook to resign this week in the wake of the accusations. He even said Friday that he will fire her if she does not leave her post. The odds that Cook will be out as governor this year spiked on prediction market Kalshi following those comments, rising to more than 30% from roughly 21% earlier in the day.\nFormer Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren thinks more information is needed before a decision — by Cook or the administration — is made.\n\"I don't know what Lisa Cook is going to choose to do. It is a difficult situation for her, but today we have allegations but no facts,\" Rosengren said Friday on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\" \"Until there's some facts out, I don't think people should draw any conclusion.\"\nSafeguarding independence\nWhen asked about the pressure that the Fed is facing, including the resignation calls against Cook, former Fed Vice Chair Roger Ferguson emphasized the importance of the institution educating the American public on \"what it does and why it's important\" as well as \"why we've gone through a period of inflation.\"\n\"People for the first time literally in 30 or 40 years had to deal with that, so everyone now understands, 'Wow, this inflation thing is a secret tax on the middle-income and … lower-class individuals,\" he said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday. \"The Fed is the institution whose mandate is to control inflation, as well as the other side, and so I turn this around and say it's really time for all of us to educate the American people. That's the way we ensure independence.\"\nFerguson added that it hasn't turned out well in places around the world where central bank independence has been undermined. For the U.S., he's still optimistic about the Fed's future in that regard.\n\"I think it maintains independence because the population will get behind and say, 'Wait a minute, we had inflation, it's not a good thing, we need an independent Fed to maintain that. Congress, etc., do your job, protect the Fed as best you can,'\" he remarked.","content_hash":"96664d7a1520f6eae9b3704c60e5645c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3723,"method_rank":0}

TSMC had been promised $6.6 billion under the act to help build its three cutting-edge chip fabrication plants in Arizona.\nLutnick confirmed in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that the government was in talks to take a 10% equity stake in troubled semiconductor company Intel, and said the administration might consider stakes in other firms as well.\nA report from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, however, said the government had no plans to seek shares in semiconductor firms that were increasing their U.S. investments, citing a government official. TSMC, in March, announced an expansion of its Investment in the United States to $165 billion.\nSeparately, Huang said that Nvidia was eager to begin work on \"NVIDIA Constellation\" — a recently announced new Taiwan office for the company to house its growing Taiwan workforce.\nHuang said the company was still working with the local government to resolve some issues to start its construction.\n\"We have many, many employees here in Taiwan, and we're growing here in Taiwan because our supply chain is so busy here.\"\n\"We're working with chip companies, system vendors and system makers all over Taiwan, and everybody is working so hard for us and so we need a lot of engineers to work alongside them,\" he added.\nShares in TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, have gained 6.5% so far this year.\nSeparately, news reports on Friday said Nvidia had asked some of its component suppliers to stop production related to its made-for-China H20 graphics processing units, after China raised security concerns over the chips.\nLast month, Nvidia said it expected to receive an export license for its H20 chips, which had been effectively banned in April. However, Beijing has reportedly placed a freeze on local companies' ability to buy them.\nAccording to Reuters, one of the companies told to pause their work in relation to the H20 chips was Taiwan's Foxconn — also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry. Foxconn did not respond to an inquiry from CNBC on the matter.\nHuang on Friday said that the company had responded to Beijing's concerns regarding its H20s and was hoping that the issue would be resolved.","content_hash":"ad63bd0d99a9c189d6d68c717954a79b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3649,"method_rank":0}

Market moves : Stocks were headed for a positive week, thanks to a big rally on Friday in reaction to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell 's speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium. Heading into the address, the market was unsure if Powell was going to hint at a possible interest rate cut at next month's central bank policymaking meeting. So, the market jumped upon hearing Powell talk about growing downside risks in the labor market and how the \"shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\" Powell's remarks lifted stocks and pushed bond yields lower as traders increased their bets around multiple rate cuts before year-end. The market's surge Friday is playing out like we discussed late Thursday, with the more dovish Fed unleashing rallies in cyclical, more economically sensitive stocks that stand to benefit the most from lower rates. Some of the biggest gainers in the portfolio Friday were Capital One , DuPont , and Home Depot . The laggards were defensive groups like consumer staples, utilities, and health care. Within the portfolio, Bristol Myers Squibb , Costco , and TJX Companies trailed the broader market. Bids coming : Starbucks expects to receive non-binding offers for a stake in its China business within the next two weeks, according to Reuters. Private equity firms Carlyle, EQT, Hillhouse Investment, and Primavera Capital were named in the story as interested partners. Bain Capital and Chinese tech giant Tencent were mentioned, too. It's another sign of progress in Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround. Quantum note : We mentioned in Wednesday's Homestretch the reports around Honeywell and other investors seeking a funding round for the quantum unit Quantinuum at a $10 billion valuation. Analysts at Bank of America commented on the report Friday, saying they believe the quantum unit's valuation \"suggests upside potential to undervalued Honeywell SOTP.\" SOTP is an abbreviation for sum-of-the-parts and is a way to value a company undergoing a breakup, like Honeywell. Next week: The stragglers of Big Tech report earnings, including quarterly results from Nvidia , CrowdStrike , Dell Technologies, Marvell Technology, and Snowflake. Retail earnings will continue with Best Buy, Gap, Dick's Sporting Goods, Five Below, and many others. On the economic data side, the key report for the week will be the July personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index on Friday morning.

Revenue was about $44.1 billion in its first quarter of fiscal 2026, a period that ends on April 27. Spotlighting the company's breakneck pace, this top-line figure was up 12% from the prior quarter and 69% year over year. Nvidia's data center segment, which is home to its AI products, did roughly $39.1 billion in revenue, up 10% sequentially and 73% year over year.\nStill, I'm not buying the growth stock, even after a recent pullback in the share price over the last week. My decision to stay on the sidelines during this dip has nothing to do with business performance. It's because I believe today's results are going to make for extremely tough comparisons in future periods, and this will be challenging in the context of the stock's premium valuation. When expectations get stretched, even a modest slowdown can sting.\nValuation leaves little room for error\nRun the math on today's output. Annualizing the quarter's $44.1 billion in revenue implies about a $176 billion run rate. Free cash flow was about $26.1 billion in the quarter, which annualizes to just over $100 billion. Those are staggering figures. They also set a very high bar, especially for a company in a cyclical industry. In addition, for the stock to work from here, investors are effectively assuming that low- to mid-70% gross margins can be sustained, that demand stays broad across customers, and that the product mix remains rich as volumes scale.\nFurthermore, capital returns are hardly material for investors. Nvidia repurchased about $14.1 billion of stock in the quarter and paid roughly $244 million in dividends. These figures are small relative to the company's market capitalization of more than $4.2 trillion as of this writing, and they hardly bolster the bull case for the stock.\nWhen the company's top-line growth finally does start to slow and when margins begin normalizing, the stock will have two things working against it: a frothy valuation and comparisons that resemble peak-cycle economics. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 57 as of this writing, the set of assumptions behind today's price leaves very little wiggle room. Investors are effectively paying up for a future that looks a lot like the present: continued double-digit capital expenditure growth from customers, resilient pricing and product mix, a somewhat fair global trade environment, and competitors that are far behind the curve. Of course, it's possible that the future really is this rosy. But given the stock's valuation and the high bar the company is creating for itself, this is also the kind of setup where even small deviations matter. If growth slows from today's pace, or if margins move down from the low 70s, the market may no longer want to pay such a premium multiple for the stock, and shares could fall significantly.","content_hash":"3e6e2f27b23c1b268d30803fbe056b41","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3289,"method_rank":0}

(It seems that being a central banker in the U.S. might be the only way to protect yourself from layoffs and displacement by artificial intelligence today.)\nThat said, the Trump administration doesn't seem to be relenting its pressure on Fed officials. The Department of Justice will investigate Fed Governor Lisa Cook based on a criminal referral by a White House official, according to a letter obtained by CNBC's Sara Eisen on Thursday.\nIn a typical year, Jackson Hole sparks excitement mostly among market watchers and finance nerds (i.e. yours truly). This time, the symposium feels more pivotal, almost like a gathering of people quietly struggling for central bank independence.\nWhat you need to know today\nThe U.S. and EU announce tariff details. Automotive exports to the U.S. will face a 15% tariff — after the EU introduces legislation to reduce their industrial duties. Pharmaceuticals will see levies capped at a maximum of 15%.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell is set to give a big speech on Friday. At Jackson Hole, a gathering of central bankers to talk economic policy, Powell is expected to discuss the Fed's long-term policy goals — in what will almost certainly be his last keynote there.\nGoogle scores a $10-billion cloud deal with Meta. Under the agreement, Google will provide Meta cloud services mainly related to AI over six years, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nMajor U.S. indexes had a red Thursday. The S&P 500 fell 0.4% for its fifth losing session in a row. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 was flat, snapping a three-day winning streak, as investors shrugged off details of the EU-U.S. trade agreement.\n[PRO] No relief rally for European pharmaceuticals.

It’s at least in part a casualty of war — trade war, that is.\nREAD ALSO: Living Room Legend Netflix Makes a Break for Hollywood and Everyone’s Joining Big Tech’s Market Rally\nAt Your Discretion\nTarget shares are down roughly 50% from a 2021 peak, when the brand’s pivot back toward home goods, fashion, and wellness products coincided nicely with the freewheeling days of post-pandemic euphoria. But the good times, they don’t last. Roughly 50% of Target’s sales come from those very same discretionary spending categories (compared with about 40% for Walmart), which means that in times of waning consumer confidence and likely inflationary tariffs, the classic Tar-zhay sparkle looks a little too bright for most US shoppers.\n“People are spending on essentials, but not really discretionary products right now,” R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, told The Daily Upside.\nComparable sales have increased in just three of the past eight quarters, with Wednesday’s report showing a decline of 1.9% as growth in digital eased the effect of a drop at bricks-and-mortar stores open at least a year. A slew of other retail earnings this week offers clues as to where shoppers have headed instead:\n-\nIn its own earnings call on Wednesday, TJX — the parent company of TJMaxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods — reported revenue that beat Wall Street’s expectations as its consolidated comparable sales figures grew 4% year-over-year. Unlike most big box retailers, TJX sources its products through thousands of individual deal-hunting buyers, which Hottovy said allowed it to benefit from tariff-induced supply shocks and cater to bargain-hunting consumers.\n-\nWalmart, which reports later today, saw an increase in foot traffic in its most recent quarter, according to Placer.ai tracking data, marking a rebound from a downturn in the prior quarter. The big box king’s unmatched pricing power has allowed it to weather tariff shocks, while Hottovy says the data indicates the brand is still seeing an increase in higher-income consumers — the type who typically represented Target’s target demographic.\nMr. Inside Hire: Wednesday’s earnings call also brought news of a leadership change at Target. Longtime CEO Brian Cornell is leaving his post (though he will remain as executive chairman), while longtime executive Michael Fiddelke will step into the top spot. Fiddelke, who has risen through the ranks after starting as an intern in 2003, called his experience with the company an asset. Wall Street didn’t necessarily agree. Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, told Reuters that Fiddelke’s hiring does not necessarily “remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink.” Shares of Target fell more than 6% on Wednesday.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

This is with the intention of streamlining regulation by reducing red tape and ensuring that firms only need to deal with the FCA, rather than a range of different regulators.\nBut the dissolution of the PSR is just one example of where regulatory changes are going to impact different stakeholders in the financial ecosystem. Broader trends are on the horizon that financial institutions, fintechs, merchants and other firms need to keep in their scope.\nOpportunities for payments innovation in the region\nAs it stands, firms active in UK payments may need to engage with as many as three different regulators: the PSR, FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). The merging of PSR into the FCA is going to reduce the number of regulatory touchpoints, streamline compliance and lower administrative overheads. This is because a single payments supervisor can help to reduce the legal and consultancy costs linked to overlapping guidance and interpretation.\nBut the move will also help to make the UK more attractive to fintechs and payment innovators, encouraging international firms to enter the market and making it easier to launch and scale new products. And while the abolition of the PSR is loosening the regulatory barriers for the UK financial sector and allowing for more self-regulation, elsewhere, new regulations and frameworks are demanding enhanced security to protect consumers from fraud and safeguard their finances.\nBoosting user protections\nWhile the UK is no longer in the EU, the nation often follows the bloc’s lead when new directives are introduced. European frameworks are being updated to boost user protection, so we can expect to see the UK following suit. One such example is the upcoming Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3), a proposed EU directive that focuses on improving security, fraud prevention and consumer protection in the ecosystem.\nA major development with the PSD3 is the revised definition of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), which requires technically separate authentication methods when customers use mobile wallets and other services.\nThis opens up the potential for passkey-based, biometric first authentication in combination with other authentication layers such as risk scoring. These authentication methods keep users safe by ensuring their biometric data never leaves their device, while taking just milliseconds to verify their identity. These methods of fraud protection will only become more pivotal for payment providers to introduce, as the UK has now implemented a world-leading fraud reimbursement scheme for victims of Authorised Push Payment (APP) attacks, introduced in 2024. Under these rules, payment service providers will be required to reimburse victims up to £85,000 per claim within five business days, with the scheme covering as many as 99.8% of all APP fraud cases.","content_hash":"8e796fd367f8662e8bdaa93af271ad2d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3104,"method_rank":0}

AdvizorPro scrapes that data to analyze investment patterns. They use that data to produce quarterly reports analyzing trends or determining whether particular ETFs are gaining traction among advisors. The annual look provides a 30,000-foot view of how usage of ETFs varies between some of the biggest shops.\nWhen widening the aperture to all 50 RIAs in AdvizorPro’s list, 11 firms have more than 50% of client assets, led by United Capital Financial Advisors, with 81.11% of assets in ETFs ($13.9 billion out of $17.2 billion in total assets).\n[[scm-embed type=\"everviz\" src=\"https:\/\/app.everviz.com\/inject\/_NBK-FG4O\/?v=3\"]]\nIn terms of total dollars allocated to ETFs, Creative Planning leads the way ($85.0 billion), followed by Edelman Financial Engines ($46.2 billion), Wealth Enhancement ($35.4 billion), Cetera ($34.4 billion) and Hightower ($32.7 billion).\n[[scm-embed type=\"everviz\" evervizEmbedType=\"table\" src=\"https:\/\/app.everviz.com\/inject\/N58QuTPWl\/?v=3\"]]\nThe findings align with a report published this week from Escalent showing that advisor allocations to ETFs rose to 32.6% of AUM, up from 23.6% in 2023. (In contrast, mutual fund allocations declined to 19.7% from 26.5% in 2023.) Escalent’s report also found that allocations to active ETFs increased from 25% in 2023 to 29% of ETF assets today. And now 80% of advisors are using active ETFs. (Escalent’s data is based on an online survey of 1,550 registered financial advisors.)\n“We’re seeing a notable shift in advisor sentiment, with heightened interest in actively managed investments, including U.S. equities, U.S. fixed income and ETFs,” Meredith Lloyd Rice, lead author and vice president in Escalent’s Cogent Syndicated division, said in a statement. “For years, mutual funds have led the way as ETFs slowly gained ground. Now, we’re seeing a sharp acceleration in active ETF allocations as advisors tout low costs, liquidity, transparency and access to a wider range of markets, sectors and strategies.”","content_hash":"63c90c60e1912e4f3c8cdd6b7089a802","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3097,"method_rank":0}

Stocks surged and Treasury yields plunged following the presentation at the Fed's annual symposium. Market pricing shifted back to a near certainty that there will be a September rate cut, and speculation swirled that at least one more would follow this year. All that came from Powell simply stating that current and expected conditions \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance\" after the Fed spent this entire year on hold, despite hectoring from President Donald Trump for lower rates. \"Fed Chair Powell is going out with a bang as he delivers what the President has been arguing for,\" wrote Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds. \"More rates cuts are certain to come as ... Powell caved on rates and markets are roaring their approval. The king is dead. Long live the next king,\" he said. The chair's remarks come at what almost certainly was his final keynote at the Wyoming symposium. With policy in flux, Powell entertained multiple scenarios, the most likely being a temporary pass-through from tariffs to inflation while downside risks build for the labor market. In investors' eyes, it was enough to signal that Powell will lead the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to ease policy during his final nine months as its leader. \"This was not just tipping his hat for a Sept. 17 rate cut. I think this was actually a move towards suggesting that we're going to be in for a sequence of rate cuts ahead,\" David Rosenberg, head of Rosenberg Research, said on CNBC. \"His speech accurately described the tension between the dual parts of the Fed's mandate but, with the clear emphasis on the downside risks for employment, the remarks clearly make the case for a careful, cautious resumption of rate cuts,\" added Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. Markets are still not looking for anything drastic, despite calls in some quarters for a half percentage point cut from the current 4.25% to 4.50% policy rate in September. Futures currently are pricing no chance of that happening though the odds for a quarter-point move rose to 89% after Powell's speech from about 75% earlier, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. The probability for another cut in October stood at about 46%, while December was a near certainty for a second cut and about a 40% chance that the year would end with three reductions. Economist Paul McCulley told CNBC that it would take a bad August nonfarm payrolls report, possibly indicating an outright loss of jobs, to push the FOMC to a half point. But he said Powell made it clear that the labor market is now a bigger focus than the fight against inflation. \"The caveat that Mr. Powell laid out very clearly is that the bias is to reacting forcibly to unexpected weakness in the labor market,\" said McCulley, a former Pimco managing director. \"They are intensely focused on [not wanting] the labor market to weaken from here.\"","content_hash":"5274b193c012742c28835fb0603726bd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3093,"method_rank":0}

Hard data has yet to back up the trend.\nAt the heart of the potential flight are changes to the British tax system, from capital gains and inheritance tax to extra stamp duty rates. In particular, the abolition of the so-called non-dom regime, which allowed wealthy foreigners to avoid paying tax on earnings outside the U.K. and to elude inheritance duties on their global assets, courted much controversy.\nThe fear is that an exodus of wealthy people will translate into lower economic growth and diminish the UK's attractiveness as a place to live, invest, and do business.\n\"We know that the top 1% and the top 0.01% pay a very high proportion of taxes in this country, so the tax base starts to shrink. The second thing is, you lose the benefit of the money that they spend in the economy. That's not just about people that they employ, but it's also about things like philanthropy,\" said Jenkins, who is now the CEO of 10x Banking.\n\"What we really need most of all in this country, is people to start and grow businesses. And that means we have to be an attractive location for capital for starting businesses,\" he added.\nThere are even warnings that the Labour party risks taking Britain back to the challenges of the 1970s, notably under then Finance Minister Denis Healey. At the time, a high-tax and anti-business environment pushed tens of thousands of people out of the country in the \"Brain Drain.\"\nAdding to the uncertainty is whether the current Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves will introduce further changes to taxes in the upcoming Autumn budget, such as a potential wealth duty.\nHowever, claims of a mass exodus of wealthy non-doms in response to tax rises may be overblown. Initial tax data suggests the number leaving of people the country is in line — or below — official forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, which forecast that 25% of non-doms with trusts and 12% of those with trusts would flee the U.K. over 2025-26 in response to the abolition of the tax status.\nThis casts shadow over a widely cited report published in association with Henley & Partners, a British investment migration consultancy, which claimed that 16,500 millionaires would quit the country in 2025. Critics have previously questioned the study for depending heavily on data from LinkedIn, which is not reliable in finding someone's tax residence.\nBerenberg Economist Andrew Wishart said the potential outflow of wealthy people will impact some parts of the economy more than others.\n\"It's going to affect the top end of London's property market. So there are going to be pockets that are quite severely affected by this exodus. However, for the U.K. economy as a whole, that's a very small part of the pie,\" he said.\nThe U.K. is set to publish an estimate of how many non-doms left the country due to the new rules in 2027.","content_hash":"9775a5c85efe2be26d64797c2705a591","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2966,"method_rank":0}

Jeep had previously discontinued the model in 2023 under Stellantis' former CEO Carlos Tavares as part of various cost-cutting measures.\nThursday's model marks the debut of Stellantis' new 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain, with more than 500 miles to a tank of fuel.

Good examples include liquid staking tokens like Lido’s wstETH, synthetic dollars like Ethena’s sUSDe or tokenized private credit funds like Hamilton Lane’s SCOPE. The process begins by depositing such a yield-bearing asset, e.g. weETH, into a money market account, borrowing a closely related asset against it, e.g. ETH, allocating the borrowed amount back into the yield-bearing version, e.g. staking ETH on EtherFi and then redepositing it as collateral — that is one full loop. One of the most widely adopted looping structures is weETH (EtherFi’s wrapped staking ether) paired with ETH on lending platforms such as Spark.\nAsset design: weETH accrues staking rewards, so one unit gradually becomes worth more ETH over time. Here, at EtherFi protocol launch 1 weETH equalled 1 ETH. Now, it equals 1.0744 ETH.\nweETH \/ ETH price appreciation over time via liquid restaking yield accrual, Source: RedStone\nRisk correlation: If weETH yields ~3 percent annually and ETH borrow rates are 2.5 percent, each loop captures a 0.5 percent spread. With 90 percent loan-to-value ratio and 10 loops, that spread compounds, potentially increasing returns to roughly 7.5 percent annually.\nMarket size in 2025 and growth potential\nContango’s Q3 2024 estimates suggested that 20 to 30 percent of the $40 billion-plus locked in money markets and collateralized debt positions was attributable to looping strategies. This implied $12–15 billion in open interest, or roughly 2–3 percent of total DeFi TVL at the time.\nToday, that scale is likely much larger: Aave alone holds close to $60 billion in TVL. Given that trading volumes in leverage-based strategies typically exceed open interest by a factor of ten, annual transaction volume from looping may already surpass $100 billion.\nBeyond ETH: stable-yield assets\nLooping can also be applied to asset pairs that are not necessarily crypto native. A practical example is sACRED \/ USDC looping on Morpho. Here, a token representing a tokenized private credit fund (Apollo’s ACRED via sACRED vault) is deposited to borrow USDC, which is then converted into sACRED and redeposited. While the yield profile is designed to be predictable, it depends on the performance of the underlying private credit portfolio and is not as inherently stable as ETH staking rewards.","content_hash":"5e9bf8c889fbbaa341a891e8b8400ef1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2913,"method_rank":0}

The funding marks a significant step in the company’s efforts to expand its product suite and accelerate growth as freight brokers face intensifying challenges around fraud and compliance.\nHighway launched in 2022 with a mission to help brokers verify carriers in real time, safeguard their networks, and reduce losses tied to fraud. Its Carrier Identity platform has quickly gained traction in the market, serving more than 1,050 brokers, including 70 of the largest 100 in the United States.\nBy combining real-time data and automated compliance tools, the company has created what many in the industry view as a first line of defense against fraudulent activity in the supply chain.\n“Highway was built to solve an important and growing challenge for freight brokers: combating skyrocketing fraud within their networks in real-time,” said Jordan Graft, CEO of Highway, in a news release. “We are thrilled to partner with FTV to help drive our next phase of expansion. The firm’s strong track record backing innovative supply chain and logistics businesses, combined with deep domain expertise in our industry, makes them an ideal partner as we execute on our ambitious growth plan to diversify our products and extend our market-leading position.”\nThe investment comes at a time when freight brokers are under mounting pressure. The U.S. freight market has become more complex as shipping volumes grow, carriers remain lean, and volatility across the supply chain increases.\nBrokers now manage roughly 30% of all truckload spend, a figure that underscores both their importance and their vulnerability to fraudulent actors. The need for trusted, real-time fraud prevention solutions has become central to their ability to operate efficiently and protect their customers.\nFor FTV Capital, which has a long history of investing in supply chain and logistics technologies, Highway represents a strong fit. “As freight brokers continue to gain greater market share with freight volume rising, fraud has intensified. To combat this, Highway is creating a more secure, data-enriched ecosystem through its scaled network of vetted brokers and carriers, ultimately resulting in fewer losses and disruptions,” said Jerome Hershey, principal at FTV Capital, in a news release. “At FTV, we’ve invested in tech-enabled supply chain and logistics businesses for over two decades and have been impressed with the mission-critical software platform Jordan and the team have built, resulting in a highly retentive blue-chip customer base and scalable profitability. We’re thrilled to help the company build on its strong momentum and reinforce its position as the industry leader in carrier fraud protection.”","content_hash":"7fb6456c34d605889c5b6e56fa78727e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2900,"method_rank":0}

After all, if you’re in the upper echelons in terms of earning income, surely you must be ahead of the game compared with the rest of Americans when it comes to net worth, right?\nWrong. Regardless of income, the path to long-term wealth is through investments, not salary. Plenty of mid-level earners end up with seven-digit bank accounts by the time they retire, while many Americans earning $150,000 or more are still living paycheck to paycheck.\nHow do the middle earners get so far ahead? By developing a solid financial plan that’s heavy on investments. Here’s how you can do it as well.\nCheck Out: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nRead Next: 10 Unreliable SUVs To Stay Away From Buying\nWhy Salary Is Not Enough\nIf you’re looking to build wealth, a higher salary can certainly make the path easier. But it’s not a slam dunk. In fact, there are lots of reasons why salary is at a handicap when it comes to increasing net worth:\n-\nInflation: Cash begins losing value the day it arrives into your pocket. Over time, the effects of inflation are insidious, eroding the purchasing power of cash. If you have $100,000 in cash and just leave it there, it might only be “worth” $90,000 a few years down the road, in terms of what you can actually buy. While accumulating cash may technically increase your net worth, in terms of your quality of life, you’re actually moving backward.\n-\nActive income: To earn a salary, you actually have to work for it. In other words, you are trading time for money. As there are only so many hours you can work in a day, your salary necessarily has an upper ceiling. Investments are passive income, meaning they earn money on their own, without taking a moment of your time. As famed billionaire Warren Buffett once said, “If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.”\n-\nTaxation: Your salary is taxed at ordinary income rates, which are much higher than the capital gains rates that you’ll pay on your investments. For 2025, the top federal marginal rate is 37%. On top of that, states like California have top tax brackets of as much as 13.3%, putting the combined rate over 50% for top earners. But most high earners only pay a 20% tax rate on their long-term capital gains. Many workers actually pay a long-term capital gains rate of 0%, according to the IRS. This includes singles with taxable incomes of up to $47,025 and joint filers with taxable incomes as high as $94,050.\n-\nRising expenses: It’s human nature for people to increase their spending as their income rises, a phenomenon known as “lifestyle creep.” But if you’re always living paycheck to paycheck, even earning $200,000 or more won’t help you build long-term wealth.","content_hash":"8b54e88589b09cba6989e1496b9af3f9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2850,"method_rank":0}

America is aging as a nation, and the way people view housing may be changing, too.\nWhat's behind the renting surge?\nAccording to the analysis, a big part of the renting surge among those 65-plus may be due to financial considerations. High mortgage rates, downsizing, upkeep costs and wanting to be closer to family or medical services could be motivating factors.\nMortgage rates have been hovering between 6% and 7% all year, and health care costs continue to rise for retirees, according to Fidelity’s latest health care cost estimate.\nFlexibility may be another key motivator.

In 2025, it became the top-performing stock in the S&P 500, surging over 106% and at points climbing 144% from the start of the year—outpacing even AI heavyweights like Nvidia. This explosive growth was fueled by its robust financial performance, notching its first billion-dollar quarter with momentum from government and commercial AI contracts.\nHowever, Palantir’s meteoric rise has been followed by a brutal reversal. Over the past six trading sessions, Palantir shares plunged more than 17%, wiping out $73 billion in market capitalization and marking the largest drop since April. This tumble handed short-sellers $1.6 billion in profits, Bloomberg reported, citing data from S3 Partners. (That figure is still dwarfed by the $4.5 billion paper losses that shorts racked up earlier in the year, S3 says.) In recent days, Palantir has also been the worst performer in the S&P 500, illustrating an extreme swing from hero to villain in the market.\nThe vicious short-seller report\nPalantir’s dramatic stock moves followed fresh fire from short-sellers, particularly Citron Research, led by Andrew Left. In a scathing report, Citron argued that Palantir’s stock was detached from its business fundamentals and sound analysis. It included a caricature of Palantir CEO Alex Karp in the royal court of OpenAI, titled, “Your highness’s multiple,” laying out the case for Palantir having much farther to fall.\nCitron’s thesis is that OpenAI, widely recognized as the leader in AI, is about to receive a $500 billion valuation with projected revenue of $29.6 billion in 2026, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 17. By contrast, Palantir is forecasted to deliver $5.6 billion in revenue in 2026. Applying OpenAI’s valuation multiple to Palantir would yield a stock price of just $40. (Citron showed its math, calculating that $5.6 billion multiplied by 17 would shoot up to a roughly $95 billion market cap, divided by 2.37 billion shares outstanding, yielding a $40-per-share valuation.) “It should be noted,” Citron writes, “that even at a 17x sales multiple, OpenAI has the highest multiple of any scaled SaaS stock in the world, and that number in itself is extreme. This means that at $40, PLTR would still be expensive.”\nShort-sellers like Left insist that Palantir’s business isn’t as scalable or as subscription-based as Wall Street prefers, in stark contrast to OpenAI. Palantir’s dependence on government deals introduces uncertainty and volatility, leading Citron to claim that the stock is unjustifiably expensive even after recent losses.","content_hash":"06948b9b14f6b58c4b63be8077d45c37","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2828,"method_rank":0}

And that they did, starting in December 2024, when Amazon launched Amazon Autos to expand the supergiant reach of its retail empire to used and “certified pre-owned” vehicles. Initially limited to Hyundai vehicles as part of a partnership with the automaker, Amazon is now opening up the platform to non-Hyundai models. It already has participating dealers in over 130 US cities to help diversify the offering, and Hertz coming on board will introduce a slate of Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet and Nissan vehicles in one fell swoop. It’s a ready-made road to expansion, one that began immediately in Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and Seattle on Wednesday, with plans to stretch to all 45 Hertz Car Sales locations in the US.\nHertz, meanwhile, is looking in the rear-view mirror at its pandemic bankruptcy and a failed electric vehicle strategy that followed. The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2021, and executives adopted a turnaround plan last year, dubbed a “Back-to-Basics Roadmap,” that makes improving its fleet management a core component of optimizing revenue and costs. That means refreshing its fleet and selling vehicles before they depreciate into pennies, or a “Buy Right, Hold Right, Sell Right” strategy, as executives have dubbed it:\n-\nIn the second quarter, the “Buy Right, Hold Right, Sell Right” approach paid off in some respects: Hertz’s depreciation per unit (DPU) per month of $251 was 16% better than executives’ North Star goal of less than $300. That occurred as Hertz continued a rotation of its rental fleet set to finish by the end of 2025, with older vehicles being sold off and replaced with new models.\n-\nOn the other hand, Hertz is very much still in turnaround mode. Citing the combination of high borrowing, approaching debt maturities, softening travel demand and costs related to its remaining older fleet, ratings company Fitch maintained its negative outlook for the rental giant earlier this month. Hertz does have the prominent backing of hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who has argued that US tariffs on auto imports will increase the value of used cars as buyers choose them over jacked-up price tags on new models from abroad.","content_hash":"68c892b9ab7d7c4ecbc67b94295f8ef1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2824,"method_rank":0}

The tripartite deal, which also involves the state-owned Janata Bank, could restore the jobs of nearly 25,000 workers over the next couple of months, sources from the labor ministry told TBS News.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n“After 10 months of tireless effort, we’re finally making progress toward reopening the factories,” Beximco managing editor Osman Kaiser Chowdhury told the outlet. “We have the government’s policy-level support.”\nThe company’s 16 factories, including Beximco Fashions, Crescent Fashion and Design, Shinepukur Garments and Yellow Apparels, were previously owned by Salman F. Rahman, one of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina most trusted advisors, who remains in prison on charges of murder, fraud, money laundering and graft. He’s also been accused of using his political influence to stall the repayment of his company’s bank loans and liabilities, estimated at a whopping 50,098 crore Bangladeshi taka, or around $4.1 billion.\nTo help with Beximco’s reopening, Janata Bank plans to reschedule defaulted loans totaling roughly 35,000 crore taka, or $2.9 billion. The Bangladesh Bank will also ease existing policies and offer export-related banking facilities, if not new loans. Under the lease agreement, the Revival Project can carve out a service charge from potential earnings, with the rest going to repay outstanding debts. The firm has suggested appointing Deloitte to audit the books. Details will be hammered out once the agreement is signed, a senior Bangladesh Bank official told bdnews24.com.\nBeximco started laying off its 40,000 textile and apparel division workers in December after it was clear it could not overcome its crushing debt on its own. Already, the government had to step in to cover wage payments that the company could no longer afford. In January, former Beximco employees protested their dismissal in spectacular fashion by allegedly setting part of a factory, a truck and three buses on fire.\n“We’ve decided to reopen the factories considering the government’s investment, the bank’s loans, employment opportunities, and export income,” A.H.M. Shafiquzzama, secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment in Bangladesh, told TBS News, adding that the move was driven by economic rather than political considerations. “Beximco’s factories are fully compliant and equipped with modern machinery.”","content_hash":"45a6e74202bb47a6cddfe814ac27aec2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2795,"method_rank":0}

The U.S. has grown concerned in the past few years that advanced American chips could be used in Chinese military applications.\nA journalist asked Huang about the B30A during a trip to Taiwan.\n\"Offering a new product to China for the data center, AI data centers, the follow on to H20, that's not our decision to make. It's up to of course the United States government. And we are in dialogue with them. But it's too soon to know,\" Huang said in response.\nLast month, Huang said he hopes that Nvidia can sell more advanced chips in China than the H20 during a visit to the country.\nNvidia's position in China has become a headache for Huang. The company created a special, less-advanced chip for China called the H20, which this year the U.S. government restricted for export. In July, Nvidia said it had given permission to sell this chip again in China. Later, it was revealed that Nvidia will give 15% of its China chip sales to the U.S. government in exchange for export licenses.\nJust as it appeared that Nvidia was back in China, it hit other roadblocks, with Chinese authorities raising concerns this month about potential security vulnerabilities in the company's chips. Nvidia said its products do not have \"kill switches and backdoors\" built into them.\nSeveral reports this month have suggested that the Chinese government has urged local companies not to use Nvidia chips.\nHuang has argued that Nvidia should be allowed to sell its chips to China, so that the country's AI is built on American technology and domestic tech giants like Huawei don't fill the void.\nThat message appeared to get through to Washington. In July, when the H20 was approved for export again, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the move was allowed because Nvidia would not be giving over its best technology.\n\"We don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best,\" Lutnick said.\nHowever, the Financial Times reported on Thursday that these comments were seen as \"insulting\" by Chinese officials and that local regulators are moving to dissuade domestic firms from buying the H20.\nA report by the The Information on Friday said that Nvidia has asked some of its component suppliers to stop production related to the H20 graphics processing units.\nThe company's shares were down 1.34% in premarket trading at 5:53 a.m. E.T.\n- CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this report.","content_hash":"3dfa58fbf5fcdd06e18a4adad68e5a22","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2788,"method_rank":0}

Here are a few key takeaways:\n-\nIf set up direct deposit with your bank, credit union or payment platform and connect your account to your employer’s bank account the net pay from your employer’s bank is then deposited directly into your account through the automated clearing house (ACH), so you don’t have to wait on a paycheck.\n-\nSome banks now can have your paycheck deposited and set up to two days early in your account.\n-\nIf you use Cash App, the Cash Card or prepaid debit card installed on your phone works like a checking account, with no monthly service fees or overdraft fees and FDIC backing from Cash App’s partner banks.\nIf you’re thinking about getting your paycheck early through direct deposit, here are four reasons it’s a good idea.\nLearn More: I’m a Banking Expert: 3 Biggest Money Mistakes People Make on Payday\nIt Can Help You Pay Your Bills on Time\nWhen your budget is almost as tight as your pay period and bills are stacking up, getting paid early might make the difference between paying bills on time and paying them late.\nLate payments often bring penalties and can even cause service interruptions, depending on the company.

At one point during Wednesday session, the stock dropped nearly 10% to $142, almost 24% from last week's highs.\nShort seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who expressed concerns about the stock's valuation in a Fox Business interview last week, said in a report Monday that he believes the stock has become \"detached from fundamentals\" and should be worth closer to $40.\nWhile Wall Street analysts have applauded the data analytics software maker’s record revenue growth fueled by robust demand for its AI-powered platform, there is growing consensus that it's fully priced into the shares.

Moreover, the move lower coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) falling into bearish territory, signaling an acceleration in selling momentum.\nIt’s also worth pointing out that Tuesday’s decline occurred on the highest trading volume since late June, indicating larger market participants drove the sell-off.\nLet’s identify three crucial support levels to watch on Palantir’s chart if the shares continue to fall and also point out a key overhead area worth monitoring during possible upswings.\nSupport Levels to Watch\nThe first support level to watch sits around $148. A pullback to this level could attract buying interest near the late June peak and a period of sideways drift during the second half of July. This location lies in the same neighborhood as a bars pattern downside target that takes a prior retracement to the 50-day MA and repositions it from this month's high. That move also started with five consecutive down days.","content_hash":"77ba3eacfeaede2f440a741a614a9453","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2769,"method_rank":0}

Chicago Blackhawk Hockey Team, Inc., the plaintiff is an openly gay man who claimed his firing followed his participation in a media interview in which he discussed his sexual orientation. The plaintiff alleged that he was reprimanded despite obtaining permission to participate in the interview and that, after he complained about this, the Blackhawks terminated him.\n-\nThe plaintiff alleged that the team’s conduct violated Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, further claiming that its proffered reason for the firing was false and pretextual. The Blackhawks did not respond to a request for comment submitted via the team’s online contact form.\nDive Insight:\nMore than half a decade after the U.S. Supreme Court held that Title VII prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of a worker’s sexual orientation or gender identity, the contours of that decision are now being shaped in the nation’s lower courts. Subsequent lawsuits alleging LGBTQ+ status discrimination have touched upon a variety of topics, including misgendering, employer coverage of gender-affirming care and harassment.\nThe plaintiff in Filomena claimed that he was fired after participating in a 2024 interview with LGBTQ+ sports outlet Outsports. In that story, the plaintiff, a public relations manager, discussed his experience joining the Blackhawks and how it helped him rediscover his passion for sports. He also discussed interviewing for a job with the team in the aftermath of a sexual assault scandal involving a former Blackhawks coach.\nApproximately one month prior to the publication of the story, Outsports quoted the plaintiff in an article about the Blackhawks’ Pride Night event. After the plaintiff was fired, he told Outsports that he was considering legal action against the team; the Blackhawks reportedly told Outsports that the plaintiff’s sexual orientation did not factor into the team’s decision and that he had instead been fired for insubordination.\nPer the complaint, the Blackhawks’ termination letter said that he lacked authorization to conduct the interview with Outsports. But the plaintiff claimed that he had received approval from the team’s chairman and CEO. He also alleged that similarly situated employees who engaged in comparable conduct were not terminated.","content_hash":"8c9c0ca768083ea6ce233be80619a008","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2758,"method_rank":0}

The move comes as the coffee chain looks to limit costs while investments are funneled into turnaround efforts. Compensation experts tell Fortune salary slowdowns are common amid economic uncertainty, but the 2% rate lags behind the national average.\nStarbucks will provide a flat 2% pay bump to all salaried employees in North America this year as the coffee chain looks to minimize costs as part of CEO Brian Niccol’s turnaround efforts.\nUnder Niccol’s leadership, Starbucks has required some remote workers to relocate to its headquarters and tightened return-to-office policies for corporate employees. The flat 2% pay raise is a shift from the company’s previous compensation model that let managers weigh in on how much of a raise their salaried direct reports received.\nThe salary hike, first reported this week by Bloomberg and confirmed by Fortune, will apply to all salaried employees, including corporate employees, workers in manufacturing and distribution, and store managers. The uniform increase will not apply to baristas, who are hourly employees.\nStarbucks is hoping to turn around its business with Niccol at the helm, who had previously helped improve financial results at Chipotle. The coffee chain has asked executives to limit costs to help pay for efforts to create better service, improve wait times, and make stores more inviting, according to Bloomberg.\n“As we make these significant investments, we need to carefully manage all our other costs,” the company said in an internal email reviewed by the Wall Street Journal.\nHow Starbucks’ salary hike stacks up\nThe 2% pay raise lags behind the U.S. inflation rate of 2.7% and average salary increases measured by different surveys.\nA recent Payscale survey found U.S. employers increased salary budgets by an average of 3.6% this year, and are expecting this average to edge down to 3.5% in 2026.\nLexi Clarke, Payscale’s chief people officer, told Fortune the move to lower pay-increase budgets is not surprising as economic concerns like tariffs and policy uncertainty have pushed businesses to be more conservative.\n“Economic concerns have now overtaken labor competition as the primary driver of compensation decisions,” Clarke said. “Sixty-six percent of employers cite this as the reason for pulling back, up 17 percentage points from last year.”\nA recent Korn Ferry survey found that in the U.S., an average of 3.6% salary increases are forecasted in 2025. This accounts for senior leadership positions, junior hourly roles, and everything in between. Six percent of survey respondents were retail companies.","content_hash":"084e66600327e386b4d37f7170acaf27","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2735,"method_rank":0}

What started earlier this week as negative rumblings has grown into something louder and more concerning.\nAfter news got out that Meta had begun a restructuring of its new AI team, the Wall Street Journal reported the company froze hiring in its AI division, fresh off recruiting more than 50 AI researchers and engineers with the lure of massive job offers.\nInvestors might have welcomed such a halt in big spending had it been another company. After all, the compensation packages, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars across several years, looked like professional athlete money.\nBut Meta has trumpeted its AI expenditures as proof of its commitment and a reflection of its grand ambitions. In turn, the market applauded. Only Nvidia (NVDA), the chip company supplying the tech platforms, has performed better this year. Meta shares are up more than 25%, outmaneuvering Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), tickers with a more natural AI fit and a technological head start.\nNow, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has reportedly turned off the spigot. No more 10-year, $252 million A-Rod-style contracts. Worse than the end of the big money contracts, though, is the reason Meta had to offer them in the first place.\nA reminder that's good news for the AI industry, but bad news for Meta.\nRather than reading Zuck's AI reshuffling and hiring pullback as a bearish signal for the AI trade, it's worth considering a simpler interpretation: This is another sign of Meta's AI dysfunction.\nAs John Herrman, New York Magazine tech columnist, told Yahoo Finance in a live interview and wrote in a column of his own this week, Meta having to spend all that money to attract AI talent stems from a company culture increasingly perceived as hostile to its workers, lacking a clear vision, and with bumbling strategies. Idealistic researchers and motivated technologists see themselves and their style of work in other outfits, he said, whether that's Sam Altman's leading-edge work at OpenAI or even the cavalier ethos and ideology and the associated chaos that surrounds Elon Musk's xAI.\nMeta's absurd offers were a way to overcome its disadvantages, perhaps, a sign of desperation rather than a show of strength.\n\"There is a war over talent, but it's not a billion-dollar-a-head war,\" Herrman said in the interview. \"That's Meta's problem. That's because they can't recruit the same way that OpenAI can.\"","content_hash":"728cad061132204bd90f8f9481e1c510","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2714,"method_rank":0}

Customers — homeowners or professionals who serve them — have continued to see strong income gains over the past several years and are “sitting on tappable equity of over $11 trillion,” double the amount in 2019, McPhail said. Home improvement demand has persisted, with Home Depot taking steps to capitalize on the trend, he said.\n-\nYet top executives also warned of potential impact from tariffs implemented by the Trump administration. While it’s “super important to remember that over 50% of our products are sourced domestically and wouldn't be subject to any tariffs,” William Bastek, executive vice president and head of merchandising said, regarding some imported goods, “obviously, tariff rates are significantly higher today than they were when we spoke in May,” he said. “So, as you'd expect, there will be some modest price movement in some categories, but it won't be broad-based.”\nDive Insight:\nThe warnings of price increases coincide with persistent challenges for the housing market. U.S. home prices slumped by 0.1% in July, marking the third consecutive month where prices declined, according to a report by RedFin.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily BioPharma Dive newsletter.\nXoma Royalty Corp. is acquiring another struggling biotechnology company in further sign of interest among certain firms in buying floundering drugmakers and shutting them down.\nXoma on Wednesday agreed to buy Mural Oncology, a cancer biotech once spun out of Alkermes. Per deal terms, a Xoma subsidiary will acquire Mural for $2.035 per share. Mural stockholders could get up to another $0.205 per share if the company’s net cash holdings at the deal’s closing exceeds $36.2 million.\nThe deal values Mural at the level of its cash reserves and represents a roughly 13% premium to the company’s closing share price of $1.80 on Tuesday. Xoma will wind down Mural’s business afterwards, according to the announcement.\nIn acquiring and liquidating Mural, Xoma is extending a pattern among certain firms and investors to shut down drug companies whose depressed share prices leave them worth less than their cash holdings. Historically, these biotech “zombies” would pivot to new projects or merge with another drug company. Of late, however, investors are heightening pressure on company boards to return cash to shareholders instead.\nThrough investment vehicle Concentra Biosciences, for instance, hedge fund Tang Capital has already bought several struggling companies in recent months, among them Elevation Oncology, iTeos Therapeutics and Kronos Bio. Others, like Pliant Therapeutics and Keros Therapeutics, have faced investor pressure. Investment funds have started up with the specific goal of liquidating flailing drug companies, too.\nXoma, which is known for acquiring drug royalty streams, is becoming an active “zombie” acquirer as well. Since June, the company has announced deals to buy Turnstone Biologics, Lava Therapeutics and HilleVax. All three companies had seen their share values collapse following disappointing study results or other setbacks, leading to deal searches and, ultimately, liquidation offers from Xoma. (Xoma also financed a buyout of Essa Pharma in July.)\nMural is in a similar position. It separated from Alkermes in 2023 to advance a trio of cancer medicines led by a drug called nemvaleukin. Mural hoped nemvaleukin would succeed where many therapies focused on an inflammatory cytokine called IL-2 had failed. But the drug fell short in multiple studies, leading the company to scrap development and lay off 90% of its workforce in April. It began a strategic search afterwards and, according to the statement Wednesday, found Xoma’s bid the “most effective route to deliver a timely return of value” to shareholders.","content_hash":"4840d8a818d8ca9422762fedad476611","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2701,"method_rank":0}

At the same time, investors are awaiting news of the Federal Reserve's strategy moving forward. Given the poor economic indicators, many are anticipating a rate cut; however, the Fed is also battling sticky inflation that could get worse as the effects of tariffs are felt.\nWhile a rate cut is usually good for riskier stocks like Tesla, given the mixed data and uneasiness in the market, the stock is taking a hit.\nCybertruck sales have not materialized\nAdding to that, another report is showing just how poor Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) sales have been. Much ink has been spilled about plummeting numbers in markets across the globe, but now the latest figures on the company's Cybertrucks are particularly stark. When the company began rolling out the futuristic trucks in November 2023, it had 1 million reservations.

The company's auto sales unit is teaming up with a top retailer, and the market clearly approved of the deal. That stock price pop was far more than good enough to beat the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) that day, as the indicator slipped by 0.2%.\nFoot on the gas\nBefore market open, Hertz announced, surely with a fair degree of satisfaction, that its Hertz Car Sales has signed an agreement with Amazon Autos unit to sell its used vehicles.\nHertz added that the offered inventory would include autos from the top manufacturers in the world, including Toyota Motor, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and others.\nThe vehicle rental incumbent extolled the advantages for car seekers of buying on Amazon Autos. Among the benefits, Hertz said that prices will frequently be beneath the Kelley Blue Book suggested retail value (a closely followed benchmark for used vehicles), and the offered cars will have each gone through a 115-point inspection by the company.\nAnother convenience is that buyers can purchase their vehicles on the site, then pick them up at a Hertz Car Sales outlet near them. Initially, however, this service is limited only to a few markets containing these outlets, specifically Dallas and Houston, Texas, plus Los Angeles and Seattle. All told, Hertz Car Sales presently has 45 locations around the country.\nDetails undisclosed\nAs with anything connected to Amazon, its auto marketplace is a high-profile, well-trafficked destination for vehicle buyers.\nSo this deal will undoubtedly provide a lift for Hertz's revenue and, likely, profitability.

The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was down 7% as of 11:15 a.m. ET and had been down as much as 9.8% earlier in trading.\nYesterday's big sell-off for Palantir stock was partially driven by an earnings report from Home Depot that arrived with news that the retailer would be raising prices on some items due to the higher purchasing costs it's facing as a result of tariffs. The announcement of pricing increases highlighted the possibility that inflation will soon begin hitting the consumer market. Today, Target's earnings and comments about tariff-related pressures seems to be playing a role in Palantir stock's continued slide.\nIn addition to inflation concerns, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recently published a report stating that most companies that have invested in AI have gotten little or no return on their investment. New reads on inflation and the broader macroeconomic backdrop and an uptick in skepticism about artificial intelligence have caused a significant pullback for Palantir recently, but the stock is still up 93% across 2025's trading.\nIs Palantir stock a buy right now?\nIf overall inflation starts heating up again, the Federal Reserve will have a more difficult path to delivering the interest rate cuts that growth investors have been banking on this year. Trading at roughly 221 times this year's expected earnings and 78 times expected sales, Palantir has the most growth-dependent valuation of any company in the S&P 500. If the outlook on interest rate cuts takes a turn for the worse and investors start to lose their appetite for AI stocks with heavily forward-looking valuations, the stock could continue to see big sell-offs.\nOn the other hand, Palantir has a leading position in the AI software market and has been scoring big wins as government customers and companies have ramped up their spending on the category. For investors with a high tolerance for risk and a long time horizon, I think the stock can still deliver wins at current levels -- but threats posed by unfavorable inflation and interest rate developments suggest buyers may be able to get a better price by waiting.","content_hash":"84fd28409eefa087adb0d9ee74462a24","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2692,"method_rank":0}

It became Europe’s biggest listed company this year following demand for its injections but has since been overtaken by the German software giant SAP.\nJes Asmussen, the chief economist at SJF Bank, told Bloomberg: “It’s natural to speculate that the steep decline in the ‘people’s stock’ has hurt sentiment as Danes watched their portfolios lose value.”\nMr Asmussen added that the company was “responsible for close to 20pc of private job creation last year, with knock-on effects on employment in other parts of the economy”.\nThe knock to Danish consumer confidence comes despite Denmark’s wage growth outpacing inflation. Interest rates, too, have come down from previous highs.\nMr Asmussen said: “If we only judged household spending prospects from consumer sentiment, we would be staring straight into a dark cellar.”\nNovo Nordisk has become one of Denmark’s greatest success stories in recent years amid demand for weight loss drugs.\nSo dramatic was its rise to prominence that, in 2023, the company went as far as hosting a festival for more than 10,000 employees to celebrate its fortunes. It hired some of Denmark’s biggest pop acts to perform.\nIn 2024, its share price surged to give it a market value that eclipsed the entire economy of Denmark.\nHowever, in recent months its share price has suffered amid worries over steeper competition from rivals such as Eli Lilly and the implications of Donald Trump’s efforts to secure lower drug prices for American consumers.\nThis month, the company halved the price of its weight-loss jabs in the US following pressure from Mr Trump. Novo Nordisk said the offer was unrelated to talks with the US government.\nMr Trump previously wrote to pharmaceutical bosses demanding they “negotiate harder with foreign freeloading nations”. Novo Nordisk has said it has no plans to raise the price of its drugs in the UK.","content_hash":"81ddf6f102a194d823b375d6ddb79f9e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2691,"method_rank":0}

The Nasdaq declined more than 1.2% this morning.\nInvestors’ long-running enthusiasm for artificial intelligence showed signs of faltering late Tuesday and early Wednesday morning as tech stocks tumbled. The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined more than 1.2% this morning.\nNvidia, fresh off becoming the world’s first $4 trillion company, sank 3.5%, while Palantir slid nearly 10%. The selloff appeared to be sparked in part by an MIT report that claimed 95% of companies investing in generative AI are seeing no returns, and was potentially deepened by earlier comments from OpenAI’s Sam Altman suggesting investors may be caught in an AI bubble. Late last week, Altman drew a parallel between today’s AI frenzy and the 1990s dotcom bubble, when internet company valuations spiked dramatically before crashing.\nAnd while the MIT study attributed failures to corporate “learning gaps” and flawed integration rather than actual AI model quality, the market reaction highlights growing concerns about AI’s commercial viability.\nThe Nasdaq logged its steepest drop since August, and the rout quickly spread overseas. Korea’s SK Hynix, one of Nvidia’s key suppliers, lost 2.9%, while chip giant TSMC slipped 4.2%. SoftBank, long bullish on AI, cratered more than 7%. However, Alibaba and Tencent barely dipped, and China’s chipmaking champion SMIC even popped 3%.\n“Tech stocks were under pressure yesterday, led by AI poster child stocks Palantir and Nvidia as investors worry the tech rally is due for a pullback\/correction with the constant valuation arguments front and center,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a note on Tuesday. “We are still in the early days of the AI revolution as the use cases are just starting to massively expand as more companies recognize the value creation being driven by a handful of tech companies led by the Godfather of AI, Jensen [Huang], and Nvidia.”\nConcerns that investment in AI is racing ahead of sustainable growth are not new. High-profile figures, including Alibaba cofounder Joe Tsai and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, have cautioned against the pace of the boom.\nDalio has also likened today’s Wall Street cycle to the run-up to the dotcom crash of the late 1990s. “There’s a major new technology that certainly will change the world and be successful.

Covrig Analytics reported Monday that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.\nNY sugar rallied to a 2-month high last Tuesday on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. Last Friday, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of July fell by -0.8% y\/y to 3,614 MT, and the 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through July fell -7.8% y\/y to 19,268 MT.

Also, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said last month that 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Monday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 611.2 mm as of August 18, or 1% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).","content_hash":"f3d462e204ebe5864d237e7ab8449bb0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2682,"method_rank":0}

It can take days to make payments, especially cross-border — longer over weekends or holidays. The result? Trillions of dollars are trapped where they can’t earn yield.\nThis inefficiency is more than an inconvenience — it is a systemic drag. For companies and financial institutions, delayed access to liquidity means higher costs, constrained working capital and a structural handicap in a world that expects everything in real real-time.\nStablecoins as the catalyst\nThe advent of stablecoins proved that money could move at the speed of the internet. Today, trillions of dollars’ worth of transactions settle instantly on blockchain rails, with stablecoins providing the dollar liquidity that powers crypto markets, payments and remittances. But stablecoins themselves only solve half the problem.\nSource: https:\/\/visaonchainanalytics.com\/\nThey provide speed, not yield. Stablecoin balances, in aggregate hundreds of billions of dollars, typically earn nothing. Contrast that with tokenized treasury assets and money market funds, which are low-risk, yield-bearing instruments that pay the risk-free rate. The challenge is that subscriptions and redemptions into and out of these products still run on asynchronous, often T+2 timelines locking out investable capital needed in the immediate term.\nConvergence and composability\nThe industry now stands on the cusp of convergence. The world’s leading asset managers now offer tokenized money market funds, with BlackRock’s BUIDL for example topping $2 billion in assets under management.\nSource: https:\/\/app.rwa.xyz\/assets\/BUIDL\nThese tokenized funds can transfer and settle instantly, including atomically, against other tokenized instruments like stablecoins. As stablecoin activity increases, so do cash and treasury management needs for which tokenized treasuries are the optimal solution.\nWhat’s missing is the connective tissue. Without neutral infrastructure to enable atomic, 24\/7 swaps between stablecoins and tokenized treasuries, we are only digitizing old constraints. The true breakthrough comes when institutions can hold risk-free assets and instantly convert them to cash at any hour, without intermediaries, delays or price slippage.\nThe stakes\nThe stakes are enormous. In the U.S. alone, non-interest-bearing bank deposits total nearly $4.0 trillion. If even a fraction were swept into tokenized treasuries and made instantly convertible to stablecoins, it would unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in yield while preserving full liquidity. That is not a marginal efficiency — it is a structural shift in global finance.","content_hash":"25e1af88c6d3e7dae8ab232af74f61b3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2671,"method_rank":0}

They would also curtail states' power to disrupt banks' operations with rules on so-called \"debanking,\" a practice in which banks allegedly deny services to customers based on political or religious beliefs.\nIndividual states have previously punished banks and barred them from doing business based on lenders' policies on guns, climate change, diversity and other social issues.\nThe debate around national standards came into focus in a lawsuit involving Bank of America. In a 2024 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal law takes precedence for national banks over state laws, a concept known as preemption. Large banks have focused on lobbying to defend themselves against accusations of debanking this year, citing unclear rules. Trump passed an executive order on debanking this month that aims to make the rules more uniform.\nEmboldened lenders are now focused on preemption after getting regulators to water down stress tests and capital requirements, one of the sources said.\nBanks plan to ramp up lobbying efforts after meeting with the OCC earlier this year to press the issue, the three sources said.\nThe OCC declined to comment.\n“We strongly support national preemption and believe federal fair access legislation or regulation would be a prudent move to address account closures in a consistent way across all states,” the Bank Policy Institute, an industry association, said in a statement.\nThe American Bankers Association previously has said that an increasing number of states are considering laws that disregard the existing federal laws. The proposals would give state regulators authority over basic operations of a national bank, including decisions about deposit taking, lending, and risk management, which the ABA has opposed.","content_hash":"01c7c4136348ffc9b33278e671c6d86c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2647,"method_rank":0}

But, early in their real estate investment careers, a mistake cost them about $100,000 worth of retirement savings.\n\"I think each of us lost like $50,000 in our 401(k),\" MacFarland told Business Insider of the failed deal they invested in back in 2008.\n\"We were very prevalent in the industry of people talking about self-directed IRAs and using your retirement accounts, and so we happened to use our retirement accounts to invest in a syndicated real estate deal,\" he explained. \"In retrospect, the timing was horrible.\"\nIt wasn't just bad timing. Han and MacFarland forewent a critical step: due diligence.\nReal-estate syndication is a way for a group of investors to pool their capital together and purchase a single property managed by a \"syndicator.\" Once the investor contributes capital, their role in the deal becomes completely passive, as the syndicator is responsible for finding the deal, executing the transaction, and, ultimately, delivering returns to the investors.\nThe hands-off nature of these deals is great for investors with more money than time, but you're putting a lot of trust in the syndicator and depending on their competence. You're investing in both the deal and the person running it. And while a good syndicator can turn a mediocre property into a success, a bad one can ruin a great opportunity — or, drain your retirement savings, in the case of Han and MacFarland.\nThey met the syndicator through a colleague and, \"we trusted that he knew what he was doing,\" said MacFarland. Looking back, they would have spent a lot more time on the vetting process.\nAn easy first step when vetting syndicators is to type their first and last names into Google along with keywords like \"fraud,\" \"complaints,\" or \"SEC.\" You can also talk to investors who have worked with them in the past and ask about their experience.","content_hash":"281cedd4e9009ad8cb61c686f2d78547","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2646,"method_rank":0}

OpenAI is not “actively looking” at such an effort today because it’s focused on securing computing capacity for its own operations, she said. But “I do think about it as a business down the line, for sure,” Friar said.\nIn recent years, OpenAI has gained expertise on how to design and set up data centers to optimize workloads for AI. The company now sees an opportunity to capitalize on that know-how. It also wants to become more directly involved in the process rather than rely solely on third-party vendors. “If all we do is buy from others, all we’re doing is giving them our IP because they’re learning how to build AI infrastructure,” Friar said.\nOpenAI has raised tens of billions of dollars to pay for advanced chips and data centers to build and operate cutting-edge AI services. The company is also working with SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. on an ambitious infrastructure venture called Stargate, with plans to build massive data centers in the US and abroad.\nEven that may be a drop in the bucket. Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman told reporters this month that people “should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars” on data center construction in the “not very distant future.” Altman said OpenAI is working to “design a very interesting new kind of financial instrument” to help support that effort, without providing details.\nHistorically, OpenAI has leaned on other partners, including backer Microsoft Corp. and Oracle, to help finance the cost of building out data centers. Now, the company is also seeing banks and private equity firms “come to the table” with debt financing to support its infrastructure initiatives, Friar said.\n“That’s the next path we’re going down,” Friar said. From there, she added, OpenAI is “trying to be thoughtful” about whether there are “other interesting, novel ways we could do that beyond debt.”","content_hash":"da38a066d17d8ac93e0ba50b8b62a402","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2642,"method_rank":0}

After rallying earlier, the stock has lost most of its momentum and now sits roughly flat year-to-date, underperforming the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has gained more than 9% in the same period. The pullback highlights macroeconomic uncertainty and concerns around its valuations.\nUpstart, known for its AI-driven lending marketplace, has not yet seen any material deterioration in its credit performance. Still, broader concerns about inflation, tariffs, and consumer credit demand have weighed heavily on investor confidence. These pressures have left the stock down more than 18% over the past month alone.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nThe Quantum Computing Race Is On: These 2 Stocks Appear Poised to Lead\n-\nAs SoFi Launches International Money Transfer Services, How Should You Play SOFI Stock?\nDespite the macro uncertainty, Upstart’s consistently solid quarterly performances are hard to ignore.

Further, the highest price target for UPST stock is $105, implying nearly 70% upside potential from current levels.\nUPST’s Q2 Shows Solid Momentum in Its Business\nUpstart’s second-quarter results highlight that its platform is gaining traction, while its revenue mix is increasingly shifting toward more sustainable, fee-based income. Further, higher loan activity, improved underwriting efficiency, and continued momentum in its emerging product lines position it well to sustain the momentum in 2025 and beyond.\nLoan originations on the Upstart platform reached $2.8 billion in Q2, the highest in three years. This surge reflects the appeal of Upstart’s platform and its growing funding partnerships. The company’s AI-driven underwriting model continues to improve, driving higher conversion rates and supporting triple-digit top-line growth. Notably, new product categories such as small-dollar loans and auto lending are meaningfully contributing to its growth, and accounting for more than 10% of total originations for the first time.\nUpstart delivered revenue of $257 million in Q2, representing a 102% year-over-year increase. However, the key here was the growing shift toward fee-based income, which helps mitigate credit risk and positions the company for steady growth over the long term. Fee revenue was approximately $241 million, up 84% from a year ago. Within that, transactional revenue more than doubled, primarily reflecting improvements in Upstart’s underwriting models, while servicing fees climbed nearly 20% as the book of serviced loans expanded.","content_hash":"318d9ea9d2d9d4484734b1f6ae05e38b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2641,"method_rank":0}

But none of the new price targets come close to the one proffered by Etherealize CEO Vivek Raman.\nAs Raman explains in a new Coinage interview, the recent rally is just further proof Ethereum is on its way to becoming the world's ledger, and worthy of a trillion-dollar price tag. Extrapolating the rough math would see Ethereum trade at about $80,000 per token, he says.\n\"I think we have to dream a lot bigger. I think we're building the infrastructure for the whole global economy,\" Raman told Coinage. \"We've almost been in this like PTSD thing where ETH has been performing so badly price-wise for so long that people just don't dream big.\"\nIn a way, there is no denying at least the thrust of that logic. Despite new all-time highs this cycle for Solana and Bitcoin, Ethereum has not traded north of $4,800 since the days of 2021. Considering all the major advancements the ecosystem, blockchain, and projects have made since then, it does seem overdue. Factor in a mega-trend of digital asset treasury companies raising billions of dollars every week to stockpile more Ethereum, and it does seem inevitable that Ethereum notches a new high at some point as well. But... $80,000?\nAs Raman explains, the price target stems from an Etherealize report that likened Ethereum to digital oil. It was one of the first reports published by the pro-Ethereum group Raman co-founded to help institutional investors understand the upside of what Ethereum offers. The early goal is simple.\n\"Let's plug all of Wall Street into Ethereum and then see how the financial system works when it settles and everything is on the blockchain,\" he says. \"That's already starting with tokenization.\"\nAnd as the stablecoin narrative has played out this year, with Circle's IPO catapulting the company into the minds of bankers on Wall Street everywhere, the plan seems to be working. Just a couple months later, CNBC contributor Tom Lee would join as BitMine chairman and begin talking about Ethereum being incredibly undervalued if Circle was worth the multiple the market was putting on it.\nAs Tom Lee mentioned to Coinage at the time, \"Circle trades at around 100-times EBITDA … and a lot of Circle operates off Ethereum. So… if these tokenized assets like tokenized dollars traded 100-times EBITDA, what should the blockchain be valued at?”","content_hash":"07e91de4705237628d96dac33269d4d2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2640,"method_rank":0}

But for Buffett, building a shareholder base isn’t about quantity; it’s about quality.\nBuffett’s reasoning is straightforward: the shareholders you attract influence the stability, decision-making, and valuation of your business. Investors who understand a company’s long-term approach are less likely to panic during downturns, demand short-term results, or pressure management into unsound moves. By contrast, courting investors with a trading mentality — those who are focused on short-term price swings rather than intrinsic business value — can create volatility that serves neither management nor long-term owners.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nThe Quantum Computing Race Is On: These 2 Stocks Appear Poised to Lead\n-\nAs SoFi Launches International Money Transfer Services, How Should You Play SOFI Stock?\nHis approach is deliberate. Berkshire’s shareholder letters, policy decisions, and even its refusal to split the stock are “advertisements” to attract the right type of investor while subtly repelling the wrong kind. This self-selection strategy works like a filter: clear communication draws disciplined investors, avoiding hype turns away short-term speculators, and an owner-oriented mindset appeals to those thinking in decades, not days. As Buffett has explained elsewhere, the goal is to create a market “populated by rational, informed investors” — not speculators chasing headlines.\nIn today’s markets, this principle is more relevant than ever. Meme stocks can double overnight, social media posts can move billions in market cap in hours, and zero-commission trading apps have gamified speculation. For public company CEOs, a shareholder base dominated by short-term traders can pressure management into unsustainable earnings “beats,” drive up volatility that deters long-term institutional investors, and distract leadership from executing a long-range strategy. For private business owners seeking outside capital, misaligned investors can push for premature exits, demand risky growth strategies for faster payback, or undermine a company’s culture to boost margins.","content_hash":"f9690e61075677225d27c974b6bef9ea","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2637,"method_rank":0}

SG&A should remain flattish at 28.3%, as cost leverage from strong comps offsets higher labor and incentive compensation costs.\nLooking ahead to 2025, Feldman estimates EPS of $4.72, in line with consensus and the top end of company guidance, and sales growth of 14% to $4.42 billion.\nHe forecasts a 170 bps operating margin contraction to 7.5%, largely from tariffs, labor, and incentive costs. While visibility remains clouded by tariff risks, Feldman maintains a constructive stance on the Five Below story.\nIn the last month, analysts have turned more constructive on Five Below, with most raising price forecasts despite mixed ratings.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin dropped 2.4% to $113,511, and Ethereum shed over 5%.\nCuban’s perspective on IPOs also comes informed by his history with meme coins. He was one of the first high-profile figures to embrace Dogecoin, and in 2021 he even allowed fans to use DOGE to buy Mavericks tickets and merchandise. At the same time, he has cautioned investors against chasing speculative assets, having once lost money himself in a DeFi project tied to an obscure token.\nMark Cuban’s complex relationship with crypto\nIn 2021, he famously lost money in a DeFi project called Titan that collapsed in hours.

Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has said that Cook took a mortgage on a property in Ann Arbor, Michigan, stipulating that it would be her primary residence, and then two weeks later declared the same for another mortgage on a Georgia property.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nWhy New York City Has a Fleet of New EVs From a Dead Carmaker\n-\nTrump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants\n-\nChicago Schools Seeks $1 Billion of Short-Term Debt as Cash Gone\n-\nNeom’s Desert Ski Resort Strains Saudi Prince’s $1.5 Trillion Plan\nThe paper’s data set consists of 584,499 loans made from 2005 to 2017.

The share of those claiming occupancy for better mortgage terms peaked ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, though remained steady for much of the ensuing decade at about 2% to 3%.\nThe findings are based on a subsample of data, meaning the number of mortgages fitting the central bank’s criteria could be higher. The researchers also caution that there are likely cases of accidental occupancy fraud, such as when borrowers were unable to sell their original home because of a worse-than-expected real estate market.\nScrutinizing the mortgages of Cook, who was nominated to the Fed by former President Joe Biden, appears to be the latest way in which Trump and his allies are using novel methods to pressure the central bank to lower interest rates.\nThe president said Wednesday that Cook “must resign now,” while Pulte claimed his accusations give him “cause to fire” her. If she were forced out, it would create another opening for Trump to appoint someone who would likely push for more aggressive rate cuts.\nPulte said “anybody can go look at these public documents” from Cook in a CNBC interview Wednesday.

What? Intel? Not Micron?\nYes, you read that right. Pursuant to the CHIPS Act passed under the Biden administration to support the U.S. semiconductor industry, Intel was awarded $10.9 billion in grants, but new negotiations between Intel and the White House suggest the Trump administration now wants to convert those grants into a 10% equity stake in Intel, effectively part-nationalizing the company.\nBut Intel isn't the only company to receive CHIPS Act grants. Micron was awarded $6.1 billion as well -- the second-biggest semiconductor subsidy after Intel's. And now we're learning that U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick may want to convert that grant into an equity stake as well.\nWhat does this mean for Micron?\nThat's exactly the question, isn't it: What does this mean for Micron?\nOn the one hand, if Commerce decides to convert its grant into a stock investment, this would effectively deprive Micron of $6.1 billion in \"free money\" that it thought it had -- clearly bad news for the stock.\nOn the other, Micron would still get the money -- just with strings attached -- and perhaps be set up to receive additional investments from the government if it needs them.\nBut the rumor that the government wants to pressure Micron for an equity stake could turn out to be false. That would still leave Micron competing with a state-backed rival in Intel, which could ask for further handouts that Micron might not get.\nThis is bad news for Micron.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Micron Technology wasn’t one of them.

Only Spain and the Netherlands reported a higher proportion, at 37pc and 48pc respectively, according to figures from management consultancy Kearney.\nThe fast rate of branch closures leaves dozens of high streets across the UK without a bank. There is just one bank branch for every 10,000 people in the UK, compared to 4.9 branches per 10,000 people in France.\nBanks’ shrinking presence on the high street comes as lenders across the country seek to cut costs and focus on their digital offering.\nThe UK’s largest retail banks are also facing increasing competition from challenger banks such as Monzo and Starling Bank, which have lower costs because they have no branches and fewer staff.\nSome of Britain’s largest banks are continuing to shut down branches this year. Barclays is set to close 99 branches, Santander is shutting down 95 and NatWest is abandoning 108.\nTo replace branches, some banks have started to use shared banking hubs, which each lender uses for one day a week. The Government has ambitious targets to open banking hubs across the country, although some have been forced to open in libraries and cafes because of the lack of cheap rental rates on the high street.\nThe decline of bank branches and free ATMs has also sparked concerns about a potential decline in cash acceptance. The number of cash machines in the UK fell by 5pc year on year to 46,182 in 2024, according to ATM provider Link.\nSince the pandemic, there has also been a rise in the number of businesses that call themselves cash-free, with others stating that they prefer customers to accept card or contactless payments.\nOver the last decade, there has also been a significant decline in the number of cash transactions. Cash accounted for just over half of all payments in 2013, but fell to 12pc in 2023 as the popularity of card and digital increased.\nThe picture in the UK is similar to other parts of Europe.\nAccording to Riksbank, 10pc of in store purchases in Sweden are made using cash as the country embraces mobile and card payments. A survey carried out by Norges Bank in 2025 showed that just 2pc of the public in Norway uses cash for payments, one of the lowest rates in Europe.","content_hash":"f145545136e61182e2183f7e8b3bf923","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2608,"method_rank":0}

That will soon include in-person visits to offices around the U.S. by Sandrew and Verne Marble, who was hired as managing director of the division at the same time Sandrew came on.\n“We need to be talking with advisors about what their goals are and what areas we can help them with that involves navigating with them, not to them, on what the priorities are,” Sandrew said. “We’re in the midst of hiring for this particular role, and I am making it a mandate that it is someone from the independent side, because they’re going to need to understand the industry.”\nSandrew added that Mariner is leaning into the independent channel to try to capture what is often cited as the most popular option for breakaway advisors, as well as for independent advisors seeking additional support and a long-term succession plan. The firm is competing with a proliferation of independent or affiliate RIA options, ranging from other mega-RIA affiliation programs, platform providers, minority investors with support networks and affiliate channels via independent broker\/dealers.\nHe said part of the key to winning in this market is working closely with advisors to hear about and then try to address their needs. Some of those solutions may come from within the Mariner ecosystem in areas such as valuation services, banking, estate planning or tax strategies.\n“We’re building out a little more infrastructure around strategic growth and engagement, which is providing resources to help advisors navigate, not only through Mariner from a business-building resource perspective, but up and down all the elements of their business,” Sandrew said. “We can do that today, but we’re making it more formal.”\nMariner has different affiliation options in addition to its 1099 platform. There is a hybrid-affiliate called Mariner Advisor Network, created in 2022 with the acquisition of The Financial Services Network, which partners with LPL Financial. It also has Baystate Wealth Management, which offers third-party investment offerings to advisors, and a separate custom model portfolio group.","content_hash":"a708d54ddd09ec0d0838b9e6eca8ee84","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2605,"method_rank":0}

This process is called garnishment.\nAccording to the DOL, there are limits to how much a creditor can garnish from your wages or benefits and there are laws that help you maintain a minimum amount in your bank account even when your wages are being garnished.\nCan Your Unemployment Benefits Be Garnished?\nIn most cases, an official court order is needed to garnish wages or benefits. That means that creditors, such as credit card agencies or other commercial lenders will need a garnishment order to garnish wages or benefits.\nHowever, the government garnishes certain types of unpaid debts, including tax debt, student loan debt and child support or alimony. Ordinary garnishments that don’t fall into these categories typically can’t exceed 25% of an employee’s weekly disposable earnings.\nTax Debt\nIf you owe unpaid taxes, your employer may receive a court order to withhold a percentage of your paycheck. The exact amount of garnished wages may vary, depending on your situation and whether you owe state or federal taxes.\nStudent Loan Debt\nIf you default on your federal student loans, agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of Education (DOE) or contracted collection agencies can garnish up to 15% of your disposable earnings without a court order.\nChild Support or Alimony\nChild support or alimony can be garnished at a much higher rate of up to 60% of a worker’s disposable earnings. If you owe child support but are also supporting another spouse or child, the ceiling is lowered to 50%. Late payments will accrue additional penalties.\nHow To Protect Your Unemployment Benefits\nIf wage garnishment is causing you financial difficulties or you want to protect your unemployment benefits from being garnished, then it’s important to understand your options.\nAccording to FindLaw, here are some possible actions to consider when dealing with wage garnishment:","content_hash":"b5099a16adc95d54bee3d7ebab740776","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2598,"method_rank":0}

The two countries also intend to cooperate on automobile standards.\n“These tariff reductions are expected to be effective from the first day of the same month in which the European Union’s legislative proposal is introduced,” according to the statement.\nFor steel and aluminum imports, the two trading partners said they would “consider the possibility” of cooperating on ring-fencing their domestic markets to protect against overcapacity.\nAs part of the agreement, the EU expects to procure $750 billion in energy products through 2028 and $40 billion worth of artificial intelligence chips from the U.S. EU companies would also invest $600 billion in the U.S. over the next three years.","content_hash":"2afe37e0183c363296d3c474d3f4f3c6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2595,"method_rank":0}

The stock tumbled, falling to less than $1 earlier this year and putting it at risk of being delisted by the Nasdaq Composite.\nIn recent weeks, however, that low price has attracted interest from retail investors who spy opportunity in the stock. Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson has made the argument repeatedly on X.com that Opendoor could be the next Carvana.

But after a pullback, the stock is building momentum again -- except this time, there is real news driving its rally.\nFirst, shares jumped on Aug. 1, on a disappointing jobs report because investors believed that made it more likely the Fed would cut interest rates, leading to lower mortgage rates. Then, after pulling back on its second-quarter earnings report, Opendoor got a boost from falling mortgage rates, which hit a nine-month low. The stock gained again on Aug. 15 after the company announced that CEO Carrie Wheeler would be stepping down from the top job.\nThe stock rose as much as 16% on Aug. 15 on that news before finishing up 4.3%.\nA changing of the guard\nIn a press release, Opendoor said it had appointed Shrisha Radhakrishna, the company's Chief Technology and Product Officer, as President and interim leader of the company while it searches for a new CEO. The succession process had begun earlier in the year as part of what the company called a \"strategic evolution.\"\nWheeler had faced a lot of pushback from company insiders, including co-founder Keith Rabois. Wheeler was CFO before taking over as CEO in December 2022, and some investors believe that a CEO with experience running a disruptive tech company could be a better fit for the job.","content_hash":"76c2d092beb8b2ebded899a856ab743b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2593,"method_rank":0}

That’s spawned demand for goods and services that cater to a more Islamic lifestyle. It’s more than just halal food: Muslim consumers also demand more modest fashion or cosmetics that don’t use pig-derived products or alcohol.\nEven Southeast Asia’s finance sector is becoming more halal. Islamic finance in Southeast Asia totaled roughly $859 billion in 2023, up from $754 billion in 2020, according to a study from the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector and the London Stock Exchange Group.\nMambu, a cloud-native, software-as-a-service, composable core banking platform based in Amsterdam, wants to tap this growing market. “The Southeast Asian market, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia, is incredibly dynamic in terms of how they’ve grown in the Islamic banking space,” says David Becker, managing director and head of APAC sales at the firm.\nThe company already works with Southeast Asian clients like Bank Islam, Malaysia’s largest provider of shariah-compliant financial products, and Bank Jago, an Indonesian digital bank.\nBecker says that Islamic finance is growing just as quickly as traditional banking, and so Mambu hopes to provide tools to support shariah-compliant products like profit sharing.\nUnlike in conventional banking, Islamic financial institutions must avoid companies that deal in products that are harmful or considered “haram”, like pork, alcohol, or gambling.\nIslamic banks also can’t charge interest and so must instead generate a return through some other mechanism, like profit-sharing or leasing.\nBecker is optimistic that Southeast Asia’s younger and more mobile-savvy population will gravitate towards digital financial solutions—and particularly those that reflect Islamic principles.\nIndonesia, the world’s largest Muslim country, is a clear target market for Islamic finance. Neighboring Malaysia, where two thirds of the population identify as Muslim, is another option. There are also significant Muslim populations across Singapore, the Philippines, and Thailand.\nMalaysia, the first country in the region to adopt Islamic finance, has “reached a peak” when it comes to growth, says Cedomir Nestorovic, a professor at the ESSEC Business School in Singapore who focuses on Islamic business. Instead, Indonesia offers more potential for retail banking and “takaful” insurance, a type that follows Islamic principles.\n“There is plenty of room for progress in the country, so many companies want to come to Indonesia,” Nestorovic says.","content_hash":"9611eb480bc5967cd4193418d5bac2e3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2592,"method_rank":0}

Juge Gregg, partner at law firm Crowell & Moring, told ESG Dive Tuesday that “companies won’t get a reprieve from fast-approaching reporting deadlines.”\nDive Insight:\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, along with the California Chamber of Commerce and other business trade associations, sued the California Air Resources Board — the agency responsible for the laws — in January 2024. The lawsuit concerns California SB 253, which requires companies with more than $1 billion in revenue to report scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, with eventual scope 3 disclosures, and SB 261, which requires companies with at least $500 million in revenues to make biennial climate-related risk reports. The plaintiffs argued the laws violate their First Amendment rights by compelling speech.\nWright, who previously denied a motion for summary judgment in the case, said the two laws implicate different levels of scrutiny to determine whether they violate the First Amendment, but based on the current record, Wright concluded the business groups are unlikely to succeed on the merits of the arguments against either law violating their rights against compelled speech.\n“Plaintiffs argue they will be irreparably harmed by [the disclosures] because the laws compel speech in violation of the First Amendment,” Wright wrote. “As Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the laws violate the First Amendment, they have also not shown irreparable harm.”\nWithout the injunction, the arguments on the merits of the case are not expected before the court until early next year. CARB released a FAQ with guidance on how to comply with the laws last month, and entities covered by SB 261 are expected to submit climate-related financial risk reports by Jan. 1, 2026.","content_hash":"a3a8e2ffa26350f5152a4dcfd986df08","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2590,"method_rank":0}

However, CEO Jeremy Allaire and other insiders are now cashing in, launching a secondary offering of 10 million shares that's raising $1.4 billion.\nJust two months after going public, Circle announced that eight million shares would come from existing shareholders, including CEO Allaire, while the company would offer two million shares. This move triggered a 5% after-hours decline, raising questions about management's confidence in the stock's current valuation.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nThe Quantum Computing Race Is On: These 2 Stocks Appear Poised to Lead\n-\nAs SoFi Launches International Money Transfer Services, How Should You Play SOFI Stock?\nDespite the insider selling, Circle's business momentum remains solid. In Q2 of 2025, Circle reported revenue of $658 million, an increase of 53% year over year, driven by USDC stablecoin circulation growing 90% year-over-year (YOY) to $61.3 billion.\nManagement projects USDC will grow at a 40% compound annual rate, positioning Circle to capture significant market share in what analysts believe could become a trillion-dollar stablecoin market.\nThe Trump administration's crypto-friendly policies have created unprecedented opportunities for Circle. The recently passed GENIUS Act represents the first U.S. crypto law, and Allaire noted that major financial institutions are now actively engaging with Circle for banking, payments, and capital markets applications.\nWhile insider selling might raise a few eyebrows, it's common for founders and early investors to diversify after successful IPOs. Circle's strong fundamentals, dominant USDC position, and favorable regulatory environment suggest the selling may simply reflect profit-taking rather than fundamental concerns. Investors should focus on the company's execution and market opportunity, rather than temporary selling pressure from insiders looking to realize gains after a remarkable run.\nEvidence of this can be seen at CRCL's current price action. It has already bounced back almost 2% today.\nIs Circle Stock a Good Buy Right Now?\nDuring its earnings call, Circle announced Arc, a groundbreaking Layer 1 blockchain that uses USDC as a native gas currency. This eliminates the complexity of paying transaction fees in volatile tokens. Arc positions Circle to capture transaction fee revenue streams while providing the purpose-built infrastructure that traditional finance demands for stablecoin adoption.","content_hash":"1c03b2c6e26d9ede4d2fe30c645730a7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2588,"method_rank":0}

It will ensure that the chipmaker will receive about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the U.S.\nUnder the agreement, the U.S. will purchase a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion, or $20.47 per share, which represents a discount of about $4 from Intel's closing share price of $24.80 on Friday.\nThe purchase of the 433.3 million Intel shares will be made with funding from the $5.7 billion in unpaid grants from the Biden-era CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion awarded to Intel for the Secure Enclave program, also awarded under Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden.\nIntel stock rose roughly 1% in the extended session on Friday after closing up 5.5% during regular trading.\nTrump met with Tan on Friday, a White House official said. That followed Trump's August 11 meeting with the Intel CEO after Trump demanded that Tan resign over his ties to Chinese firms.\n\"He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion,\" Trump said on Friday.\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that Tan had struck a deal \"that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"\nPLAYING CATCH UP\nThe Intel investment marks the latest unusual deal with U.S. companies, including a U.S. government agreement allowing AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for receiving 15% of those sales.\nOther recent deals include an agreement for the Pentagon to become the largest shareholder in a small mining company, MP Materials, to boost output of rare earth magnets and the U.S. government's winning a \"golden share\" with certain veto rights as part of a deal to allow Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel.\nThe federal government's broad intervention in corporate matters has worried critics, who say Trump's actions create new categories of corporate risk.\nAhead of the U.S. deal with Intel, Japan's SoftBank agreed to take a $2 billion stake in the chip maker on Monday.\nSome industry observers still question Intel's ability to surmount its problems.","content_hash":"bd91eb56c2e99e655564176ee278c065","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2562,"method_rank":0}

Foulger Pratt and its partners will close on an additional 138 units from the Arlington, Virginia-based REIT in the coming weeks, according to a news release.\n“This portfolio acquisition fits within our strategy of acquiring high-quality multifamily assets in great locations at significant discounts to replacement cost,” said Joe Clauser, Foulger Pratt’s chief financial officer. “We have long believed in the strength and resilience of the Washington, D.C., market, and with new supply tapering off, we see significant opportunities for rent growth and long-term value creation.”\nThe three initial properties in the transaction were built between 2003 and 2018 and are 95% leased. Foulger Pratt plans to make targeted renovations and active asset management strategies to enhance both resident experience and long-term value.\nThe initial three properties include:\n-\nAvalon Gallery Place: A 203-unit urban-infill multifamily community built in 2003 in Washington, D.C.’s Gallery Place\/Chinatown submarket.\n-\nAvalon First and M: A 469-unit property built in 2012 and located in the heart of the District’s NoMa submarket.\n-\nAVA NoMa: A 438-unit property completed in 2018 and adjacent to Avalon First and M in the NoMa submarket.\nAfter the deals close, Foulger Pratt will own 2,904 units in the District of Columbia and 7,755 apartments nationwide. For AVB, the sales are another step in its long-term move to sell properties in its established coastal regions and reinvest in the Sun Belt.\nOn the REIT’s recent second-quarter earnings call, chief investment officer Matthew H. Birenbaum said selling properties in D.C. is “particularly challenging and hard to predict” due to the city’s Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act, which gives residents the right of first refusal when their building is being sold.","content_hash":"9ec6437cbf41e392227740ec9f3251c3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2559,"method_rank":0}

In his new role, he will help accelerate sustainable growth, drive franchisee profitability and improve the guest experience across North America. His appointment was part of a move to bring in new leadership across various regions.\nThose appointments included Tracy Gehlan as president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa and Artemio Garza as president of Latin America and Caribbean. The hirings also come roughly a month after the chain brought on Jonathan Fitzpatrick as its newest CEO.\n“We’ve brought together a group of strong, experienced leaders who believe in Subway’s vision and are committed to partnering with our franchisees and employees to take this brand to the next level,” Fitzpatrick said in a statement.\nIn his most recent role at Best Buy, Harmon oversaw store and services teams and “championed initiatives that drove employee engagement, increased and strengthened long-term customer relationships, and delivered consistent, industry-leading results for the company,” the press release said. Harmon has also served in various positions at Bridgestone Americas.\nHarmon will likely oversee ongoing remodels across the U.S. system. Subway is providing rebates to franchisees as a way to reinvest in the operators’ business, according to Restaurant Business. These rebates are about 10% of a franchisees’ average weekly sales for the first half of this year.\n“We have rolled out a special reinvestment program for U.S. franchisees,” a Subway spokesperson said in an email about the reinvestment program. “Franchisee profitability is a top priority. With a new leadership team in place, we are exploring several initiatives focused on supporting our franchises, creating long-term sustainable growth, and helping to increase profitability.”\nA focus on franchisee profitability could help slow down ongoing closures across the U.S. system. The company closed 631 units last year, according to its franchise disclosure document. That follows 443 closures in 2023 and 571 in 2022. Average unit volumes are among the lowest in the industry at roughly $490,000, according to Restaurant Business.","content_hash":"06f9de0a2757865b1eed669f2924a120","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2557,"method_rank":0}

How much would you need to invest to reach your retirement goals?\nCheck Out: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nRead Next: Mark Cuban Tells Americans To Stock Up on Consumables as Trump's Tariffs Hit -- Here's What To Buy\nHow Much Will You Need for Retirement?\nTo know how much Apple you’ll need to invest in, you’ll have to start with your retirement savings goal. Depending on your lifestyle and where you live, you might need anywhere between $500,000 and $3 million or more to fund a comfortable retirement. Obviously, the less you’ll need in retirement, the less Apple stock you’ll need.\nDiscover More: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Bought Over $73 Million in Shares of This Tech Company — Here’s Why\nWhat Age Are You Starting?\nThe younger you are when you begin your investment career, the less Apple stock you’ll need to buy. For example, if you own $20,000 of Apple stock at age 25 and earn a 10% annual return until age 65, the stock will be worth nearly $1.1 million. But if you wait to buy $20,000 of Apple until age 40, a 10% annual return will only net you about $241,000.\nSo, How Much Apple Stock Do You Need?\nThere’s no way of determining exactly how much Apple stock you need to fund your retirement simply because its return is variable and unpredictable. However, using various starting ages and a range of returns for the stock, you could estimate how much you need now.\nThese figures all assume a retirement age of 65 and a final nest egg value of $1.5 million. If you feel you’ll only need $500,000 to retire, you could use one-third of these values. If you’re looking for $3 million, you’ll have to double them.\nApple’s closing price of $229.65 on Aug. 12, 2025, is used for purposes of this calculation.\nThe chart makes it clear that the earlier you can invest in Apple, the better your long-term results. Similarly, the increase in average annual return by just a few percentage points also makes a huge difference in your long-term account value.","content_hash":"d117111bdacec1983bc74520b68d2de3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2494,"method_rank":0}

Derby\n(Reuters) -Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday announced an updated operating framework more oriented toward traditional efforts of promoting price stability, supplanting what had been a troubled effort that biased central bank policy toward its job mandate over its inflation target.\nNodding toward significant changes in the economic landscape over the last five years, the new operating edict moves the Fed's framework away from what had been an omnipresent challenge of monetary policy having to operate at very low interest rates due to what had been an extended period of tepid inflation relative to the central bank's 2% target. That environment informed its 2020 policy framework review.\n\"There is a great deal of continuity with past statements\" in the new framework, Powell said in a speech to international economists and policymakers at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole conference in Wyoming.\n\"We continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward-looking and consider the lags in its effects on the economy\" and that the Fed must balance risks to both its job and inflation mandates when setting monetary policy, Powell said. He added that setting numerical goals for things like the ideal level of employment is \"unwise.\"\nPowell said in the new framework \"we removed language\" about the low-rate environment and \"we returned to a framework of flexible inflation targeting and eliminated the 'makeup' strategy\" featured in the 2020 framework, the last time the Fed updated its overall operating principles.\n\"Our revised statement emphasizes our commitment to act forcefully to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, to the benefit of both sides of our dual mandate,\" Powell added.\nKathy Bostjancic, chief economist for Nationwide, said the policy strategy update demonstrated that \"the Fed had reverted to its pre-COVID framework that had a symmetric focus on both attaining the inflation and employment goals, moving away from the more asymmetrical focus on the high unemployment rate and concerns about interest rates falling back sharply to the effective lower bound.\"\nJoe Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLP, said the framework would likely orient the central bank toward higher interest rates. \"By returning to a focus on price stability and a 2% inflation target, this implies that all concerned should prepare for higher rates for longer despite a rising probability of near-term rate cuts,\" he said.","content_hash":"253c8b05958f399b44c55b1275b0a190","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2488,"method_rank":0}

Despite having to pay premiums.”\nHe argued that when deductibles climb beyond reach, patients often avoid using coverage altogether and might be better off paying out-of-pocket.\n“It may sound counterintuitive, but if you can't afford your deductible, you MIGHT be better off not getting insurance,” Cuban wrote.\nTrending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90\/share.\nDirect-Pay Doctors And Cash Pricing Could Offer Cheaper Care\nCuban pointed to hospitals and physicians offering cash prices and financing plans, which he said are often lower than what insurers negotiate.\nHe encouraged patients to consider direct relationships with providers: “Now is the time to find a doctor who is willing to work with you directly and let you pay them directly. See what works for you.”\nSee Also: In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage — Get Your Demo\nMark Cuban's Push To Overhaul US Health Insurance\nCuban had long been a vocal critic of the U.S. insurance industry, arguing that rising deductibles and opaque pricing left patients, doctors and hospitals at a disadvantage.\nIn May, during a talk at Stanford University's Department of Medicine, he accused insurers of designing plans that kept premiums low while steadily raising out-of-pocket costs.\nHe said this pushed patients into high-deductible plans that benefited insurers but left providers carrying the financial and reputational risk when patients couldn't pay.\nIn June, Cuban had unveiled a sweeping proposal to overhaul the healthcare system. In social media, he suggested eliminating traditional premiums, allowing patients to choose cash-pay providers with upfront pricing, and capping annual medical expenses at $50,000.","content_hash":"32e22cd42aab42f4f42ea9883159139a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2423,"method_rank":0}

ULTA YTD mountain ULTA YTD chart \"We believe shares can continue to be propelled higher by upwards consensus earnings revisions over the next several quarters,\" the analyst wrote. As a catalyst, Yih cited recent business decisions made by Ulta CEO Kecia Steelman, who took over the reins of the company earlier this year. \"We are highly encouraged by a series of rapid and decisive changes since CEO Kecia Steelman took the helm in January 2025,\" Yih said. Specifically, tailwinds include a return to margin expansion, improvements in promotional activity, the company's focus on optimizing points of retail distribution and its initially conservative guidance for fiscal 2025. Yih also emphasized that as one of only two specialty multibrand domestic beauty retailers, alongside Sephora, Ulta commands a unique target audience. \"Furthermore, we believe that the overall beauty landscape, which has been normalizing since its peak in 2022, is in the process of stabilizing with an annual growth rate in the mid-single-digit range,\" Yih said. \"While we acknowledge price increases in discretionary goods are on the horizon, and consumer demand in the U.S. market remains an unknown variable, we believe that beauty, and in particular ULTA's core customer (aka the 'beauty enthusiast'), will continue to over-index wallet share toward beauty, health, and wellness categories.\" The analyst also pointed to Ulta's relative resistance to tariffs as another tailwind. Specifically, only around 1% of its merchandise was directly imported in fiscal 2024, \"suggesting minimal direct-cost tariff risk.\" \"The company has previously disclosed that it relies on China imports only for select hair care tools, store fixtures, and store supplies,\" she said. \"As such, overall risk remains negligible and well below the rest of our coverage universe as the company's key categories, such as beauty and personal care products have limited China and Southeast Asia exposure (i.e., K-beauty and J-beauty); we do note that some product is imported from Europe.\"","content_hash":"3521572bcc62690a31866133df431dde","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2411,"method_rank":0}

The AI startup said it “conferred on four occasions” with Meta about its response.\nOpenAI said its request from the court is aligned with the court’s July 9 order that discovery related to Musk’s bid and the letter of intent “is relevant to phase 1 issues…because Musk’s bid may be inconsistent with Plaintiffs' phase 1 theories of liability.”\nMeta said in the filing that the court should reject OpenAI’s request because it said the AI startup should obtain the documents it wants “directly from plaintiffs” — which is Musk — “rather than imposing that burden on non-party Meta.” It added that any documents OpenAI wants that \"plaintiffs do not have” are “not relevant.”\nRegarding OpenAI’s request for internal communications, Meta said “it is difficult to see how any communications by any Meta employee are at all relevant.”\nOpenAI said in the filing that “Meta’s objections are meritless.”\n— Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.","content_hash":"bc29284300fd78de495efa0e167f9002","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2390,"method_rank":0}

Put another way, a $1,000 investment in BNB during its ICO would now be worth $873,000.\nFrom exchange token to ecosystem giant\nBNB was originally created as a utility token for discounted trading fees on Binance. Over time, it expanded into powering BNB Chain, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and tokenized projects. Its quarterly token burns, modeled after a buyback strategy, have also fueled scarcity and upward price momentum.\nToday, BNB’s use cases span beyond Binance, including payment gateways, NFTs, decentralized exchanges, and real-world spending options. Its growth parallels Binance’s rise from a fledgling startup in 2017 to the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume.\nBNB’s surge comes amid a broader market rebound. Bitcoin traded above $114,200, while Ethereum hovered at $4,347. Other majors like Solana ($186), XRP ($2.97), and Dogecoin ($0.22) also posted weekly gains. The total crypto market cap climbed back to $3.96 trillion, with BNB alone commanding 3% of that share.\nSentiment around BNB has also been lifted by structural adoption.

The case is proceeding in a federal court in Northern California, and a judge recently said OpenAI can move ahead with counter claims against Musk, who co-founded OpenAI as a non-profit with Sam Altman and others in 2015.\nWhen Musk floated his proposal to buy OpenAI in February, he was incensed that the company and Altman, OpenAI's CEO, were pushing to transform the business into a for-profit entity.

Musk later sued OpenAI, alleging a breach of contract, and tried to stop OpenAI from converting to a for-profit company.\nIn its counter claims, OpenAI has alleged that Musk and xAI's \"sham bid\" harmed its business and that Musk has engaged in \"harassment\" through litigation and attacks on social media and in the press.\nAs part of its complaint, OpenAI has filed to subpoena Meta for communications between the company, its CEO and Musk about the bid.\nIn a statement to the court published Thursday, OpenAI said that when Musk and xAI were trying to form a consortium of investors to finance a takeover, they approached Zuckerberg with a letter of intent and asked \"about potential financing arrangements or investments.\"\nNeither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the LOI, the filing said.\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

That makes Jane Street the fourth largest investor in CRWV, according to Wednesday’s regulatory filing.\nThe nod from quant firm Jane Street is a much-needed boost for CoreWeave, which has collapsed by 37% from last week’s highs amid widespread selling in tech stocks. Recent market skepticism about artificial intelligence (AI) valuations, influenced by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments about potential market bubbles and an MIT study showing limited returns on AI investments, has contributed to the selling pressure on CRWV - despite strong fundamental growth indicators.\nMore News from Barchart\nH.C.

Wainwright today, with the brokerage firm arguing that the stock’s price has now “sunk deep enough,” particularly considering that CoreWeave is pacing the industry in neocloud, which the firm considers “one of the most influential technology adoption cycles of our time.”\nH.C. Wainwright lifted its rating on CRWV to “Buy” from “Neutral,” with the $180 price target implying expectations for the stock to roughly double from here.\nAfter a wobbly start to the day, CRWV stock is up more than 1%. The stock is trading below its 21-day exponential moving average and 50-day simple moving average, but the Wall Street newcomer is testing support near the site of a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of its all-time high and low.\nCoreWeave’s Fundamental Story\nCoreWeave’s Q2 2025 results showcased impressive revenue growth, with the top line tripling year-over-year to $1.21 billion - though profitability remains elusive, with a substantial net loss of $291 million, primarily due to interest expenses on its $11 billion debt load.

That's our bottleneck for growth in this market,\" Batista told investors in mid-August. \"It's actually production capacity. It's much more production capacity than actually being able to sell.\"\nA cattle shortage in the U.S. has driven up the price of beef, pushing consumers to more affordable options. JBS' pork unit in the U.S. posted a 5% decline during the previous year due to trade restrictions with China, though executives said business fundamentals remained strong.\n\"When there is low availability of beef and high prices of beef, pork becomes a very good option,\" Batista said.\nJBS currently operates four production facilities in Iowa. The plant in Perry would provide raw materials to the acquired facility in Ankeny, allowing the company to produce fully cooked sausage items in addition to bacon.\nThe Ankeny plant is expected to create approximately 400 jobs when all phases of the project are finished.

Its shares have gained 11.7% year-to-date, and the strong share price performance has also caught Cramer’s attention. While discussing Brinker International, Inc.

What Hochman realized is that America isn’t ready for north of ten bucks. It is delicious. . .they use really good tequila, and I think it’s one of the better places that, I go to with my wife.

You know, we got the CAVA that was really bad, the Sweetgreen. But some of these companies always seem to come through because they have something different, like Brinker International, the parent company of Chili’s and Maggiano’s. This morning, Brinker reported a beautiful top and bottom line beat with a mindboggling 23.7% same-store sales numbers from the Chili’s business. They just keep doing it. Even better, management issued a strong forecast for the year ahead, which is why the stock rallied over 1.6% today, although at one point it was up even bigger. Brinker’s been a winner in this environment because they offer their customers an incredible value proposition.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of EAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

In May 2024, he told \"Fast Money\" that high-income shoppers were creating a \"bubble\" at Walmart. His concern: They would return to premium retailers once inflation started to abate.\nBut that hasn't happened.

When a stock trades above its 200-DMA, it is generally seen as being in an uptrend, while trading below it may signal potential weakness or a shift in momentum. Because of its role as a key support or resistance level, the 200-DMA is closely watched by both traders and long-term investors.\nIn recent years, the 200-DMA has been a notable level of support for MSTR.\nFor instance, in April 2025, during the so-called “Trump tariff tantrum,” the stock tested this level before rebounding. A similar pattern emerged during the summer of 2024, when MSTR once again found a floor around the 200-DMA before resuming its upward trajectory.\nWhether the current dip below this technical threshold proves temporary or signals a more sustained downturn will likely depend on both bitcoin’s price action and broader market sentiment.\nChanos notches a win\nFamed short-seller James Chanos has been publicly bearish on Strategy for a number of weeks, saying he's opened up a sizable bet against the Michael Saylor-led company by shorting MSTR against a long in bitcoin.\nOf late, the trade has been looking like a winner, with MSTR lower by 21% over the past month compared to bitcoin's very modest 3.5% decline.\nMarket technician J.C. Parets noted on Wednesday that the ratio between MSTR and IBIT (BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF) has now fallen to a five-month low. \"This one is accelerating quickly,\" said Parets.","content_hash":"e87ee8ae8f59f138f0caeb6ad0296d47","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1720,"method_rank":0}
