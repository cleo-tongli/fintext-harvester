But are they still growing fast enough for investors? Find out today on Motley Fool Money.\nI'm Emily Flippen, and today I'm joined by analysts Sanmeet Deo and Jason Hall to talk about capital compounders. They're businesses that have reinvested for growth so rapidly that earnings and their market values have just snowballed over time. We have earnings out from two of these new school compounders that we'll discuss. But first, let's talk about some of the old school compounders that reported last night, both of which that have been defying that overvalued label for years. A quintessential element of being a Rule Breaker investment is being called overvalued. Sanmeet, let's start with Axon. Axon Enterprises just posted its 29% revenue growth with over $1.2 billion in annualized recurring revenue. They have contracted bookings growth of 43% year over year. Management also once again raised guidance. Now, when I rewind to August 2020, I find a Seeking Alpha article that claimed despite the strong unit economics of Axon, the stock was too expensive at around $80 a share and that its intrinsic value is closer to 74 \"at best\". Today, Axon after earnings trades for over $800 a share. What are your takeaways here?\nSanmeet Deo: This stock over a five-year period has grown 704%. That is really because of a consistent, strong execution and a powerful business model that's almost like a razor blade model where they're selling hardware and offering high-margin subscription, Cloud software, to complement that hardware. They have just continued to consistently over really that whole five-year period generate double-digit revenue growth, and this quarter was no different. They beat and raised on earnings and revenues, continued strong revenue growth, software services, providing that high margin growth. It's almost like, when is this company not going to perform? That's the worry. Really only concern of this company right now is its valuation, and that it's stretched. But with numbers like these, that valuation is justified for a growth company.\nEmily Flippen: It's so funny to go back and find articles that compare a mere six dollars in price difference, that at the time when that article was written, $80 versus $74 probably felt like a lot. When you look at it where it is today, it's almost like splitting hairs. But I do have to ask, this is the definition of what it means to be a compounder, and a quintessential definition of a rule-breaking stock is that they always somehow look overvalued, but in order to compound, you just continue to grow and grow much faster than the market expects. In your opinion, does Axon have what it takes to continue to compound, or is this truly overvalued? Because there are moments where stocks truly are overvalued for the growth that they put forward.\nSanmeet Deo: Well, really, it's overvalued, and it's still a great investment compounding because growth are like muscles, they always need fuel. Growth is always needed with fuel. Axon has proven that their products and services right now are growing. There will be a limit to that. But growth investor is always looking for what's that next leg of growth? What is that other opportunity that can cause this company to continue to grow and continue to justify that premium valuation? Axon has international markets that can continue to grow in. It's looking to also possibly get into more of the federal enforcement agencies. That's a little tougher nut to crack, but that's something they're doing. Like we all hear from most other companies, AI. One cool thing that they're using with AI is their AI-powered software. They collect a lot of data from their body cameras and their hardwares. Gathering all that data and something as simple as just making paperwork easier for officers, that in itself could be a huge leg of growth. You think it's just paperwork. Paperwork takes a lot of time and takes a lot of effort away from doing the actual work that officers need to do is being out there in the field. Things like that, and then now they bought a drone company called Skydio, working to do something called drone as a first responder, where they can send out drones to monitor what's happening in the real world, and maybe triaging whether the officer can really go in there. Lots of great opportunities, but they got to execute to justify their valuation.\nEmily Flippen: Another business that has to execute to arguably justify its valuation, although it's looking arguably a little bit cheaper today, is Mercado Libre. Now, in their quarter, they just topped 90 million unique active buyers, 68 million fintech users with an FX-neutral top-line growth of over 50%. Now, I rewind even further with Mercado Libre back to 2014. There's a Forbes article. They asserted that Mercado Libre was significantly overvalued at $87 a share. Since that valuation implied a 17% compounded annual growth in operating profit for the next decade, certainly a high bar. But I tell you what? It's been a decade, Jason. Mercado Libre, posted net operating profit, Kaeger, of over 40% for the past 10 years. At share price now sitting at just under $2,300 a share, what did you make of this report?\nJason Hall: It's exactly what you talked about when you and Sanmeet were talking about Axon. Two things can be true at the same time. They might seem diametrically opposing, where a stock can be overpriced. But the growth stories that can drive the results in it still a winning stock can still be there. The key with Axon is the growth opportunity has to be very large, and the company has to be led by people who can execute on a vision that many others just really don't see. In the case of Mercado Libre, you go back a decade ago, and this was just a company trying to build e-commerce in Latin America. What it's actually done is build the financial tools for buyers. This past quarter, we saw the dual flywheels of the e-commerce business, and payments continue to drive that growth. Since Mercado Libre operates in about a dozen and a half countries with different currencies, doesn't really move a lot of money around across those borders. The numbers that I'm talking about, they are currency neutral. Gross merchandise volume, that's the sum of all the transactions on the e-commerce platform. It was up 37% in the quarter. Here's the big one. Total payment volume, this is the value of all the transactions on its fintech platform, were up 61%. Here's a giant number. Total payment volume, almost $65 billion versus $15.3 billion in gross merchandise volume. That's a ton of money that's flowing through Mercado Libre that's going to other merchants and going to other payments, and it's a massive amount of valuable data. Now, let's look at the bottom line a little bit. Because of all the currency adjustments, Mercado Libre reports in US dollars, but essentially does no business in US dollars, so we really have to adjust that. Net income was down largely because of those foreign exchange adjustments. But adjusted free cash flow very strong even as it continues to spend a lot of money to build out its technology infrastructure and logistics infrastructure, the actual warehouse and distribution, and put a lot of capital to lending to consumers and merchants alike.\nEmily Flippen: It's really hard to understate just how important that fintech business is also for the bottom line in terms of driving operating profits. But that's the optionality that comes with business like this. A decade ago, you didn't know about the fintech offerings. Same question to you, Jason. When you look out, this is an old compound. Does it have the ability to keep compounding for the next decade?\nJason Hall: Just as with Axon, which used to be called TASER International, got into the body cam business, got into the SaaS business as it started collecting all of that data, we're seeing a lot of the same thing that's driving the future for Mercado Libre because it's really that data that it's gaining through its payments business about the spending patterns and habits of its consumers and all of the data about its merchants that it's using to inform making good credit decisions. I don't think we need any new transformative businesses like Mercado Pago, but it's starting to reach into that Amazon playbook. It's building an ad business, so there's an incremental thing there. You look at those growth rates, and you think, these are crazy, they're unsustainable. Sure, they're going to come down over time. But I think we have to acknowledge how massive the market is. If we look at those 18 countries or so that it does business in, e-commerce is a fraction of total consumer spending in those countries, banking services, credit card usage, even smaller penetration than we see in developed economies. Now, here's the key, move fast and break things is great in tech, but not if you're lending money. We saw a blip on the radar last year with the credit businesses, default rates started to creep up. But what we've seen since then is that management is doing a good job so far of managing that risk. If it can keep being a good originator of debt, that's a very different operational skill set than the things that it's built its foundation on, and just ride the massive secular tailwinds of commerce and finance in Latin America, absolutely, Mercado Libre could remain a winning investment.\nEmily Flippen: One thing I love about both those companies is that when you rewind time, it's really hard to find an analyst that didn't call them overhyped or expensive. Even among people who were fans of the investments, they always looked expensive, but that execution just kept compounding. It's a playbook that just seems to work time and time again. Coming up next, we'll have two new school compounders that are trying to run the same play. This is Motley Fool Money.\nOne of the great things about history is that while it might not repeat, it does rhyme. Reinvestors keep finding great ways to grow and analyst sometimes rightfully, sometimes regretfully, keep calling them overvalued. Let's dive into two companies that are proving the history of compounders isn't changing yet today. Both Hims & Hers and Palantir, they both reported earnings. Both still had their fair number of skeptics. But, Jason, let's start with Hims & Hers. This is a telehealth platform that's known for compounding more than just returns in terms of its popular compounded drug offerings. Their revenue growth has risen at triple digit in recent years, and the business is converting new customers left and right. But at the same time, there was a Seeking Alpha article posted last month that claimed Hims was potentially \"too late to buy\" after shares have doubled with a fair value closer to $40 per share. Based on what you're seeing in the most recent report, Jason, do you agree it's too late for investors to jump in on this bandwagon?\nJason Hall: First of all, I'll say it's a good thing that I'm talking about Hims & Hers and not Palantir, considering that I'm using options to short it, and we'd get a lot of emails about that. I'm not going to even talk about Palantir. But when you look at what's going on with Hims & Hers, I think it's less about whether it's an overpriced stock and whether its future is going to be more like Mercado Libre and less like some overhyped pass flyer that came down to Earth. What that's going to work out to is the extremely large market opportunities that are in front of it. In this case, we're talking about healthcare spending. Now, here's the thing. The core of Hims & Hers today it's really about prescribing medications and ideally, ones that it can compound in its own pharmacies, where it can earn the bulk of the profits that otherwise are shared more with pharma. Just, for example, it has about 2.4 million subscribers. Massive growth in subscribers continues year over year, quarter over quarter. Of that 2.4 million, 1.5 million are on what it calls a personalized treatment plan. That generally means that it's compounding a special dose or it's combining multiple medications into a single deliverable, like a gummy, something that's not commercially available. Now the question about this business model is, how large can it become? What percentage of the actual spend for pharmaceuticals can that actually be? Then it also ties to its incentive structure for physicians, which is heavily tied to writing a prescription. Can that remain viable? I think we've all read the reports of customers being written a prescription with less than a couple of minutes of interaction with a physician.\nUp next is expansion and more vertical integration. We're seeing they're spending a ton of money to increase their lab testing capabilities and then start delivering even more personalized medical services. The bottom line here is the healthcare industry is worth trillions of dollars, and some disruption to the status quo in this extremely regulated space is probably a really good thing. But Hims & Hers having a future that looks more like Mercado Libre or Axon is going to require it to do more than just being a compounding prescription factory. It needs to become a vertically integrated healthcare business that beats those entrenched players at their own game by some degree, reinventing how that game is played, too.\nSanmeet Deo: The only thing that I'll say about Hims is it's still very early in its growth, high risk, high opportunity. It's developing a healthcare platform unlike we've probably seen, unlike we probably can even imagine. It's going to be hard. It's going to take a lot of work, but there's a lot of growth areas that it can grow into, and it's just going to take a lot of time for it to cook.\nJason Hall: Exactly. It's an execution play, not a valuation play.\nEmily Flippen: That's beautifully said, and I think we spend a fair bit of time on Motley Fool Money talking about Hims, and in hindsight, it might be one of those companies that flames out. We don't talk about it a decade from now, or it could be the Mercado Libre, where a decade from now the opportunity seems so obvious that we wonder why we didn't spend more time discussing it. It's binary in that regard, but I'm really excited to see where it takes us. But Jason, as you alluded to, I'm really excited to talk about Palantir here. I'll spare you. You are obviously a bear on Palantir. Maybe we'll have to have you on at some point in the future to give us some more context behind that thought. But, Sanmeet, I want to go to you. This is a really lucrative business, but one that has all these secretive government contracts, and that has created an incredible opportunity for high rates of return on its capital, but not everyone is sold. One analyst claimed the stock is both overhyped and overpriced, given the fact that it trades at a price-to-sales ratio north of 70 times. I have to admit that does sound pretty expensive. What are you seeing here?\nSanmeet Deo: This is the most expensive stock on the market, probably, but this is a classic Rule Breaker in so many senses of the term that intuitively it just feels, and I will say here now and I've said it before on some of our other shows, I think it will be a trillion-dollar company at some point. It will hit its slide, growth will slow. It will take a correction as all Rule Breakers have. The growth that they're doing right now at such a high margin, expanding from the government to the commercial side of the business, and basically becoming the operating system of AI. Short term, it could be a great short. Long term, I think it's going to be a fantastic compound that I think we're talking about as one of the premier software companies.\nEmily Flippen: Well, I can't wait to have you both on at some point in the future to have the two opinions here between the actively buying puts and the belief that Palantir could be a trillion-dollar company, too. That is what makes a market two entirely separate opinions.\nJason Hall: I think both of those could be true, though.\nEmily Flippen: It's true.\nJason Hall: We're going to see.\nEmily Flippen: When we get back from this break, we'll be doing tariff math in a minute. Stick with us.\nPolicy shifts on tariffs are in motion. As you wrap up here, let's do a little bit of tariff math. That could go a long way for investors. For starters, let's take a look at hardware plus software business, Zebra. Zebra reported earnings this morning, and management had to spell it out clearly for investors. There's a $30 million operating profit headwind, just from import tariffs alone, which reduced their EBITDA margin by nearly a full percentage point. Doesn't sound like a lot. But when you're Zebra, that's a lot of cash. In other pure hardware companies, they're expected to be impacted even more. Caterpillar saw its operating profit fall 18% this quarter, again, largely due to tariffs. Now, I know exact math is impossible here, but when you look at businesses that can mitigate the impact of tariffs that have decent pricing power, Jason and Sanmeet, I want to go quick Round Robin. Where, if anywhere, is pricing power strong enough that the cost can be passed along enough to mitigate the costs of tariffs?\nSanmeet Deo: I think that On Holdings is a great company with tons of pricing power. They have premium brands. Shoes are priced very highly, $150 and up. They have very high, 50% and above gross profit margin, which indicates pricing power. They're willing to raise prices, and they have just a very significant channel to do it with their direct consumers. I believe they have pretty strong pricing power.\nJason Hall: I think you pretty much are going to see it in consumer brands, largely, that's where you see it. Coca-Cola is a good example. One of the reasons that Warren Buffett has loved the company as long as he has is because their ability to raise prices, even as volumes of Coke and Diet Coke in the US have declined. They've raised prices enough to more than offset the loss of the volume. That's a good example. Even now, a company, though, who's been a loser to the market over the long-term. Pricing power is still no guarantee of returns. Ferrari, I think, is a primo example of a company in an industry that you don't associate pricing power. Automakers are price takers. They're heavily competitive. But when you control the market, yeah, there's plenty of hypercars out there, but there's only one Ferrari, and your motto is to provide the market with one less than it demands every year, you have pricing power.\nSanmeet Deo: What's 251,000 versus 250,000? No, big deal. There you go.\nEmily Flippen: Exactly. [laughs] I was going to say Lululemon. Now, they haven't historically been able, at least since the tariffs have been in place over the course of 2025, been able to pass those prices along, but I do think they had the type of audience and consumers, as well as the pricing power to at least mitigate the majority of tariff impacts. But Sanmeet, actually, in hindsight, I agree. I think On Holdings is probably where it's at. They're expanding into apparel as well. Despite the fact that I think Lululemon looks scarily cheap right now and pretty balanced risk-reward investment, I do think on is, to your point, probably in a better position there. But I guess time will tell, both for tariffs as well as future compounders. Really looking forward to where these companies are a decade from now.

The way that we react to risk or the risk that we respond to is immediate risk. It's seeing the yellow and the black flash of light in your peripheral vision or hearing the hiss of a snake or the roar of a lion, and you respond just like that. That's the way most people perceive risk in financial markets. It's the day that the market calls falls three or 4% or when there's very bad economic news. That's not risk. That's volatility. What real risk is is living under a bridge or eating cat food when you're old.\nMac Greer: That was Bill Bernstein, a financial theorist, neurologist, and author of numerous books, including the Four Pillars of Investing, the Intelligent asset allocator, and the Birth of Plenty. I'm Motley Fool producer Mac Greer. Now, Motley Fool contributor Rich Lumelleau and Motley Fool analyst Buck Hartzell recently caught up with Bernstein and talked risk reward, and financial freedom.\nBuck Hartzell: Rich and I both have young adults. People that are either getting ready to graduate or graduating college and got their first job. I just had 10 of those people over at our house this weekend. One of the questions that we got asked during that conversation as we sat down is, how much do we need to save? In order to be prepared and reach one day, financial freedom. I don't like the word retirement because I think freedom is something different. You can do what you love. You don't need to retire and people aren't meant to sit around and watch TV on their couch and stuff. How much is a reasonable amount do you think that they need to save in order to reach their goals, Bill?\nBill Bernstein: Well, I've in recent years, I've changed my mind about this. I used to think that 15% was enough, which is the figure you'll see in that particular book. 15% is adequate if you have a relatively low income because what will happen when you retire is you will get a very nice replacement ratio out of your Social Security. The person who has below average income or average income is going to get probably in the realm of about 50%-60% replacement from social security. But if you're an upper and for that person, 15% is adequate. But if you're an upper income person, then Social Security may only replace 30 or 35% of your income or even less if you've got a very high income. That person should be saving at least 20% of their income.\nRich Lumelleau: Bill, you've written that investing is simple but not easy. What do you think makes it so hard for most people to follow sound investing principles?\nBill Bernstein: Well, there's a very precise analogy for that, which is losing weight. Losing weight is simple. Exercise more, eat less. It is not easy. It is also simple to say, I'm going to invest 15 or 20% of my salary every month into the financial markets. It's an easy thing to say that. But when the world looks like it's crashing down around you and maybe you're losing your job, it's not such an easy thing to do. The other analogy I like to use is, if you've ever had any flight training, it's flying in a simulator, preparing for an emergency or a crash landing in a simulator is easy. It's very non stressful. I've done it. But doing it in the real world, unfortunately, I never had to do it, I imagine it's a good deal more stressful, and the financial markets are the same way. It's one thing to have a plan in a spreadsheet or in a beautiful mathematical model. It's another thing to actually execute it in real time.\nRich Lumelleau: I guess a follow up to that is, are there misconceptions about risk that you see from your work and your writings that persist among both amateur and professional investors?\nBill Bernstein: We're human beings who evolved over millions of years of biological history. The way that we react to risk or the risk that we respond to is immediate risk. It's seeing the yellow and the black flash of light in your peripheral vision or hearing the hiss of a snake or the roar of a lion, and you respond just like that. That way most people perceive risk in financial markets. It's the day that the markets falls three or 4% or when there's very bad economic news. That's not risk. That's volatility. What real risk is is living under a bridge or eating cat food when you're old. Those are two entirely different risk. Unfortunately, people pay much more attention to the first risk, the immediate risk, what I call shallow risk than they should pay to deep risk, which is the second risk, long term risk.\nRich Lumelleau: Is there a way for investors to cultivate the discipline to do nothing during periods of market volatility. You mentioned those three and 4% down days. Obviously, three months ago, we had a 20% correction. Obviously, you were rewarded if you just stuck. Is there a way to cultivate that discipline?\nBill Bernstein: Well, like everything else in life, there's theory, and there's practice. The theory is to look at financial history and understand that once every three or four years, the markets fall by 20%, and once every 10 or 20 years, they fall by 50%. It's to have that knowledge in your knowledge, bank, so it's to know that theory, but the theory isn't enough. The practice part of it is to actually live through it yourself and see how you respond. People respond in different ways. There are people who are utterly impervious to falling markets and will happily, invest even in the worst of markets. They find it very easy to do. I find those people are very rare. I'm not one of them myself. There are other people who when the markets do poorly and the world looks like it's going to end, they panic. I've known people I've known men who risked their lives in combat and seem to execute that very well. But on the other hand, when their portfolio fell by five or 10%, they threw up. It's very odd.\nBuck Hartzell: Yeah, it's funny even business owners people that run their own business and they've been through swings and upturns and downturns and COVID and all this stuff, and they can handle that fine. But then when they see their stocks go down 5 or 10% it's something that blows their mind a little bit. I'm like, Some of these people are friends. I'm like, you've run your business through all downturns and things that happen. Why does it bother you? I think it's 'cause they feel like they're in control of their business, and they're calling the shots where the movements and these stocks. I tell them, Just don't watch. This is long term investing. If the up and down bothers you, don't look at it. Go play golf. You like that.\nBill Bernstein: As I already mentioned, I like to think about things evolutionarily, and I like to think in terms of analogies as well. The analogy, I think it's appropriate here is the skunk. The skunk evolved over tens of millions of years to have a given reaction to a large predator that threatened it, which is to turn 180 degrees, lift its tail, and spray. That's very effective. But it's not effective in an environment where your major predator is a hunk of steel weighing two tons moving 60 miles an hour. That's not the appropriate response. That analogy to finance is precise.\nBuck Hartzell: Now, I want to go toward a little bit diversification because four pillars was a great book that you wrote and shared a lot of great lessons for people. But one of the comments in there was, when things look the brightest, returns are typically the lowest. When things look the darkest, returns are the highest. I have a question for you today. We sit here July 22nd, 2025. Where do you think we are on the brightest to darkest continuum as far as investors today?\nBill Bernstein: A lot of clouds in the sky that I can see. People are talking about tariffs and a debt spiral and the unsustainability of the treasury market. But that's not the way people are behaving. People are behaving like everything's fine. That's a really important concept because in the financial markets, you are paid to bear risk and uncertainty. The worst things look, the lower prices have to fall in order to attract people back into the market with higher expected returns. The best fishing is done in the most troubled waters, and the time to be wary is when things look the brightest. Warren Buffett, very famously said to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. People look pretty greedy to me right now.\nBuck Hartzell: Yeah, the risk trade seems to be back on right now. With most people. I'd say, also, stocks are relatively expensive. It leads me into another question, and this goes to diversification. A recent Wall Street Journal article posted that over the last decade, small CAP stocks have returned about 6.6%. That trailed large CAP stocks that returned over 13%. They trailed by about 7.3% per year. That's the widest gap that we've seen going back the whole way to 1935, as they were mentioned. That includes dividends. I just wonder, from an allocation standpoint today, where are you on small caps versus large caps? Can you just give us? Do you adjust your allocation based on how well that particular class has done or not done well the last 5 or 10 years?\nBill Bernstein: Well, my emotional, excuse me, my discipline, my intellectual discipline tells me I shouldn't do that at all. But I have to admit that my emotionality, when I see something like that tells me, yes, I should act on it. Whatever my given allocation was to small cap stocks, say, five years ago, maybe it's a little higher now. Just for that exact reason. The financial markets do have a tendency to mean revert, which is what that article by Jason Zweig talked about. Mean reversion is a relatively weak phenomenon. It's at best a 55, 45 bet. But if you bake enough 55, 45 bets over the course of your lifetime, you're going to win some, you're going to lose some, but on average, you'll come out ahead. I think that's a bet that's worth making, but don't be surprised if it doesn't work this time.\nBuck Hartzell: Intellectually, you say, I stick to my guns. I've had my allocation. But also, you say, I might tilt a little bit more in that direction, given that reasoned data. Can you give for people that are listening at home, so they have an idea? What are your rough allocations, would you say in a simple form to large CAP versus small cap and say international and maybe bonds in there?\nBill Bernstein: Well, I think the typical investor is well advised to hold the market, the total stock market. If they want to tilt toward small cap stocks, they can do it with a small portion of that allocation, say, a quarter or at most a third of it. Understand that there are going to be long periods of time, like the last 20 years when you're sorry you did that. You have to be extremely patient.\nRich Lumelleau: How does geopolitical risk, and I'm going to throw tariffs into that just because it's basically we're dealing with every country in the world. How does geopolitical risk influence your long term investment strategy?\nBill Bernstein: I like to channel Ken Fisher, bless his soul, who observed that he pays close attention to the headlines because he knows that if something is above the fold, that is, it's the top of the headlines, it's an archaic term, I guess, showing my age. If something is above the fold, then it's already been impounded in the prices so he knows he can ignore it. Those are the things that fit into that category, geopolitical risk, what's the feds doing? Everybody knows about that stuff. It's impounded in the prices. That's not a new observation. I think it was almost over 100 years ago that Bernard Baruch said it's something that everyone knows isn't worth knowing.\nBuck Hartzell: If it's in the paper, it's in the price is usually what I tell people.\nBill Bernstein: Exactly. That's a great way to put it.\nBuck Hartzell: We tend to be bottoms up here at the fool. We get a lot of questions, particularly around the tariff noise. We can point to them and tell them, Hey, in 2016, there was a similar conversation that was going on. Here's what happened then. Most of those international stocks traded down pretty significantly once the presidential election happened in 2016, and then the year afterwards, international stocks took off, I think China was the best performing up probably over 50% in 2016 during President Trump's first year in office. We can tell them the data, but it's hard because people focus on what's in the newspaper, and I'm like, if you can just keep your goalpost focus on how the business is doing in the company and pick good businesses, you're probably better off because the noise is immense that is out there.\nBill Bernstein: If there's one data I tend to pay attention to, I do it as a negative indicator, which is you'll often hear people say, Country X Y or Z, has a great economy. It's going to take off buy its stocks. It turns out that there's an inverse correlation there. There are a lot of different reasons for that. But the poster child for that phenomenon is China. Over the past 30 years, economic growth in China has been through the roof, almost 10% real over the past 30 years every single year. Yet, over the past 30 years, Chinese stocks have been money losers. They've had terrible returns. For, again, many different reasons. That's one argument that I tend to pay attention to because it's so specious, but it usually works out the opposite direction.\nBuck Hartzell: I remember when the bricks were all a big thing, and that was Brazil, Russia, India, China, and they were the emerging growth stories. Well I think over longer periods of time, those emerging market stocks tend to perform less than a developed world because like I said, everybody runs toward the growth, and then the multiples get bit up. But we even had some members that posted some ETFs because they wanted exposure to the growing middle class of China, which is a smart thing. They had huge growing middle class. But if you looked at some of the ETFs that were available for investors, most of those were investing in government run entities in China. They were state owned enterprises like banks and manufacturing and stuff like that. They were getting very little exposure to the rise of the Chinese consumer. I said, You got to be careful sometime when you just look at some of these ETFs that think they're meeting your needs. You got to understand what's in them, as well.\nBill Bernstein: There's a more general principle, epistemological principle here, which is that narratives and stories are very misleading. We're human beings. We tell each other stories. That's how we communicate. That's a really lousy way to invest. If you're buying a story, you're very liable to have your head handed to you. What you should be looking at is the data. What's the data? It's the valuation. What earnings yield are you getting? What dividend yield are you getting? That's what you should be paying attention to.\nBuck Hartzell: You've talked a lot about behavioral finance and psychological tendencies. I think investors that are trained in those tend to do better, and they protect themselves from making a lot of mistakes. I want to spend a little bit of time on that. I grew up. We had one investor in my household, and that was my mother, and she was probably the best investor I've ever known because she's had the ability to buy good companies and hold them for six decades. Those are companies like Apple and Microsoft and things like that. At the end of her life, your portfolio reflected the fact that she held onto her winners. I want to just ask you a little bit about people that are just beginning. I've worked a lot with our interns this summer, as well as many summers before. I've seen a difference between men and women investors. Like I said, I grew up lifelong relationship and investing with my mother. She was very patient with her stocks. Men that I know tend not to be. They tend to want to buy and sell and trade a little bit more. I just want to know, like for people that are beginning investing, I'm talking about people that are pretty humble here and they're scared to lose money on their first investment. They're scared to take that first leap, and I tell them, if you're great, you're going to be wrong 40% of the time. Don't sweat it. It's fine. What do you tell those people that are a little scared to get started because they're going to buy that first investment, whether it's a stock or Eta and afraid it's going to go down?\nBill Bernstein: Before I answer that question, the first thing you talked about the gender difference is quite salient. Testosterone does wonderful things for muscle mass and reflex time. It does not do good things for judgment. Women tend to be better investors than men are. Now, as far as what you do with your first investment, you have to find out what person you are. I tell people who are starting out to invest relatively conservatively, so that when they hit their first bear market, they find out what their actual risk tolerance is. The first investment that a person makes, generally tell them start with a 50, 50 portfolio, and when the market goes down 50%, which is liable to happen at some point in your first 10 or 15 years of investing, then you're going to find out who you are. If you bought more or you held on, fine. You know what to do. You're either going to keep that allocation or you're going to up your equity allocation. But if it ruins your life, maybe you should be 30, 70 for the rest of your life because that may be sub optimal, but a sub optimal allocation that you can execute is better than an optimal one, a stock heavy one that you can execute.\nMac Greer: That was Bill Bernstein.

That's how I felt about last week where the market took a huge number of stocks out and shot them, including some of ours — more on that when we get to Thursday's Monthly Meeting for Club subscribers — but the sellers could not stop Apple, the most unlikely of winners for this moment, and one that defined last week's tape. Why did Apple's glorious run unfold as it did? That 13% weekly advance, its best in more than five years, was the result of a short squeeze plain and simple, and it couldn't be contained. Going into last week, Apple had everything a short-seller wanted. It was the most likely of stocks to expect a monster rollover. But it backfired into one of the most remarkable short-squeezes I have ever seen. Let's use the Apple squeeze as a bizarre metaphor for the market itself, which, judging by the major averages, appears to be a paradise for the longs. But the averages are distorted by the positive action in a handful of stocks, Apple being the most notable. Case in point: the traditional market-cap weighed S & P 500 climbed 2.4% over the past week while a modified version of the index that assigns each company the same influence, known as the equal-weight S & P 500 , advanced merely 0.8%. Apple's move last week was just so dazzling that it obscured everything else that was happening, and most of the action that was obscured was negative. As impossible as it might seem, leading into last week, a $3 trillion company became the object of every short-seller's desire. I don't cavort with many short-sellers — I don't cavort much with any money manager, lest they know what I am working on. But the anti-Apple chatter on Wall Street ran so deep that you couldn't avoid it: Apple's stock was headed to $175. How could that be? Why was this short considered such a layup? Let's dissect. AAPL .SPX YTD mountain Apple's year-to-date stock performance versus the S & P 500. First, good short-sellers like to go after either the most white hot of companies — in the current moment, that's a name like Palantir — or companies with a stock that is already rolling over, like that of Apple. Short-sellers are betting a stock will decline in value. They borrow shares and promptly sell them back into the market, with the intention of buying them back once they've dropped in price. If that happens, they then returned the borrowed shares and profit off the difference. However, if their targeted stock goes up in price, a short-seller may decide to \"close out\" the trade and buy back shares, adding fuel to the rally. Palantir is a dangerous short bet because it's more of a sports team with a rabid fanbase than it is a company or a stock. The software provider is seen as being a pure artificial intelligence consultant, which is very important in a market that thirsts for pure AI plays. Palantir seems to have the ability to report any numbers it wants to, including numbers that give it the best \"Rule of 40\" score anyone has ever seen. Palantir has somehow convinced everyone that once it wins a contract, the client immediately starts saving — and making — money. The Palantir buyers believe it because Palantir has convinced them that it has a mysterious, even magical, AI formula. Betting against magic is real perilous to a short-seller's health, as we have learned endlessly for those who bet against this monster. Which brings me back to Apple. As much as Palantir has a modus operandi that is all in on AI, Apple has an M.O. that is regarded as AI-less to an extreme. What do we hear about Apple and AI? First, we hear how they've failed to develop anything we want or even consider generative AI. Announced to much fanfare last June, its suite of AI software tools dubbed Apple Intelligence is widely ridiculed and key features like an AI upgrade of Siri have been delayed. Second, we hear that they seem to not realize how important it is to have an AI strategy in this technological race. We also see the headlines about the company losing people who might, or might not, be working on AI, which may be the reason they seemingly have no AI strategy. In this tape, it's a must to have AI. That's obvious. We in the media cannot resist asking business leaders questions like, \"How are you using AI?\" And we ask it to any CEO, no matter how clueless they may be about AI and how little they might need AI. Because they know the AI question is coming, they are ready for it. Most of the time their answers sound rehearsed, kind of like when I delivered my lines playing Lieutenant Rooney in \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" as a junior in high school. We accept their by rote answers and move on knowing that the AI box was now checked — by both of us, questioner and questionee. You can't get that box checked with Apple. Therefore, you have the start of an amazing short bet given that there is no AI answer in sight. Worse, the best way for Apple to get high-quality AI was to get paid to take someone else's AI model and incorporate it into its devices. You give Apple money, and it gives you their massive base of iPhone users and bragging rights, worth a huge amount of money. But that route may no longer be open to them because of a crucial win by the Biden-era Justice Department against Alphabet last year, one where a federal judge deemed Alphabet and its search-engine business violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlaws monopolies. The lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020 during the first Trump administration. Recall that Google pays roughly $20 billion a year to Apple to make its search engine the default on Apple's devices. At one point, Apple might have been waiting for any of the generative AI-infused search engines to come along and pay them $20 billion to do the same thing to block any other comer. However, that kind of relationship may be kaput because of the Justice Department's win against Google. We are awaiting a remedy ruling from Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. That decision could come down any day now, maybe even this week. As part of that ruling, it is expected that Apple will no longer be able to receive Google's $20 billion in what is basically free money. That decision could hurt Apple's bottom line. and it will make things painfully obvious that Apple isn't going to get $20 billion from, say, Perplexity, to be Apple's AI search bot. That payment would become the object of the most obvious antitrust case in the world. Even this Justice Department would sue Apple for making that deal. So what do the short-sellers know about AI and Apple? Mainly they know that it doesn't have a strategy — in itself a great reason to short it — and second, they know it isn't going to get anyone to pay it for sending Safari users to their AI bot. I think many big short-sellers have also been betting against Apple precisely because that remedy ruling is imminent and the ruling could mean that Apple could immediately lose that $20 billion from Google. There's a lot of money to be made being short Apple when this ruling comes down. But the federal-court cavalry didn't arrive in time for last week's squeeze. The Google case has forced Apple either to develop its own AI or buy an AI company, presumably Perplexity because it is the one that seems the most unencumbered. Apple is legendarily unwilling to buy anything big. I know it because I begged them to buy Netflix several times when the putative target was worth about $25 billion to $50 billion, and Apple's management seemed determined to rule that out along with anything else that came to mind. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook did recently tell me in a call to discuss its quarterly earnings that Apple is willing to do a big acquisition. So don't take it off the table just yet. Nevertheless, the combination of not getting paid the $20 billion from Google — and perhaps paying an outrageous amount to buy Perplexity outright — is not something you want to buy the stock of Apple for. That, of course, is only one very complex reason to be short. The other one seemed even more of a layup than the lack of an AI strategy: the wrath of President Donald Trump. Apple's manufacturing approach had been all about China, which was helpful as the company courted the Chinese consumer. But that, of course, was not the only place made-in-China iPhones were destined. They were headed to the U.S. No one could match the Chinese for both quality and price. We keep hearing that the supply chain is there and the supply chain is the best there is. But when Trump returned to office in January and started going after China, Apple pivoted to ramp up iPhone production in India at global scale. Apple's key supplier Foxconn first started making iPhones in India in 2019 and some of the supply-chain issues that arose during the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to additional emphasis being placed on India as a production hub. Then came Trump 2.0, and Apple leaned even further into India as the source of its U.S.-bound iPhones. Ultimately, Apple wants to make all of the phones it is shipping to the U.S. in India, and its Chinese phones are meant to be sent to the rest of the world to minimize tariffs all the way around. What Apple didn't count on was not only that the president didn't want iPhones made in China, he also didn't want them to be made in India. Until most recently, India was thought to be a decent ally and a good, getting-to-be great place to build phones. Then it became evident that Trump didn't like that India had become somewhat of a weird ally\/client state of Russia because of Russian oil, and that the president did not want any iPhones made anywhere but the U.S. He was quite vocal about his displeasure. When I interviewed Cook and asked him about his relationship with Trump after Trump had called him out for doing business in India, he said the relationship was a good one. If you were short Apple and you listened to my endless iterations on air of that proclamation of friendship, you would have thought twice about staying short. But I am sure the shorts thought it nothing but dross. It turned out the relationship was, indeed, a good one, and after Apple committed another $100 billion in U.S. investments was pledged on top of the previous $500 billion, it morphed into a great one — great enough to make Apple exempt from tariffs. It could be a double win because Samsung, with 30% of the U.S. market, will see its phones marked up by tariffs, which could make the iPhone cheaper, or at least not as expensive as it has been, versus its Korean opponent. Sure, you may not think it matters and it is awfully difficult even for the government to spend $600 billion unless the money goes to the Pentagon or the interest on the national debt. But all that matters is that Trump endorsed Apple's actions. Oh, and if you needed one more reason to be short: Apple had a very good last quarter, but it was presumed that the success of the quarter came from pull-through to beat the tariffs and it wasn't regarded as consequential. A panned upside surprise. So, let's wrap up the metaphor: Apple has no AI strategy and even if it gets one, it will have to pay through the noise for it, perhaps endlessly, as you need all the chips that fellow Club name Nvidia makes to have a winning AI offering. The shorts were hoping that the remedy phase would be done and Google would have to suspend payments to Apple. They figured Apple would have earnings cut big by the Indian tariffs. And numbers were expected to come down anyway. Sell, sell, sell. Now we know that the remedy phase ruling is still out there — and so is a potential earnings shortfall — but it looks like the shorts couldn't ride things out. Plus, the longs were attracted to a once-expensive stock that hadn't gotten this cheap in ages. I've had an own-don't-trade philosophy toward Apple for ages but even I was struck about the run from $210 a share to $220 in after-hours trading early last week when Trump blessed Apple's largesse. But that's what happens when the shorts start to panic. All of this occurred at a time that most of the market was rolling over except, weirdly, medical technology names — check out Becton Dickinson , Medtronic and our Abbott Labs — and some scattered retailers, including Club-owned TJX Companies , a heavily shorted stock for no reason other than the chart. Of course, looking back, the window to win as a short-seller is always on the verge of being closed when you're betting against companies with good management teams and great balance sheets. In the case of Apple, though, the negatives we just ran through were too juicy to ignore. It just seemed like Apple's fall was destined. It was a natural decline that had only just begun, a safe short in a lousy tape. Instead, it turned out to be the best long in a terrible tape. And that's how the Apple squeeze unfolded, taking the entire averages up with it. Sure, the averages were helped by Nvidia's strength, but that's done by longs, not shorts. Will other stocks follow Apple's lead next week? I think that given it was a squeeze, that seems unlikely. But what could have been more unlikely than Apple being at $229.35? Nothing that I have ever heard of. That's for certain. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, NVDA, ABT and TJX. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Wall Street's next test this week: Inflation data. The pair of reports measuring price pressures in the U.S. economy carries implications for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate move and likely the stock market's. It's too soon for President Donald Trump 's newest tariff rates to show up in the numbers just yet, but we'll be watching for any inflation signs from the levies already in place. The S & P 500 is coming off a positive week, its third in the past four, and sits just shy of a fresh record-closing high. The Nasdaq ended last week at a record. There are a few other economic reports on this week's schedule. Within the portfolio, it's mostly quiet on the earnings front — save for our newest holding. Here's a closer look at what we're watching for. 1. Inflation data: The consumer price index (CPI) and the wholesale inflation gauge, known as the producer price index (PPI), are slated to be released Tuesday and Thursday morning, respectively. The overarching theme for both inflation releases: What do they mean for the Fed rate policy at its upcoming September meeting and beyond? The CPI and PPI arrive after a weak July jobs report — and the accompanying downward revisions to the prior two-month totals — that caused investors to dramatically reconsider the health of the U.S. labor market. Nurturing maximum employment is one part of the Fed's dual mandate; fostering price stability is the other. Traders went from betting the Fed will keep rates steady again in September — thanks to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell throwing cold water on the idea at the Fed's July meeting — to overwhelmingly pricing in a quarter-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Now comes the CPI and PPI, which shine a light on the price-stability piece of the Fed's mandate and, in particular, the impact that Trump's tariffs are having on the rate of inflation. In the June CPI report, inflation picked up to 2.7% overall and 2.9%, when excluding the more volatile food and energy prices, from the May rates of 2.4% and 2.8%, respectively. Tariff-sensitive categories like furniture and apparel showed increases in the June CPI, and Wall Street will once again look closely at those areas in the July data. If inflation comes in really hot, will the market recalibrate its expectations for September once again? \"We see the biggest risk to markets in the [second half of the year] from a reacceleration in both goods and service inflation, leading the Fed to remain on hold and putting upward pressure on interest rates,\" strategists at Wolfe Research said in a note to clients Friday. Economists expect the July CPI to show a 0.2% increase on a monthly basis and a 2.8% increase annually, according to Dow Jones. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core CPI is projected to rise 0.3% month over month and 3.1% on a 12-month basis; that would be an acceleration from 0.2% and 2.9%, respectively, in June. For the PPI, which is seen as a leading indicator for the CPI because it measures what companies pay for their own inputs like steel, the consensus is for a 0.2% monthly gain after being flat in June, according to Dow Jones. On a core basis, PPI is expected up 0.3% month over month. Core PPI also was flat in June. Central bankers say the reason they haven't lowered rates yet this year is uncertainty around the inflationary impact of the tariffs. While it's good to get another month's worth of data, the CPI and PPI for July won't answer that question entirely, in part because tariff levels are still evolving, and in part because businesses that may eventually raise prices are still working through inventory accumulated before duty rates went up. However, at least for Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, he told CNBC last week that he's getting more comfortable with the idea of cutting rates without knowing the full effect of tariffs. Kashkari is an alternate member of the Fed's policymaking arm this year and a voting member in 2026, so his comments are notable. At the July meeting, two central bankers did vote for a cut. \"There's a bunch of data that I know and that I've got confidence in, and there's data that I don't know and we're not going to know for a while,\" Kashkari said Wednesday on \"Squawk Box.\" \"The data that I think we know is that the economy is slowing. Housing services inflation is gently declining. Non-housing services inflation is coming down. Wage growth is coming down. We've seen the jobs number, and consumer spending cooling. All of that suggests the real underlying economy is slowing.\" He continued, \"The part I don't have confidence in yet is, what are the ultimate effects of tariffs going to be on inflation? And what I'm realizing is we may not know the answer to that for quarters, or a year or more. That tells me, as one policymaker, that I need to start leaning more on the data I've got confidence in. The economy is slowing, and that means in the near term, it may become appropriate to start adjusting the federal funds rate.\" 2. Other data: While the CPI and PPI are the biggest data points of the week, there are a few other releases that the market will be watching due to the heightened focus on the health of the economy post-jobs report. On Thursday morning, we'll get the weekly initial jobless claims report — a measure of both first-time unemployment insurance filings, which can be used to gauge layoff activity among employers, and so-called continuing claims, which offer insights into how easily people who lose their jobs can find a new gig. On Friday, the July retail sales report is out, courtesy of the Commerce Department, offering a look at the level of consumer spending and where people spent their money. Amazon' s Prime Day was held in July, so a measure of online spending in the report will likely be influenced by that. Also on Friday, the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment survey for the month of August will be out. After some dour readings as Trump's tariff rhetoric ramped up earlier this year, the sentiment releases have stabilized. The inflation expectations component of the survey — also closely watched — tumbled to below pre-tariff levels in July . 3. Earnings: After a busy stretch of earnings, Cisco Systems is the lone Club name to report quarterly results in the week ahead. It's the first time we'll hear from the networking and security provider since it joined the portfolio on July 17. For its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, Wall Street expects Cisco to report revenue of $14.62 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of 98 cents, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Beyond the headline numbers, investors will be keyed into Cisco's orders and commentary around its AI products, along with its guidance for fiscal 2026. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a recent note to clients that expectations are for mid-single-digit order growth, \"which we expect will continue to drive momentum in the stock.\" Last quarter, Cisco said it booked more than $600 million in AI infrastructure orders from \"webscale\" customers, its term for large data center operators often called hyperscalers, such as Club names Amazon and Microsoft .

If you ask ChatGPT \"how to become a millionaire,\" you’re likely to get a flood of endless money hacks, conflicting advice and complex economic theory.\nBut you don’t need any of that to get into the seven-figure club. You can chart a course to the $1 million milestone by simply focusing on three essential numbers.\nHere’s a closer look at these crucial wealth-building blocks.\nNet worth\nYou can’t make intentional progress if you don’t know where you currently sit. That’s why the most basic number you should be tracking is your net worth.\nCalculating your net worth sounds simple, but for many Americans, it’s not. About 51% say they don’t know how to do it. The numbers are even higher for women (61%) and Gen Z (64%), according to Credit Karma. That means many people have no clear picture of their financial standing.\nFortunately, you don’t need sophisticated tools or AI to track your net worth. A simple spreadsheet that lists all of your assets and liabilities and calculates the difference between the two should suffice.\nBut, while knowing your net worth is important, this is only the first step. Growing it is what truly counts.\nOne way to build long-term wealth is through real estate — an asset that can generate passive income, appreciate over time and offer powerful tax advantages. When people talk about real estate investing, they think of home ownership most of the time, meaning residential real estate.\nBut there are other ways to invest in real estate without committing to a mortgage or setting down roots.\nYou can tap into this market through First National Realty Partners (FNRP). The real estate platform allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.\nWith a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities.\nThrough FNRP’s online platform, accredited investors can potentially collect quarterly cash flow through a diverse real estate portfolio and grow their net worth.\nSimply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.\nAnother way to invest in real estate is by leveraging the $34.9 trillion home equity market, which has historically been the domain of large institutions.\nThrough Homeshares, accredited investors can gain direct access to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund.\nThe fund focuses on homes with substantial equity and uses Home Equity Agreements to help homeowners access liquidity without incurring debt or additional interest payments.\nThis hands-off approach lets accredited investors access high-quality residential properties with a minimum investment of $25,000 — without the headache of tenant management.\nWith risk-adjusted target returns ranging from 14% to 17%, the U.S. Home Equity Fund could unlock lucrative real estate opportunities, offering accredited investors a low-maintenance alternative to traditional property ownership.\nStay in the know.

Range advisors will then use the study as part of a member's tax planning and strategy.\nCost segmentation shortens depreciation timelines — from the standard 27.5–39 years down to just 5–15 years—allowing you to claim significantly larger tax deductions sooner and keep more money in your pocket. Note that only investment properties qualify for segmentation studies.\nRange also delivers proactive advice across your entire financial life — not just real estate or taxes\nFrom stock options and tax strategies to real estate and big-picture planning, Range integrates it all under one roof. With a transparent, flat annual fee — no hidden costs or percentage-of-assets surprises — you get AI-powered insights and comprehensive guidance designed to scale with your wealth.\nSavings Rate\nIf you’re trying to reach your magic number, tracking the amount of money you or your family saves every year is an essential task. If you can monitor and raise your savings rate high enough to meet your savings goal, you can make your journey to millionaire status a lot shorter.\nBut here’s the reality check: Most American families are falling short. As of May 2025, the personal savings rate in the U.S. was just 4.5%, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. At that rate, a family earning $100,000 annually would save only $4,500 per year — and it would take 222 years to reach $1 million in savings.\nBut, by contrast, if the same family raised their annual savings rate to 20%, it would take them just 50 years to get to that target.\nIt’s no coincidence that many millionaires — and even billionaires — are famously frugal. They understand that tracking and increasing your savings rate is one of the most effective ways to accelerate wealth creation.\nTo raise your savings rate, you need to keep a close eye on your expenses. One area that often flies under the radar is home and car insurance, which can quietly eat away at your monthly budget.\nU.S. homeowners' insurers have hiked premium rates by double digits over the past two years. If you’re not paying attention, that could be a major hit to your saving power.\nShopping around is one of the best ways to find better rates, but calling individual providers takes time and effort that many working people just don’t have.\nOfficialHomeInsurance.com can take the hassle out of shopping for home insurance. In just under 2 minutes, you can explore competitive rates from top insurance providers all in one place.\nBut home insurance premiums aren’t the only thing coming out of homeowners' pockets. If you own a car, you have another cost to deal with.\nCar insurance rates rose an average of 16.5% in 2024, according to ValuePenguin. Like with home insurance, shopping around can lead to substantial savings.\nOfficialCarInsurance.com lets you compare quotes from trusted brands — including Progressive, Allstate and GEICO — to make sure you're getting the best deal. Their matchmaking system takes into account your location, vehicle details and driving history to find the lowest rate possible for you.\nThe final ingredient in the wealth creation recipe is the rate of return on your savings.\nWhere you place your savings is just as important as how much you save. If you’re stacking $20,000 a year under a mattress, you will take decades to get to millionaire status. By the time you get there, inflation would have drastically reduced the value of a million dollars anyway. Instead, if you invest in robust growth stocks, real estate or fixed income opportunities, you could get to the seven-figure club a lot faster.\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, for example, has delivered an annualized return of 14.55% since its inception in 2010. If you assume a similar return going forward and invest $1,000 a month, you could reach the $1 million target in less than 20 years.\nGold can also be a powerful asset for speeding up your journey to millionaire status. In times of economic uncertainty — whether due to trade wars, inflation or market instability — investors often turn to gold as a hedge and a safe haven.\nThe price of gold has jumped by about 40% since 2023. JP Morgan projects that it will hit the $4,000 mark by 2026.\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\nTo learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.\nHowever, as with any investment, it’s crucial to have a trusted financial advisor by your side. The right advisor can help you evaluate risks, align investments with your goals and make informed decisions that support your overall financial plan.\nMore than 90% of wealthy Americans work with financial advisors and report high satisfaction with the guidance they receive, according to a Bank of America survey.\nA trusted, pre-screened financial advisor can help you develop a solid retirement strategy and protect your wealth at any level.\nWith Advisor.com, you can quickly connect with a local, qualified financial advisor who can help you build a personalized investment plan based on your goals, timeline and risk tolerance.\nAdvisor.com offers a free, no-obligation consultation where you can discuss your financial goals and get guidance on retirement planning.\nBottom line: Know your net worth, then grow it with the right team behind you.","content_hash":"673dc51076f6e4c8c670cf927ba29884","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":9724,"method_rank":0}

That’s a reversal of bets that had dominated since 2021, according to the data, which are based on fund disclosures to Hazeltree, an alternative-investment data specialist.\nOver the same period, funds have unwound short bets against solar stocks. The analysis, which is based on a universe of some 700 hedge funds representing about $700 billion in assets — or roughly 15% of the industry’s total under management — also shows that portfolio managers have stayed net long wind in the period.\nThere has been “a bottoming out with some of these clean energy plays,” said Todd Warren, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners Pty. That trend has “really occurred at the same time as we’ve seen — in the oil patch — some concerns with regards to supply and demand balance,” he said.\nThe analysis shows that more hedge funds were, on average, net short stocks in the S&P Global Oil Index than net long for seven of the nine months starting October 2024. By contrast, net longs exceeded net shorts in all but eight of the 45 months from January 2021 through September 2024.\nThe development coincides with a rise in oil supply as some OPEC+ member nations act to preserve their market share. Joe Mares, a portfolio manager at Trium Capital, a hedge fund managing about $3.5 billion, notes that ratcheting up output has “not historically been great” for the oil industry. Evidence of an economic slowdown in the US and China, combined with an expectation that global oil inventories will continue to rise through the rest of 2025, means there’s growing skepticism toward the sector.\nOnce investors take in “the general slowdown in everything,” the question then becomes, “who’s buying the oil?” said Kerry Goh, Singapore-based chief investment officer at Kamet Capital Partners Pte.\nGreenwich, Connecticut-based Tall Trees Capital Management LP is short oil stocks because “we see much lower oil prices, especially in 2026,” said Lisa Audet, the fund’s founder and chief investment officer.\nInvestors may get further insight into the supply-demand balance as early as this week, with OPEC set to release its monthly market analysis. Updates are also due from the US Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency.\nIn the US, meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s quest to add supply in an effort to bring down the price of oil has unsettled local producers.\nThe Dallas Fed’s latest quarterly energy survey, published on July 2, shows negative sentiment among oil companies toward the Trump administration’s policy on the fossil fuel. One respondent in the anonymized study said the administration’s implied price target of $50 a barrel is simply unsustainable for the industry. Another spoke of the “chaos” caused by current US trade policies, adding the volatility will drive companies to “lay down rigs.”\nMeanwhile, the outlook for solar and wind stocks is starting to improve.\nThe analysis of Hazeltree’s data shows that the average share of funds that were net short stocks in the Invesco Solar ETF dropped to 3% in June. That’s the lowest percentage since April 2021, when green equities were trading near record highs. The number of funds net long stocks in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF reached a 30-month high in February this year. Those positions fell back in June, but net longs still dominated shorts overall.\nOther hedge fund managers said AI has the potential to trigger a generational swell in energy demand that is likely to give new support to renewables.\n“The market is telling you that AI is the biggest thing we’ve seen in our entire careers,” said Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at London-based Selwood Asset Management LLP, which manages about $1.6 billion. To meet energy demand from AI, renewables will need to play a big part, not least “because they’re the fastest to market,” he said. Renewables are likely to meet more than half of the required additional generation capacity by 2035, BloombergNEF said in a report last month.\nIn China, green stocks are now enjoying a rebound after its solar industry started addressing overcapacity concerns. After losing about half its value between the end of 2021 and 2023, the Solactive Select China Green Energy Index — which includes solar giant Longi Green Energy Technology Co. — has advanced around 19% from an April low.\nIn the US, Trump administration attacks on green energy — including a rollback of Biden-era subsidies — have already contributed to over $22 billion of clean energy projects being canceled or delayed since January, according to an analysis from the E2 advocacy group.\nYet, for a number of fund managers, the decision to slash green subsidies helps end some of the policy uncertainty that had prevented investors from moving into wind and solar.\n“At least now we know what the rules are going to be and so people can go back to evaluating these as businesses,” Mares said.\nThe final version of Trump’s $3.4 trillion budget bill — dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill — was actually more favorable toward some corners of the renewables market than Tall Trees Capital’s Audet expected. Utility-scale solar, for example, has emerged as a relative winner, she said.\nFor green investors, it’s been “less bad than expected,” said Nishant Gupta, founder and chief investment officer of Kanou Capital LLP, an energy transition-focused hedge fund. “There’s been more protection around US domestic production than expected.”\nAnd this year’s tariff wars have coincided with a broad rebound in green stocks. Since Trump first unveiled his proposed tariffs on April 2 — dubbed Liberation Day by the White House — the main S&P index tracking clean energy stocks has added about 18%. Over the same period, the main S&P index for oil companies is down around 4%.\nMuch of the clean-energy rebound has been driven by solar. The Invesco Solar ETF, a widely tracked exchange-traded fund packed with solar stocks, is up more than 18% since April 2.\nMore hedge funds continue to be short stocks in the Kraneshares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF than long — a constant since 2021 as China has steadily displaced Western manufacturers. But the share of net shorts dropped to 2.87% in June, which is the second-lowest level in almost half a decade.\nAt the same time, there’s an expectation among fund managers that the continued rise in sales of EVs globally will reduce the need for petroleum. That matches BloombergNEF estimates, which anticipate a 25% annual increase in EV sales this year. BNEF also expects that about 40% of vehicles on the road could be electric by 2040, displacing 19 million barrels of oil a day by that year.\nThe strategy shift among funds reflects the fact that economic growth without low-carbon energy is now inconceivable, according to Trium’s Mares.\n“If we are going to continue to grow both in developed and emerging economies, we’re going to need a lot of energy,” he said. “A big chunk of the marginal growth in energy over the last 10 years has come from renewables and it’s hard to see why that isn’t going to continue.”\nMethodologyBloomberg Green analyzed anonymized weekly data that around 700 hedge fund managers disclosed to Hazeltree, from January 2021 through 27 June 2025. The hedge funds in the Hazeltree database vary in terms of assets under management, and the analysis is not weighted by hedge fund assets or size of position held. Collectively, AUM for the hedge funds analyzed is around $700 billion. Total assets under management in the hedge fund industry were around $4.7 trillion at the end of the second quarter 2025, according to Hedge Fund Research. Bloomberg also interviewed hedge fund managers on their oil and energy transition bets and on trends from the data analysis.\nHedge funds mostly provided their data to Hazeltree via prime brokers. There is a possibility that some positions may not be disclosed. These will not be included in Hazeltree’s data or in the Bloomberg analysis.\nHazeltree’s data reports percentages of the hedge funds that held net long positions and net short positions for a specific stock. Bloomberg’s analysis categorized roughly 230 stocks based on key ETFs or indices for a sector, and further calculated a sector-wide monthly average. In some cases, the same company could be included in different sectors. Four stocks didn’t appear in the Hazeltree data provided to Bloomberg.\nETFs and indices used in the analysis are S&P Global Oil Index, Invesco Solar ETF, First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF and KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility Index ETF.\n--With assistance from Sheryl Tian Tong Lee, Will Mathis and Simon Casey.\n(Adds reference to next round of OPEC forecasts in ninth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","content_hash":"68a103badbfff9f0699f7adcaba1e26a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":9278,"method_rank":0}

This makes the current bull market the third-priciest when back-tested 154 years. Historically speaking, when valuations get extended to the upside, the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and\/or Nasdaq Composite eventually fall 20%, or considerably more.\nFor Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the nation's central bank, these correlative events and historical headwinds aren't of much concern -- but there is one exception.\nNothing scares the Fed more than the prospect of stagflation, which is characterized by a period of higher inflation, slower economic growth, and generally higher unemployment. While Powell and the Fed aren't panicking, Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy certainly has the central bank more concerned about the prospects of stagflation in America than they were prior to the president's January inauguration.\nThe groundwork for the Fed's worst-case scenario is being laid\nNormally the Federal Reserve is doing its work at one end of the spectrum or the other. If the economy is firing on all cylinders, its primary goal is to keep inflation (rising prices) from getting out of hand. A growing economy is generally going to exhibit a healthy job market.\nOn the other hand, if U.S. economic growth has weakened or a recession has taken hold, the Fed will turn its attention to spurring job growth by lowering the federal funds rate. When the economy is weak, the prevailing rate of inflation tends to decline.\nStagflation presents a nightmare scenario for Jerome Powell and the Fed because there's no blueprint for how to approach it. Lowering interest rates to spur growth can fan the flames of higher-than-desired inflation. Meanwhile, raising interest rates to cool the prevailing rate of inflation can weaken an already stumbling economy and jobs market. Regardless of the actions the central bank employs, it tends to be bad news for workers and the stock market.\nThe concern is that stagflation fears are mounting specifically because of President Trump's tariff and trade policy.\nIn early April, the president unveiled a 10% global tariff rate, as well as higher \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of countries deemed to have adverse trade imbalances with America. Since initially introducing these reciprocal tariffs, numerous pauses, adjustments, and trade deals have been hashed out.\nHowever, the June inflation report, announced in mid-July by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), pointed to an uptick in the prevailing rate of inflation -- from 2.35% in May on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, per the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, to 2.67% in June on a TTM basis. While a 32-basis-point uptick might not sound like much, it represents the first report where the full impact of Donald Trump's tariff policy is being felt.\nAccording to a December-published report (\"Do Import Tariffs Protect U.S. Firms?\") from four New York Fed economists working at Liberty Street Economics, the duties President Trump placed on China during his first term in 2018-2019 did a poor job of differentiating between output and input tariffs. Whereas an output tariff is placed on a finished product imported into the U.S., an input tariff is a duty applied to a good used to complete the manufacture of a product domestically. Input tariffs run the risk of meaningfully increasing costs for businesses and consumers... and this may be happening, yet again.\nFollowing the Federal Open Market Committee's June 2025 meeting, the Summary of Economic Projections forecast a 3.1% core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation rate by the end of 2025, which is up from its prior forecast of 2.8% for core PCE. In other words, inflation is expected to modestly pick up, with tariffs driving this trend.\nAt the same time, the BLS made a major downward revision to previously reported job gains for May and June when it released the July jobs data. May was revised down by 125,000 jobs to a gain of just 19,000, while June was slashed by 133,000 jobs to a gain of only 14,000. Though the unemployment rate of 4.2% (as of July 2025) remains near its historic low, these not-so-subtle BLS revisions intimate weakness in the job market.\nRounding things out, Liberty Street Economics' analysis of Trump's China tariffs in 2018-2019 found that public companies whose stock was negatively impacted on tariff announcement days produced worse future real outcomes. Specifically, companies directly impacted by these tariffs saw an average across-the-board decline in sales, profits, labor productivity, and employment from 2019 to 2021.\nBased on existing economic data and historical precedent, President Trump's tariff and trade policy is laying the groundwork for possible stagflation, with higher inflation, a weaker job market, and potentially weaker economic growth.\nThe stock market's resiliency is unparalleled\nWhile the possibility of stagflation exists, Fed Chair Powell doesn't believe this nightmare scenario will manifest in the U.S. \"We have warned of it, but it is not something that we are facing or that we expect to face,\" said Powell.\nNevertheless, certainty may be hard to come by over the coming weeks or months for Wall Street's major stock indexes. When things are uncertain is often when the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite become more volatile than usual.\nBut when the lens is widened and historical precedent is applied to Wall Street over a span of one or more decades, it becomes easy to see just how resilient the major stock indexes are to short-term headwinds and emotion-driven fear.\nAt the heart of this long-term optimism is the nonlinearity of economic and stock market cycles. Even though adverse events are inevitable and sometimes uncomfortable, they're historically short-lived.\nFor instance, the U.S. economy has navigated its way through a dozen recessions since the end of World War II. The average length of these downturns is a mere 10 months, with no recession enduring longer than 18 months. In comparison, the average economic expansion has lasted for about five years, with two periods of growth surpassing the 10-year mark. Angling your portfolio to take advantage of these extended periods of growth is how significant wealth is created on Wall Street.\nSpeaking of stocks, this clear-as-day disparity can be seen in Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500.\nIn June 2023, shortly after the S&P 500 was confirmed to be in a new bull market, the researchers at Bespoke Investment Group published a data set on X (formerly Twitter) that calculated the length of every bull and bear market dating back to the start of the Great Depression (September 1929).\nIn one corner, the average 20% (or greater) downturn in the S&P 500 has lasted just 286 calendar days, or less than 10 months. Comparatively, the average S&P 500 bull market endured for 1,011 calendar days (as of June 2023), which is about 3.5 times longer than the typical bear market.\nRegardless of what's thrown Wall Street's way, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite always find a way to power through it over the long run. Not even stagflation fears precipitated by President Trump's tariff and trade policy can keep these major stock indexes from hitting new highs over the long run.\nShould you buy stock in S&P 500 Index right now?\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

For truly patient people though, the reward is well worth the wait; you'd be hard-pressed to find better returns on your money than the market's average annual gain of about 10%.\nStill, sometimes you get the itch for a bit more gain reaped in a little less time. And every now and then the market obliges with the right prospects.\nIf you can stomach their above-average risk, there are stocks that have the potential to quintuple your money within the next five years. Even half of that, of course, would still be worth your while.\nCarnival Corp.\nAnyone who knows anything about Carnival Corp.(NYSE: CCL) knows the leisure cruise company took on a ton of debt during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It needed the cash just to survive. As of May the $40 billion company was sitting on nearly $26 billion worth of long-term obligations costing it roughly $1.4 billion worth of interest payments per year. That's a pretty big bite out of its annualized top line of almost $16 billion, paring its yearly net income back to something in the ballpark of $3 billion. That's why shares are still down on the order of 30% from their price right before the pandemic took hold, and less than half of their 2018 peak price -- investors are simply worried its balance sheet is untenable.\nThe thing is, this profitable company is managing to continue paying down its debt while also still growing its business. At its early 2023 peak, for perspective, Carnival's long-term debt stood at nearly $33 billion.\nWhile there's obviously plenty of more work to be done before the company is back to its pre-pandemic condition, the demand it requires to do so is most definitely in place. Last quarter's record-breaking revenue of $6.3 billion was turned into record-breaking operating income of over $900 million, extending an ongoing streak of growth for both measures. Look for more of the same, too. See, also as of the end of last quarter the company's total customer deposits toward future trips reached a record-breaking $8.5 billion.\nWhat gives? As it turns out, consumers are still seeking out affordable luxury experiences even if money is tight. The Cruise Lines International Association believes the industry will serve 37.7 million passengers this year, breaking last year's record of 34.6 million en route to 41.9 million in 2028. Carnival is well positioned to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\nJust don't tarry if you're interested. More and more investors are seeing this dynamic, given how shares are well up from their 2022 low and still climbing.\nIovance Biotherapeutics\nThere's a good chance you've never heard of Iovance Biotherapeutics(NASDAQ: IOVA). Its billion-dollar market cap just doesn't turn many heads, and for those who do find it, the unprofitable biopharma outfit with only one expensive therapy in its portfolio seems like anything but a sure thing.\nIf there was ever a one-trick pony to take a shot on though, this one may be it.\nIt's called Amtagvi. Only approved early last year, this drug is the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cellular therapy (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, specifically) to treat certain kinds of melanoma. The underlying science, however, is promising on far more fronts. Amtagvi -- generically called lifileucel -- is also being tested in a dozen other clinical trials, while similarly made treatments are in the midst of eight more testing regimens. And some of these trials are in their latter stages, like the use of lifileucel as a treatment for certain sorts of non-responsive lung cancer.\nThere is a challenge. That is, Amtagvi is complicated to administer, and expensive. Each patient's one-time treatment is custom-made in a lab for their particular tumor at a cost of around $500,000 apiece. Some insurers are balking, particularly given that it's still a relatively new medicine, and not a more proven \"front line\" therapy that's also often much cheaper. Anyone who's been watching this company for a while also knows this stock's performed poorly since its 2010 initial public offering (IPO), and even since its 2020 rally when Amtagvi's approval first became imminent.\nThe fact is, however, Iovance Biotherapeutics' future has never been brighter than it is right now, yet the stock's never been cheaper. The company's also never been closer to profitability than it is at this time. Analysts are expecting bottom-line progress that puts it on a trajectory for a swing to profitability sometime around or even before 2030, when research from Global Data suggests sales of Amtagvi could exceed $1 billion en route to as much as $2 billion per year. This prospect alone is enough to turn up the heat on Iovance stock in the meantime.\nShopify\nFinally, add Shopify(NASDAQ: SHOP) to your list of stocks that could turn $1,000 into $5,000 by 2030. The analyst community expects its top line to grow to the tune of 20% per year for the next several years, pumping up its profits at an even faster rate.\nIt's possible you've used the company's technology without even realizing it. In contrast with Amazon's business model, Shopify helps brands and merchants build their own online stores. This allows for far more customization of the e-commerce experience, ultimately building a stronger -- and more direct -- relationship with consumers as they become customers. Although the company no longer discloses the figure, estimates of the number of online stores put the figure somewhere around 5 million.\nThe company does, however, still disclose how much business its platform is facilitating. Last year, Shopify's e-commerce technology handled $292.3 billion worth of business on behalf of its customers, generating $8.9 billion worth of revenue for itself. Those numbers were up 24% and 26% (respectively) year over year, extending growth trends that are expected to persist for a long while more.\nThe key to this growth is the way e-commerce is evolving in the wake of Amazon's heavy-handed dominance of the business.\nIn its early days Amazon.com was the premier platform for connecting with consumers. As time has marched on, however, Amazon is decreasingly a partner with its sellers, and increasingly a competitor to them. Not only does the e-commerce giant now sell its own merchandise, but it offers third-party sellers the option of paying the company to more prominently feature their goods at the site. Smaller sellers without much of a marketing budget often just can't compete. The issue of fake product reviews also remains a nuisance. All of this dynamic ultimately helps Shopify, of course, by prompting sellers to look for sales platforms where they have more cost-effective control.\nThen there's the more philosophical aspect of e-commerce's ongoing evolution. As the industry changes it's increasingly moving toward greater authenticity and more personal connections with consumers. This of course favors Shopify's customizable offerings, and is one of the reasons IMARC Group believes the world's direct-to-consumer market that Shopify serves will grow at an average annualized pace of more than 17% through 2033. Shopify is well positioned to win more than its fair share of this growth.\nShould you buy stock in Carnival Corp. right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Carnival Corp., consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Carnival Corp. wasn’t one of them.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.84%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +1.05%.\nStock indexes settled higher on Friday, with the S&P 50 posting a 1-week high and the Nasdaq 100 setting a new record high. Stocks are supported by robust corporate earnings results and hopes that the Fed will soon cut interest rates to support the economy.\nMonster Beverage rose more than +6% after beating Q2 EPS estimates. Also, Expedia Group closed up more than +3% after reporting better-than-expected Q2 EPS and raising its full-year forecast. On the negative side, Trade Desk plunged more than -38% after giving an outlook that analysts said was underwhelming. Also, Microchip Technology fell more than -5% after pausing most factory expansions and cutting its full-year capital expenditures.\nStocks extended their gains Friday after Bloomberg News reported that the US and Russia are aiming for a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Russia said it would halt its offensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine along the current battlelines as part of the deal if Ukraine cedes its entire eastern Donbas area to Russia as well as Crimea.\nFriday’s comments from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem were slightly hawkish and bearish for stock and bonds when he said the Fed is missing more on the inflation side of its dual mandate, so \"Given the economy where it stands today, it seems appropriate for the Fed to maintain the policy rate at a constant for now.\"\nStocks are seeing support from speculation that weaker-than-expected US economic news and recent dovish Fed commentary will push the Fed to lower interest rates as soon as next month. On Thursday, President Trump nominated Stephen Miran to be a temporary replacement for Adrianna Kugler as Fed Governor until the end of the year. Miran is currently chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors and is seen as dovish and supporting President Trump’s calls for lower interest rates. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 90% from 40% last Friday.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 90% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 63% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEarnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 82% exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.29%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.12%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 climbed to a 2-week high and closed up sharply by +1.85%.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Friday closed down by -8.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +3.5 bp to 4.285%. T-notes moved lower on Friday as strength in stocks has reduced safe-haven demand for government securities. Also, rising inflation expectations are negative for T-notes as the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a 1-week high Friday of 2.417%. T-note prices dropped to their lows on hawkish comments from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who said inflation is still a problem.\nLosses in T-notes were limited Friday after President Trump late Thursday nominated Stephen Miran for Fed Governor to replace Adriana Kugler for the rest of the year. Miran views President Trump’s policies as disinflationary and would support a more dovish Fed policy.\nEuropean government bond yields on Friday moved higher. The 10-year German bund yield rose +6.0 bp to 2.690%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +5.4 bp to 4.601%.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 9% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nGilead Sciences (GILD) closed up more than +8% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 product sales of $7.05 billion, above the consensus of $6.94 billion, and raising its full-year product sales forecast to $28.3 billion-$28.7 billion from a previous forecast of $28.2 billion-$28.6 billion.\nGen Digital (GEN) closed up more than +7% after reporting Q1 revenue of $1.26 billion, stronger than the consensus of $1.19 billion, and forecasting full-year revenue of $4.80-$4.90 billion, better than the consensus of $4.76 billion.\nMonster Beverage (MNST) closed up more than +6% after reporting Q2 net sales of $2.11 billion, stronger than the consensus of $2.08 billion.\nApple (AAPL) closed up more than +4% to lead gainers in the Dow Jones Industrials and has rallied more than 12% in the last three sessions after President Trump on Wednesday said the company will announce that it will commit to spending another $100 billion on domestic manufacturing.\nExpedia Group (EXPE) closed up more than +4% after reporting Q2 revenue of $3.79 billion, better than the consensus of $3.71 billion, and raising its full-year gross bookings forecast to +3% to +5% from a previous estimate of +2% to +4%, the midpoint above the consensus of +3.3%.\nLive Nation Entertainment (LYV) closed up more than +3% after reporting Q2 revenue of $7.01 billion, above the consensus of $6.89 billion.\nTempus AI (TEM) is up more than +3% after reporting Q2 net revenue of $314.6 million, stronger than the consensus of $297.7 million.\nTesla (TSLA) closed up more than +2% after it was granted a rideshare permit in Texas for operating its robotaxi service.\nTrade Desk (TTD) closed down more than -38% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 41 cents, above the consensus of 40 cents but considered underwhelming by several analysts.\nSweetgreen (SG) closed down more than -22% after reporting a Q2 EPS loss of -20 cents, wider than the consensus of -13 cents, and cut its full-year same-store sales forecast to down -4% to -6% from a previous forecast of no change.\nTwilio (TWLO) closed down more than -19% after forecasting Q3 adjusted EPS of $1.01-$1.06, weaker than the consensus of $1.14.\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber (GT) closed down more than -18% after reporting an unexpected Q2 loss per share of -17 cents versus expectations of a +19 cent profit.\nGoDaddy (GDDY) closed down more than -11% after it reported Q2 revenue of $1.20 billion, below the consensus of $1.21 billion.\nPinterest (PINS) closed down more than -10% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 33 cents, below the consensus of 36 cents.\nMicrochip Technology (MCHP) closed down more than -6% after forecasting Q2 net sales of $1.11 billion-$1.15 billion, the midpoint right on the consensus of $1.13 billion, considered disappointing by analysts.\nEarnings Reports (8\/11\/2025)\nAAON Inc (AAON), AST SpaceMobile Inc (ASTS), Celanese Corp (CE), Ralliant Corp (RAL), Roivant Sciences Ltd (ROIV).\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Nvidia, for example, has seen its stock price grow more than tenfold since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, now topping $4 trillion in market cap.\nSome investors may feel like they've missed the boat and they're too late to buy AI stocks at a good price. It's important to consider that today's AI winners might not be the biggest companies to benefit from advancements in artificial intelligence over the long run. Finding a company that's making excellent progress right now with sustainable long-term competitive advantages could end up being an even better stock to own when the dust settles.\nThese three companies are all well positioned to benefit from the continued growth and advancement in artificial intelligence. Their stocks are all attractive at today's prices, too, which means you can buy them now and hold them forever.\n1. Amazon\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is home to the largest public cloud computing platform in the world, Amazon Web Services, or AWS. The segment generated $116.4 billion over the last 12 months, roughly 50% larger than its next-closest competitor, Microsoft's Azure.\nSome have expressed concern about AWS for a few reasons. First, it was caught flat-footed as the generative AI opportunity was getting off the ground. That led it to cede market share to Microsoft and others who were earlier to invest in the space. However, it quickly course corrected, releasing its Bedrock platform, and it's seeing triple-digit growth in AI services. As such, it's been able to maintain most of its market share in a rapidly growing market (even though overall revenue growth has slowed to the high-teens).\nThe second reason is that AWS saw a significant decline in operating margin in the second quarter. Management explained half of that decline was due to the timing of stock-based compensation. The rest is explained by Amazon's significant investments in capacity, as it notes the business remains capacity constrained. Over time, investors should see margin tick back up. It's worth noting AWS still commands higher margins than its smaller competitors.\nMeanwhile, the rest of Amazon looks strong. Its retail operations are seeing improved margins quarter after quarter, thanks in part to a strong advertising business. The international segment is notably on its way to becoming a meaningful contributor to operating income after years of investment.\nThe stock fell following the release of its second-quarter earnings based on a disappointing outlook. But the long-term potential for Amazon, particularly in AWS, remains strong. The pullback in price looks like an opportunity for long-term investors to buy this AI leader.\n2. Salesforce\nSalesforce(NYSE: CRM) provides a suite of software often found at the center of many enterprises' operations. The company has seen very good results with its growing set of cloud-based software solutions, but the standout recently has been its Data Cloud offering. Data Cloud provides a single platform to aggregate all of a company's data to create actionable insights from a single source.\nData Cloud recurring revenue grew to $1 billion in Salesforce's most recent quarter, up 120% year over year. It's seeing strong attachment, with 60 of its top 100 deals including Data Cloud in the contract. And the most recent product built on top of Data Cloud, Agentforce, is seeing very strong adoption.\nAgentforce allows businesses to build AI agents that can execute tasks or provide customer service with minimal human intervention. The key to building successful AI agents is access to pertinent data, which is exactly what Data Cloud brings to the table. Management says it's made 8,000 deals with Agentforce since its launch last fall, representing $100 million in revenue. That makes it Salesforce's fastest-growing product ever.\nConsidering Salesforce's software suite is entrenched in the operations of so many enterprises, it's in a prime position to benefit from growing spend on artificial intelligence, particularly through Data Cloud. It's unlikely to lose that position. In fact, its expanding suite of software tools only serves to increase the switching costs for a company. With shares trading for just 22 times forward earnings estimates, Salesforce looks like a great buy at today's price.\n3. Meta Platforms\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) may be the biggest investor in artificial intelligence in the world. It's on track to spend between $66 billion and $72 billion on capital expenditures, and it's only building compute power for itself (unlike the other hyperscalers, who serve cloud customers). There's a good reason Meta is spending more than everyone else on artificial intelligence; it could be the biggest beneficiary of all generative AI has to offer.\nSigns of that are already coming through. In the second quarter, Meta's ad prices climbed 9% year over year and impressions grew 11%. CEO Mark Zuckerberg notes a significant portion of that improvement came from its AI-recommendation model. Additionally, time spent on Facebook and Instagram increased 5% and 6%, respectively, thanks to bigger AI models.\nBut the future is bright, too. Meta's generative AI tools for ad creative are seeing strong adoption. Zuckerberg notes \"a meaningful... [percentage] of our ad revenue now... [comes] from campaigns using one of our Generative AI features.\" Long term, Meta is working on an AI agent that can develop and test ad creatives autonomously.\nMeta's AI chatbot now boasts over 1 billion users, creating an additional channel for monetization over the long run. Meta only recently started putting ads in WhatsApp and Threads, which should provide additional ad revenue as advertising on Meta grows increasingly easier thanks to generative AI capabilities.\nMeta's seeing excellent financial results from the growing adoption of its advertising platform and increased engagement from its users. Revenue climbed 22% last quarter and operating income grew an impressive 38%. Meta's growing depreciation expense will likely weigh on earnings going forward as long as it continues to ramp up spending, but if it continues to produce top-line growth like last quarter, that's easily digestible.\nIf you back out the depreciation expense using EBITDA, Meta shares trade for an attractive price with enterprise value around 16 times forward EBITDA estimates. Even on a more traditional forward P\/E valuation, Meta shares look to be well worth the 27 times multiple you'll have to pay for the stock today.\nDo the experts think Amazon is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

Stocks of growing companies will usually experience greater volatility than the market average. But investors that ignore those fluctuations and keep regularly buying shares of growing companies will come out ahead over the long run.\nThree fool.com contributors see great deals right now for fallen growth stocks like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Dutch Bros(NYSE: BROS), and Sweetgreen(NYSE: SG). Here's why they believe these stocks are solid investments for a long-term investor.\nAmazon: Down 8.5%\nJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon reported spectacular results for the 2025 second quarter last week, but its stock dropped on the news. While there was a lot to be excited about, the market seemed to home in on certain qualities that didn't fully meet its expectations, and that has created an excellent opportunity for investors who haven't pressed the buy button yet.\nSales growth was strong at 13% year over year, beating expectations. Let's not forget that Amazon is the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales, and to be able to still deliver double-digit sales growth is an impressive feat. It reached $167.7 billion in sales, ahead of Walmart's $165.6 billion in sales in its most recent quarter, and Amazon is on track to become the largest company in the U.S. by sales.\nOperating income surged to $19.2 billion, up from $14.7 billion last year, easily topping its guidance. But that wasn't enough for Wall Street.\nThe market seems to have been spooked by the outlook for operating margin coming in slightly below expectations. Management is shooting for $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion in third-quarter operating income, and Wall Street is expecting $19.5 billion.\nIt also wasn't thrilled with the performance of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon's cloud business. AWS sales were up 17.5% year over year in the quarter, but that was nowhere near the growth of its two biggest rivals, Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet, which increased 39% and 32%. However, AWS is much bigger than both of them, and in dollar amounts, its increase surpassed them.\nCEO Andy Jassy made some remarks about the artificial intelligence (AI) business that may have sounded worse than he expected. He explained that it couldn't meet demand right now, which is why it's investing heavily in the platform. While that could lead clients to find somewhere else to meet their demand, the high demand implied should be great for Amazon down the line, as long as it can build out fast enough to keep it going.\nAmazon stock is down 8.5% from its highs, already making its way back up as investors recognize the opportunity to buy on the dip. This was an overcorrection, and now it's a great chance to buy before it reaches new highs.\nDutch Bros: Down 33%\nJohn Ballard (Dutch Bros): Dutch Bros has all the ingredients of a growth stock set up to deliver multi-bagger returns for patient shareholders. It's tapping into growing demand for specialty beverages. The business was founded in 1992, but it's still early in its nationwide U.S. expansion plans.\nAnalysts expect revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 23% over the next few years. This is in line with the company's current pace of shop openings and same-shop sales trends, which have hovered around the low to mid-single-digit level over the last few years. It currently has over 1,000 shops in 18 states, but management sees tremendous growth potential supporting as many as 7,000 locations over the long term.\nDutch Bros is outperforming Starbucks, which has experienced problems growing sales recently. One reason for Dutch Bros' success is that it likes to hire shop managers from within the company. Even some of the company's franchise partners started out working for Dutch Bros as \"broistas.\" This can help promote consistency throughout the company's shops, which is an important quality to look for in any restaurant chain.\nAnother quality that leads me to have high conviction in the future of this brand is that it is very popular among Gen Z. Dutch Bros offers a fun-loving atmosphere and a focus on the drive-thru experience, and it goes out of its way to delight customers with limited time offerings, such as the recent rubber duck giveaway with every purchase. The little things can go a long way in winning loyal customers, and Dutch Bros seems to understand this well.\nThe stock is currently down about 33% from its 52-week high. I would consider taking advantage of the dip and adding shares, especially for investors who are interested in finding promising new restaurant brands in the early stages of expansion.\nSweetgreen: Down 77%\nJeremy Bowman (Sweetgreen): Restaurant stocks have struggled this year as a combination of fears about tariffs and weak consumer discretionary spending have weighed on both business results and stock performance.\nSweetgreen, the promising fast-casual salad chain, has been one of the worst-performing stocks in the industry. The stock is now down 61% year to date, and is off 77% from its all-time high shortly after the company went public in late 2021.\nIt's understandable why Sweetgreen is down based on its recent results. In its first quarter, same-store sales declined 3.1%, and revenue rose just 5.4%. Sweetgreen has also been unprofitable throughout its history.\nHowever, the chain is still small with roughly 250 locations, and it is popular as its restaurants generate average sales of $2.9 million. That puts it on par with Chipotle, one of the most successful restaurant stocks in history.\nSweetgreen has also been unprofitable in part because it's invested in its Infinite Kitchen program, an automated system that measures and dispenses ingredients and helps prep its salad bowls. That innovation seems likely to pay off over the long run. Management has said that restaurants with the Infinite Kitchen generate higher sales, as it helps increase throughput and customer service, in addition to saving on labor costs.\nSweetgreen's comparisons are expected to get easier in the second half of the year, which could turn comparable sales positive. The company expects to open at least 1,000 stores over the long term, meaning it has a long growth runway ahead.\nInvestors who take advantage of the discount are likely to be rewarded.\nDo the experts think Amazon is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

These changes include industry leadership, stock-selection strategies, allocation adjustments, and more.\nThere are still some reliable constants though. One of them is Warren Buffett, and the picks he makes -- or at least approves -- for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. If a stock becomes a Berkshire holding, you can bet it's a quality name with a promising future.\nHere's a closer look at three Warren Buffett picks currently held by Berkshire Hathaway that just might work for your portfolio as well.\n1. American Express\nBuffett's done a fair amount of selling over the past few quarters, lightening up on Berkshire's positions in Apple, Bank of America, and DaVita, and outright exiting its stakes in Citigroup and Nu Holdings.\nOne stock has remained conspicuously untouched for years now, however, to quietly become Berkshire Hathaway's second-biggest holding (right behind Apple). That's credit card outfit American Express(NYSE: AXP).\nIt's not too difficult to see why Buffett's such a fan, though; the company's certainly more than proven it knows how to make its unique business model work.\nOn the surface it's just another credit card company. Under the hood though, it's more. Unlike Visa and Mastercard, which are only payment networks for card issuers, American Express is both the issuer and the payment middleman.\nThis leveraged position allows it to offer a perks and rewards program that cardholders are willing to pay up to $700 per year just to access. This annual fee also means American Express' cardholders tend to be a bit more affluent than the average consumer, and as such are less likely to miss payments, and more likely to continue spending even when other people are tightening their purse strings.\nAnd the proof is in the company's results. With the obvious exception of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing, Amex's top line has improved every year going all the way back to 2017.\nProfit growth hasn't been quite as consistent. It's remained reliable enough, however, to make American Express a solid dividend stock. Although the company tends to not raise its dividend payments in times of uncertainty -- like in the wake of 2008's subprime mortgage meltdown or during the COVID-19 pandemic -- it still continues to pay a quarterly dividend, and begins raising these payments again as soon as the economy makes it feasible to do so.\n2. Occidental Petroleum\nIf it seems like the oil and gas business is inching its way to obsolescence, that's because it is. With the advent of electric cars and renewable energy sources, consumers just won't need oil like they have in the past. To this end, Goldman Sachs predicts \"peak oil\" -- the point at which the planet's daily consumption of crude stops growing and starts shrinking -- will happen in 2035.\nThere's a reason, however, that Buffett remains enough of a fan of oil giant Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) to stick with Berkshire's 265 million share position despite the stock's relatively poor performance of late. That is, there's still a great deal of money to be made in the business between now and then, and even after 2035.\nSee, while demand will likely start to shrink then, it's apt to shrink very, very slowly. Indeed, outlooks from ExxonMobil, OPEC, and Standard & Poor's all suggest that oil will still be the world's top source of energy production as far down the road as 2050. The continued proliferation of alternative energy options just won't be able to keep up with the ever-growing demand for electricity.\nAnd Buffett feels very good about Occidental's ability to deliver, even in an environment where crude oil prices remain subdued. As he noted in 2023's letter (published in early 2024) to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders:\n\"Under Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.\"\nThat's strong personal praise from the Oracle of Omaha.\nThe kicker: Buffett also touted the potential of the carbon-capture technology that Occidental Petroleum is developing, which literally sucks carbon dioxide out of the ambient air. While it's not quite yet ready for mass commercialization, that day is coming, and soon, putting Occidental into what's apt to be another multibillion-dollar market.\n3. Pool Corp.\nFinally, add Pool Corp.(NASDAQ: POOL) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks you might want to buy for yourself right now.\nIt's the smallest and least-known of the three companies in focus here, with a market cap of only $11 billion. It's not a particularly big Berkshire holding either; the conglomerate's 1.5 million Pool Corp. shares are worth less than $500 million, which is less than 4% of Pool itself.\nThis relatively small stake makes Buffett's interest in the company all the more telling. While owning this much Pool stock doesn't actually do much for Berkshire's bottom line, Buffett and\/or his lieutenants waded in anyway. There's a reason, even if it's not yet clear.\nBut first things first. Yes, this is the company that sells swimming pool supplies. It's the biggest name in the business, in fact, doing $5.3 billion worth of business last year. Of that, $617 million was turned into net income.\nCuriously, both of those numbers were down from 2023's comparisons. Neither figure is expected to improve any this year, either. Berkshire bought the stock anyway despite its relatively rich valuation of 28 times this year's expected per-share profit of $10.88. It's a significant vote of confidence in this company's future growth prospects.\nThe thing is, it may not be a crazy bet at all.\nThere's no denying this stock's been a poor performer since 2021's peak, largely due to headwinds on the residential real estate front, where costs have soared. Investors are just worried, and understandably so.\nAs Buffett says though, \"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\" This business may be struggling right now, but it will eventually thrive again once the economy gets back up to full speed and the highly cyclical homebuying and home-improvement markets perk up, in turn driving demand for pools, and, subsequently, demand for pool maintenance supplies. Berkshire's just positioning in a quality company now for whenever that recovery materializes.\nShould you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\nArtificial intelligence startups have minted dozens of new billionaires this year, adding to an AI boom that's quickly becoming the largest wealth creation spree in recent history.\nBlockbuster fundraising rounds this year for Anthropic, Safe Superintelligence, OpenAI, Anysphere and other startups have created vast new paper fortunes and propelled valuations to record levels. There are now 498 AI \"unicorns,\" or private AI companies with valuations of $1 billion or more, with a combined value of $2.7 trillion, according to CB Insights. Fully 100 of them were founded since 2023. There are more than 1,300 AI startups with valuations of over $100 million, the firm said.\nCombined with the soaring stock prices of Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and other publicly traded AI-related firms, along with the infrastructure companies that are building data centers and computing power and the huge payouts for AI engineers, AI is creating personal wealth on a scale that makes the past two tech waves look like warmups.\n\"Going back over 100 years of data, we have never seen wealth created at this size and speed,\" said Andrew McAfee, principal researcher at MIT. \"It's unprecedented.\"\nA new crop of billionaires is rising with sky-rocketing valuations. In March, Bloomberg estimated that four of the largest private AI companies had created at least 15 billionaires with a combined net worth of $38 billion. More than a dozen unicorns have been crowned since then.\nMira Murati, who left Open AI last September, launched Thinking Machines Lab in February. By July, she raised $2 billion in the largest seed round in history, giving the company a $12 billion valuation, according to reports.\nAnthropic AI is in talks to raise $5 billion at a valuation of $170 billion, nearly three times its valuation in March. CEO Dario Amodei and its six other founders are now likely multibillionaires, according to people familiar with the company.\nAnysphere was valued at $9.9 billion in a June fundraise and just weeks later was reportedly offered a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion, likely making its 25-year-old founder and CEO, Michael Truell, a billionaire.\nGranted, most of the AI wealth creation is in private companies, making it difficult for equity holders and founders to cash out. Unlike the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when a flood of companies went public, today's AI startups can stay private for longer given the constant investment from venture capital funds, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and other tech investors.\nAt the same time, the rapid growth of secondary markets is allowing equity owners of private companies to sell their shares to other investors and provide liquidity. Structured secondary sales or tender offers are becoming widespread. Many founders can also borrow against their equity.\nOpen AI is holding talks for a secondary share sale to provide cash to employees. Its proposed valuation of $500 billion follows the company's fundraise in March that provided a $300 billion valuation.\nDozens of private firms are being acquired or merging, also providing liquidity. After Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, founder Alexandr Wang joined Meta's AI team. There have been 73 liquidity events — including mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, reverse mergers or corporate majority stakes — since 2023, according to CB Insights. Following the Meta deal, Scale AI's co-founder, Lucy Guo, who left the company in 2018, bought a mansion in LA's Hollywood Hills for around $30 million.\nStill, the AI surge is largely centered in the Bay Area, reminiscent of the dot-com era. Last year, Silicon Valley companies raised more than $35 billion in venture funding, according to the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies. San Francisco now has more billionaires than New York, with 82 compared with New York's 66, according to New World Wealth and Henley & Partners. The Bay Area's millionaire population has doubled over the past decade, compared with New York's growth of 45%.\nMore homes sold above $20 million in San Francisco last year than in any other year in history, according to Sotheby's International Realty. Rising rents, home prices and demand in the city, attributed in large part to AI, mark a sharp turnaround for a city facing a \"doom loop\" just a few years ago.\n\"It's astonishing how geographically concentrated this AI wave is,\" said McAfee, who is also co-director of MIT's Initiative on the Digital Economy. \"The people who know how to found and fund and grow tech companies are there. I've heard people say for 25 years 'This is the end of the Silicon Valley' or some other place is 'the new Silicon Valley.' But Silicon Valley is still Silicon Valley.\"\nWith time, and initial public offerings, many of today's private AI fortunes will eventually become more liquid, providing a historic opportunity for wealth management firms. All of the major private banks, wirehouses, independent advisors and boutique firms are cozying up to the AI elite in hopes of winning their business, according to tech advisors.\nLike the dot-com millionaires, however, luring the AI wealthy may be challenging for traditional wealth management companies. Simon Krinsky, executive managing director at Pathstone and former managing director at Hall Capital Partners in San Francisco, said most AI wealth is locked up in private companies and therefore can't be turned into wealth management accounts.\n\"I would say a much higher percentage of the ultimate wealth being created is illiquid,\" he said. \"There are ways of getting liquidity, but it's tiny compared to being employed at Meta or Google\" or another megacap publicly traded tech company.\nEventually, those fortunes will become liquid and prized by wealth management firms. Krinsky said the AI wealthy are likely to follow similar client patterns as the newly rich dot-commers of the 1990s. Initially, the dot-commers used their excess liquidity and assets to invest in similar tech companies they knew through their networks, colleagues or shared investors. He said the same is likely true for the AI wealthy.\n\"Everybody turned around and invested with their friends in the same kind of companies that created their own wealth,\" he said.\nAfter discovering the perils of having all their wealth concentrated in one highly volatile and speculative industry, the dot-commers turned to wealth management. And being born disruptors, many turned their capital and skills toward reinventing the wealth management industry in their image. Netscape founder Jim Clark, for instance, helped launch MyCFO, a response to his dislike of bankers and the industry.\nKrinksy said today's AI entrepreneurs are likely to follow the same path, with huge potential for AI to disrupt — if not replace — many of the traditional functions of wealth management.\nUltimately, however, the ultra-wealthy AI founders will discover the need for the traditional, personalized service that only dedicated wealth management teams can provide, whether it's around taxes, inheritances and estate planning, or philanthropy advice and portfolio construction.\n\"After people were beaten up or bruised up in the early 2000s, they came around to appreciating some degree of diversification and maybe hiring a professional manager to protect them from themselves,\" Krinksy said. \"I anticipate a similar trend with the AI group.\"","content_hash":"97fdda9764832dcbbb997090c534af8f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7585,"method_rank":0}

And because private assets aren’t traded on public exchanges, the companies and funds behind them are not legally required to disclose detailed financial information to the public.\nTo be sure, private-equity holdings do get valued because fund managers must provide their private clients — usually pension funds, endowments and family offices — with periodic appraisals of the assets they hold. These valuations primarily rely on the so-called mark-to-model pricing method, which assigns values to assets using financial models as opposed to market trading prices.\nThis approach also involves comparable company analysis, projected cash flows and assessments from the management themselves. As a result, the valuations are mostly estimates and often inherently subjective.\nDavid Krakauer, senior director of portfolio management at Mercer Advisors, said these valuation methods have to be taken with “a huge grain of salt,” because investors do not know what these private-market investments are actually worth until they have to sell their positions.\n“We’ve seen that the mark-to-model [pricing method] is very slow to mark things down and very quick to mark things up,” said Jason Kephart, senior principal of multiasset-strategy ratings at MorningStar. “When markets sell off, the model is slower to react or not as reactionary in general, but when things are doing well, then you’ll see prices marked up a bit quicker.”\nThat illiquid nature of private assets is another major challenge, as there’s no readily available buyer or seller at any given moment. So even if investors have a valuation and trading prices on paper, they can’t quickly convert the investment into cash whenever they want to exit their position.\nThat lack of price transparency and liquidity is exactly what makes private assets tricky for 401(k) investors — who are used to logging in and seeing up-to-the-minute price updates for their holdings, and are able to adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly.\nLow volatility in private markets?\nPrivate markets are often known for their relatively low volatility and higher returns compared to public markets — but that is largely because of their illiquid nature, and it doesn’t necessarily imply lower risk, according to portfolio managers.\nThe supposedly superlow volatility of private assets does create “an illusion of diversification, which comes from the valuations not really changing or only changing in a positive direction,” Kephart told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Friday.\n“But the small standard deviation of these funds is in no way indicative of the amount of risk investors are taking,” he added.\nThe lack of public interest in private assets\nTo be sure, Trump’s executive order doesn’t immediately change policy, but rather serves as directional guidance for government agencies. His order instructs the Labor Department to re-examine its guidance to employers and consult with the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as other federal regulators, to determine what regulatory changes need to be made to facilitate the goal of expanding private-markets access to 401(k)s.\nBenjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy for Better Markets, a nonprofit financial-market watchdog, said Trump’s executive order exemplifies the administration’s determination to prioritize the interests of Wall Street over the interests of retail investors.\n“Let’s be clear: Neither 401(k)-plan sponsors or 401(k)-plan participants — regular, hardworking Americans — are asking to replace stocks and bonds in their 401(k)s with risky private assets,” Schiffrin said in a statement shared with MarketWatch on Thursday.\n“Instead, the private-funds industry needs a way to get its hands on the $12 trillion in Americans’ retirement accounts to boost its profits and make up for the fact that institutional investors are fleeing the private markets due to mediocre returns, higher fees and more risk,” he added.\nA survey of Americans with retirement accounts found that among those not investing in alternative assets, the leading barrier is “fear of fraud or scams,” according to data compiled by Lansons, a financial and strategic communications consultancy. Other cited barriers included concerns about the viability of investment platforms, the belief that alternative assets are too new and lack a track record, and not knowing credible companies to invest with.\nHowever, more than half of the respondents still thought alternative investments offer an opportunity for larger returns than traditional assets, and they saw “diversification potential” in alternatives.\nTo be sure, the push to add private securities to 401(k) menus has long been a priority for some of Wall Street’s largest asset managers. BlackRock Inc. BLK, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to offer a 401(k) target-date fund with a 5% to 20% allocation to private investments in the first half of 2026, the company said in a press release in June.\nJaime Magyera, head of BlackRock’s U.S. wealth-advisory and retirement businesses, told MarketWatch on Friday that “the access to investments long out of reach” will help ensure millions of Americans build stronger, more diversified portfolios designed to increase savings.\nAnother retirement giant, Empower CA:GWO, which manages around $1.8 trillion in retirement accounts for nearly 19 million Americans, said in May that it would begin offering access to alternative investments — including private equity and private credit — through the retirement plans it oversees. Other retirement-plan providers such as State Street Corp. STT and Voya Financial Inc. VOYA have also announced similar moves this year.\nIt’s still uncertain how these private-equity investments will actually function within 401(k) plans when it comes to pricing and trading. But MorningStar’s Kephart said there’s a lot of “real-world friction” between what plan sponsors and 401(k) fiduciaries are accustomed to, in terms of fees and transparency — so it could take years before private assets ultimately enter retirement accounts.","content_hash":"4ce4850c02fd96ec4f6470688297c50d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7445,"method_rank":0}

As agentic AI becomes more deeply embedded in the enterprise in areas like finance and legal, cybersecurity AI agents are on the rise, too, becoming a key asset for detection, analysis, and alerts.\n\"It's a massive challenge to detect, contain, investigate and respond across larger companies,\" said Brian Murphy, CEO of cybersecurity technology company ReliaQuest. \"AI is allowing us to remove a lot of that noise, that tier one or tier two work, that work that's often not at all relevant to something that could be threatening to an organization,\" Murphy said.\nPutting a tool in the hands of human workers that can automate otherwise menial tasks or time-consuming ones, freeing them to do more important work, has often been the pitch for agentic AI.\nIn a message shared with Amazon employees in June, CEO Andy Jassy said \"We have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live,\" adding that he sees a future with \"billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field,\" helping workers \"focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically\" while also making \"our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today.\"\nMurphy shares a similar view across cybersecurity, where he sees an industry of workers who are inundated with work they likely shouldn't be spending time on, causing more burnout and exacerbating the existing issue of a lack of available talent.\nHe's also seen the way AI is being wielded to attack companies. \"Those phishing emails, they used to look almost laughable with the misspellings and the fonts wrong,\" he said. \"AI can take the average bad actor and make them better, and so the trick is if you're on the defensive side, they have to use AI because of the reality of what AI can do.\"\nReliaQuest recently released what it calls GreyMatter Agentic Teammates, autonomous, role-based AI agents that can be used to take on tasks that detection engineers or threat intelligence researchers would otherwise accomplish on a security operations team.\n\"Think of it as this persona that teams up with a human, and the human is prompting that agentic AI, so the human knows what to do,\" Murphy said, adding that it's like having a \"teammate that takes that incident response analyst and multiplies their capability.\"\nMurphy gave an example that is a frequent occurrence for any security team at a global company: international executive travel. Every time a laptop or cell phone is connected to a network in, say, China, the security operations team would be alerted, and the security team would have to verify that the executive is abroad and is securely using their device each day of that trip. With an agentic AI teammate, that security person could automate that task, or even set up a series of similar processes for board meetings, off-sites, or other large team gatherings.\n\"There's hundreds of things like that,\" he said.\nJustin Dellaportas, chief information and security officer at communications technology company Syniverse, said that while AI agents have been able to automate some of those basic cybersecurity tasks like combing through logs, it's also starting to be able to automate actions, like quarantining flagged emails and removing them from inboxes, or restricting access by a comprised account across a variety of logins.\n\"[AI] is being used by criminals to efficiently find vulnerabilities and exploits into organizations at scale, and all of that is resulting in them having a higher success rate, getting initial access sooner and moving laterally into an organization quicker than we've seen,\" he said. \"Cyber defenders really need to lean into this technology now more than ever to stay ahead of this evolving threat landscape and the pace of cyber criminals.\"\nDellaportas said that while every company has a unique risk profile and tolerance when it comes to deploying different types of cybersecurity tools, he views the adoption of agentic AI in cybersecurity as stages of a \"crawl, walk, run methodology.\"\n\"You roll this out, and it's going to reason and then take action, but then it's got to iterate through the actions that it's previously taken,\" he said. \"I come back to a kind of trust but verify, and then as we get confidence in its effectiveness, we'll move on to different problems.\"\nWhat AI bots mean for cybersecurity workers\nWhile Dellaportas said AI agents can take over some tasks from human cybersecurity professionals in the future, he still sees the technology as an augmentation to make workers more effective, not as a replacement.\nMurphy agrees, and said he does not see agentic AI taking the place of actual cybersecurity workers, but helping with tasks where automation is the better option while also addressing the skills gap that many organizations struggle with when filling cybersecurity roles.\n\"There may be a shortage of trained and skilled cybersecurity professionals, but there's no shortage of people who would like to be trained and skilled at cybersecurity,\" he said. \"The reason that knowledge transfer takes so long in cyber is that when you get your entry-level job, it's equivalent to working on a help desk.\"\nMurphy said he understands that there is still plenty of education needed when it comes to deploying agentic AI in any part of a business, as well as concerns about how decisions are made by AI.\nDellaportas said what has helped is the fact that agentic AI is being used by all types of business lines, so discussions of how these AI tools can help accomplish objectives are not new ones.\nAI agents are catching on inside companies. A May 2025 poll of 147 CIOs and IT function leaders by Gartner found that 24% had already deployed a few AI agents, with more than 50% of those AI agents working across functions like IT, HR and accounting, compared to just 23% of external customer facing functions.\nAvivah Litan, a distinguished vice president analyst on Gartner's AI strategy team, said that in the cybersecurity space, companies experimenting with agentic AI are finding it \"moderately beneficial,\" but there remain some questions as to the ability of these tools to scale beyond simpler tasks.\n\"Security has always been the low-hanging fruit use case for AI,\" Litan said. \"You first saw AI show up with fraud detection, so it's 100% that we're going to have digital security assistance in the future doing work and freeing up staff to take on the new attacks; the key will be making sure they stay up with all this innovation so they can see the whole attack surface.\"\nMurphy believes that corporate adoption and evolution of agentic AI in cybersecurity may occur even more quickly than in finance or legal.\n\"They absolutely understand AI is being used against them, and the only way to defend that is to use it in their own defense,\" he said.","content_hash":"488fb04f7752a041f75702b3b88b5b0d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7126,"method_rank":0}

There are official distinctions, like S&P 500 components versus those in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but there are also more nuanced groupings, like growth stocks, value stocks, dividend stocks, etc.\nSometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The \"Nifty Fifty\" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.\nJim Cramer used \"FANG\" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google (now Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)). It eventually expanded to \"FAANG\" to include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).\nBut the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the \"Ten Titans\" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), and Netflix.\nHere's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.\nThe Broadcom blunder\nThe biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.\nBased on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.\nNvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.\nEnd markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.\nAnother \"value\" stock turned growth stock\nNot long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.\nOracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.\nSome drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.\nLike Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.\nFAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans\nNetflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.\nNetflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.\nA major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.\nAs you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.\nThe company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.\nIt's time to add some all-stars to the team\nExpanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.\nWith a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.\nShould you buy stock in Oracle right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $636,563!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,108,033!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,047% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 181% for the S&P 500.

With this rise, many growth stocks have reached new peaks of their own, and a decent portion of these are now sporting lofty valuations.\nHowever, one of my favorite growth stocks has gone in the opposite direction. Despite its promising growth potential and rising margins, international sales helper Global-e Online(NASDAQ: GLBE) is down 50% from its highs as it battles short-term tariff headwinds.\nThe company is currently trading near its lowest-ever valuation. Here's why it's time to buy this promising, founder-led growth stock.\nGrowth options abound\nGlobal-e Online aims to help merchants sell internationally as easily as they sell domestically. Typically, selling goods online in a foreign country is a highly complex task that's often not worth the battle for merchants to do in-house.\nThat's where Global-e's end-to-end platform comes in. Taking this complex sales process off of its merchants' hands, Global-e offers a full suite of global e-commerce enablement solutions, such as:\nRegion-specific pricing in more than 100 currencies.\nMore than 150 payment options, adjustable by location.\nLocal messaging for customers and website layouts in more than 30 languages.\nShipping options from more than 20 providers, with returns.\nDuty and tariff calculations in more than 170 markets.\nZero-risk payment fraud.\nLocal-market knowledge that lets merchants act locally.\nSolving these issues in just one country is challenging, but doing this across 20, 50, or 100 countries can be a nightmare. Add in the fact that merchants who have switched to the company's offerings see a 40% conversion uptick, and the value proposition of Global-e Online's platform is clear.\nThanks to the value it provides to its merchants, the company has grown revenue sevenfold since 2020. Despite that incredible growth, Global-e still has less than a 1% market share of the $1.1 trillion cross-border e-commerce industry.\nThis small market share leaves a lengthy growth runway ahead for the company. Here are the four most crucial growth areas to watch.\n1. Add new merchants\nIn 2020, Global-e added new merchants that did $287 million in gross merchandise volume (GMV). By 2024, this number had quadrupled. Now more than 1,400 merchants strong, the company regularly inks new deals with major retailers and brands such as Manchester United, FC Barcelona, Adidas, Victoria's Secret, and LVMH.\nManagement has stated that its payback period on new merchants is less than nine months across multiple geographies, meaning that customer growth doesn't take long to become profitable.\n2. Grow alongside customers\nPerhaps the most potent growth lever for Global-e is its ability to grow alongside its merchant customers. Since 2019, the company has grown its annual GMV per active merchant cohort by four times. This growth highlights the booming sales that new customers see as they expand into international markets with Global-e.\nAn example of this notion comes from Adidas, which expanded its partnership with the company from eight markets in 2021 to 27 today.\nIn total, Globel-e's merchants have grown their GMV four to five times faster than the overall e-commerce industry, making the growth stock a compelling investment idea.\n3. Geographic and business-to-business expansion\nAside from adding more merchants and growing alongside existing ones, Global-e can also expand its economic footprint to grow. For instance, it's in the process of adding the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Indonesia to its supported countries.\nFurthermore, the company has global sales expertise in the business-to-business (B2B) industry, which may be worth two or three times as much as traditional business-to-consumer (B2C). With the global B2B e-commerce market worth roughly $20 trillion in 2024 -- compared to $6.3 trillion for total online retail sales -- there's lots of potential for Global-e.\n4. Managed markets with Shopify\nPerhaps the best endorsement of Global-e's operations (and why I believe it has a wide moat) is its partnership with e-commerce juggernaut Shopify. The fact that an e-commerce darling as powerful as Shopify would rather partner with Global-e than try to sell internationally on its own speaks volumes.\nSince combining to form Shopify Managed Markets, the companies have processed transactions for more than 10,000 merchants, filling orders in over 175 countries. Not only does this help grow Global-e's sales, but it acts as an incubator of sorts for potential customers for the company, as these smaller merchants grow their fledgling companies and brands.\nGlobal-e's lowest-ever valuation\nDespite all of these promising growth options and Global-e's widening moat, its stock is down 50% from its highs as the market seems to be worried about how tariffs will impact its business.\nHowever, co-founder and President Nir Debbi believes that while these tariffs create short-term uncertainty, they may create long-term opportunities for the company. Added tariffs make international sales more complex, whether it's B2B or B2C, and that's when Global-e can step in to help.\nRegardless, due to these headwinds, the stock now trades near its lowest-ever valuation.\nConsidering that Global-e expects to grow sales by 24% when it reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 13, this valuation is reasonable. Furthermore, management believes the company's 22% free-cash-flow (FCF) margin could grow to 26% to 28% over the long haul, which would make its valuation even cheaper.\nThough the road to success may be bumpy since Global-e Online's operations are tied to tariff volatility, the company's growth potential, wide moat, and rising margins make it a spectacular opportunity at today's valuation.\nShould you buy stock in Global-E Online right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Global-E Online, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Global-E Online wasn’t one of them.

A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas.\nThe crowded camps — sheltering well over half a million displaced people, according to the U.N. — had not been part of Israel's announcement Friday. It was not clear why, though, Netanyahu faced criticism this weekend within his ruling coalition that targeting Gaza City was not enough. Netanyahu said there would be \"safe zones,\" but such designated areas have been bombed in the past.\nNetanyahu spoke with Trump about plan\nNetanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his \"steadfast support.\"\nRejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a \"global campaign of lies,\" Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.\n\"Our goal is not to occupy Gaza, our goal is to free Gaza,\" Netanyahu asserted.\nNetanyahu said there is a \"fairly short timetable\" for next steps there, but didn't give specifics. The goals, he said, include demilitarizing the territory, the Israeli military having \"overriding security control\" and a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge.\nIsrael wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites in Gaza, he said, but in a later briefing to local media, he asserted: \"There is no hunger. There was no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.\"\nNetanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to \"bring in more foreign journalists\" — which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war.\nHe again blamed many of Gaza's problems on the Hamas militant group, including civilian deaths, destruction and aid shortages. \"Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists,\" he asserted, adding that Palestinians are \"begging\" to be freed from them.\nHamas responded with a lengthy statement that summed up Netanyahu's remarks as \"blatant lies.\"\nU.S. defends Israel at Security Council meeting\nThe United States defended Israel, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.\nThe U.S. has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there.\nOther council members, and U.N. officials, expressed alarm. China called the \"collective punishment\" of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a \"reckless intensification of hostilities.\"\n\"This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,\" said Ramesh Rajasingham with the U.N. humanitarian office. \"Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.\"\nIsrael faces growing action even by its closest allies. Netanyahu said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany had \"buckled under\" the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. Merz, for his part, told public broadcaster ARD that Germany and Israel were talking \"very critically\" but Berlin's overall policies of friendship haven't changed.\nMore Palestinians killed as they seek aid\nAt least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. The Associated Press spoke to witnesses of gunfire in the Israeli-controlled Morag and Netzarim corridors and the Teina area in the south. All accused Israeli forces of firing at crowds trying to reach food distributions or waiting for convoys.\nFifteen people were killed while waiting for trucks near the Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital.\nThe situation is a \"death trap,\" said Jamal al-Laweh, who said Israeli forces opened fire there. \"But I have no other choice to feed the kids.\"\nSix were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital.\nIn central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The AP could not independently confirm who fired. Awda hospital said four people were killed by Israeli gunfire.\nSix other aid-seekers were killed while trying to reach GHF sites in Khan Younis and Rafah, Nasser hospital said.\nThe GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but operations have been marred by deaths and chaos.\nResponding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: \"There were no incidents at or near our sites today.\" Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.\nHunger death toll among children hits 100\nIsrael's air and ground offensive has displaced most Palestinians and pushed the territory toward famine. Two Palestinian children died of malnutrition-related causes on Saturday, bringing the toll among children to 100 since the war began.\nAt least 117 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since June, when the ministry started to count them.\nThe hunger toll is in addition to the ministry's war toll of 61,400 Palestinians. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, doesn't distinguish between fighters or civilians, but says around half of the dead have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties.\nLabor strike urged in Israel over looming offensive\nHostages' relatives have urged a labor strike in Israel next week over the plans to expand military operations, fearing it will endanger their loved ones. Fifty hostages remain after being taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Twenty are believed to be alive.\nDozens of people sat outside the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem to protest Israel's offensive. \"I think it's a horrible decision. It's like deciding that we don't want (hostages) alive anymore,\" said one, Milly Rothschild.","content_hash":"77adf3e22a67d0ce8e806445791b1e51","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6657,"method_rank":0}

Both of their cars are paid off, and the mortgage on the starter house they bought in 2016 is $1,200 a month. Jason says a friend is renting the house from them to cover their mortgage and leasing one of the cars while they stay.\nAs for their stay, they rented an apartment and spent months preparing their paperwork. Jason used his Taiwanese passport (he was born there and moved to the U.S. when he was 9), Forrest got his own Taiwan passport, and Katie obtained a spousal visa.\nBy the summer of 2024, Jason quit his job in sales, and Katie left her work at a nonprofit.\n'This is not something that can afford to wait'\nJason says timing was important: Not only did he want to make sure Forrest had enough time with his grandparents and to adjust to kindergarten, but taking the leap was also crucial for himself, Katie and the grandparents.\n\"This is not something that can afford to wait,\" Jason says. \"If I don't do this now, I will forever lose my 30s. And then when am I going to re-explore myself again? In my 40s? My 50s? By the time I retire in my 60s? I just didn't feel like that was a good trade off.\"\nWe are so happy right now, the happiest we've been as a family, and we are living our life on less than what we had before.Jason LeeAmerican on a sabbatical in Taiwan\nWhat's more, he wanted to make sure that Forrest had time to interact with his grandparents while they are still in good health and mobile.\nOverall, Jason says, \"as I look back to this year and I think about all the trips we were able to do and all the memories we were able to make, it's absolutely worth it.\"\n'We are so happy right now'\nIn addition to spending more quality time with family, Jason set a few personal and professional goals for himself for his sabbatical.\nHe says his career break has given him time and energy to focus on his physical and mental health, such as going to the gym, meditating, eating healthfully and working with a psychiatrist for the first time, thanks to Taiwan's universal health care system.\nWith more mental clarity, Jason says he's turned his attention to what he wants out of his career. Prior to his break, he says he put a lot of pressure on himself to have a high-performing sales year; when that didn't pan out, it took a toll on his sense of self.\n\"The whole last 10 years, I've been dictating my career next steps not based on what I want, but based on what the world or LinkedIn tells me I should want,\" Jason says.\nHe realized he felt pressure to continue climbing the corporate ladder to earn higher titles and more money. \"I just realized how much of that has set me up for being unhappy, when I don't prioritize myself or what I want.\"\nBy March, he sat down with Katie with a big realization that once they returned to the U.S., they were OK with not chasing the same salaries they had before.\n\"I realized that our family doesn't need to make as much or more than what we made before in order to be happy,\" Jason says. \"We are so happy right now, the happiest we've been as a family, and we are living our life on less than what we had before.\"\nReturning to the U.S.\nThe Lees have big plans for their return to the states.\n\"The plan was always to return in August, but surprise, we got pregnant,\" Jason says.\nThe couple had discussed having their second baby during their sabbatical, given Taiwan's high quality of birthing and post-natal care for families.\nKatie gave birth to their daughter, Ruby, in early July, so the family of four will return to the states in October when she has a passport and is able to travel.\nJason and Katie say their first career-related priority is for one of them to secure a job back in the U.S. as soon as possible to make sure their family has health insurance coverage. Jason says he'll consider taking a lower-paying job that affords more flexibility, like with a company that makes it easier to work summers remote in Taiwan.\nKatie, meanwhile, has spent her sabbatical drafting business plans for two startup ideas, a vending machine business and a play cafe for kids and their parents or caregivers, and hopes to continue building out those ideas in the U.S.\nAs for their journey so far, \"it's just been so transformative for the family,\" he says.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Its chips can be found in popular consumer products like Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox, and even the infotainment systems inside Tesla's electric vehicles.\nHowever, AMD's biggest opportunity right now is in the data center. The company is planning to launch a new lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development in 2026, which could blow the competition -- including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- out of the water.\nAMD stock is up 34% in 2025 already, but it's still below its all-time high just north of $200, which was set last year. Should investors scoop it up while it's still trading at a discount? Read on to find out.\nAMD is catching up to Nvidia in the data center space\nAMD launched its flagship MI300X data center GPU at the end of 2023, more than a year after Nvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU hit the market. Despite being behind, AMD still managed to attract some of Nvidia's largest customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms.\nWhile Nvidia continues to leap ahead of the competition with new GPU architectures like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, AMD is quickly closing the gap. It just started shipping its MI350 series GPUs, which are based on a new architecture the company calls Compute DNA (CDNA) 4. These new chips offer 35 times more performance than CDNA 3 versions like the original MI300X, placing them on par with Nvidia's Blackwell lineup.\nIn fact, the latest MI355 offers comparable performance to Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 GPU, and it delivers up to 40% more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) in AI inference workloads for the same cost. In other words, it's much cheaper to run over the long term without sacrificing any processing power, which is why it's attracting hyperscalers and even leading AI start-ups like OpenAI.\nBut customers' attention is already turning to 2026, when AMD plans to release its MI400 series. These new chips will be combined with specialized software and hardware systems to create a fully integrated AI data center rack called Helios, which will supercharge their performance. AMD CEO Lisa Su believes these MI400-based Helios systems will be the most powerful in the world when they launch, offering a staggering 10 times more performance over the MI350 series.\nSimply put, 2026 could be the year that AMD overtakes Nvidia in the AI data center space, at least in terms of technological capability.\nAMD's AI data center revenue hit a speed bump in Q2\nAMD generated a record $7.7 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025, which was a 32% increase from the year-ago period. The data center segment was responsible for $3.2 billion of that revenue on its own, but it only mustered 14% growth, which was somewhat disappointing given the competitive, high-stakes nature of the GPU market.\nExport restrictions were recently imposed by the U.S. government, and they wiped out AMD's AI GPU sales to China, which was the main reason for the underperformance in its data center segment. However, the company says it has applied for licenses to resume sales, and they are currently under review by the Trump administration.\nBut there was great news in other areas of AMD's business, like its client segment, where revenue soared 67% year over year to $2.5 billion. This is where the company accounts for sales of its Ryzen AI chips for personal computers, which come with a built-in GPU, central processing unit (CPU), and neural processing unit (NPU). They are installed in a growing number of computers from leading brands like Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus.\nAMD's gaming business also roared back to life in Q2, with revenue surging by 73% to $1.1 billion. Revenue declined in this segment last year, and also during the first quarter of 2025, but demand for some of the company's core products is starting to rebound. Console manufacturers are increasing their inventories in preparation for the holiday season, and AMD said demand for its new Radeon 9000 series desktop GPUs is exceeding supply.\nShould you buy AMD stock while it's under $200?\nDespite the temporary regulatory headwind in AMD's data center business, Lisa Su is as optimistic as ever about its potential. She believes the company's AI revenue will scale into the tens of billions of dollars per year over the long term, driven by the MI400 GPU, which is already experiencing strong customer interest even though it won't hit the market until next year.\nOn that note, is AMD stock a buy while it's still below its record high? The company generated $3.45 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 46.8. That means it's notably cheaper than Nvidia stock, which is sitting at a P\/E ratio of 55.7.\nMoreover, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests AMD could deliver $5.97 in EPS during 2026, placing its stock at a forward P\/E ratio of just 27.1. That leaves room for significant upside, because the stock would have to soar by 73% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current P\/E ratio of 46.8.\nIt's possible AMD stock will perform even better if the MI400 series blows the competition out of the water next year, like Su expects, so it could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio right now.\nShould you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,\" the statement said.\n\"The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine. We remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force,\" the Europeans added.\nU.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News on Sunday that a good deal would mean preventing an emboldened Russia, and aggressors elsewhere, from trying to once again redraw borders by force.\nA Trump ally and Russia hawk, Graham nevertheless said that \"you can't end a war without talking.\"\n\"I do hope that Zelenskyy can be part of the process. I have every confidence in the world that (President Trump) is going to go to meet Putin from a position of strength, that he's going to look out for Europe and Ukrainian needs to end this war honorably,\" he said.\nHe argued that \"Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian\" soldier, but said the West should give Kyiv robust security guarantees, keep some of its forces on the ground \"as trip wires,\" and keep arming Ukraine \"so that Russia will be deterred by the most lethal army on the continent of Europe.\"\nA fruitless push toward a truce\nA monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking.\nTrump also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The deadline was Friday. The White House did not answer questions Saturday about possible sanctions.\nThe Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO, and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country. Particularly galling for Kyiv is Moscow's insistence that it cede pockets of eastern and southern Ukraine, the Kremlin claims to have annexed, despite lacking full military control.\nMark Galeotti, a British expert in Russian politics who heads the Mayak Intelligence consultancy, says Moscow's tactic of encircling towns in eastern Ukraine has brought a string of territorial gains for Russia, and Putin \"does not appear to feel under pressure.\"\nFor the Kremlin, \"further delaying any more serious U.S. action and the optics of a meeting with the U.S. president will already be wins,\" Galeotti argued in an analysis published Sunday by the UK's Sunday Times newspaper.\nZelenskyy rules out giving up territory\nZelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine \"will not give Russia any awards for what it has done\" and that \"Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"\nUkrainian officials previously told the AP privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine's inability to regain lost territories militarily. But Zelenskyy on Saturday insisted that formally ceding land was out of the question.\nGaleotti argued that any deal that involves Ukraine abandoning territory would be \"agonizing\" and politically dangerous for Zelenskyy.\nAndriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelenskyy, noted on Sunday that Kyiv will strive to boost its position ahead of the planned Trump-Putin meeting.\n\"Ahead lies an important week of diplomacy,\" he said.\nPushing for sanctions\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Sunday that European leaders are \"intensively preparing\" ahead of the Alaska summit, while they \"hope and expect\" that Zelenskyy will be invited.\nMerz told Germany's public broadcaster ARD that he has for weeks been encouraging Washington to toughen sanctions against Russia, adding that \"Putin only acts under pressure.\"\nMikhail Kasyanov, Putin's first prime minister and later a political opponent, similarly told the BBC Sunday that the Kremlin would be more willing to negotiate seriously and make some concessions when sanctions have further strained Russia's economy.\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Sunday praised Washington for taking steps such as allowing more military equipment to flow to Ukraine and imposing secondary sanctions on India for purchasing Russian oil, saying Trump \"clearly is putting pressure on Putin.\"\n\"Next Friday will be important because it will be about testing Putin — how serious he is — on bringing this terrible war to an end,\" Rutte said in an interview with ABC News.","content_hash":"3dd5f4e9570b7037418f9875b9bc9065","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6576,"method_rank":0}

But certain Wall Street analysts think the stocks are wildly overvalued, as detailed below:\nRishi Jaluria at RBC Capital has set Palantir with a target of $45 per share, which implies 75% downside from its current share price of $182. He cited an unsustainable valuation as the primary reason for his sell rating.\nMichael Ng at Goldman Sachs has set Super Micro Computer with a target price at $24 per share, which implies 49% downside from its current share price of $47. He cited margin pressure due to increased competition as a key reason for his sell rating.\nHere's what investors should know about Palantir and Super Micro Computer.\nPalantir Technologies: 75% implied downside\nPalantir develops data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms for the commercial and government sectors. Its software not only helps clients turn complex data into actionable insights, but also lets them train and deploy machine learning models that drive better decision-making over time. Use cases range from retail and manufacturing to defense and financial services.\nThe International Data Corporation has ranked Palantir as the market leader in decision intelligence software, and Forrester Research recognized the company as a technology leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms. That puts Palantir in a prime position. The data analytics software market is forecast to grow at 28% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.\nPalantir reported exceptional second-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Customers increased 43% to 849 and the average existing customer spent 28% more. In turn, revenue climbed 48% to $1 billion, the eighth straight acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings increased 77% to $0.16 per diluted share.\nPalantir is clearly a fundamentally sound business, but no business is worth buying at any price. The stock currently trades at an absurdly rich 133 times sales. For context, the next most expensive member of the S&P 500 is Nvidia at 30 times sales. That means Palantir's share price could drop 77% and it would still be the most expensive stock in the index.\nInvestors should never put too much confidence in forecasts from individual analysts, but Wall Street analysts in aggregate see Palantir as overvalued. The average target price is $151 per share, implying 17% downside from the current share price of $182. Investors should steer clear of this stock until it's priced more reasonably.\nSuper Micro Computer: 49% implied downside\nSuper Micro Computer (commonly called Supermicro) designs and manufactures storage systems, compute subsystems, and servers, including full server racks tailor-made for artificial intelligence and other high-performance computing tasks. Importantly, the company established itself as an early leader in AI servers based on its ability to quickly bring new chips to market.\nTo elaborate, Supermicro uses electronic \"building blocks\" across product lines to quickly assemble a broad range of servers. That strategy lets the company rapidly release hardware featuring the latest technologies from suppliers like Nvidia and AMD. In fact, CEO Charles Liang says Supermicro can often bring new AI chips to market two to six months before its competitors.\nBut that time-to-market advantage alone does constitute a durable competitive moat, and Supermicro has lost momentum as competition has intensified with Dell Technologies. The company announced dismal financial results for the June quarter. Revenue increased 7% to $5.8 billion, gross margin narrowed 70 basis points to 9.5%, and GAAP earnings fell 33% to $0.31 per diluted share.\nLast year, management said gross margins would normalize around 14% to 17% by the end of fiscal 2025, but margins have continued to contract in a clear sign Supermicro is losing pricing power as the AI server space becomes more competitive. To that end, the company slashed its revenue guidance to $33 billion (down from $40 billion) for the fiscal year ending in June 2026.\nLooking ahead, Grand View Research says AI server sales will increase at 38% annually to reach $850 billion by 2030. But Supermicro's earnings are likely to grow less quickly given it lacks a durable competitive moat. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company's adjusted earnings to increase at 28% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027.\nAdmittedly, the current valuation of 23 times adjusted earnings still looks reasonable versus forward earnings estimates, but Wall Street has historically overestimated the company. Supermicro missed the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 13% over the last four quarters. So, while I doubt shares will plunge 49%, I still believe there are better places for investors to put their money.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

SMCI stock once again regained traction as investors bet big on its leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware space, growing demand for next-gen servers, and close partnership with chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) — all of which painted a promising growth story.\nBut the narrative took a sharp turn in the wrong direction after the company dropped its fourth-quarter earnings report on Aug. 5. Shares of SMCI sank more than 18% in the following trading session, as Super Micro missed Wall Street’s expectations on both revenue and earnings. Even guidance fell short, sparking fresh concerns about slowing growth and rising competition.\nInvestor sentiment around SMCI stock has clearly taken a hit, and analysts' opinions are now deeply divided. On one end, the most bullish target on Wall Street suggests that SMCI stock could soar to $70, while on the other side, the most bearish sees it dropping all the way to $15 per share. So, with expectations stretched so far apart, can SMCI defy the doubts and reclaim its momentum? Or is there more downside still to come?\nAbout Super Micro Stock\nSuper Micro Computer specializes in building high-powered, energy-efficient servers to support surging demand from AI, cloud services, and data centers. With operations across the U.S., Taiwan, and the Netherlands, the company has built a solid international footprint and currently holds a market capitalization of $27.8 billion.\nAfter sliding last year under the weight of negative headlines, SMCI stock came roaring back in 2025, hitting a fresh high of $66.44 in February. Even after pulling back some 32% from that peak, the stock remains up an impressive 50% so far this year, well ahead of the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) modest 8.5% gain year-to-date (YTD).\nHowever, the comeback rally appears to be facing turbulence lately. SMCI is once again under pressure following its latest earnings miss, with shares tumbling 19% in just the past five trading days.\nA Look Inside Super Micro’s Q4 Earnings\nSuper Micro’s fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings report released earlier this month came as a letdown to investors, missing Wall Street’s expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue for the quarter rose 7.4% year-over-year (YOY) to $5.8 billion but still fell short of the $5.9 billion analysts had expected. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.41, marking a notable 24% decline from the prior year and falling below the consensus estimate of $0.44, partly because of the impact from President Donald Trump’s tariffs on goods imported into the United States.\nWhile the company pointed to tariffs as a key reason for the earnings shortfall, the miss stung even more given the backdrop of soaring demand for AI infrastructure, which had set investors’ expectations sky high. Instead of a blowout quarter, the results revealed mounting cost pressures and thinner margins, casting doubt on Super Micro’s ability to deliver strong profits even as sales continue to rise.\nA key red flag was the drop in gross margin, which slipped to 9.5% from 10.2% a year ago. The decline suggests the company may be facing pricing pressure or higher costs, likely tied to competitive dynamics or more expensive AI components. As of June 30, Super Micro reported $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents, alongside $4.8 billion in total bank debt and convertible notes.\nUnfortunately, the disappointment didn’t end at Super Micro’s Q4 financials. The company’s guidance for Q1 of fiscal 2026 also fell short of expectations. Management expects revenue to land between $6 billion and $7 billion, while adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.40 and $0.52. Both of these figures miss Wall Street’s forecasts for $6.6 billion in revenue and $0.59 in EPS.\nOver the longer term, analysts tracking Super Micro project the company's bottom line to rise 19.2% YOY to $2.05 per share in fiscal 2026, then leap 21% annually to $2.49 in fiscal 2027.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Super Micro Stock?\nAfter the disappointing Q4 showing, several Wall Street analysts struck a more cautious tone. For instance, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee lowered the firm’s price target to $45 from $46, maintaining a “Neutral” rating. Chatterjee pointed to capital constraints and customer hesitation as key reasons the company fell short of expectations.\nOn the other hand, Bank of America Securities analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya slightly raised the price target to $37 from $35 while sticking with an “Underperform” rating. The analyst noted that gross margins were pressured once again, this time due to inventory reserves for older products. Bhattacharya explained that many customers are opting to wait for Nvidia’s upcoming B300\/GB300 GPUs, which has weighed on current demand.\nOverall, Wall Street sentiment on Super Micro is tilting cautious, with SMCI stock earning a consensus rating of “Hold.” Among the 16 analysts covering the stock, opinions are clearly mixed. Only four recommend a “Strong Buy,” while three lean toward a “Moderate Buy.” The majority of analysts take a wait-and-see approach, with six suggesting “Hold.” On the bearish side, one analyst has a “Moderate Sell” rating for SMCI and two assign a “Strong Sell” rating, reflecting growing uncertainty around the company’s near-term outlook.\nSMCI stock has a Street-high price target of $70, indicating nearly 54% potential upside. The lowest target of $15 suggests a steep 67% drop from current levels.\nKey Takeaways\nSuper Micro’s wide price target range, spanning from $15 to a Street-high of $70, underscores the uncertainty surrounding its near-term trajectory. While some analysts remain bullish on its long-term AI-driven potential, others are wary of execution risks and margin pressures. With sentiment this divided, the stock’s path forward may remain volatile as investors wait for more apparent signs of sustained growth.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Buffett will be stepping down as the company's CEO in a little under five months, and investors are likely paying close attention to the last reports with him at the helm. Although the company's operating results came in strong, investors may have been disappointed that Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own stock.\nIn addition to watching the usual earnings metrics, investors are always parsing through Buffett's letters and Berkshire's regulatory filings on the hunt for clues about how Buffett and his team feel about the economy. In its Q2 report, Berkshire specifically mentioned President Donald Trump's tariffs. The company's warning to Wall Street only grew louder.\nBerkshire's businesses are emblematic of the economy\nWhile Buffett had expressed concerns about the U.S. trade deficit with other countries in the early 2000s, he and Berkshire have made it pretty clear that they are not a fan of Trump's tariff plans.\nEarlier this year, during an interview with CBS, Buffett called tariffs \"an act of war to some degree.\" He also said that the U.S., throughout its history, has significant experience with tariffs, and he believes that over time they are a tax on goods. \"I mean the tooth fairy doesn't pay them,\" he said.\nAbout five months later, the tariff drama has wound down, and the market has seemingly gotten used to Trump's negotiating style of seeming to play hardball and then choosing a tariff rate that tends to be a little bit easier to digest. That said, I think tariff rates have come in higher than most experts and pundits expected. Imports from most countries are looking at a rate of 15%, while imports from more than a few countries currently face rates in the 20% to 40% range, as of this writing.\nMake no mistake, those rates are significant and will have an impact. While tariffs are projected to bring in significant revenue for the U.S. government, most experts, including Buffett, view them as a tax that someone has to bear. Additionally, Trump's constant changing of tariff rates and the resulting uncertainty are likely leading many businesses to hit the pause button on hiring and their capital expenditure plans.\nOn its Q2 earnings report, Berkshire wrote:\nOur periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by the impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical conflicts and events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events. The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events. We are currently unable to reliably predict the ultimate impact on our businesses, whether through changes in the availability of products, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services. It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses, as well as on our investments in equity securities, which could significantly affect our future results.\nThis, in my view, makes more deafening the warning to Wall Street, especially when you consider that Buffett typically tries to stay out of politics.\nIt's also important to note that Berkshire Hathaway, one of the largest conglomerates in the world, owns companies across most sectors. In addition to its nearly $300 billion equities portfolio, Berkshire owns one of the largest insurance businesses in the U.S., significant energy assets, the Burlington North Santa Fe Railroad, a large mortgage business, and smaller businesses in other sectors, giving the Berkshire team strong visibility into the broader economy.\nThe big threat from tariffs\nWhile Berkshire did not spell out specifically how tariffs could adversely impact all of its operating businesses, it's reasonable to assume that Berkshire's team is concerned about an uptick in inflation that, paired with higher unemployment, could put the economy and Federal Reserve in a bit of a pickle.\nWhile inflation on the whole has not surged higher just yet, as some had feared, it is starting to rear its head in certain areas that would be more impacted by tariffs like apparel, toys, and appliances. Businesses are also starting to announce charges from tariffs, including the major U.S. car companies, as well as major retail and apparel companies.\nIt's possible that tariffs lead to a one-time hit to inflation, but the longer the uncertainty continues, the longer companies stay on pause. Already, there are signs of weakness in the labor market. It's also possible that tariffs stall growth and inadvertently lead to disinflation (a slowing of inflation). Regardless, the Fed and most others want to avoid a stagflation scenario where both unemployment and inflation rise, putting the Fed in a bind, where it can't raise or lower interest interest rates without raising unemployment or reigniting inflation.\nSince the big tariff scare in April, the market has largely been able to shake off worrisome tariff news and events. But as more and more data piles up, the market won't be able to ignore the signs forever.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

And this time they’re eyeing up the Government’s bond market.\nIt may sound like a boring trade, but investors are making huge profits by borrowing tens of billions of pounds against UK debt, known as gilts.\nThe aim? To profit from minute differences between the cash price of a bond today and what it may be worth several days, weeks or months from now.\nThis strategy, known as a “basis trade”, makes money by exploiting the tiny gap between the two prices – buying one for a lower price and selling another for a higher price in a good old fashioned game of arbitrage.\nSuch is the high risk, low reward nature of these types of trades, that they have been likened to “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller”.\nBut these “masters of the universe”, as Tom Wolfe once wrote, are far smarter than that. To really make it worth their while, hedge funds borrow money from banks to juice up their returns – turning these fractional pennies into big bucks.\nYet such is the popularity of the strategy that regulators are now becoming increasingly alarmed about the dangers these funds pose to the British financial system.\nIn many ways, their involvement has been welcome. Hedge funds – which face less regulatory scrutiny than banks – are performing the role of linking buyers and sellers that used to be done by more traditional lenders.\nThriving in an environment of high volatility, hedge fund traders are able to let their hair down in a way that banks cannot.\nHowever, as Richard Hughes, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility recently highlighted, these “fickle and flighty” investors are more likely to be looking for short-term gains than a long-term relationship.\n“These overseas investors are, by their nature as comparison shoppers in the global debt market, likely to be more fickle and flighty than their domestic counterparts,” he warned last month.\nAndreas Dombret, a former German central bank official, puts it more simply: “They’re the first to leave the party if things get rough.”\nThe Bank of England is also keeping a close eye on developments. Its latest Financial Stability Report (FSR) warned that the big global footprint of these funds “increased the risk that stress in one market could spill over into others” – triggering huge fire sales in times looming financial chaos.\nSo what could go wrong?\nThe role of hedge funds in the bond market has grown significantly in recent years.\nEarlier this year, Bank deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said that hedge fund involvement in the gilt market had almost doubled from 15pc of trades in 2018 to around 30pc today.\nHistorically, pension schemes had been the largest buyers of gilts, particularly long-term debt. But this demand has started to dry up, as the era of the final salary pension scheme comes to an end, at least for private sector workers.\nPart of the reason for hedge funds’ huge appetite for gilts is that they can be used as collateral to borrow more money from banks.\nTo juice up their returns on the “basis trade”, hedge funds raise money through so-called repurchase agreements – or repos – where investors can swap bonds for cash.\nGilts are put up as collateral: if banks don’t get paid back they get to keep the gilts. And they use this money to buy more debt. As of June, hedge funds had borrowed £77bn from banks to recycle back into gilts – the highest level since records began in 2016.\nThis also represents the largest increase in borrowing across the so-called shadow banking sector, according to Threadneedle Street.\nBut it doesn’t take a genius to spot the risks involved. If hedge funds are using their gilts to borrow money to recycle into more gilts, then it only takes one small unexpected price movement for the house of cards to start wobbling.\nThe Bank is watching this explosive growth closely over fears it could create another doom-loop spiral.\nIt said growing holdings of gilts by hedge funds also raised the risk of a borrowing shock, with 90pc of net borrowing on the repo market concentrated among just a handful of hedge funds.\n“This concentration means that a rapid unwind of leveraged positions by a few key players could amplify shocks during periods of high volatility,” the Bank warned.\nHouseholds and businesses at risk\nIt’s not just investors that risk getting hurt. The Bank has warned that a wider leverage-fuelled sell-off could push up borrowing costs for households and businesses.\nAfter all, the liability driven investment (LDI) crisis triggered by Liz Truss’s mini-Budget pushed up mortgage costs for millions of borrowers.\nAndrew Bailey’s recent inaugural speech as head of the world’s most powerful financial watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), saw him warn about the dangers of history repeating itself.\nReeling off a list of near misses in terms of financial meltdowns, he noted that American hedge funds were forced to unwind $90bn (£66bn) of their so-called “basis trade” positions as they became largely loss-making.\n“Public authorities had to intervene in unprecedented ways to prevent further market dysfunction and strain on the real economy,” said the Bank of England Governor, as he described the US bond market seizure triggered by Donald Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs as a “near miss”.\nHowever, a drive for more financial reporting and disclosure has met with resistance and has been watered down after a backlash from the industry.\nBack in the UK, regulators are pressing ahead with proposals for more scrutiny, with a discussion paper in the works that could ultimately push more government bond trading towards central clearing houses, which charge a margin that effectively eats in to how much hedge funds can borrow.\nPolicymakers are also examining whether regulators can impose lower valuations lower than the market price on assets used to back a repo transaction, also removing the appeal of borrowing this way.\nChanges in how the gilt market functions are likely to be permanent.\nRegulators must now scramble to keep up as the risks continue to keep central bankers around the world awake at night.\nSoros may have broken the Bank of England. But the Bank must be ready to make sure it doesn’t happen again.","content_hash":"28ae554cf12250c6f490f672293b679a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6283,"method_rank":0}

In fact, he and his team of investment managers at Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) have been net sellers of stocks for 11 straight quarters.\nBuffett's stock sales have accelerated over the past five quarters. That includes monster sales of Berkshire's stakes in Apple and Bank of America. In the meantime, he's stopped buying one stock investors had seen him buy consistently each quarter since mid-2018. As a result, Berkshire's cash pile has climbed to a whopping $344 billion.\nBut the market may be offering Buffett an opportunity to start buying his favorite stock again, and investors should consider doing the same.\nBuffett isn't timing the market\nBuffett's big stock sales over the last few years and his lack of purchases may be seen by some as the Oracle of Omaha trying to predict the future and time the market. While it might look like market timing, Buffett is merely sticking to what's worked for him as an investor for the last 60 years or so.\n\"We try to price, rather than time, purchases,\" Buffett wrote in his 1994 letter to shareholders. The same could be said of Berkshire's stock sales. If the market is offering a massive premium on one of Berkshire's holdings, Buffett ought to sell it, pocket the cash, and look for opportunities in stocks trading well below their intrinsic value. That could even include buying Berkshire Hathaway shares themselves.\nIn fact, the board of directors updated its share repurchase policy in 2018, allowing Buffett to buy back shares of the company as long as it traded below its intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Buffett quickly went to work buying back shares following that change, indicating that the stock looked like a bargain. Between 2018 and May 2024, Buffett spent $78 billion buying back shares of Berkshire Hathaway.\nOver the last 14 months, however, Buffett hasn't spent a single dollar buying back the stock based on Berkshire's quarterly earnings reports. He holds himself to the same high standards he expects of the CEOs of all the companies Berkshire invests in. \"All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium,\" he wrote in his 2023 letter to shareholders.\nBut Berkshire shares have fallen considerably since Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year during the company's annual meeting in May. And after a further sell-off sparked by its second-quarter earnings report, shares are starting to look a lot more appealing. That could open the door for Buffett to start buying back Berkshire's stock.\nWill Buffett start buying again?\nBerkshire Hathaway's earnings disappointed many investors, leading the market to sell off the stock.\nAfter a stellar 2024, the insurance business is back to more normalized operations, including big payouts earlier this year due to the California wildfires. That's led to a drop in underwriting profits, which pushed the conglomerate's total operating earnings down nearly 4% last quarter. It's worth noting, however, that Berkshire faced significant foreign exchange headwinds last quarter, which negatively affected operating earnings.\nBerkshire also wrote down its Kraft Heinz investment by $5 billion. That follows a $3 billion impairment charge it took in 2019. That further negatively affected reported earnings.\nNonetheless, Buffett has seen the book value per share of Berkshire Hathaway climb, including a 2.1% gain from the first quarter, and a 10.9% increase from a year ago. Combined with the declining stock price over the last three months, Berkshire Hathaway shares now trade for a price-to-book ratio of about 1.5.\nThat's an important valuation, because when Buffett last repurchased shares of Berkshire, the stock traded below that valuation. The stock has rarely dipped below that price since last May. But shares are certainly more attractive after the sell-off.\nA couple of factors could keep Buffett from buying at the current price. First, Berkshire's marketable equity portfolio is a significant factor in its book value. Buffett may still see most of the stocks in the portfolio as overpriced, especially as stocks continued to climb over the past year. That would push him to require a lower multiple for Berkshire stock, since repurchasing Berkshire shares would also mean purchasing a small piece of its equity portfolio.\nThe other factor is that he may want to use a significant chunk of cash to bolster the railroad business in the near future. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have agreed to a merger, threatening the competitiveness of Berkshire's Burlington Northern Santa Fe.\nWhen you consider the strength of Berkshire's balance sheet and that it's not relying on insurance float for any capital at this point, it should trade for a higher price-to-book value ratio than it has historically. With shares trading around 1.5 times book value, the stock finally looks to be trading near its intrinsic value again, making it worth buying.\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

The master limited partnership (MLP) sports a 7.4% yield and has been growing its distribution nicely in the past few years. While MLPs come with some extra paperwork at tax time, the majority of their distributions are deemed a return of capital and are tax-deferred until the stock is sold.\nWhat's even more exciting, though, is that the midstream company is entering a new growth phase, and its backlog of attractive projects is starting to pile up. This should lead to solid growth in the coming years.\nThe company recently announced a new large growth project right around the time it posted its second-quarter results.\nGrowth projects keep piling up\nJust ahead of its earnings announcement, Energy Transfer announced a new $5.3 billion natural gas pipeline project called the Desert Southwest pipeline that will take natural gas from the Permian to markets in Arizona and New Mexico. The pipeline will be able to handle 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf\/d), and it expands the company's Transwestern natural gas pipeline network. The project is expected to be complete by the end of 2029 and is backed by significant long-term commitments.\nThis follows the company's already announced Phase 1 of its Hugh Brinson Pipeline, which also will have 1.5 Bfc\/d of capacity takeaway from the Permian to markets in Texas. Phase 1 of the project is expected to come online by the end of 2026. Energy Transfer also just agreed to go through with Phase 2 of the project, which will give it the ability to transport approximately 2.2 Bcf per day of natural gas from west to east and approximately 1 Bcf per day from east to west. The company said that the project \"establishes Energy Transfer as the premier option for customers seeking a flexible and reliable natural gas solution to support their power plant and data center growth plans.\"\nEnergy Transfer also said it is making substantial progress toward the commercialization of its Lake Charles LNG project. LNG (liquified natural gas) exports are one of the hottest areas of the energy market. The long-awaited project looks like it may finally get the green light, with it finding a partner for the project in MidOcean Energy and signing a number of offtake agreements. The company is also in advanced discussions with some offtake partners for them to take an ownership stake, and it ultimately plans to own about 25% of the project.\nThe company also remains excited about the opportunities it sees coming from data center customers. It said it continues to see a significant level of activity and that it is in advanced discussions with several facilities in close proximity to its footprint.\nOverall, the company is spending $5 billion in growth capital expenditures (capex) this year, and it has a lot more projects lined up. Half its current growth spending will be on natural gas-focused projects.\nTurning to its Q2 results, Energy Transfer grew its adjusted EBITDA in the quarter by 3% year over year to $3.87 billion. Distributable cash flow (DCF) to partners fell 1% to $1.96 billion, down from $2.04 billion a year ago.\nVolumes were up across its systems, including an 11% year-over-year jump in interstate natural gas volumes, a 10% jump in midstream gathered volumes, a 9% rise in crude oil volumes, and an 8% increase in intrastate natural gas volumes. However, the company saw some reduced pipeline optimization in its Texas intrastate pipeline system due to lower spreads, and it saw lower crude transportation revenues on its Bakken pipeline system.\nAs a result, the company now expects its full-year EBITDA to be at or slightly below the low end of its $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion guidance.\nTime to buy Energy Transfer stock\nWhile the slight reduction in guidance is disappointing, the long-term story for Energy Transfer looks bright. The number of growth projects the company has in front of it is just piling up, with it generally expecting to get a mid-teens return on these projects. The larger projects are still a ways off, but they should provide the company with a strong runway of growth in the coming years.\nAt the same time, investors get a nice distribution that is well covered by the company's DCF. For Q2, its coverage ratio was a robust 1.7 times. The company is looking to grow its distribution by a 3% to 5% annual rate moving forward, and it increased its quarterly payout by more than 3% year over year last month to $0.33 per unit.\nMeanwhile, about 90% of its 2025 EBITDA is coming from fee-based operations, with many of its contracts having take-or-pay provisions, so this is a nice steady business. The company's balance sheet is also in good shape.\nTurning to valuation, the stock trades at a forward enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple of just 8.1 times. That's toward the low end of its MLP peers and below the 13.7x EV\/EBITDA multiple the average MLP traded at between 2011 and 2016.\nWith a lot of growth ahead, a robust yield, growing distribution, and cheap valuation, Energy Transfer looks like a great option for income-oriented investors moving forward.\nShould you buy stock in Energy Transfer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Energy Transfer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Energy Transfer wasn’t one of them.

A new survey shows exactly what the average American believes it takes to achieve it -- and if you're falling short, there's a simple way to build a net worth of $1 million or more with a few hundred dollars per month.\nThere's a high bar for financial comfort\nEarlier this year, Charles Schwab conducted a survey of over 2,000 U.S. adults ages 21 to 75. Participants were asked how much money they believe it takes to be \"financially comfortable,\" and the results were broken down by age range.\nAmong all participants, the average net worth needed to be considered \"financially comfortable\" was $839,000. That's up from $778,000 in 2024 and $624,000 in 2021. The answers also varied across generations, with baby boomers having the highest expectations for financial comfort.\nSource: Charles Schwab. Table by author.\nThe survey also asked participants how likely they thought they were to ever achieve this goal. While 28% said they believed they were already on track to be financially comfortable and another 25% said they could achieve it with some lifestyle changes, 27% said they don't think they'll ever get there.\nBut it's simpler than you might think to build wealth with the stock market. If you're new to investing or just want a low-maintenance option, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a smart choice.\nETFs are bundles of stocks grouped together into a single investment. With just one share of an ETF, you can own hundreds or even thousands of stocks at once. They make fantastic long-term investments for building significant wealth with minimal effort, and these three choices can help you reach your financial goals.\n1. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF\nAn S&P 500 tracking fund like the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: IVV) aims to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 itself. The fund contains stocks from 500 of the largest U.S.-based companies, many of which are industry leaders and have experienced many decades of consistent growth.\nThis type of ETF is one of the safer options, making it ideal for risk-averse investors who have plenty of time to let their money grow. It has a flawless track record of surviving periods of volatility, and the extensive diversification within an S&P 500 ETF can also help limit risk.\nHistorically, the S&P 500 has a compound annual growth rate of 10%. If you were earning a 10% average annual return and had a goal of reaching $1 million in savings, you' would need to invest around $300 per month for 36 years.\n2. Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF\nThe Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: SCHG) is similar to the S&P 500 ETF in that it only contains large-cap stocks. However, it's somewhat smaller, with only 230 holdings, and it's more focused on stocks that have the most growth potential.\nThis ETF can be a good fit for those looking for a somewhat safer growth fund. Large-cap stocks in general can be less volatile than smaller stocks, and many of them have a long history of surviving downturns. That said, growth stocks often carry more risk than those from more established companies, so growth ETFs are not quite as surefire as, say, an S&P 500 ETF.\nHigher risk can often come with higher reward, however, and this fund has earned an average rate of return of 16.73% per year over the last decade. At that rate, investing $300 per month would add up to just over $1 million after around 25 years.\n3. Vanguard Information Technology ETF\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has the highest risk of the three ETFs on this list, but it's also the one with the highest potential earnings.\nWith a focus solely on tech stocks, this ETF has earned explosive returns since its launch in 2004. With new innovations in technology -- particularly artificial intelligence -- the fund could have even more room for growth in the coming years.\nHowever, because the tech industry can be incredibly volatile, be prepared for more significant short-term ups and downs. This ETF has, historically, been hit much harder than the S&P 500 and other broad-market funds during slumps. If you choose to buy, be sure you're willing to hold your investment for at least a few years and double-check that the rest of your portfolio is well diversified.\nDespite its short-term volatility, this ETF has earned an average rate of return of 21.58% per year over the last decade. If it continues earning those types of returns, you could accumulate $1 million by investing $300 per month for around 21 years.\nAchieving financial comfort is a goal nearly everyone shares, and while it may seem out of reach for some, investing in the stock market is one of the most effective ways to get there. No matter how much you can afford to invest, small amounts can add up to more than you might think over time.\nShould you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Core S&P 500 ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in iShares Trust - iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and iShares Trust - iShares Core S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

The company recently delivered market-beating earnings for the second quarter. However, earnings declined compared to the prior-year quarter due to lower oil prices. Meanwhile, Chevron expects the recently completed Hess deal to begin contributing to its earnings in the fourth quarter of this year.\nIn Q2, Chevron returned $5.5 billion of cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $2.6 billion and dividends of $2.9 billion.

The Hess deal is expected to enhance Chevron's growth and portfolio duration.\nAdditionally, the 5-star analyst noted that while Chevron has lagged peer Exxon Mobil (XOM) in recent years, the Hess deal, along with the Tengizchevroil (TCO) project and cost-cutting measures, is expected to close the gap on growth, at least over the next 2 to 3 years. \"With a ~$12.5B cash flow inflection underway, CVX's 2026 FCF [free cash flow] yield of 8% compares to XOM at 6% and COP at 7%,\" said McDermott.\nMcDermott ranks No. 406 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.6%. See Chevron Statistics on TipRanks.\nRithm Capital\nWe move to Rithm Capital (RITM), an asset manager with significant experience in managing credit and real estate assets. The company recently announced better-than-expected second-quarter results. Rithm Capital paid a dividend of 25 cents per share for the second quarter of 2025. At an annualized dividend of $1 per share, RITM stock offers a dividend yield of 8.2%.\nReacting to the Q2 performance, RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee raised his price forecast on Rithm Capital stock to $14 from $13 while reaffirming a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on RITM stock.\nThe top-rated analyst noted that Rithm Capital reported Q2 2025 earnings available for distribution (EAD) of 54 cents per share, surpassing RBC and the Street's consensus estimate of 52 cents. Given the strong results, Lee raised his EAD per share estimate for 2025 to $2.24 from $2.21. He also raised his 2026 EAD per share estimate to $2.30 from $2.27.\n\"We favor RITM as it pivots towards being an alternative investment manager, with a fee-based, capital-light business model, over time,\" said Lee.\nBased on management's comments, Lee noted that Rithm might not spin off or list its Newrez business and would rather focus on growing the earnings stream within the business. He views RITM's renewed focus on growth and ROE (return on equity) enhancement positively. Lee also highlighted that Rithm Capital is seeing notable cost benefits through the implementation of initiatives related to artificial intelligence.\nLee ranks No. 22 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 74% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.7%. See Rithm Capital Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.\nAT&T\nFinally, let's look at telecom giant AT&T (T). The company delivered better-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings, topping market expectations for wireless postpaid subscriber additions. AT&T offers a quarterly dividend of $0.2775 per share. At an annualized dividend of $1.11 per share, AT&T's dividend yield stands at about 4%.\nIn reaction to the Q2 results, RBC Capital analyst Jonathan Atkin reiterated a buy rating on AT&T stock with a price target of $31. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating with a price target of $30.\nAtkin explained that AT&T's Q2 revenue beat was driven by higher-than-expected Wireless equipment revenues. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) exceeded expectations, thanks to the strength in the company's Wireline business, which offset softer Wireless profits.\nThe analyst noted that AT&T's revised 2025 guidance reflects cash tax benefits, the improved trajectory of the Wireline business, and a more competitive Wireless backdrop. Atkin added that the company's free cash flow outlook was revised to the low-to-mid $16 billion range compared to the previous guidance of more than $16 billion, which implies that most of the cash tax benefit will be reinvested into fiber capex and pension funding.\nThe 5-star analyst stated that while estimates for revenue, EBITDA, and EPS for 2026 and 2027 remain unchanged, AT&T's free cash flow outlook was increased by $1 billion for both years to reflect cash tax benefits, net of incremental investments. Atkin stated that he supports management's decision to prioritize capital investments that are expected to drive long-term growth, and \"highlight the company's traction in switching off legacy networks.\"\nAtkin ranks No. 234 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.3%.

Despite some big instances of volatility and risk factors along macroeconomic and geopolitical lines, the S&P 500 has risen roughly 7% across 2025's trading and isn't far removed from its all-time high.\nOn the other hand, some strong businesses have actually seen significant valuation contractions this year -- and taking a buy-and-hold approach to the best of the bunch could be a path to fantastic returns. If you're looking for top stocks trading at substantial discounts compared to their all-time highs, read on to see why two Fool.com contributing analysts think that these industry-leading companies stand out as great investment opportunities right now.\nAmazon stock: Down 12% from its high\nKeith Noonan (Amazon): Sometimes, the market has a gut reaction to a company's earnings report that seems to miss the forest for the trees -- and these instances can sometimes present big opportunities for investors. I think Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is one of those types of opportunities on the heels of its recent second-quarter report.\nThe technology and e-commerce giant notched per-share earnings of $1.68 on revenue of $167.7 billion, which crushed the average analyst estimate's target for earnings per share of $1.33 on sales of $162.11 billion. Despite the very strong quarterly results, Amazon stock saw a significant pullback following its second-quarter report.\nAmazon stock is down roughly 2.5% across this year's trading, and its share price is down approximately 12% from its all-time high.\nThe company guided for high levels of spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to continue, and some investors were concerned about the near-term impact the big build-out initiative will have on profitability.\nAmazon's Q2 report also arrived the same day that disappointing July jobs numbers were reported and the day after the Trump administration unveiled a series of new tariffs, which certainly didn't help set the stage for a big post-earnings rally. Amazon's recent business execution and Q2 results don't seem to have gotten all the kudos they probably deserve, but that will likely change with time.\nHeavy spending on AI infrastructure, robotics, and other potentially explosive growth drivers will certainly put some pressure on Amazon's earnings in the near term, but making big investments in these categories is probably among the smartest things the company can be doing right now. Amazon's recent quarterly report was a reminder of the company's strengths, and the stock looks like a great portfolio addition for long-term investors.\nTarget stock: Down 62% from its high\nJennifer Saibil (Target):Target(NYSE: TGT) has been a massive disappointment for shareholders over the past few years. It's been dealing with problems as fundamental as lower consumer discretionary spending and as fleeting as negative public opinion about its political beliefs. However, there are many signs of light amid the darkness, and Target stock's low price looks compelling for long-term investors.\nIn its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended May 3), sales were down 2.8% from last year, and comparable sales (comps) were down 3.8%. However, digital comps were up 4.7%, driven by a 36% increase in same-day services from its membership program. This category has been a bright spot in Target's reports throughout this challenging time. It's a good indication that loyal customers are finding value, and under better circumstances, Target can rebound.\nToday's operating environment is still hostile to a retailer like Target, which is a discount retail chain focused on discretionary shopping. Unlike Walmart, which is one of the country's biggest grocers, Target's sweet spots are categories like apparel and home improvement. Home improvement in particular is still suppressed since the real estate industry has been in a funk.\nTarget tends to perform well under better conditions, and that's likely to happen again. In the meantime, it continues to upgrade the digital platform and loyalty program, where growth is happening.\nTarget is a Dividend King, an exclusive status applied to companies that have raised their dividends for at least 50 years straight. It means the dividend is reliable, which is a crucial feature for many dividend investors, and that you can count on it to grow. With the stock down roughly 62% from its high, Target's dividend yields 4.4%, or more than three times the S&P 500 average.\nAs the S&P 500 continues to rise, it's getting harder to find bargains, but Target stock is still cheap. It trades at a forward, one-year P\/E ratio of roughly 13, which makes it a great time to buy for long-term investors, especially if you're looking for passive income.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The mission's success gave Firefly bragging rights as the first U.S. company to execute a fully successful soft lunar landing (that is, landing without causing serious damage to the module). It also generated a huge wave of interest in the company.\nThat interest is clearly still white-hot, because Firefly's Thursday IPO launched the company onto the Nasdaq at a valuation of $6.3 billion. Can it rocket even higher? Or will it fall back to earth?\nWhat Firefly actually does\nFans of the canceled-way-too-soon space Western Firefly will be sad to learn that the company's name isn't actually related to the TV series. Instead, it's a name Firefly founder Tom Markusic -- a former SpaceX and Virgin Galactic (NYSE: SPCE) engineer -- selected to embody a hypothetical future in which rocket launches are as common in the night sky as fireflies.\nIndeed, Firefly Aerospace has gone all-in on making launches more frequent and more accessible. It developed the Alpha rocket, a smaller, lighter rocket manufactured from carbon fiber composites that launched a satellite into orbit with just 24 hours' notice in 2023. While the Alpha is certainly lighter (and thus, less expensive to launch) than most other commercial rockets, the roughly one-ton payload capacity is somewhat restrictive: Firefly's Blue Ghost lunar lander, for example, was too heavy for the Alpha rocket and had to be launched using a SpaceX Falcon 9.\nFirefly is also working on the Elytra orbital vehicle and lunar imaging service Ocula. The company has nine planned non-test missions through 2029: five for NASA, one for the U.S. Space Force, and three for commercial clients, for a total current project backlog of $1.1 billion.\nWhy its stock might take off...\nWith more companies (and people) heading to space, demand for cheaper spaceflight is likely to skyrocket (no pun intended). As a company offering a more affordable rocket that has already had successful launches, Firefly is well ahead of many would-be competitors.\nAdditionally, Firefly is receiving investment and support from industry heavyweights including Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and L3Harris (NYSE: LHX). In May, Firefly received a $50 million investment from Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC). Being in the good graces of such major aerospace players is a big advantage for the start-up, both financially and reputationally.\nToday's commercial space industry is a fairly crowded place, with companies big and small jockeying for limited funds and contracts. However, early success tends to encourage investment, which fuels future success. Firefly seems to have all the right ingredients, including an active contract pipeline, major industry partnerships, and a few successful early missions. If it can keep it up, it could be the next SpaceX...or maybe an even bigger success story.\n...and why it might not\nFor an 11-year-old company, Firefly has had a checkered past, which includes IP issues, a 2017 bankruptcy, government intervention over national security concerns, and an abrupt July 2024 CEO departure (current CEO Jason Kim took the helm in October 2024). Meanwhile, private equity firm AE Industrial Partners controls the company with a 40.9% stake; the firm's employees currently hold five of Firefly's nine board seats. As the IPO prospectus notes, \"AE Industrial Partners controls us, and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.\"\nThat's...a lot, and we haven't even gotten to the company's financials.\nBecause it's an IPO, we don't even have a full quarterly financial report from Firefly yet. But its IPO prospectus shows a net loss of about $125 million in the first half of 2025, along with negative free cash flow of about $97.5 million, with just $205.3 million in cash on its balance sheet and $173.6 million in debt. Not a pretty picture.\nNow, it's not unusual for new start-ups to have high net losses and negative free cash flow, but given the lack of context and details, it's worth asking: Does this business deserve a $6.3 billion valuation? How about $8.4 billion, which the company briefly hit on its first day of public trading Thursday?\nTo me, that seems pretty expensive for an unproven business with opaque financials in a competitive, high-risk industry that's controlled by a venture capital firm and led by a brand new CEO. Before I'd buy shares, I'd want to at least see a few quarterly reports to get a clearer picture of how the company operates. It would still be a risky bet, but right now it feels too risky to buy.\nShould you buy stock in Firefly Aerospace right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Firefly Aerospace, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Firefly Aerospace wasn’t one of them.

The oil and gas giant's low-cost operations enable it to produce significant free cash flow. This allows it to invest in growing its operations, return cash to investors through dividends and buybacks, and maintain its fortress-like financial profile.\nThe company's already robust cash flow will become even larger in the coming years. A combination of growth initiatives and cost savings is now on track to add $7 billion to its annual free cash flow total by 2029. That will give the oil stock even more money to return to shareholders.\nDrilling down into ConocoPhillips' second-quarter results\nConocoPhillips' ability to print cash was on full display during the second quarter. The company generated $4.7 billion in cash from operations, despite a 19% decline in the average price it realized per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) sold during the period compared to the second quarter of last year. It was able to partially mute the impact of lower commodity prices by significantly increasing its production. Its output averaged nearly 2.4 million BOE per day in the quarter, 446,000 BOE per day higher than the year-ago period. ConocoPhillips benefited from its acquisition of Marathon Oil, as well as a 3% increase in output from its legacy operations.\nThe oil giant used that cash to fund $3.3 billion of capital expenditures and investments to maintain and grow its output. It also paid $1 billion in dividends, repurchased $1.2 billion of shares, and retired $200 million of debt at maturity. That brought its year-to-date total to $2.7 billion in share repurchases, $2 billion in dividend payments, and $700 million in debt reduction.\nThe company ended the quarter with $5.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and $1.1 billion in long-term investments, backing its fortress A-rated balance sheet. It padded its cash position by closing the sale of $700 million of non-core assets during the quarter and $1.3 billion through the first half of this year. ConocoPhillips has recently agreed to sell an additional $1.3 billion of non-core assets, which should close early in the fourth quarter. As a result, it has exceeded its target of selling $2 billion of assets following its acquisition of Marathon.\nThe upcoming free-cash-flow growth wave\nConocoPhillips expects to generate significantly more free cash flow in the future. In the near term, the company expects higher cash distributions from its APLNG investment, tax benefits from the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" and lower capital spending to boost its free cash flow in the second half of the year. That assumes oil prices remain near their current level in the $60 to $70 a barrel range.\nThe company also continues to expect to get a boost from its acquisition of Marathon Oil. It's on track to achieve its target of hitting $1 billion in cost savings from synergies by the end of this year, double its initial target of $500 million. Additionally, the company now expects to deliver another $1 billion in cost and margin enhancements by the end of next year.\nMeanwhile, ConocoPhillips continues to anticipate its long-cycle investments in liquified natural gas (LNG) and Alaska will fuel a $6 billion uplift in its free cash flow through 2029. The company has investments in three LNG projects (Port Arthur LNG in the U.S. and Qatar's North Field East and North Field South) that should come online over the next few years. The energy company continues to secure customers for this gas. It recently signed a regasification agreement for the Dunkerque terminal in France and a sales agreement in Asia, both of which will begin in 2028. Additionally, its major Willow project in Alaska should start producing by 2029.\nOn top of all this, ConocoPhillips now plans to sell another $2.5 billion of non-core assets by the end of next year. These sales will give it additional cash to strengthen its fortress balance sheet or recycle into higher-quality assets.\nThe company's growing free cash flow and cash balance will enable it to continue returning more money to investors. ConocoPhillips aims to deliver dividend growth within the top 25% of companies in the S&P 500 in the coming years. It also aims to repurchase over $20 billion of its stock in the first three years of closing the Marathon deal.\nA cash-producing juggernaut\nConocoPhillips now expects to capture another $1 billion in cost savings from its Marathon deal. It's also on track to produce $6 billion in incremental free cash flow from its investments in LNG and Alaska. That will give the oil company a lot of money to return to shareholders in the future. Its combination of growing cash flows and rising cash returns could provide the fuel to produce strong total returns in the coming years, making it an attractive oil stock to consider for the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in ConocoPhillips right now?\nBefore you buy stock in ConocoPhillips, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and ConocoPhillips wasn’t one of them.

Reddit's (NYSE: RDDT) website doesn't feature flashy graphics or funky designs; rather, it's a set of online discussions about almost any topic imaginable.\nThis outwardly mundane presentation hides a high-potential operation that has more than proved it can deliver the goods for investors. Given that, I think the stock price growth of the dowdy-looking Reddit can trounce that of social media peers Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Snap (NYSE: SNAP) over the coming year.\nThe social media rock star of the moment\nThe excitement over Reddit across the past few days stems from its second-quarter earnings report, published Friday morning to a thunderously positive reception by the market (which sent the share price more than 21% skyward in morning trading alone).\nRevenue surged 78% higher on a year-over-year basis to $500 million, powered by all-important ad sales that rose 84% to $465 million. The bottom line according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) flipped to a well-in-the-black profit of $89 million, against a $10 million deficit in the same quarter of 2024. Free cash flow (FCF) ballooned by $84 million across that stretch to $111 million. Both headline figures blew past analyst estimates.\nAs for operational metrics, the company's count for daily active uniques (DAUq) -- users that it defines as those \"whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the Reddit website ... or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period\" -- leaped by 21% year over year to over 21 million souls. How's that for engagement?\nReddit's guidance for its current (third) quarter was similarly impressive. It's projecting $535 million to $545 million for revenue, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $185 million to $195 million. Analysts were anticipating a top line of barely over $473 million.\nThe right site at the right time\nSo, what's the secret sauce for Reddit?\nSure, management has launched several clever, growth-fueling initiatives, including dynamic product ads (DPA), rolled out in May. These spots match topics of the site's \"subreddits,\" and embed within them to serve users who are obviously or apparently looking to buy such products\/services. In the ideal case, the ads are doubly beneficial, as a shopper in need of guidance gets a tailored recommendation, and a theoretically ideal consumer is targeted by an advertiser.\nAlso in the realm of ads, Reddit is future-forward with its embrace of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for ad creation. With these, an advertiser can garner real-time information on trends in the discussion threads, plus integrate positive user comments into the ads themselves.\nBut I don't believe Reddit's big leaps are mostly due to these (admittedly impressive) technologies. Rather, I think it's more a function of what the company offers as a service. With the ability to generate meaningful discussion about almost anything and provide answers for a near-limitless variety of questions or concerns, Reddit is growing in both authority and utility.\nAs successful as Meta's Facebook and Instagram and Snap's offerings have been, they're not really venues for information swapping or edification. They're fun places to share things with friends and acquaintances. However, you would be hard-pressed to quickly access an effective informational discussion on the history of the Habsburg Empire.\nI think analysts tracking social media and big-tech stocks have cottoned on to this. They're modeling nearly 60% (!) annual growth for Reddit on the top line for full-year 2025, with a 31% boost in 2026. The collective estimate for per-share profitability is $1.86, a night-and-day improvement over a $3.33 loss in 2024. That should balloon by 61% (!!) in 2026.\nNeither revenue nor profitability are expected to surge anywhere near that high for Meta from 2025 to 2026. Analysts forecast Snap will improve its bottom line by 42% across that stretch, but with revenue growth of 11%.\nHigh performance attracts investors, of course, so Reddit's valuations are comparatively much higher than its social media cousins (a dizzying 121 forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, against Snap's under 37, and Meta's sub-29). Yet this company has clearly captured the zeitgeist and possesses the user stickiness, the resources, and the managerial acumen to keep up those massive growth rates.\nOf that trio, then, I would unhesitatingly buy Reddit stock.\nShould you buy stock in Reddit right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Reddit, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Reddit wasn’t one of them.

Should you be excited about the upcoming earnings and PLUG stock?\nAbout Plug Power Stock\nIncorporated in 1997 and headquartered in Latham, New York, Plug Power develops hydrogen fuel cell systems used primarily to replace conventional batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) and equipment powered by electricity. Plug Power has a market capitalization of $1.73 billion.\nPlug Power designs and manufactures fuel cells for applications in material handling, stationary power, and on-road vehicles. Beyond fuel cells, the company is building a comprehensive green hydrogen ecosystem, including production, storage, transportation, and refueling infrastructure. Plug Power is also investing in global expansion and innovation in electrolyzer technology to meet growing demand in the renewable energy and hydrogen markets.\nConcerns over Plug Power’s financials have not been favorable to the stock. Over the past 52 weeks, PLUG stock has declined by 27%, and so far this year, it has decreased by 29%. The stock had reached a 52-week high of $3.32 in January but is now down nearly 55% from that high.\nPlug Power still has a lofty valuation. Its price-to-sales ratio is at 2.75 times, which is stretched compared to the industry average.\nPlug Power’s Q1 Top Line Growth and Bottom Line Snags\nOn May 12, Plug Power reported its Q1 earnings for fiscal 2025. For the period, net revenue increased by 11.2% year-over-year (YOY) to $133.67 million, surpassing the $132.2 million that analysts had expected. Plug Power cited expanding electrolyzer deliveries, sustained demand in material handling, and “ongoing deployments” of its cryogenic platform as reasons for this growth.\nWhile the topline growth has been holding steady, Plug Power remains unprofitable. It reported a quarterly gross loss of $73.86 million, which reflected an improvement from the prior year’s period. Plug Power also reported a loss of $0.21 per share, marking an improvement over the $0.46 loss per share in the year-ago period but missing the consensus Wall Street analyst estimate of a loss of $0.20 per share.\nThe company has also formed some meaningful partnerships recently. In July, Plug Power signed a multi-year supply agreement with a popular industrial gas company. This secures a long-term supply of hydrogen while lowering costs and potentially improving profitability. Plug also signed a commercial agreement with Uline, a logistics firm, establishing a strategic relationship that will last through 2030.\nFor the second quarter, Plug Power expects revenue to be in the range of $140 million to $180 million. The company also expects improvements in its gross margin and working capital levels. With its newly online capacity in Louisiana, the company aims to improve margins and reduce third-party fuel costs.\nWall Street analysts are still optimistic about Plug Power’s ability to recover its losses. They expect the company’s loss per share to narrow by 58.3% YOY to $0.15 for the second quarter. For fiscal 2025, they forecast a 78% improvement to a loss per share of $0.59, then a 42.4% improvement to a loss of $0.34 in fiscal 2026.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Plug Power Stock?\nSeveral Wall Street analysts, while not entirely bullish on Plug Power, have notably raised their price targets on PLUG stock. In July, analysts at Jefferies raised the price target on shares from $0.90 to $1.60, while keeping their “Hold” rating. Analysts view the OBBB Act as a “clearing event,” although they are not entirely convinced about “the renewable names.”\nIn the same month, while expecting growth, Susquehanna analyst Biju Perincheril maintained a 'Neutral' rating on Plug Power stock. However, Perincheril also raised the price target significantly from $1 to $1.80, indicating a fresh bout of optimism.\nWall Street analysts recommend caution at the moment, giving Plug Power a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the 22 analysts rating the stock, five give it a “Strong Buy” rating, while four give it a “Strong Sell” rating. On the other hand, a majority of 13 analysts play it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $1.95 represents 29% potential upside from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Dutta did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

While around 35% of investors feel optimistic about the next six months, according to the most recent weekly survey from the American Association of Individual Investors, around 43% are pessimistic about the future.\nMany stocks and funds are still reaching new heights, but is it safe to invest right now? Here's what you need to know.\nAn unstoppable growth ETF reaching record highs\nDespite mixed feelings among investors, many funds are still surging -- including the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: VOOG). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) reached a new all-time high on Aug. 8, climbing by more than 38% since its low point in early April of this year.\nAlthough the market still faces a threat of a downturn or recession -- especially as new tariff policies begin taking effect -- this ETF is more likely than many other investments to withstand volatility while still helping you build wealth.\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF includes only stocks that are listed in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Making it into the S&P 500 is a high bar, and these stocks are among the largest and strongest in the U.S. While the index itself contains stocks from 500 companies, this ETF includes only 212 stocks with the most potential for growth.\nThat combination can make this ETF a particularly strong investment. Many stocks within the S&P 500 are industry-leading juggernauts, making them more likely to survive periods of volatility. At the same time, though, because this fund includes only those with the most growth potential, you're also more likely to see above-average returns over time.\nIn fact, over the last 10 years, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF has earned an average rate of return of 15.79% per year. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, by comparison, has earned an average return of 13.62% per year in that time.\nIs it really safe to buy now?\nNobody knows when the next downturn will begin, how long it will last, or how severe it might be. But the good news is that, with the right strategy, there's never necessarily a wrong time to invest.\nWhen stocks take a turn for the worse, your portfolio will likely lose value. But you don't technically lose any money unless you sell your investments for less than you paid for them. If you invest now, the market immediately plummets, and then you sell, you'll likely lock in significant losses.\nHowever, if you simply hold your investment until stock prices eventually recover, your portfolio should regain any value it lost -- without you losing a dime.\nFor example, say you invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF in January 2022. The S&P 500 was about to descend into a bear market that would last nearly a year, and your ETF would have plunged by nearly 33% by October. But if you simply held on to your investment, you'd have earned total returns of nearly 36% by today.\nIn another scenario, say you'd waited until mid-2024 to buy. This ETF had fully recovered from the 2022 bear market by then, setting new record highs. While it may have felt safer to invest at that point -- and stocks still had many more months of growth ahead -- you'd have earned total returns of only around 23% by today.\nTime is your best friend as an investor. If you can't hold your investments for at least five to seven years (or, ideally, a couple of decades), it can be a risky time to buy. In that case, you may be better off contributing to an emergency fund rather than investing your spare cash.\nBut if you're able to stay in the market for the foreseeable future, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF is more likely than many others not only to recover but also to go on to experience long-term growth. Time in the market is far more valuable than timing the market, no matter what the future may hold.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard Admiral Funds - Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Admiral Funds - Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Admiral Funds - Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF wasn’t one of them.

You can then use that money to pay bills, pad your savings, or even have it reinvested back into stocks.\nWhat's important when investing in income-generating investments is picking ones that you can safely rely on. Chasing high yields can lead to trouble later on if those payouts don't prove to be sustainable. In some cases, it's just bad luck where a dividend stock you've invested in ran into challenges that it couldn't get itself out of, and it had no choice but to reduce its payout.\nSome risk is unavoidable when you're investing in individual stocks. And that's why, if your goal is to generate safe recurring income, you may want to consider investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can provide you with an easy way to diversify. Two ETFs that can be ideal options in this case are the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF(NYSEMKT: SCHD) and iShares Core High Dividend ETF(NYSEMKT: HDV). They both pay above-average dividends and can be excellent investments to hang onto for years.\nSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF\nThe Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF promises investors a straightforward investing strategy that prioritizes things such as low costs, fundamental strength, and quality and safety when it comes to dividends. Those are essential items to consider when investing in dividend stocks. And at 0.06%, its expense ratio does indeed make it a low-cost fund, which makes it suitable for long-term investing; its fees won't put a big dent in your overall returns, even over several years.\nWith 103 holdings as of Aug. 5, the fund isn't overly diversified, and there are much larger ETFs. But what makes the Schwab fund ideal for income investors is its focus on quality stocks with good fundamentals. It isn't simply investing in a wide range of dividend stocks; the ETF carefully selects safe stocks, with many of them being high-yielding investments that pay more than the S&P 500 average of 1.2%.\nBig-name stocks such as Merck, Verizon Communications, and PepsiCo are among its top holdings. By focusing on such high-yielding stocks, the ETF is able to average an overall yield of around 3.9%. That's exceptional, given the diversification you're getting with the fund.\nIn the past 12 months, the ETF is down over 1% but when including its dividend, its total return is positive and above 2%. And in five years, its total returns are north of 70%.\niShares Core High Dividend ETF\nAnother solid ETF to add to your portfolio can be the iShares Core High Dividend ETF. This fund is even more selective in its portfolio as it focuses on 75 of the best high-dividend stocks.\nThere will be some overlap with the Schwab fund, but one key difference is that in the Schwab ETF, the largest holding accounted for approximately 4.3% of the portfolio's weight, whereas in the iShares Core High Dividend fund, there are multiple stocks above that threshold. The top three stocks in this ETF -- ExxonMobil (8.5%), Johnson & Johnson (6.7%), and AbbVie (5.8%) -- account for a combined 21%.\nSo you get a bit less diversification with the fund and more of a position in its largest holdings, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's just important to be aware of the stocks you have the most exposure to, to ensure that you're comfortable with them.\nThe fund's expense ratio is 0.08%, which is comparable to the other fund on this list. Its yield of 3.5% is a bit smaller, but it's still a high payout overall. The bulk of its portfolio is allocated to sectors that have a great deal of long-term stability: healthcare, energy, and consumer staples. Collectively, those sectors represent 64% of all the stocks within the ETF.\nThis year, as investors have been seeking out safe stocks, the iShares ETF has rallied 6% in value, and with its dividend, the total return is nearly 8%.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn’t one of them.

It got so bad that the board decided the best course of action was to effect a turnaround under private hands. That deal means that Walgreens won't be a publicly traded company a year from now. But that isn't the whole story, and more aggressive investors might still be interested in the stock because of a unique nuance of the take-private transaction. Here's what you need to know.\nFrom industry giant to going private\nThere are only a handful of large pharmacy retailers, and Walgreens is one of them. For many years it was a growth business, but eventually the market became saturated. Often there was a Walgreens on one corner and one of its competitors just across the street. It's not shocking that growth stalled out throughout the sector.\nWhat happened next was that Walgreens looked for other ways to keep growing its business. It tried to buy into the pharmacy benefits management business, but that didn't go as well as hoped. And then it started to build out a healthcare clinic operation, but that didn't go as well as hoped. This company, which was on track to become a Dividend King, ended up cutting and then eliminating its dividend (the elimination came after the take-private agreement came about).\nWalgreens had recently been working to right-size its business, including closing locations. However, the revamp is likely to be a large undertaking that will be difficult to effect in the public markets. Investors don't like it when companies shrink, and that's exactly what Walgreens is in the process of doing. So, in early March, it agreed to be taken private by Sycamore Partners Management for $11.45 per share. The transaction is likely to close sometime in the second half of 2025.\nWhy is Walgreens trading for more than the deal price?\nNormally in a takeover situation, the stock of the company being acquired trades for slightly less than the takeover price. That's because there is always a risk that the deal falls apart. However, Walgreens' shares are trading hands for slightly more than the takeover price, which suggests that there is something odd going on here.\nThe wrinkle is that Sycamore Partners is planning on selling Walgreens' medical clinic business. And it will give Walgreens shareholders a chit that could be worth up to $3 per share, depending on the sales price it gets for the clinic business. So investors that are paying over $11.45 per share for Walgreens right now are, essentially, buying that chit, since they are locking in a loss on the Walgreens shares.\nThere's just one problem. There is no timeline for the sale of the clinic business. And there is no guarantee on the price that Sycamore Partners will extract from the buyer. So the $3 chit could be worthless or, conversely, the length of time it takes to see any money could be very long, reducing the time value of the potential profit. There's just no way to tell what the outcome will be.\nAnd, as such, buying Walgreens today is not something that most investors should do, particularly if they are conservative by nature. More aggressive types that like special situations may like it, since the clinic business probably does have some value. But it is still a high-risk play that has a maximum upside of around 25%. That sounds like a lot, and it is, but only if the cash arrives quickly.\nWalgreens will be gone in a year, but not forgotten\nIn one year, Walgreens will no longer be a public company. But it will linger in the minds of investors because of the $3 chit tied to the sale of the medical clinic business. That said, in the long term, it seems highly likely that Walgreens will eventually go public again -- with completely different shares -- hopefully with a better industry position. However, only aggressive investors should be looking at Walgreens right now.\nShould you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn’t one of them.

The proliferation of artificial intelligence tools in web navigation have raised concern that Google, as well as companies that rely on consumers reaching them through search results, could see their business take a hit. A study by the Pew Research Center found that users who encounter an AI summary when searching are about half as likely to click on a traditional search result than those who aren't met with one. Another survey from Bain found that 80% of consumers have come to rely on these \"zero-click\" results in at least 40% of searches — reducing organic web traffic by approximately 15%-25%, Bain said. But investors may be overestimating the hit these companies will take due to this shift. \"The death of search is greatly exaggerated,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNBC. He pointed to Google-parent Alphabet 's latest quarterly figures as a sign that search remains strong. The company's second-quarter earnings and revenue, released July 23, beat analyst expectations. Its search engine business also raked in $54.2 billion in sales , while advertising revenue expanded by 10% to $71.3 billion. GOOGL 1M mountain GOOGL in past month \"Alphabet continues to defy the bears, just like this last quarter, and all of our survey data shows that search continues to be pretty robust from a query perspective,\" said Ives. \"Now, AI is clearly a near-term potential headwind for Google, but we actually believe they turn it into a talent.\" Ives believes that Google — as well as rivals such as Meta Platforms — will learn how to monetize AI search. \"Google's key KPIs (traffic, search share, & mobile DAUs) were relatively stable in July, despite rapidly growing AI adoption across several sites, including Gemini. Data suggests AI-driven usage appears incremental, with growing adoption complementing, rather than significantly altering existing search activity,\" Bank of America analyst Justin Post wrote in a Tuesday note. \"We think Street could be underestimating AI driven upside potential for Google search and YouTube monetization. That's not to say all companies will be left unscathed by the rise of AI search. The potential losers While it's hard to pinpoint just exactly how this will affect business' bottom lines, Barclays anticipates that the impairments will begin to emerge more clearly from here. \"Over time, as search referral traffic declines, companies are faced with a challenging situation whereby they can: 1) maintain profit margins while watching their top line decelerate or decline, or 2) supplement the loss of search referral traffic by spending more on customer acquisition across paid channels, which would compress margins but keep growth rates consistent,\" the bank wrote in a July note to clients. \"In general, we view that neither of these are contemplated in the current consensus estimates over the medium term.\" Barclays found that companies that rely more on web traffic from search results versus direct traffic are more likely to face a larger disruption. Direct traffic refers to instances where users directly type in a website into their URL address bar or access a website through non-search traffic channels such as social media. For instance, at just 29%, TripAdvisor has much lower direct traffic mix than Airbnb . Therefore, between the two companies TripAdvisor might be faced with a larger disadvantage. The chart below shows a website's direct traffic mix as a percentage of its total. The further right the company is, the more insulated it might be from the rising threat of AI to searches. Robert Pavlik of Dakota Wealth Management highlighted the following as stocks that could be negatively impacted by AI search: eBay , NerdWallet , Wayfair , Booking Holdings, Airbnb and Chegg . Wedbush's Ives believes that a site like Expedia Group has disproportionately more headwinds when compared to one like Booking Holdings . That's because demand trends for Expedia have weakened, while the site is much more exposed to advertising trends, he said. Still, both Pavlik and Ives remain think the impact from AI on search will not be as negative as the Street expects. Pavlik pointed out that while AI can help summarize search results, users will eventually have to click through to a site if searching for a product. \"Those general searches are probably going to be the ones that upset these companies going forward,\" he added. \"But even AI will have to direct you somewhere. ChatGPT doesn't sell you a chair for your living room, so probably will have to direct you to a site some way.\" Ives even highlighted Pinterest as a stock he's bullish on amid the shifts in search. \"Just because the newer initiatives on modernization and engagement — I think the Street is underestimating what that's going to look like,\" he said.","content_hash":"a6de8246f07336619481dac1e7efef62","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4931,"method_rank":0}

Investors looking to set themselves up with a lifetime of high-quality income will want to start with great businesses that also happen to have high yields.\nThat is exactly what Realty Income(NYSE: O) and its lofty 5.6% yield offer today. Here's what you need to know.\nStart with Realty Income's dividend\nThe S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has a miserly dividend yield of 1.2% today. The average real estate investment trust's (REIT's) yield is 3.9%. Realty Income's average yield over the past decade was roughly 4.5%. The net lease REIT's yield today is around 5.6%.\nLet's break that down. Realty Income has a high yield on an absolute level. But the yield is also attractive relative to the broader market, REITs in general, and Realty Income's own yield history. If you are looking for a high-yield stock, now is a good time to be considering Realty Income for your portfolio.\nBut a high yield isn't going to set you up for life if it isn't reliable. So it's good news that Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for three decades. Within that streak, the dividend has been increased every quarter for 110 quarters (roughly 27 years). As if that wasn't enough, the dividend is paid monthly, so it is pretty close to a paycheck replacement. That should particularly interest investors who are entering retirement.\nWhat about Realty Income's business?\nIf you're ready to buy Realty Income, don't. You still haven't heard about its business, which is the foundation that supports the dividend. As noted, it's a net lease REIT, which means that its tenants pay most of the costs associated with the single-tenant properties they occupy. Although any one property is high-risk, over a large portfolio, the risk is fairly low. Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT you can buy, with more than 15,600 properties.\nThe portfolio is highly concentrated in the retail sector (roughly 75% of rents), where properties tend to be very similar and, thus, are easy to buy, sell, and release as needed. The rest of the portfolio is split between industrial assets and unique investments in areas like agriculture, casinos, loans, and data centers.\nOn top of the property segment diversification, Realty Income also layers in geographic diversification. It invests in both North America and Europe, a region where the use of net leases is still fairly new. The company is also starting to offer management services to institutional investors.\nOverall, Realty Income has a lot of levers to pull as it seeks to continue growing its business and dividend. But it also has a rock solid financial foundation, with an investment-grade rated balance sheet. Moreover, its industry-leading $50 billion market cap means that it can more easily tap the capital markets than smaller peers. Thus, it also tends to have advantaged access to capital, which allows it to compete aggressively for properties.\nIf there is one negative to consider with Realty Income, it's that the REIT's size limits its ability to grow. Basically, it takes a lot of investment to move the needle on the top and bottom lines. So slow and steady is likely to be the name of the game here, including when it comes to dividend growth. However, given the high yield, that's probably not the end of the world.\nRealty Income is a foundational investment\nBasically, if you add Realty Income to your portfolio, you have a reliable high-yield stock on which you can layer lower-yielding, but faster-growing, investments. Indeed, companies with rapid dividend growth rates often have modest yields.

Revenue soared 9.6% year over year to $94 billion, while diluted earnings per share climbed 12.1%. These headline figures beat Wall Street estimates.\nDespite the upbeat results, Apple shares have disappointed. They're down 15% in 2025 (as of Aug. 6). And in the last 12 months, they are essentially flat. The S&P 500 index is up 22% during the same time. This trend doesn't inspire confidence among the investment community.\nThe general view is that Apple has so far fallen behind in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) race. Apple Intelligence, its AI system that's integrated with its devices and software, has launched 20 different features for users. But it hasn't exactly had that wow factor that people are accustomed to seeing from Apple.\nThere was also supposed to be an AI-powered Siri launching in late 2024. However, this more personalized voice assistant won't be introduced until sometime in 2026. Big tech peers have gone full steam ahead in the meantime, while it appears that Apple is playing catch-up.\nOn the latest earnings call, though, CEO Tim Cook gave investors a reason to be bullish. \"We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,\" he said on the Q3 2025 earnings call. Maybe he's finally starting to regard AI as a serious paradigm shift that can have huge implications for his business.\nApple is raising the amount of money it's spending on AI-related capital expenditures (capex). CFO Kevan Parekh said capex spending \"is going to grow substantially.\" In Q3, the company's capex totaled $3.5 billion. Mergers and acquisitions could be part of the plan.\nTherefore, investors shouldn't be surprised for Apple to push more aggressively into AI initiatives. This seems to be the right move from a strategic perspective. At the end of the day, it's all about Apple being able to bolster its competitive position. It's hard to say what new products or services will come next from this.\nIt's also difficult to see any meaningful effect on the company's financials. For Apple, this means being able to sell more devices and simultaneously grow the services segment. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Apple's revenue will rise 6.3% in fiscal 2025 and 4.8% in fiscal 2026.\nMaking accurate predictions is hard\nIt can be a valuable exercise for investors to understand the current situation that a business is in, as well as what the near future might hold. However, making correct predictions about the direction of a stock is almost impossible to do. There are so many variables at play.\nFor what it's worth, the consensus price target for Apple shares is $233.61, which implies 10.9% upside from today's price. That would certainly be an improvement from the last 12 months' performance. It's a gain that I wouldn't be surprised by.\nBut investors looking at Apple shouldn't make a decision based on what could happen over the next 12 months. Instead, it's worth assessing whether or not this is a business that you'd want to own for the next five years. That's the proper way to invest, with a long-term mindset.\nRight now, Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.9. That's a high valuation to pay for a company whose growth is harder to come by these days. To be fair, Apple possesses one of the world's strongest brands, its products and services are hugely in demand, and its profitability is incredible. However, I don't believe investors who own this stock will achieve market-beating returns between now and 2030, regardless of what happens in the next year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

There's also some confusion among workers about how the tax break works.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nWhat private assets in 401(k) plans mean for investors\nEducation Department launches college financial aid form\nTrump's 'big beautiful bill' slashes this tax break for high earners in 2026\nT. Cooper, a hair and makeup stylist in New York City, said that the measure is \"being perceived incorrectly\" among tipped workers she knows.\n\"A lot of people don't understand that you will still have to pay the tax on tips,\" she said.\nHow 'no tax on tips' works\nBoth Republicans and Democrats floated the \"no tax on tips\" idea during the 2024 presidential campaign.\nThe \"no tax on tips\" provision in Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" provides a deduction worth up to $25,000. This tax break, which is available even if you don't itemize deductions, reduces taxable income.\nThe deduction phases out, or gets smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000. The law is also temporary; the tax break is available from 2025 through 2028.\nHowever, \"you're still likely paying state taxes\" on tip income, and you'll owe payroll levies for Medicare and Social Security, said Ben Henry-Moreland, a certified financial planner with advisor platform Kitces.com, who analyzed the legislation.\nA lot of people don't understand that you will still have to pay the tax on tips.T. Coopera hair and makeup stylist in New York City\nDeductible tips must appear on information returns from your employer, such as Form W-2 or 1099. But the agency's reporting rules for tip income remain unclear, experts say. For example, questions remain about how employers need to report tips on Forms W-2 or 1099 to qualify for the deduction.\nCurrently, workers who make $20 or more per month in tips must report those earnings to employers, according to the IRS. Tips can include cash directly paid by customers, payouts from tip-sharing structures among employees and credit card payments.\nThe IRS is expected to clarify which occupations qualify for the tax break in early October, per the agency.\nWhat counts as 'qualified tips'\nAccording to the provision, \"qualified tips\" include cash or gratuity paid by credit card, as well as earnings from a sharing arrangement.\nBut it also says tips must be paid voluntarily by the customer. That puts automatic service charges — like mandatory gratuity charges restaurants impose on larger parties — in question, experts say.\nAdding to the reporting confusion, it's not unusual for those kinds of mandatory gratuities to mix with other tip income and simply appear as tips on tax forms, Lopez, the bartender, said of her experience.\nCustomers are tipping less\nIn some industries, tipping has decreased as consumer sentiment declines. During the second quarter of 2025, the average tip across restaurants, cafes and bars was at 14.99%, down from 15.17% the prior quarter, according to a new report by Square, a technology services company.\n\"As consumer confidence in the economy shifts and tips fall, workers are taking home less,\" Ming-Tai Huh, head of food and beverage at Square, wrote in the report.\nSome consumers are also experiencing \"tipping fatigue.\" About 41% of Americans said that \"tipping is out of control\" in 2025, up from 25% last year, according to a Bankrate report.\nSome workers say higher service costs and reduced consumer spending have contributed to these tipping trends.\nIn the hair industry, prices typically rise every year as the cost of materials, rent and services go up, said Cooper.\n\"So it's not that people have an issue with tipping,\" she said. \"The service overall has just become way more expensive.\"\nIn restaurants and bars, it's not unusual to see smaller checks these days, Lopez said, which makes your tip average decline.\nFor example, previously, a $200 tab could earn $40 in tips. But nowadays, a typical tab could be $100, she said, and \"you're only making $20 on the same guest.\"","content_hash":"94fb1006a800a7137903c9790502e8a8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4600,"method_rank":0}

While eligible items vary by state, many include categories like back-to-school shopping or supplies for disaster preparedness.\n\"Sales tax holidays are politically popular because everyone likes tax relief,\" said Katherine Loughead, a senior policy analyst and research manager with the Center for State Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation, where she has researched the topic.\nBut \"it's not as good a deal\" as policymakers and consumers expect, she said.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nTrump tariffs make investing 'tricky,' expert says\nWhat private assets in 401(k) plans mean for investors\nEd Department launches college financial aid form sooner than expected\nWhile sales tax holiday supporters claim the policy boosts economic growth, some research suggests that consumers simply shift the timing of their essential purchases, Loughead said.\n\"Wealthier taxpayers are often best positioned to benefit from a temporary exemption\" because they have the flexibility to choose when to make purchases, Miles Trinidad, a state analyst for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, wrote in a July blog post.\nHowever, some middle- to lower-income families do plan for yearly sales tax holidays, particularly for bigger purchases like back-to-school shopping, experts say.\nShelly Werger, a mother of seven in Guttenberg, Iowa, says she tracked the timing of her state's Aug. 1-2 sales tax holiday. \"Everything is just getting so expensive right now that I am doing everything I can to save money here and there,\" she said.\nHowever, in Iowa, the exemption only covers clothing and footwear under $100 and not school supplies, computers or sports equipment — \"we get a little bit of savings but not a lot,\" Werger said.\nWhich states have sales tax holidays for 2025\n\"A lot of states are offering sales tax holidays again this year,\" Loughead said. \"Some of them have gotten more generous, while others have been trimmed back.\"\nFor 2025, 19 states have held or will hold sales tax holidays, which matches the number from 2024, according to the Tax Foundation, as of July 22.\nHere's a breakdown of the dates for 2025, eligible items and price limits.\nA money-saving tool for shoppers\nAny money-saving opportunity, particularly ahead of the peak back-to-school shopping season, can be a benefit for families squeezed by higher costs.\nA survey conducted last year by ParentsTogether, a national parenting organization, found that 75% of parents said back-to-school shopping causes significant stress, and 47% reported cutting back on food to afford school supplies.\nMore recently, a report from Intuit Credit Karma found that 39% of parents said they were unable to afford back-to-school shopping this year, up from 34% in 2024. Many of them started shopping earlier than usual to prepare for tariff-related price hikes and to take advantage of sales tax holidays along with other summer sales, the report found.\n\"Families are kicking off their back-to-school shopping earlier this year and are keeping an eye out for key ways to save, including retailer sales and deals as well as events like tax-free holidays,\" said Katherine Cullen, the National Retail Federation's vice president of industry and consumer insights.\nWhile skipping the state tax could save up to 7% in some places, \"the even bigger impact is when you combine that discount with other savings strategies,\" advised Ted Rossman, Bankrate's senior industry analyst.\nFor example, \"you can combine that with a store promotion — maybe they give 30% off. You could use a rewards credit card for 5% cash back.

It's a staggering return given that the S&P 500 is up just 91% over that same period. That's still a solid return, but it pales in comparison to Bitcoin.\nBut what may be even more surprising is that a company that has simply been loading up on Bitcoins has been a far better buy than the cryptocurrency itself. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), which now goes by just \"Strategy,\" has climbed a remarkable 3,000% in five years. It hasn't been experiencing huge sales growth or become a top artificial intelligence (AI) company. Instead, it has just been accumulating Bitcoins, and its enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency has made it a red-hot stock for retail investors to buy.\nHowever, with the company already accumulating such massive gains in a short time frame, is it due for a crash or at least a correction? Or could it still be a good buy today?\nMore companies are following the same blueprint\nStrategy's remarkable returns over the years haven't gone unnoticed by other businesses. More companies are also eagerly investing in the top digital currency in the world as they try to appeal to retail investors. Social media stock Trump Media and Technology Group has recently announced it bought $2 billion in Bitcoin. The stock, largely a speculative play, is likely hoping a similar bullishness in crypto sends its valuation soaring. It's now the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Some other notable names that have accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin include Block and Tesla.\nFor Strategy, it is still far and away the leader, owning nearly 629,000 Bitcoins as of Aug. 4. The next-largest corporate position belongs to crypto mining company Mara Holdings, which has 50,000 Bitcoins. But the sheer success of Strategy's approach could entice other businesses to do the same and start accumulating significant holdings of Bitcoin as well. If the novelty of Strategy's stock wears off, that could result in less bullishness and excitement, potentially leading to more muted gains for it in the future.\nA disconnect with fundamentals could make the stock ripe for a sell-off\nLoading up on Bitcoins has enabled Strategy's valuation to grow to a market cap of $110 billion today. It's large enough to now be part of the Nasdaq 100 index, which is made up of the top non-financial stocks on the exchange. (Strategy is technically involved in providing companies with business intelligence and analytics software.) A quick look at some valuation metrics highlights just how egregiously priced the stock has become: Strategy trades at more than 200 times its revenue, and its estimated forward price-to-earnings multiple, which is based on analyst estimates, is over 1,200.","content_hash":"324c8550c30377a094b653651e65fcec","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3038,"method_rank":0}

NVIDIA does not have 'backdoors' in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them.\"\nNvidia on Tuesday similarly rejected Chinese accusations that its AI chips include a hardware function that could remotely deactivate the chips, also known as a \"kill switch.\"\nTensions between the U.S. and China on semiconductor export controls have escalated in recent weeks, even after Nvidia resumed sales of its H20 chip to China. Chinese state media has framed the H20 chip as inferior and dangerous compared to Nvidia's other chips, while the company has defended its chips.\nThe company's resumption of its H20 shipments reversed a previous ban on H20 sales that was placed in April by the Trump administration. Nvidia's H20 chips — a less-advanced semiconductor compared to its flagship H100 and B100 chips, for example — were developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market after initial export restrictions on advanced AI chips in late 2023.\nU.S. export controls on some Nvidia chips are rooted in national security concerns that Beijing could use the more advanced chips to gain an advantage broadly in AI, as well as in its military applications.\nChinese officials, meanwhile, are pushing for the U.S. to ease export controls on high-bandwidth memory chips as part of a trade deal before a possible summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has supported Trump's policies while also lobbying for export licenses for the H20 AI chip. Huang has said he wants Nvidia to ship more advanced chips to China, underscoring his outspoken stance that Nvidia's chips becoming the global standard for AI computing is ultimately better for the U.S. to retain market dominance and influence over global AI development.\nChina is among Nvidia's largest markets. Nvidia took a $4.5 billion writedown on its unsold H20 inventory in May and has warned that its topline guidance for the July quarter would have been higher by $8 billion without the chip export restrictions.\nNvidia shares were up 1% to close at $182.70 on Friday and are up 36% this year.","content_hash":"19ef2422ddae2d1e1042ca0de6a990c3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3000,"method_rank":0}

The space and defense technology company had a drop in revenue last quarter and is posting large net losses. It is working on promising new technologies in satellites, drone surveillance, and even biotechnology solutions in space.\nAs of 3:34 p.m. ET on Friday, Redwire stock was down 35.1%. Here's why the high-risk company sank this week.\nDelayed contract plans, new acquisition\nOn Aug. 6, Redwire released its earnings for the second quarter of 2025. Revenue was $61.8 million, down from $78.1 million in the same quarter a year ago. Profits were also elusive, with the company posting a net loss of $78.9 million, larger than its revenue in the quarter. While this is one of the first revenue drops for Redwire in many quarters, selling space and defense solutions to the U.S. government can sometimes be a lumpy business. Redwire said contracts were delayed to later in 2025 and into 2026 for projects such as the Golden Dome, which will have a huge budget from the United States.\nOn a positive note, Redwire was awarded over $90 million in contracts last quarter and has a pipeline of potential revenue at a staggering level of over $11 billion. As the company dives into cutting-edge technologies such as satellites and military surveillance drones, it will aim to win more and more contracts from the United States military and its allies. It is also looking into on biotech research and drug development in space with its new subsidiary, as well as working on missions to the moon and Mars.\nThe net loss figure for Redwire looks ugly, but some of that can be explained away as one-time occurrences. There were major one-time expenses in the quarter in relation to its acquisition of drone maker Edge Autonomy, as well as changes to contract estimates. Over time, most of these expenses should go away as the company completes contracts. It had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.47 in the period, meaning that the company had more orders placed than it fulfilled as its backlog ramps up.\nShould you buy or sell Redwire stock?\nInvesting in new space and defense technology companies is tough. Many remain private such as Anduril or SpaceX, while Palantir Technologies trades at a premium valuation.\nRedwire is unprofitable at the moment, but with a market cap of just $1.3 billion chasing technologies the U.S. government plans to spend tens of billions (if not hundreds of billions) on in the near future, it has a potentially bright future ahead of it. It remains a risky stock, but one investors may want to take a small position in if they want to get exposure to cutting-edge space and defense technology development.","content_hash":"1f86705716ce19d4386ab7b8d1396bbb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2913,"method_rank":0}

The report adds that officials believe the offering could raise $30 billion in such a debut, valuing the two at \"roughly $500 billion.\"\nThe two firms are operated by the federal government, which receives its profits and manages its day-to-day business through a conservatorship. The two firms were taken into government control after they faced significant losses on mortgage securities during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008.\nIn particular, the firms were heavily exposed to subprime mortgages. The government's takeover of the firms at the time helped stabilize the market. However, after 17 years under government management, officials in the White House believe that the firms have replenished their reserves and should be privatized.\nOne big incentive to doing so? A multi-billion dollar windfall for the federal government.\nRelated: Bill Ackman’s net worth in 2025: The hedge funder's wealth & income\nWhy IPO Freddie and Fannie?\nAn IPO of the two firms might read as perplexing for the unacquainted, seeing as though the two firms have traded on the OTC markets for nearly two decades despite being government-supported enterprises (GSEs). However, while the firms are run by the government, it is not a majority owner (at least, not directly.)\nInstead, as part of the 2008 agreement, the U.S. government received warrants which entitled it to acquire the vast majority of the two businesses. Aside from that, the companies maintain their current private ownership. Among their largest shareholders is Pershing Square's Bill Ackman, a vocal proponent of their privatization.\nAckman, who has owned a sizable stake in the two for over a decade, has been banking on their privatization. In January, Ackman claimed that ending that conservatorship could boost the two stocks and help the government realize billions in profits from an IPO. Since the start of the year, when Ackman began boosting his investment case, Fannie and Freddie are up 183% and 132%, respectively.\nWhat Happens After Privatization?\nThe GSEs currently serve a public mission: expanding housing access and increasing mortgage market stability. They do this by effectively guaranteeing the mortgages and lowering the risk of borrowing.\nHowever, analysts warn that if Fannie and Freddie were privatized, doing away with this guarantee and public mission could affect housing access and affordability. Fair housing advocates say that those impacts would be most dramatic for lower income Americans and minorities. However, privatization of the two firms would almost certainly lead to higher rates, as the firms focus on shareholder value.","content_hash":"d024ce7b406a9ffc42dd0984bdf1a9ec","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2906,"method_rank":0}

Chime CEO Chris Britt attributed the revenue growth on the company earnings call to \"an acceleration relative to our seasonally strong Q1, when tax refund activity [drove] higher levels of re-engaged active members, purchase volume and revenue.\"\nEven though the company's main product line involves money management through digital high-yield savings and checking accounts, Britt emphasized to investors on the company earnings call that Chime is not a bank. \"Our member deposits reside in regulated FDIC insured accounts at our partner banks,\" he said.\nChief Financial Officer Matt Newcomb asserted that the lack of brick-and-mortar locations serves as a competitive advantage for the neobank.\n\"In contrast to incumbent banks, the [digital] platform allows us to efficiently scale our services over a growing active member base without needing to make massive investments in infrastructure or people,\" he said in the earnings call.\nChime currently serves 8.7 million active members, or consumers who have initiated a money movement transaction on the platform within the last month. According to the earnings report, 67% of those consumers rely on Chime for their primary financial relationship, a term the company defines as describing a consumer \"who made 15 or more purchases using their Chime cards in the past calendar month or who had at least one qualifying direct deposit of $200 or more through Chime.\"\nA William Blair analyst report said that \"investors should build Chime positions and see the company rapidly standing up a traditional bank alternative focused on spending, savings, and short-term liquidity products. … We see Chime as the top destination for individuals making up to $100,000 seeking to switch direct deposit relationships.\"\nThe fintech's net income came out to -$923 million for the quarter, and diluted earnings per share came out to -$7.29 for the quarter. Chime gives employees a \"double-trigger\" stock option as part of their compensation plans, and those stocks vested due to the IPO. The stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes resulted in a one-time operating expense of $928 million for the company.\nChime's stock went down by 14% in trading on Friday.\nChime's successful IPO opening day in June set the stage for other fintechs considering or starting IPOs this year. The company also signaled a soft reopening of the IPO window for the U.S. market when it became the first fintech to file after the uncertainty of April's tariff announcements, particularly after Klarna delayed its IPO due to tariff-induced market volatility at the time.","content_hash":"391127e923538bc3e25b46f03de50faa","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2802,"method_rank":0}

It is a great business that is growing well right now, but the valuation is so rich it probably isn't worth buying.\nThen there are other growth stocks, like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), which is performing well, and yet the shares are still attractively priced.\nCoca-Cola is a well-known giant\nCoca-Cola isn't some unknown company; it is one of the most important beverage companies on the planet. It sells its products throughout the world, and its namesake brand is one of the best-known brands on planet Earth. It has industry-leading distribution, marketing, and research-and-development skills. And it can easily act as an industry consolidator, buying up-and-coming competitors to fill out its own brand portfolio.\nMuch like Costco, which is an industry leader in the club store space, Coca-Cola is a great company. That's highlighted by the fact that Coca-Cola's dividend has increased annually for more than six decades. That makes it a Dividend King, one of a highly elite group of companies that have proven over time they know how to survive through thick and thin.\nWhat's interesting right now is that the consumer staples sector, particularly companies in the food and beverage spaces, are kind of out of favor. There's a shift toward healthier fare, and regulators in the U.S. are getting a bit more stringent with their rules. That has Wall Street a little down on the whole sector, even with regard to companies that are performing relatively well. And Coca-Cola is, indeed, performing well.\nIn the second quarter, Coca-Cola's organic sales advanced 5%, which is more than twice the pace of PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), the No. 2 beverage maker. Moreover, Coca-Cola updated its earnings guidance, going from growth of 2% to 3% to growth of approximately 3%. That's not a huge change, but it is clear that the business is performing at the high end of the company's own expectations.\nCoca-Cola's valuation isn't outlandish\nHere's the interesting thing: While Costco's strong recent performance has left it trading with a high valuation, Coca-Cola's valuation is fairly reasonable. To put some numbers on that, Costco's price-to-sales (P\/S), price-to-earnings (P\/E), and price-to-book value (P\/B) ratios are all notably above their five-year averages. The club store retailer has a dividend yield of just 0.6%, which is way below the 1.2% of the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).","content_hash":"13158a5f1a32a8c41e23120b43985f6d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2776,"method_rank":0}

The president is still weighing all of his options.\nThe over-the-counter shares of Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) both jumped 21% on Friday following the report. They are up over 190% and 130%, respectively, year to date.\nChiefs of the country's biggest Wall Street banks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Wells Fargo (WFC), have visited Washington, D.C., in recent weeks to meet with President Trump one by one to discuss plans for Fannie and Freddie, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Freddie and Fannie, attended some of these meetings, according to the report.\nThese giants play integral roles in the US housing market by purchasing mortgages and repackaging them as securities. Both fell under government conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis when mortgage defaults soared.\nInvestors in the mortgage-backed securities offered by Fannie and Freddie rate them as lower risk compared to their private-sector equivalents, given the implicit guarantee that they have the government's backing.\nRead more: Where and how to find the lowest mortgage rates right now\nIt remains unclear whether the Trump administration plans to fully relinquish its stakes in these major institutions.\n\"I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES, and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social in late May.\nMany housing experts and critics alike worry that fully privatizing these firms will cause investors to view their mortgage obligations as more risky, creating a ripple effect across the US housing market that would raise mortgage rates for homebuyers.\nMaking such a guarantee explicit without the government's ownership would require an act of Congress. That kind of federal guarantee could even prompt mortgage rates to fall, benefiting borrowers, but \"political gridlock makes this unlikely,\" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi noted in June.","content_hash":"50ef4b20bd1f4744b6580cf36af6dab9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2771,"method_rank":0}

The contract included salary, production, staff, and stock awards, and marked the beginning of Stern's move off terrestrial radio.

That contract is set to expire later this year.\nWhile rumors have swirled about the show being canceled, SiriusXM president and chief content officer Scott Greenstein told The Hollywood Reporter in 2024 that there's no indication Stern wants to step away. \"He's been with me and the company going on two decades, and so he's pretty happy, but he's also able, like many great artists, to stop whenever he wants,\" Greenstein said. \"Nobody will ever replace them. We would never try to replace them.\"\nOn a separate 2024 earnings call, Greenstein added that he hopes Stern \"continues forever.\"\nBut if he doesn't? Stern's fallback plan involves an empire of real estate that would make most billionaires blush.

The telehealth platform is delivering huge revenue growth but is at risk of a legal battle with weight loss drugmakers. Shares of the stock are down 25% from all-time highs but are up 400% in the past five years due to the platform's fast growth.\nHere's why the stock sank this week.\nFast growth but a looming lawsuit\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Hims & Hers' revenue grew 73% year over year to over $500 million, making it one of the fastest-growing companies in the world. This was driven by 30% growth in total subscribers to Hims & Hers products and 30% growth in spend per active subscriber. The company offers telehealth services for basic pharmaceuticals such as hair loss, sexual wellness, and weight loss drugs.\nWhile the company is growing quickly and now generating a profit, Hims & Hers is facing a looming legal battle with Novo Nordisk. The innovator in weight loss drugs originally had a partnership with Hims & Hers but pulled out of the deal because of disagreements over Hims & Hers selling knockoffs of its weight loss drug formula. Hims & Hers was permitted to sell patented weight loss drugs while they were in shortage, but now that the shortage is over, it is breaking the law by selling patented drugs to customers at a discount.\nUnsurprisingly, Hims & Hers is getting sued for this practice, which is a fast-growing part of its business. Investors are worried about the future impacts of this legal battle and how it could hurt Hims & Hers' future revenue growth and profitability.\nShould you buy Hims & Hers stock?\nHims & Hers has been an incredible stock to own over the last few years, making shareholders rich. It has $2 billion in trailing revenue, up over 1,000% in the last five years. By far, it is the leading telehealth provider for drugs and medical treatments over the internet, making a ton of inroads in market share gains in the last few years.\nIf there were no legal battle looming, Hims & Hers would probably be a buy on this dip. However, we cannot ignore the potential legal ramifications and huge risk Hims & Hers management is putting on itself and shareholders by blatantly selling patented weight loss drugs on its website. This legal battle is not likely to end well. Don't buy the dip on Hims & Hers stock until its dispute with the weight loss drugmakers is resolved.","content_hash":"39094e8e994026d4be23fa1d2410be2d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2701,"method_rank":0}

Within days, three PE shops, starting with Apollo, began announcing that they'd stall recruiting until 2026. Since then, the other biggest banks have hopped on the train to roll out their own new policies for junior bankers interested in one day jumping to the buy-side.\nEvery week seems to bring a new twist, and it has undoubtedly been a whirlwind for recent grads starting their first investment banking jobs.\nIn the interest of clarifying all the disparate developments, Business Insider has compiled the policies on accepting pre-dated private equity jobs from the five largest banks — Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley — in one place.\nThe policies run the gamut. Some banks will terminate you immediately if they find out you've accepted a pre-dated job. Others won't fire you so long as you tell them you have the job lined up, but may move you to another team. They've all said that their rules are directed at preventing potential conflicts of interest — since investment banks often seek to advise the very firms young bankers can agree to work for two or three years down the road.\nUnderstanding the rules will help junior bankers navigate their careers. The stakes are high. Young bankers who lose their banking jobs, or are reassigned to a non-dealmaking job, risk losing the very private equity offers banks are now eager for them to disclose. These firms sign future candidates with the expectation that by the time they arrive at their own offices, they'll have two years of experience under their belt in M&A.\nHere's how top investment banks are defending against private equity poaching of junior bankers, in alphabetical order by name:\nBank of America\nAnalysts will be asked to disclose whether they have offers for future-dated jobs, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.

It’s getting closer every year. This reality check means it’s the time to prepare for a more stable retirement.\nTrending Now: 4 Ways Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Will Change How You Plan for Retirement\nFor You: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\nOne of the best ways to prepare isn’t just by saving more but by downsizing assets that quietly drain your wallet year after year. It may hurt to let go of things you’ve worked hard for, but it will save you money during retirement. Below are six assets every Gen X should downsize as they approach retirement.\nAlso here are four reasons Gen X feels unprepared to retire.\nHouse\nFor many Gen Xers, the home is their biggest asset. While it may hold decades of memories, a larger house often means higher costs, including property taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and repairs.\nAs you approach retirement, these ongoing expenses will eat into your savings. Downsizing to a smaller home can lower your expenses and free up cash you can use to boost your retirement savings or reduce debt.\nCheck Out: Savings Needed To Be Rich in America’s Most Popular Retirement Destinations\nVacation Home\nOwning a vacation home may seem like the best retirement goal. However, it can quickly turn into a financial burden. Between mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance and travel costs, a second home often becomes more expensive than it’s worth. Even if you’ve paid off the mortgage, ongoing maintenance and repairs can drain funds that would have covered your everyday retirement needs.\nInstead of owning, consider renting a vacation home when you want to go on a vacation. This way, you won’t be covering expenses for a property that sits empty almost all year. Additionally, you won’t be tied to one location when going on a vacation.\nExtra Vehicles\nHaving more than one car may have been practical years back when raising a family. But as kids grow and move out, you may no longer need more than one or two cars. Even if the vehicle sits in the driveway, it’s still costing you money in insurance, registration fees and maintenance.\nSelling unused cars before retirement can provide immediate cash to boost your emergency fund or cover other important expenses. In fact, couples who can share one reliable car can save thousands of dollars each year.\nBoats and RVs\nFor many Gen Xers, owning a boat or an RV is a symbol of success. But the reality is that these assets often cost more than the enjoyment they provide. Beyond the purchase price, you’ll incur recurring expenses, such as insurance, registration, gas, storage, maintenance and repairs.","content_hash":"fefbbba21db1a8268c393917df798981","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2683,"method_rank":0}

On July 31, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported earnings for the second quarter (ended June 30).\nRevenue of $167.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.68 both came in well ahead of consensus analyst estimates. However, it's important to view this fresh information in the context of Amazon's bigger picture.\nHere's what this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's latest earnings report means for long-term investors.\nSecond-quarter highlights\nI think it's appropriate to first give a brief high-level overview of the latest quarter's most important financial drivers. Revenue increased 13% year over year. The top line was bolstered by an 11% gain in the key North America segment.\nOperating income soared 31% to $19.2 billion in the quarter. CEO Andy Jassy has focused relentlessly on cost controls and operational efficiencies in recent years, so it's very encouraging to see this strategy play out in the form of rising profits.\nHowever, the stock tanked immediately following the news. The market is a forward-looking machine. And investors were not happy with management's forecast for operating income in the third quarter to be $18 billion at the midpoint. This would translate to just a 3% year-over-year gain, much slower than the recent growth Amazon has put up.\nZoom out and focus on the big picture\nEvery company's quarterly results are scrutinized by the investment community, but it's important to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Amazon's latest financial update provided some key insights for long-term investors.\nThe first takeaway is that the leadership team is intensely focused on the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. This is evident by looking at its surge in spending. Capital expenditures totaled $31.4 billion in the quarter.\nIf this pace continues, it translates to more than $125 billion on an annualized basis. These are huge moves meant to expand the company's technical infrastructure and better serve demand for AI.\nAnother takeaway is that Amazon is a well-rounded enterprise, which should make it the envy of other companies. Yes, this business is known first and foremost for how it totally disrupted the retail sector. Consequently, e-commerce remains key to its success.","content_hash":"64e023541fd72d1237cab08ca6e8a517","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2662,"method_rank":0}

However, its shares took a dip following the announcement of its second-quarter results, after earnings came in a bit light.\nThe stock now finds itself up about 30% year to date after the pullback, as of this writing.\nLet's take a closer look to see if this decline is an opportunity to buy the stock.\nData center in focus\nAMD's data center segment has been its biggest growth driver in recent quarters, but revenue rose just 14% in Q2 to $3.2 billion. The slowdown in growth largely stemmed from the company no longer being allowed to sell its MI308 graphics processing units (GPUs) in China during the quarter. This led to a year-over-year revenue decline in its artificial intelligence (AI) business. However, sales are expected to resume in the future once the U.S. government approves its export license to China.\nOutside of China, the company said it saw solid progress with its MI300 and MI325 GPUs, with increasing adoption. Seven out of 10 of the top model builders and AI companies now use its GPUs. Meanwhile, AMD claimed with the launch of its MI355 GPU that it matches or exceeds the performance of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) top B200 chip for both training and inference.\nAt the same time, AMD's central processing units (CPUs) continue to gain market share in the server space. Growth is also being driven by increasing demand for cloud and on-premises compute, and the investments being made in AI infrastructure.\nAMD's client and gaming segment, which provides CPUs for computers and GPUs for gaming devices, saw revenue surge 69% in the quarter to $3.6 billion. The company saw strong CPU share gains during the quarter and was helped by strong sell-through for AMD-powered commercial notebooks. Meanwhile, it saw strong demand for its newly launched gaming GPUs, as well as an uptick in semi-custom chip revenue.\nAMD's embedded segment, meanwhile, saw a 4% decline in revenue to $824 million. It expects sequential growth in the second half as demand improves across several key markets.\nOverall, the company's revenue climbed by 32% to $7.69 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS), however, plunged 30% to $0.48. Analysts were looking for EPS of $0.49 on sales of $7.42 billion, as compiled by LSEG. Note that its EPS was hurt by its $800 million inventory write-down related to Chinese export controls.","content_hash":"20b7f587dc335451e7f7d0ea07a54271","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2659,"method_rank":0}

The analyst consensus pointed to earnings near $1.38 per share with a top-line revenue target right in line with the reported figures.\nGoDaddy also issued third-quarter and full-year revenue guidance roughly on par with the current analyst views.

But it has seemingly shaken off those fears, and year to date, the stock is now up close to 30% (as of Aug. 4), becoming the first to reach a valuation north of $4 trillion.\nWhile its valuation is undoubtedly high, there's one thing that has the potential to send its shares up even more, and that's a strong earnings report. With Nvidia's earnings set to come out later this month, on Aug. 27, is that likely to be a catalyst that sends the chipmaker's scorching-hot stock to new heights?\nHow has Nvidia's stock typically performed after earnings?\nThe chart shows how Nvidia's stock has performed over the past few years, while also indicating when it reported earnings. There has been notable movement following earnings in both directions, but it hasn't normally been a move straight up or straight down afterward. This suggests that other factors may play much more important roles in Nvidia's stock's performance, and that strong earnings numbers may already be priced into its valuation.\nNvidia last reported earnings on May 28. At the time, the stock was trading at around $135, and it has gone on to surge since then. But in the first few days after reporting earnings, its shares didn't take off -- a clear sign that the earnings report itself wasn't likely the reason for its recent rise in value.\nInstead, the rally may be due to progress in China-U.S. trade talks, with the U.S. government recently permitting Nvidia to sell its H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China. Another catalyst is tech companies still expecting to spend more on AI in the near future, indicating that demand for Nvidia's chips isn't likely to slow down anytime soon.\nCould Nvidia's high valuation make it too difficult for the stock to rally after earnings?\nBack in April, when the U.S. government announced reciprocal tariffs, Nvidia's stock was trading at close to 30 times its trailing earnings. And that low valuation may have made it easier for it to rally since then. But by the same token, now, with the AI stock looking much more expensive and valued at a price-to-earnings multiple of over 56, that could restrict gains from here on out, even if Nvidia does demonstrate strong growth for the upcoming quarter.","content_hash":"23f4844fe9638148420254a8f74cbe7b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2629,"method_rank":0}

The following year, their parcel delivery outfit Yodel narrowly avoided collapse after it was bought by rival operator Shift.\nThe Barclay siblings – Aidan and Howard – have also recently parted with their prized super-yacht Lady Beatrice, named after their late mother – after reducing the asking price.\nCarlyle’s anticipated takeover of Very Group, which has 4.5 million UK customers, comes amid growing expectations that a loan it has made to another Barclay-controlled entity will not be repaid on time, according to a source close to the discussions.\nIt was described as one of “several triggers” for Carlyle to move in. Another is a £280m loan that it made to Very Group last year, which expires at the beginning of November. This year it has borrowed a further £83m in two tranches from the private equity house.\nCity sources believe Carlyle will seek to carve-up ownership of Very Group with IMI, the Abu Dhabi-based vehicle that ended up as a major lender to Very Group as part of a convoluted deal related to its brief ownership of the Telegraph newspaper titles. The United Arab Emirates investor is positioned to emerge from the protracted tussle with a 15pc stake in the newspaper’s parent company.\nCity sources believe the ownership change at Very Group will open the door to a long-mooted merger with arch-rival N Brown. Its smaller competitor was taken private last year by members of the Alliance family, which are the controlling shareholders.\nCarlyle’s decision to call in its debts – first reported by Sky News – is likely to spark a fierce battle between other lenders to recover their loans. Very Group’s parent company, Shop Direct Holdings Limited, has amassed a debt pile totalling £2.8bn, according to its most recently filed accounts. Owners have repeatedly sought to stave off looming repayments with new borrowings.","content_hash":"cd8b4316468b324c825f0f687e763d65","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2620,"method_rank":0}

In fact, his entire brand is built on helping people get rid of it. But when a recently divorced dad called \"The Ramsey Show\" asking if a home equity line of credit could help him pay his ex-wife her share of the house, Ramsey surprised him with a rare \"yes\" — followed quickly by a reality check.\nThe caller's situation was tight. He owed his ex-wife $150,000 for her half of the equity in their home. He had $70,000 saved but needed the rest by the end of August. His first mortgage balance was $110,000, the house was worth about $430,000 to $440,000, and his interest rate was a jaw-dropping 2.25 percent. His solution? A HELOC — short for home equity line of credit — which allows homeowners to borrow against the equity in their property and pay it back over time.\nDon’t Miss:\n\"I don't tell people to borrow money,\" Ramsey told him, \"but you're already in debt. You're in debt to your ex-wife, and we're going to change that to another kind of debt called a HELOC.\" In other words, he wasn't advising the caller to pile on more debt, just to restructure the kind he already had. \"Get her off your back,\" Ramsey said.\nThen he pivoted to the bigger question: \"Why are you keeping the house?\"\nThe caller explained that he loved the home, wanted to keep his kids in the school district, and thought stability was important for them. Ramsey didn't buy it. \"Neither one of them care,\" he said of the children, ages four-and-a-half and five months. \"You're the only one that cares... A 5-month-old does not have any feelings except food and wet diapers.\"\nCo-host George Kamel suggested a hybrid approach — take out the HELOC, list the house, and use the sale proceeds to pay it off and put the remainder toward a new place. Ramsey agreed that was worth considering, especially for one very human reason: \"Your next wife probably doesn't want to live in the house where your ex-wife used to live in the same bedroom.\"\nTrending Now:\n-\nWarren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100.\n-\n$100k in assets?

Can I contribute to my IRA while taking RMDs?\n-\nTrade Desk’s stock sees its worst drop ever, and analysts wonder if Amazon is to blame\n2) I’m self-employed. No employees and not incorporated. My income is reported on a 1099-K (basically a pass-through from the company that processes my clients’ credit-card payments). I contribute the max to my IRA every year. I will soon, in addition, derive income as an independent contractor and that income will report on a standard 1099. So I’ll have both. My key question: Can I open a SEP-IRA for the 1099 income (and possibly even the 1099-K income)? If so, can I contribute to both?\nSincerely,\nSelf-Employed Saver\nSee: I’ve been getting the wrong Social Security Disability benefit for years. How do I fix it?\nDear Self-Employed Saver,\nTo answer your first question simply — yes. Because it is an IRA, you will have to take RMD — but thanks to the Secure Act, you can continue to contribute to the account so long as you receive earned income.\nTo answer your second question simply — also yes. You can use 1099 income to fund a SEP-IRA since it is self-employment income. The same goes for your 1099-K income if it’s self-employment income, too. With this question, there’s a bit more to know, though.\nA SEP-IRA is basically just a traditional IRA for business owners, so it follows many of the same rules as the account you’ve already come to know. There are, however, a few differences. For example, the maximum you can contribute to a SEP in 2025 is the lesser of up to 25% of your total compensation, which is determined by your net earnings, or up to $70,000.\n“There is no limitation when coordinating a SEP-IRA and a traditional IRA,” said Byrke Sestok, a partner at Moneco Advisors. You can contribute to a SEP as well as to your traditional IRA, since the SEP is funded with employer contributions and the traditional IRA is made with personal contributions.\n“You can both receive employer contributions to a SEP-IRA and make regular, annual contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Employer contributions made under a SEP plan do not affect the amount you can contribute to an IRA on your own behalf,” according to the Internal Revenue Service.","content_hash":"a65c17f2b72171ee2e141ad83443f560","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2598,"method_rank":0}

Shares currently trade for about $13 a share — well below the record price of $100.25 set in early 2020.\nTwo of VF’s main problems are a heavy debt load and a “modest” revenue growth forecast, according to Simply Wall Street.

In fact, Travelzoo’s shares haven’t shown much of a growth trajectory in nearly 15 years. The internet media company fell well short of consensus earnings estimates during its most recent quarter, although it did top revenue forecasts.\nOn the bright side, the stock is cheap at about $10 a share, and Zacks recently noted that Travelzoo is “likely undervalued” right now when you factor in the company’s earnings outlook.\nRobert Half International (RHI)\nThis provider of talent solutions and business consulting services hasn’t had much to cheer about lately, at least in terms of its stock market performance. Shares are down about 43% in 2025 and currently trade near a nine-year low.\nRobert Half’s stock took another hit last week after the company reported mixed second-quarter results that beat revenue estimates but included a weaker-than-expected Q3 earnings outlook. Even so, RHI is solidly profitable and trades at 4.7% below its fair value, according to Simply Wall Street.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE)\nHP is another company rated as “likely undervalued” by Zacks, which has a “Buy” rating on the stock and gives it an “A” value grade due to the strength of its P\/E ratio and earnings outlook.","content_hash":"a928241ed8b0ebac812fabffa2b10363","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2588,"method_rank":0}

But for now, analysts say gold’s legacy as a crisis hedge is prevailing.\n“Gold has certainly benefited from safe-haven flows more so than cryptocurrencies like bitcoin” this year, said Rob Haworth, senior investment-strategy director at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. He noted in a phone interview that bitcoin still tends to move in lockstep with risk assets, limiting its appeal during times of uncertainty.\nIn particular, gold has seen strong support from global central-bank purchases, which have accelerated in response to geopolitical tensions, tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainties this year, according to Konstantin Anissimov, chief executive at Currency.com.\n“I think the overall theme is uncertainty. And when there is uncertainty, sovereigns flee to what they know best — an asset that has weathered the storms of millennia rather than just decades or centuries,” Anissimov said in a phone interview.\nIn contrast with gold, no major government has adopted bitcoin as a reserve asset, though Anissimov sees strong long-term potential for it to serve as a store of value. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to establish a federal bitcoin reserve, though few details have emerged since. Anissimov also noted that corporations have been increasingly adding the cryptocurrency to their treasuries.","content_hash":"4f53530d7580aef64e397c2ecb22f372","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2580,"method_rank":0}

The latter are appointed by the Treasurer of the day with input from the RBA.\nMarkets have little to no idea what the views of these six are, and that is unlikely to change as there are only vague plans for each to make one public appearance a year.","content_hash":"df148e5a3dc810b6699929cd500b0113","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2551,"method_rank":0}

The latest model will be the first Polestar car made in Europe, and the facility will be able to produce 250,000 units per year when it opens.\nThe move comes in the wake of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which will heavily impact companies that outsource manufacturing to China. Volvo has chosen the Slovakia plant for EV production to sidestep this issue and continue sales to the crucial U.S. market.\nVolvo's premium EV spinoff marked the start of 2025 with an exciting finish to the first quarter, which saw a 76% sales increase year over year. Polestar has struggled to gain ground in the EV market, though a recent strategic reset for the brand and shifting interest for buyers has played to its advantage.\nBy taking advantage of new momentum with this manufacturing shift, Polestar is jockeying for a favored position among American drivers looking to switch to an EV. More potential buyers are moving toward this option for cost reasons, namely the savings on routine maintenance and fuel.\nMany also see EVs as the most environmentally friendly option because of the lack of tailpipe pollution. While there are concerns about lithium battery production, as well as the pollution created through charging these cars, the Department of Energy notes that EVs produce six times less carbon pollution annually than gas-powered counterparts.\nCombined with other clean energy measures — like home solar panels to charge an EV — owners can limit energy consumption while saving money over time. EnergySage makes the solar installation process easy, allowing potential buyers to compare quotes from local installers — and even save up to $10,000 on the investment.\nWhile the latest Polestar model won't be available stateside until at least 2028, potential EV buyers can expect the car to feature Volvo's next-generation software-defined vehicle platform,\ncell-to-body battery packs, and more of the Swedish brand's most cutting-edge features.\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.","content_hash":"87b156ac5d5e0ab733e1582f4f4e53eb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2515,"method_rank":0}

Seabed mining capabilities could be crucial to helping to improve the United States' ability to source rare earth minerals domestically. Along those lines, the recent pullback for TMC stock has actually been driven by signs suggesting that the Trump administration could reach a trade agreement with China that secures future access to Chinese minerals.\nWith a market capitalization of roughly $1.9 billion, TMC is still a relatively small company. Its stock is also a highly speculative investment play. While the company's shares come with a very high level of investment risk, I think there's actually a very good chance that its valuation will bound well above current levels. Whether or not the company's stock can deliver 5x returns over the next five years remains to be seen, but geopolitical dynamics and the importance of rare earth mineral sourcing suggest the potential is there even if that outcome is far from a safe bet.","content_hash":"6cb293480e12760efd6a97fd64585822","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2504,"method_rank":0}

Some of the headwinds hanging over the market, he said, are how the Federal Reserve will handle short-term interest rates in September and President Donald Trump's tariffs. \"The idea of concentration risk of only a handful of stocks [that] are making all of the money and seeing all of the flow is not unique — we've seen this movie before,\" Savage told CNBC Pro in an interview. \"It usually gets taken out in a rotation trade. Are we due for a rotation trade? Sure, but it needs a catalyst, and that catalyst usually comes from the cycle changing.\" \"It's really easy for us to pontificate on potential great story policies, but they're [only] narratives and the current environment is impeding clear investment goals,\" he added. With the market setting itself up for a pullback of maybe 5% in the near-term, Savage said he prefers commodities as opposed to equities. When looking for equities, he said he largely favors companies offering high cash flow. The concern, Savage said, is that there's little sign that the current makeup of the market is headed for a cycle change. For that to happen, there needs to be more clarity as to how the Federal Reserve will handle short-term interest rates, as well as how Trump's tariffs will affect the economy. For example, Savage said that the economy likely won't feel the full effects of the tariffs until October or November, two or three months from now. \"It's really hard for anyone to argue with me about growth or value when return on investment is a fundamental part of the math equation,\" Savage said. \"So even if the Fed does cut 50 basis points [half a percentage point], as everyone expects, it might not be sufficient to make that equation work.\" \"Welcome to my world of uncertainty,\" he added.","content_hash":"580772ae1806e7e10eef97e1e1910740","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2492,"method_rank":0}

Despite modest rebounds, the design software firm’s stock has given back much of the increase that briefly mesmerized Wall Street.\nFigma’s 250% first-day pop was the largest in at least three decades for a US-listed company that raised more than $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. After further gains last week that lifted the stock to more than quadruple the price IPO buyers paid, Figma is now trading at around $80, down from a peak of $142.92 on Aug. 1.\n“Figma was a testimony to the speculative nature of this market, abetted by some of the peculiarities of the IPO process,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Folks will probably lose interest and move onto the next situation if the stock persists below its opening print, even with the stock still up more than double over its IPO price.”\nPart of the raucous debut can be credited to a tiny pool of available shares to trade — just 7% of the outstanding stock is in the public domain — meaning it was partly a product of an imbalance in demand and supply.\nWhile recent debutants like Circle Internet Group Inc. have seen eye-popping returns, the drop off in trading volume and chatter on social media platforms that cater to individual investors show the group moved on after a few days as activity stalled. Recent IPOs including CoreWeave Inc. and Circle have more than tripled from their IPO prices, though both have wiped out more than 30% of their value from closing highs.\nFigma’s market value currently stands at roughly $39 billion, down from a closing peak of almost $60 billion. However, the current price is still well above the range investors had been pitched in meetings before the IPO. The stock now trades at a price-to-sales ratio of roughly 37, vastly outstripping comparable firms like Adobe Inc., which attempted to buy Figma in 2023 and trades at a less than six times sales.","content_hash":"cf0f2ddfdd111cae59c5352da9022c9e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2485,"method_rank":0}

It will be an auction process which would get to a clear end goal much quicker [than an IPO] and we can pay the debt off,” he told the Financial Times.\n“The shareholders are still thinking about the options. Other options would be trying to sell the US in its entirety. And I think that should be an option we should do”.\nNew ventures\nMr Issa stepped down as co-chief executive of EG last year and is now a non-executive board member, focusing on his new venture EG On the Move after buying EG’s last forecourts in the UK.\nEG Group was earlier this year exploring plans to sell off some European assets in countries like France and Germany to offload debt ahead of a stock market listing.\nThe Blackburn-born brothers founded Euro Garages, or EG, in 2001, after acquiring a single petrol station and proceeding to buy up forecourt sites from oil giants like Esso.\nIn 2016, they partnered with TDR Capital and merged Euro Garages with its European Forecourt Retail Group, turning it into EG Group. The rapid expansion was fuelled by borrowing, with the return of higher interest rates forcing the group to sell off parts to bring down debt.\nIn an ill-fated venture, the Issa brothers bought supermarket chain Asda in an £6.8bn acquisition with TDR in 2021. Zuber has since sold his 22.5pc Asda stake to TDR, giving them majority control.\nEG Group employs nearly 40,000 people across more than 5,500 sites, serving close to 1bn customers a year. Among its operations in nine countries, the US generates the most revenue.\nEG Group and TDR Capital declined to comment.","content_hash":"93a96d8167f075b6815989b420f5817b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2443,"method_rank":0}

The company also declared a quarterly dividend, authorized a significant share repurchase program, and completed a lease renewal in Ghana. Despite a decline in gold production, these developments likely bolstered investor confidence, contributing to the company's 36% share price increase over the last quarter. This upward movement aligns broadly with the market's positive trend, which included record highs in the Nasdaq and increased overall investor optimism amidst additional stock buyback activity and dividends within the sector.\nEvery company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Newmont you should know about.\nWith Newmont's latest results showing a boost in sales and net income, the company's operational and strategic developments could reinforce its current narrative of resilience, focusing on gold demand and asset synergies. However, despite a recent uptick in its share price—36% this past quarter—the stock has achieved a total shareholder return of 63.75% over the past three years. This long-term performance reflects a complex mix of operational efficiency and market conditions, aligning with the company's efforts to maintain stability amidst fluctuating gold production rates.\nOver the last year, Newmont's performance has outpaced the broader US Metals and Mining industry, which returned 24.1%. This indicates a strong relative positioning, likely aided by the company's proactive engagement in shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchase programs. As for revenue and earnings forecasts, the recent lease renewal in Ghana and other long-term initiatives might offer sustained revenue support, though the decline in gold production introduces a risk to achieving the expected 1.6% annual revenue growth over the next three years.\nCurrently trading at US$68.98, Newmont's share price aligns closely with the consensus price target of US$70.36, suggesting the market views the stock as fairly priced given current conditions. The modest price differential indicates skepticism about substantial immediate upside but acknowledges the potential for incremental value in alignment with forecasted earnings of US$6.3 billion by 2028. As such, the current developments signal a stable, though cautious, investor sentiment focused on sustainable growth.","content_hash":"137a682bc24c75cf0eaf03d886e60a99","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2442,"method_rank":0}

The firm’s shares are up by 16% after the firm’s latest earnings, and Cramer was nothing but full of praise for the firm’s CEO, Alex Karp:\n“And, Alex Karp, congratulations again for getting the stock up. What a guy. What a sweetheart. That’s a word that’s not used by anyone in the world, remember pistol competition he does.”\nPreviously, Cramer discussed Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR)’s earnings. Here is what he said:\n“Palantir Technology reported a spectacular quarter after the close, much better than expected revenue, up 48% year-over-year, 2 cent earnings beat off a 14 cent basis, management raising their full year forecast dramatically. Company’s Rule of 40 score, which combines the revenue growth rate with the adjusted operating margin, came in at 94 for the quarter. I’ve never seen anything like it, so no wonder this already red-hot stock could surge in after-hours trading.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
