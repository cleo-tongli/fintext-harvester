Emily Flippen: Earnings from four companies that have the market beat by triple digits. But are they still growing fast enough for investors? Find out today on Motley Fool Money.
I'm Emily Flippen, and today I'm joined by analysts Sanmeet Deo and Jason Hall to talk about capital compounders. They're businesses that have reinvested for growth so rapidly that earnings and their market values have just snowballed over time. We have earnings out from two of these new school compounders that we'll discuss. But first, let's talk about some of the old school compounders that reported last night, both of which that have been defying that overvalued label for years. A quintessential element of being a Rule Breaker investment is being called overvalued. Sanmeet, let's start with Axon. Axon Enterprises just posted its 29% revenue growth with over $1.2 billion in annualized recurring revenue. They have contracted bookings growth of 43% year over year. Management also once again raised guidance. Now, when I rewind to August 2020, I find a Seeking Alpha article that claimed despite the strong unit economics of Axon, the stock was too expensive at around $80 a share and that its intrinsic value is closer to 74 ""at best"". Today, Axon after earnings trades for over $800 a share. What are your takeaways here?
Sanmeet Deo: This stock over a five-year period has grown 704%. That is really because of a consistent, strong execution and a powerful business model that's almost like a razor blade model where they're selling hardware and offering high-margin subscription, Cloud software, to complement that hardware. They have just continued to consistently over really that whole five-year period generate double-digit revenue growth, and this quarter was no different. They beat and raised on earnings and revenues, continued strong revenue growth, software services, providing that high margin growth. It's almost like, when is this company not going to perform? That's the worry. Really only concern of this company right now is its valuation, and that it's stretched. But with numbers like these, that valuation is justified for a growth company.
Emily Flippen: It's so funny to go back and find articles that compare a mere six dollars in price difference, that at the time when that article was written, $80 versus $74 probably felt like a lot. When you look at it where it is today, it's almost like splitting hairs. But I do have to ask, this is the definition of what it means to be a compounder, and a quintessential definition of a rule-breaking stock is that they always somehow look overvalued, but in order to compound, you just continue to grow and grow much faster than the market expects. In your opinion, does Axon have what it takes to continue to compound, or is this truly overvalued? Because there are moments where stocks truly are overvalued for the growth that they put forward.
Sanmeet Deo: Well, really, it's overvalued, and it's still a great investment compounding because growth are like muscles, they always need fuel. Growth is always needed with fuel. Axon has proven that their products and services right now are growing. There will be a limit to that. But growth investor is always looking for what's that next leg of growth? What is that other opportunity that can cause this company to continue to grow and continue to justify that premium valuation? Axon has international markets that can continue to grow in. It's looking to also possibly get into more of the federal enforcement agencies. That's a little tougher nut to crack, but that's something they're doing. Like we all hear from most other companies, AI. One cool thing that they're using with AI is their AI-powered software. They collect a lot of data from their body cameras and their hardwares. Gathering all that data and something as simple as just making paperwork easier for officers, that in itself could be a huge leg of growth. You think it's just paperwork. Paperwork takes a lot of time and takes a lot of effort away from doing the actual work that officers need to do is being out there in the field. Things like that, and then now they bought a drone company called Skydio, working to do something called drone as a first responder, where they can send out drones to monitor what's happening in the real world, and maybe triaging whether the officer can really go in there. Lots of great opportunities, but they got to execute to justify their valuation.
Emily Flippen: Another business that has to execute to arguably justify its valuation, although it's looking arguably a little bit cheaper today, is Mercado Libre. Now, in their quarter, they just topped 90 million unique active buyers, 68 million fintech users with an FX-neutral top-line growth of over 50%. Now, I rewind even further with Mercado Libre back to 2014. There's a Forbes article. They asserted that Mercado Libre was significantly overvalued at $87 a share. Since that valuation implied a 17% compounded annual growth in operating profit for the next decade, certainly a high bar. But I tell you what? It's been a decade, Jason. Mercado Libre, posted net operating profit, Kaeger, of over 40% for the past 10 years. At share price now sitting at just under $2,300 a share, what did you make of this report?
Jason Hall: It's exactly what you talked about when you and Sanmeet were talking about Axon. Two things can be true at the same time. They might seem diametrically opposing, where a stock can be overpriced. But the growth stories that can drive the results in it still a winning stock can still be there. The key with Axon is the growth opportunity has to be very large, and the company has to be led by people who can execute on a vision that many others just really don't see. In the case of Mercado Libre, you go back a decade ago, and this was just a company trying to build e-commerce in Latin America. What it's actually done is build the financial tools for buyers. This past quarter, we saw the dual flywheels of the e-commerce business, and payments continue to drive that growth. Since Mercado Libre operates in about a dozen and a half countries with different currencies, doesn't really move a lot of money around across those borders. The numbers that I'm talking about, they are currency neutral. Gross merchandise volume, that's the sum of all the transactions on the e-commerce platform. It was up 37% in the quarter. Here's the big one. Total payment volume, this is the value of all the transactions on its fintech platform, were up 61%. Here's a giant number. Total payment volume, almost $65 billion versus $15.3 billion in gross merchandise volume. That's a ton of money that's flowing through Mercado Libre that's going to other merchants and going to other payments, and it's a massive amount of valuable data. Now, let's look at the bottom line a little bit. Because of all the currency adjustments, Mercado Libre reports in US dollars, but essentially does no business in US dollars, so we really have to adjust that. Net income was down largely because of those foreign exchange adjustments. But adjusted free cash flow very strong even as it continues to spend a lot of money to build out its technology infrastructure and logistics infrastructure, the actual warehouse and distribution, and put a lot of capital to lending to consumers and merchants alike.
Emily Flippen: It's really hard to understate just how important that fintech business is also for the bottom line in terms of driving operating profits. But that's the optionality that comes with business like this. A decade ago, you didn't know about the fintech offerings. Same question to you, Jason. When you look out, this is an old compound. Does it have the ability to keep compounding for the next decade?
Jason Hall: Just as with Axon, which used to be called TASER International, got into the body cam business, got into the SaaS business as it started collecting all of that data, we're seeing a lot of the same thing that's driving the future for Mercado Libre because it's really that data that it's gaining through its payments business about the spending patterns and habits of its consumers and all of the data about its merchants that it's using to inform making good credit decisions. I don't think we need any new transformative businesses like Mercado Pago, but it's starting to reach into that Amazon playbook. It's building an ad business, so there's an incremental thing there. You look at those growth rates, and you think, these are crazy, they're unsustainable. Sure, they're going to come down over time. But I think we have to acknowledge how massive the market is. If we look at those 18 countries or so that it does business in, e-commerce is a fraction of total consumer spending in those countries, banking services, credit card usage, even smaller penetration than we see in developed economies. Now, here's the key, move fast and break things is great in tech, but not if you're lending money. We saw a blip on the radar last year with the credit businesses, default rates started to creep up. But what we've seen since then is that management is doing a good job so far of managing that risk. If it can keep being a good originator of debt, that's a very different operational skill set than the things that it's built its foundation on, and just ride the massive secular tailwinds of commerce and finance in Latin America, absolutely, Mercado Libre could remain a winning investment.
Emily Flippen: One thing I love about both those companies is that when you rewind time, it's really hard to find an analyst that didn't call them overhyped or expensive. Even among people who were fans of the investments, they always looked expensive, but that execution just kept compounding. It's a playbook that just seems to work time and time again. Coming up next, we'll have two new school compounders that are trying to run the same play. This is Motley Fool Money.
One of the great things about history is that while it might not repeat, it does rhyme. Reinvestors keep finding great ways to grow and analyst sometimes rightfully, sometimes regretfully, keep calling them overvalued. Let's dive into two companies that are proving the history of compounders isn't changing yet today. Both Hims & Hers and Palantir, they both reported earnings. Both still had their fair number of skeptics. But, Jason, let's start with Hims & Hers. This is a telehealth platform that's known for compounding more than just returns in terms of its popular compounded drug offerings. Their revenue growth has risen at triple digit in recent years, and the business is converting new customers left and right. But at the same time, there was a Seeking Alpha article posted last month that claimed Hims was potentially ""too late to buy"" after shares have doubled with a fair value closer to $40 per share. Based on what you're seeing in the most recent report, Jason, do you agree it's too late for investors to jump in on this bandwagon?
Jason Hall: First of all, I'll say it's a good thing that I'm talking about Hims & Hers and not Palantir, considering that I'm using options to short it, and we'd get a lot of emails about that. I'm not going to even talk about Palantir. But when you look at what's going on with Hims & Hers, I think it's less about whether it's an overpriced stock and whether its future is going to be more like Mercado Libre and less like some overhyped pass flyer that came down to Earth. What that's going to work out to is the extremely large market opportunities that are in front of it. In this case, we're talking about healthcare spending. Now, here's the thing. The core of Hims & Hers today it's really about prescribing medications and ideally, ones that it can compound in its own pharmacies, where it can earn the bulk of the profits that otherwise are shared more with pharma. Just, for example, it has about 2.4 million subscribers. Massive growth in subscribers continues year over year, quarter over quarter. Of that 2.4 million, 1.5 million are on what it calls a personalized treatment plan. That generally means that it's compounding a special dose or it's combining multiple medications into a single deliverable, like a gummy, something that's not commercially available. Now the question about this business model is, how large can it become? What percentage of the actual spend for pharmaceuticals can that actually be? Then it also ties to its incentive structure for physicians, which is heavily tied to writing a prescription. Can that remain viable? I think we've all read the reports of customers being written a prescription with less than a couple of minutes of interaction with a physician.
Up next is expansion and more vertical integration. We're seeing they're spending a ton of money to increase their lab testing capabilities and then start delivering even more personalized medical services. The bottom line here is the healthcare industry is worth trillions of dollars, and some disruption to the status quo in this extremely regulated space is probably a really good thing. But Hims & Hers having a future that looks more like Mercado Libre or Axon is going to require it to do more than just being a compounding prescription factory. It needs to become a vertically integrated healthcare business that beats those entrenched players at their own game by some degree, reinventing how that game is played, too.
Sanmeet Deo: The only thing that I'll say about Hims is it's still very early in its growth, high risk, high opportunity. It's developing a healthcare platform unlike we've probably seen, unlike we probably can even imagine. It's going to be hard. It's going to take a lot of work, but there's a lot of growth areas that it can grow into, and it's just going to take a lot of time for it to cook.
Jason Hall: Exactly. It's an execution play, not a valuation play.
Emily Flippen: That's beautifully said, and I think we spend a fair bit of time on Motley Fool Money talking about Hims, and in hindsight, it might be one of those companies that flames out. We don't talk about it a decade from now, or it could be the Mercado Libre, where a decade from now the opportunity seems so obvious that we wonder why we didn't spend more time discussing it. It's binary in that regard, but I'm really excited to see where it takes us. But Jason, as you alluded to, I'm really excited to talk about Palantir here. I'll spare you. You are obviously a bear on Palantir. Maybe we'll have to have you on at some point in the future to give us some more context behind that thought. But, Sanmeet, I want to go to you. This is a really lucrative business, but one that has all these secretive government contracts, and that has created an incredible opportunity for high rates of return on its capital, but not everyone is sold. One analyst claimed the stock is both overhyped and overpriced, given the fact that it trades at a price-to-sales ratio north of 70 times. I have to admit that does sound pretty expensive. What are you seeing here?
Sanmeet Deo: This is the most expensive stock on the market, probably, but this is a classic Rule Breaker in so many senses of the term that intuitively it just feels, and I will say here now and I've said it before on some of our other shows, I think it will be a trillion-dollar company at some point. It will hit its slide, growth will slow. It will take a correction as all Rule Breakers have. The growth that they're doing right now at such a high margin, expanding from the government to the commercial side of the business, and basically becoming the operating system of AI. Short term, it could be a great short. Long term, I think it's going to be a fantastic compound that I think we're talking about as one of the premier software companies.
Emily Flippen: Well, I can't wait to have you both on at some point in the future to have the two opinions here between the actively buying puts and the belief that Palantir could be a trillion-dollar company, too. That is what makes a market two entirely separate opinions.
Jason Hall: I think both of those could be true, though.
Emily Flippen: It's true.
Jason Hall: We're going to see.
Emily Flippen: When we get back from this break, we'll be doing tariff math in a minute. Stick with us.
Policy shifts on tariffs are in motion. As you wrap up here, let's do a little bit of tariff math. That could go a long way for investors. For starters, let's take a look at hardware plus software business, Zebra. Zebra reported earnings this morning, and management had to spell it out clearly for investors. There's a $30 million operating profit headwind, just from import tariffs alone, which reduced their EBITDA margin by nearly a full percentage point. Doesn't sound like a lot. But when you're Zebra, that's a lot of cash. In other pure hardware companies, they're expected to be impacted even more. Caterpillar saw its operating profit fall 18% this quarter, again, largely due to tariffs. Now, I know exact math is impossible here, but when you look at businesses that can mitigate the impact of tariffs that have decent pricing power, Jason and Sanmeet, I want to go quick Round Robin. Where, if anywhere, is pricing power strong enough that the cost can be passed along enough to mitigate the costs of tariffs?
Sanmeet Deo: I think that On Holdings is a great company with tons of pricing power. They have premium brands. Shoes are priced very highly, $150 and up. They have very high, 50% and above gross profit margin, which indicates pricing power. They're willing to raise prices, and they have just a very significant channel to do it with their direct consumers. I believe they have pretty strong pricing power.
Jason Hall: I think you pretty much are going to see it in consumer brands, largely, that's where you see it. Coca-Cola is a good example. One of the reasons that Warren Buffett has loved the company as long as he has is because their ability to raise prices, even as volumes of Coke and Diet Coke in the US have declined. They've raised prices enough to more than offset the loss of the volume. That's a good example. Even now, a company, though, who's been a loser to the market over the long-term. Pricing power is still no guarantee of returns. Ferrari, I think, is a primo example of a company in an industry that you don't associate pricing power. Automakers are price takers. They're heavily competitive. But when you control the market, yeah, there's plenty of hypercars out there, but there's only one Ferrari, and your motto is to provide the market with one less than it demands every year, you have pricing power.
Sanmeet Deo: What's 251,000 versus 250,000? No, big deal. There you go.
Emily Flippen: Exactly. [laughs] I was going to say Lululemon. Now, they haven't historically been able, at least since the tariffs have been in place over the course of 2025, been able to pass those prices along, but I do think they had the type of audience and consumers, as well as the pricing power to at least mitigate the majority of tariff impacts. But Sanmeet, actually, in hindsight, I agree. I think On Holdings is probably where it's at. They're expanding into apparel as well. Despite the fact that I think Lululemon looks scarily cheap right now and pretty balanced risk-reward investment, I do think on is, to your point, probably in a better position there. But I guess time will tell, both for tariffs as well as future compounders. Really looking forward to where these companies are a decade from now. Sanmeet and Jason, thank you both so much for joining.

This podcast was recorded on August 03, 2025.
Bill Bernstein: We're human beings who evolved over millions of years of biological history. The way that we react to risk or the risk that we respond to is immediate risk. It's seeing the yellow and the black flash of light in your peripheral vision or hearing the hiss of a snake or the roar of a lion, and you respond just like that. That's the way most people perceive risk in financial markets. It's the day that the market calls falls three or 4% or when there's very bad economic news. That's not risk. That's volatility. What real risk is is living under a bridge or eating cat food when you're old.
Mac Greer: That was Bill Bernstein, a financial theorist, neurologist, and author of numerous books, including the Four Pillars of Investing, the Intelligent asset allocator, and the Birth of Plenty. I'm Motley Fool producer Mac Greer. Now, Motley Fool contributor Rich Lumelleau and Motley Fool analyst Buck Hartzell recently caught up with Bernstein and talked risk reward, and financial freedom.
Buck Hartzell: Rich and I both have young adults. People that are either getting ready to graduate or graduating college and got their first job. I just had 10 of those people over at our house this weekend. One of the questions that we got asked during that conversation as we sat down is, how much do we need to save? In order to be prepared and reach one day, financial freedom. I don't like the word retirement because I think freedom is something different. You can do what you love. You don't need to retire and people aren't meant to sit around and watch TV on their couch and stuff. How much is a reasonable amount do you think that they need to save in order to reach their goals, Bill?
Bill Bernstein: Well, I've in recent years, I've changed my mind about this. I used to think that 15% was enough, which is the figure you'll see in that particular book. 15% is adequate if you have a relatively low income because what will happen when you retire is you will get a very nice replacement ratio out of your Social Security. The person who has below average income or average income is going to get probably in the realm of about 50%-60% replacement from social security. But if you're an upper and for that person, 15% is adequate. But if you're an upper income person, then Social Security may only replace 30 or 35% of your income or even less if you've got a very high income. That person should be saving at least 20% of their income.
Rich Lumelleau: Bill, you've written that investing is simple but not easy. What do you think makes it so hard for most people to follow sound investing principles?
Bill Bernstein: Well, there's a very precise analogy for that, which is losing weight. Losing weight is simple. Exercise more, eat less. It is not easy. It is also simple to say, I'm going to invest 15 or 20% of my salary every month into the financial markets. It's an easy thing to say that. But when the world looks like it's crashing down around you and maybe you're losing your job, it's not such an easy thing to do. The other analogy I like to use is, if you've ever had any flight training, it's flying in a simulator, preparing for an emergency or a crash landing in a simulator is easy. It's very non stressful. I've done it. But doing it in the real world, unfortunately, I never had to do it, I imagine it's a good deal more stressful, and the financial markets are the same way. It's one thing to have a plan in a spreadsheet or in a beautiful mathematical model. It's another thing to actually execute it in real time.
Rich Lumelleau: I guess a follow up to that is, are there misconceptions about risk that you see from your work and your writings that persist among both amateur and professional investors?
Bill Bernstein: We're human beings who evolved over millions of years of biological history. The way that we react to risk or the risk that we respond to is immediate risk. It's seeing the yellow and the black flash of light in your peripheral vision or hearing the hiss of a snake or the roar of a lion, and you respond just like that. That way most people perceive risk in financial markets. It's the day that the markets falls three or 4% or when there's very bad economic news. That's not risk. That's volatility. What real risk is is living under a bridge or eating cat food when you're old. Those are two entirely different risk. Unfortunately, people pay much more attention to the first risk, the immediate risk, what I call shallow risk than they should pay to deep risk, which is the second risk, long term risk.
Rich Lumelleau: Is there a way for investors to cultivate the discipline to do nothing during periods of market volatility. You mentioned those three and 4% down days. Obviously, three months ago, we had a 20% correction. Obviously, you were rewarded if you just stuck. Is there a way to cultivate that discipline?
Bill Bernstein: Well, like everything else in life, there's theory, and there's practice. The theory is to look at financial history and understand that once every three or four years, the markets fall by 20%, and once every 10 or 20 years, they fall by 50%. It's to have that knowledge in your knowledge, bank, so it's to know that theory, but the theory isn't enough. The practice part of it is to actually live through it yourself and see how you respond. People respond in different ways. There are people who are utterly impervious to falling markets and will happily, invest even in the worst of markets. They find it very easy to do. I find those people are very rare. I'm not one of them myself. There are other people who when the markets do poorly and the world looks like it's going to end, they panic. I've known people I've known men who risked their lives in combat and seem to execute that very well. But on the other hand, when their portfolio fell by five or 10%, they threw up. It's very odd.
Buck Hartzell: Yeah, it's funny even business owners people that run their own business and they've been through swings and upturns and downturns and COVID and all this stuff, and they can handle that fine. But then when they see their stocks go down 5 or 10% it's something that blows their mind a little bit. I'm like, Some of these people are friends. I'm like, you've run your business through all downturns and things that happen. Why does it bother you? I think it's 'cause they feel like they're in control of their business, and they're calling the shots where the movements and these stocks. I tell them, Just don't watch. This is long term investing. If the up and down bothers you, don't look at it. Go play golf. You like that.
Bill Bernstein: As I already mentioned, I like to think about things evolutionarily, and I like to think in terms of analogies as well. The analogy, I think it's appropriate here is the skunk. The skunk evolved over tens of millions of years to have a given reaction to a large predator that threatened it, which is to turn 180 degrees, lift its tail, and spray. That's very effective. But it's not effective in an environment where your major predator is a hunk of steel weighing two tons moving 60 miles an hour. That's not the appropriate response. That analogy to finance is precise.
Buck Hartzell: Now, I want to go toward a little bit diversification because four pillars was a great book that you wrote and shared a lot of great lessons for people. But one of the comments in there was, when things look the brightest, returns are typically the lowest. When things look the darkest, returns are the highest. I have a question for you today. We sit here July 22nd, 2025. Where do you think we are on the brightest to darkest continuum as far as investors today?
Bill Bernstein: A lot of clouds in the sky that I can see. People are talking about tariffs and a debt spiral and the unsustainability of the treasury market. But that's not the way people are behaving. People are behaving like everything's fine. That's a really important concept because in the financial markets, you are paid to bear risk and uncertainty. The worst things look, the lower prices have to fall in order to attract people back into the market with higher expected returns. The best fishing is done in the most troubled waters, and the time to be wary is when things look the brightest. Warren Buffett, very famously said to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. People look pretty greedy to me right now.
Buck Hartzell: Yeah, the risk trade seems to be back on right now. With most people. I'd say, also, stocks are relatively expensive. It leads me into another question, and this goes to diversification. A recent Wall Street Journal article posted that over the last decade, small CAP stocks have returned about 6.6%. That trailed large CAP stocks that returned over 13%. They trailed by about 7.3% per year. That's the widest gap that we've seen going back the whole way to 1935, as they were mentioned. That includes dividends. I just wonder, from an allocation standpoint today, where are you on small caps versus large caps? Can you just give us? Do you adjust your allocation based on how well that particular class has done or not done well the last 5 or 10 years?
Bill Bernstein: Well, my emotional, excuse me, my discipline, my intellectual discipline tells me I shouldn't do that at all. But I have to admit that my emotionality, when I see something like that tells me, yes, I should act on it. Whatever my given allocation was to small cap stocks, say, five years ago, maybe it's a little higher now. Just for that exact reason. The financial markets do have a tendency to mean revert, which is what that article by Jason Zweig talked about. Mean reversion is a relatively weak phenomenon. It's at best a 55, 45 bet. But if you bake enough 55, 45 bets over the course of your lifetime, you're going to win some, you're going to lose some, but on average, you'll come out ahead. I think that's a bet that's worth making, but don't be surprised if it doesn't work this time.
Buck Hartzell: Intellectually, you say, I stick to my guns. I've had my allocation. But also, you say, I might tilt a little bit more in that direction, given that reasoned data. Can you give for people that are listening at home, so they have an idea? What are your rough allocations, would you say in a simple form to large CAP versus small cap and say international and maybe bonds in there?
Bill Bernstein: Well, I think the typical investor is well advised to hold the market, the total stock market. If they want to tilt toward small cap stocks, they can do it with a small portion of that allocation, say, a quarter or at most a third of it. Understand that there are going to be long periods of time, like the last 20 years when you're sorry you did that. You have to be extremely patient.
Rich Lumelleau: How does geopolitical risk, and I'm going to throw tariffs into that just because it's basically we're dealing with every country in the world. How does geopolitical risk influence your long term investment strategy?
Bill Bernstein: I like to channel Ken Fisher, bless his soul, who observed that he pays close attention to the headlines because he knows that if something is above the fold, that is, it's the top of the headlines, it's an archaic term, I guess, showing my age. If something is above the fold, then it's already been impounded in the prices so he knows he can ignore it. Those are the things that fit into that category, geopolitical risk, what's the feds doing? Everybody knows about that stuff. It's impounded in the prices. That's not a new observation. I think it was almost over 100 years ago that Bernard Baruch said it's something that everyone knows isn't worth knowing.
Buck Hartzell: If it's in the paper, it's in the price is usually what I tell people.
Bill Bernstein: Exactly. That's a great way to put it.
Buck Hartzell: We tend to be bottoms up here at the fool. We get a lot of questions, particularly around the tariff noise. We can point to them and tell them, Hey, in 2016, there was a similar conversation that was going on. Here's what happened then. Most of those international stocks traded down pretty significantly once the presidential election happened in 2016, and then the year afterwards, international stocks took off, I think China was the best performing up probably over 50% in 2016 during President Trump's first year in office. We can tell them the data, but it's hard because people focus on what's in the newspaper, and I'm like, if you can just keep your goalpost focus on how the business is doing in the company and pick good businesses, you're probably better off because the noise is immense that is out there.
Bill Bernstein: If there's one data I tend to pay attention to, I do it as a negative indicator, which is you'll often hear people say, Country X Y or Z, has a great economy. It's going to take off buy its stocks. It turns out that there's an inverse correlation there. There are a lot of different reasons for that. But the poster child for that phenomenon is China. Over the past 30 years, economic growth in China has been through the roof, almost 10% real over the past 30 years every single year. Yet, over the past 30 years, Chinese stocks have been money losers. They've had terrible returns. For, again, many different reasons. That's one argument that I tend to pay attention to because it's so specious, but it usually works out the opposite direction.
Buck Hartzell: I remember when the bricks were all a big thing, and that was Brazil, Russia, India, China, and they were the emerging growth stories. Well I think over longer periods of time, those emerging market stocks tend to perform less than a developed world because like I said, everybody runs toward the growth, and then the multiples get bit up. But we even had some members that posted some ETFs because they wanted exposure to the growing middle class of China, which is a smart thing. They had huge growing middle class. But if you looked at some of the ETFs that were available for investors, most of those were investing in government run entities in China. They were state owned enterprises like banks and manufacturing and stuff like that. They were getting very little exposure to the rise of the Chinese consumer. I said, You got to be careful sometime when you just look at some of these ETFs that think they're meeting your needs. You got to understand what's in them, as well.
Bill Bernstein: There's a more general principle, epistemological principle here, which is that narratives and stories are very misleading. We're human beings. We tell each other stories. That's how we communicate. That's a really lousy way to invest. If you're buying a story, you're very liable to have your head handed to you. What you should be looking at is the data. What's the data? It's the valuation. What earnings yield are you getting? What dividend yield are you getting? That's what you should be paying attention to.
Buck Hartzell: You've talked a lot about behavioral finance and psychological tendencies. I think investors that are trained in those tend to do better, and they protect themselves from making a lot of mistakes. I want to spend a little bit of time on that. I grew up. We had one investor in my household, and that was my mother, and she was probably the best investor I've ever known because she's had the ability to buy good companies and hold them for six decades. Those are companies like Apple and Microsoft and things like that. At the end of her life, your portfolio reflected the fact that she held onto her winners. I want to just ask you a little bit about people that are just beginning. I've worked a lot with our interns this summer, as well as many summers before. I've seen a difference between men and women investors. Like I said, I grew up lifelong relationship and investing with my mother. She was very patient with her stocks. Men that I know tend not to be. They tend to want to buy and sell and trade a little bit more. I just want to know, like for people that are beginning investing, I'm talking about people that are pretty humble here and they're scared to lose money on their first investment. They're scared to take that first leap, and I tell them, if you're great, you're going to be wrong 40% of the time. Don't sweat it. It's fine. What do you tell those people that are a little scared to get started because they're going to buy that first investment, whether it's a stock or Eta and afraid it's going to go down?
Bill Bernstein: Before I answer that question, the first thing you talked about the gender difference is quite salient. Testosterone does wonderful things for muscle mass and reflex time. It does not do good things for judgment. Women tend to be better investors than men are. Now, as far as what you do with your first investment, you have to find out what person you are. I tell people who are starting out to invest relatively conservatively, so that when they hit their first bear market, they find out what their actual risk tolerance is. The first investment that a person makes, generally tell them start with a 50, 50 portfolio, and when the market goes down 50%, which is liable to happen at some point in your first 10 or 15 years of investing, then you're going to find out who you are. If you bought more or you held on, fine. You know what to do. You're either going to keep that allocation or you're going to up your equity allocation. But if it ruins your life, maybe you should be 30, 70 for the rest of your life because that may be sub optimal, but a sub optimal allocation that you can execute is better than an optimal one, a stock heavy one that you can execute.

That's how I felt about last week where the market took a huge number of stocks out and shot them, including some of ours — more on that when we get to Thursday's Monthly Meeting for Club subscribers — but the sellers could not stop Apple, the most unlikely of winners for this moment, and one that defined last week's tape. Why did Apple's glorious run unfold as it did? That 13% weekly advance, its best in more than five years, was the result of a short squeeze plain and simple, and it couldn't be contained. Going into last week, Apple had everything a short-seller wanted. It was the most likely of stocks to expect a monster rollover. But it backfired into one of the most remarkable short-squeezes I have ever seen. Let's use the Apple squeeze as a bizarre metaphor for the market itself, which, judging by the major averages, appears to be a paradise for the longs. But the averages are distorted by the positive action in a handful of stocks, Apple being the most notable. Case in point: the traditional market-cap weighed S & P 500 climbed 2.4% over the past week while a modified version of the index that assigns each company the same influence, known as the equal-weight S & P 500 , advanced merely 0.8%. Apple's move last week was just so dazzling that it obscured everything else that was happening, and most of the action that was obscured was negative. As impossible as it might seem, leading into last week, a $3 trillion company became the object of every short-seller's desire. I don't cavort with many short-sellers — I don't cavort much with any money manager, lest they know what I am working on. But the anti-Apple chatter on Wall Street ran so deep that you couldn't avoid it: Apple's stock was headed to $175. How could that be? Why was this short considered such a layup? Let's dissect. AAPL .SPX YTD mountain Apple's year-to-date stock performance versus the S & P 500. First, good short-sellers like to go after either the most white hot of companies — in the current moment, that's a name like Palantir — or companies with a stock that is already rolling over, like that of Apple. Short-sellers are betting a stock will decline in value. They borrow shares and promptly sell them back into the market, with the intention of buying them back once they've dropped in price. If that happens, they then returned the borrowed shares and profit off the difference. However, if their targeted stock goes up in price, a short-seller may decide to ""close out"" the trade and buy back shares, adding fuel to the rally. Palantir is a dangerous short bet because it's more of a sports team with a rabid fanbase than it is a company or a stock. The software provider is seen as being a pure artificial intelligence consultant, which is very important in a market that thirsts for pure AI plays. Palantir seems to have the ability to report any numbers it wants to, including numbers that give it the best ""Rule of 40"" score anyone has ever seen. Palantir has somehow convinced everyone that once it wins a contract, the client immediately starts saving — and making — money. The Palantir buyers believe it because Palantir has convinced them that it has a mysterious, even magical, AI formula. Betting against magic is real perilous to a short-seller's health, as we have learned endlessly for those who bet against this monster. Which brings me back to Apple. As much as Palantir has a modus operandi that is all in on AI, Apple has an M.O. that is regarded as AI-less to an extreme. What do we hear about Apple and AI? First, we hear how they've failed to develop anything we want or even consider generative AI. Announced to much fanfare last June, its suite of AI software tools dubbed Apple Intelligence is widely ridiculed and key features like an AI upgrade of Siri have been delayed. Second, we hear that they seem to not realize how important it is to have an AI strategy in this technological race. We also see the headlines about the company losing people who might, or might not, be working on AI, which may be the reason they seemingly have no AI strategy. In this tape, it's a must to have AI. That's obvious. We in the media cannot resist asking business leaders questions like, ""How are you using AI?"" And we ask it to any CEO, no matter how clueless they may be about AI and how little they might need AI. Because they know the AI question is coming, they are ready for it. Most of the time their answers sound rehearsed, kind of like when I delivered my lines playing Lieutenant Rooney in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" as a junior in high school. We accept their by rote answers and move on knowing that the AI box was now checked — by both of us, questioner and questionee. You can't get that box checked with Apple. Therefore, you have the start of an amazing short bet given that there is no AI answer in sight. Worse, the best way for Apple to get high-quality AI was to get paid to take someone else's AI model and incorporate it into its devices. You give Apple money, and it gives you their massive base of iPhone users and bragging rights, worth a huge amount of money. But that route may no longer be open to them because of a crucial win by the Biden-era Justice Department against Alphabet last year, one where a federal judge deemed Alphabet and its search-engine business violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, which outlaws monopolies. The lawsuit was initially filed in October 2020 during the first Trump administration. Recall that Google pays roughly $20 billion a year to Apple to make its search engine the default on Apple's devices. At one point, Apple might have been waiting for any of the generative AI-infused search engines to come along and pay them $20 billion to do the same thing to block any other comer. However, that kind of relationship may be kaput because of the Justice Department's win against Google. We are awaiting a remedy ruling from Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. That decision could come down any day now, maybe even this week. As part of that ruling, it is expected that Apple will no longer be able to receive Google's $20 billion in what is basically free money. That decision could hurt Apple's bottom line. and it will make things painfully obvious that Apple isn't going to get $20 billion from, say, Perplexity, to be Apple's AI search bot. That payment would become the object of the most obvious antitrust case in the world. Even this Justice Department would sue Apple for making that deal. So what do the short-sellers know about AI and Apple? Mainly they know that it doesn't have a strategy — in itself a great reason to short it — and second, they know it isn't going to get anyone to pay it for sending Safari users to their AI bot. I think many big short-sellers have also been betting against Apple precisely because that remedy ruling is imminent and the ruling could mean that Apple could immediately lose that $20 billion from Google. There's a lot of money to be made being short Apple when this ruling comes down. But the federal-court cavalry didn't arrive in time for last week's squeeze. The Google case has forced Apple either to develop its own AI or buy an AI company, presumably Perplexity because it is the one that seems the most unencumbered. Apple is legendarily unwilling to buy anything big. I know it because I begged them to buy Netflix several times when the putative target was worth about $25 billion to $50 billion, and Apple's management seemed determined to rule that out along with anything else that came to mind. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook did recently tell me in a call to discuss its quarterly earnings that Apple is willing to do a big acquisition. So don't take it off the table just yet. Nevertheless, the combination of not getting paid the $20 billion from Google — and perhaps paying an outrageous amount to buy Perplexity outright — is not something you want to buy the stock of Apple for. That, of course, is only one very complex reason to be short. The other one seemed even more of a layup than the lack of an AI strategy: the wrath of President Donald Trump. Apple's manufacturing approach had been all about China, which was helpful as the company courted the Chinese consumer. But that, of course, was not the only place made-in-China iPhones were destined. They were headed to the U.S. No one could match the Chinese for both quality and price. We keep hearing that the supply chain is there and the supply chain is the best there is. But when Trump returned to office in January and started going after China, Apple pivoted to ramp up iPhone production in India at global scale. Apple's key supplier Foxconn first started making iPhones in India in 2019 and some of the supply-chain issues that arose during the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to additional emphasis being placed on India as a production hub. Then came Trump 2.0, and Apple leaned even further into India as the source of its U.S.-bound iPhones. Ultimately, Apple wants to make all of the phones it is shipping to the U.S. in India, and its Chinese phones are meant to be sent to the rest of the world to minimize tariffs all the way around. What Apple didn't count on was not only that the president didn't want iPhones made in China, he also didn't want them to be made in India. Until most recently, India was thought to be a decent ally and a good, getting-to-be great place to build phones. Then it became evident that Trump didn't like that India had become somewhat of a weird ally/client state of Russia because of Russian oil, and that the president did not want any iPhones made anywhere but the U.S. He was quite vocal about his displeasure. When I interviewed Cook and asked him about his relationship with Trump after Trump had called him out for doing business in India, he said the relationship was a good one. If you were short Apple and you listened to my endless iterations on air of that proclamation of friendship, you would have thought twice about staying short. But I am sure the shorts thought it nothing but dross. It turned out the relationship was, indeed, a good one, and after Apple committed another $100 billion in U.S. investments was pledged on top of the previous $500 billion, it morphed into a great one — great enough to make Apple exempt from tariffs. It could be a double win because Samsung, with 30% of the U.S. market, will see its phones marked up by tariffs, which could make the iPhone cheaper, or at least not as expensive as it has been, versus its Korean opponent. Sure, you may not think it matters and it is awfully difficult even for the government to spend $600 billion unless the money goes to the Pentagon or the interest on the national debt. But all that matters is that Trump endorsed Apple's actions. Oh, and if you needed one more reason to be short: Apple had a very good last quarter, but it was presumed that the success of the quarter came from pull-through to beat the tariffs and it wasn't regarded as consequential. A panned upside surprise. So, let's wrap up the metaphor: Apple has no AI strategy and even if it gets one, it will have to pay through the noise for it, perhaps endlessly, as you need all the chips that fellow Club name Nvidia makes to have a winning AI offering. The shorts were hoping that the remedy phase would be done and Google would have to suspend payments to Apple. They figured Apple would have earnings cut big by the Indian tariffs. And numbers were expected to come down anyway. Sell, sell, sell. Now we know that the remedy phase ruling is still out there — and so is a potential earnings shortfall — but it looks like the shorts couldn't ride things out. Plus, the longs were attracted to a once-expensive stock that hadn't gotten this cheap in ages. I've had an own-don't-trade philosophy toward Apple for ages but even I was struck about the run from $210 a share to $220 in after-hours trading early last week when Trump blessed Apple's largesse. But that's what happens when the shorts start to panic. All of this occurred at a time that most of the market was rolling over except, weirdly, medical technology names — check out Becton Dickinson , Medtronic and our Abbott Labs — and some scattered retailers, including Club-owned TJX Companies , a heavily shorted stock for no reason other than the chart. Of course, looking back, the window to win as a short-seller is always on the verge of being closed when you're betting against companies with good management teams and great balance sheets. In the case of Apple, though, the negatives we just ran through were too juicy to ignore. It just seemed like Apple's fall was destined. It was a natural decline that had only just begun, a safe short in a lousy tape. Instead, it turned out to be the best long in a terrible tape. And that's how the Apple squeeze unfolded, taking the entire averages up with it. Sure, the averages were helped by Nvidia's strength, but that's done by longs, not shorts. Will other stocks follow Apple's lead next week? I think that given it was a squeeze, that seems unlikely. But what could have been more unlikely than Apple being at $229.35? Nothing that I have ever heard of. That's for certain. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, NVDA, ABT and TJX. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Wall Street's next test this week: Inflation data. The pair of reports measuring price pressures in the U.S. economy carries implications for the Federal Reserve's next interest rate move and likely the stock market's. It's too soon for President Donald Trump 's newest tariff rates to show up in the numbers just yet, but we'll be watching for any inflation signs from the levies already in place. The S & P 500 is coming off a positive week, its third in the past four, and sits just shy of a fresh record-closing high. The Nasdaq ended last week at a record. There are a few other economic reports on this week's schedule. Within the portfolio, it's mostly quiet on the earnings front — save for our newest holding. Here's a closer look at what we're watching for. 1. Inflation data: The consumer price index (CPI) and the wholesale inflation gauge, known as the producer price index (PPI), are slated to be released Tuesday and Thursday morning, respectively. The overarching theme for both inflation releases: What do they mean for the Fed rate policy at its upcoming September meeting and beyond? The CPI and PPI arrive after a weak July jobs report — and the accompanying downward revisions to the prior two-month totals — that caused investors to dramatically reconsider the health of the U.S. labor market. Nurturing maximum employment is one part of the Fed's dual mandate; fostering price stability is the other. Traders went from betting the Fed will keep rates steady again in September — thanks to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell throwing cold water on the idea at the Fed's July meeting — to overwhelmingly pricing in a quarter-point cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Now comes the CPI and PPI, which shine a light on the price-stability piece of the Fed's mandate and, in particular, the impact that Trump's tariffs are having on the rate of inflation. In the June CPI report, inflation picked up to 2.7% overall and 2.9%, when excluding the more volatile food and energy prices, from the May rates of 2.4% and 2.8%, respectively. Tariff-sensitive categories like furniture and apparel showed increases in the June CPI, and Wall Street will once again look closely at those areas in the July data. If inflation comes in really hot, will the market recalibrate its expectations for September once again? ""We see the biggest risk to markets in the [second half of the year] from a reacceleration in both goods and service inflation, leading the Fed to remain on hold and putting upward pressure on interest rates,"" strategists at Wolfe Research said in a note to clients Friday. Economists expect the July CPI to show a 0.2% increase on a monthly basis and a 2.8% increase annually, according to Dow Jones. Excluding food and energy, the so-called core CPI is projected to rise 0.3% month over month and 3.1% on a 12-month basis; that would be an acceleration from 0.2% and 2.9%, respectively, in June. For the PPI, which is seen as a leading indicator for the CPI because it measures what companies pay for their own inputs like steel, the consensus is for a 0.2% monthly gain after being flat in June, according to Dow Jones. On a core basis, PPI is expected up 0.3% month over month. Core PPI also was flat in June. Central bankers say the reason they haven't lowered rates yet this year is uncertainty around the inflationary impact of the tariffs. While it's good to get another month's worth of data, the CPI and PPI for July won't answer that question entirely, in part because tariff levels are still evolving, and in part because businesses that may eventually raise prices are still working through inventory accumulated before duty rates went up. However, at least for Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, he told CNBC last week that he's getting more comfortable with the idea of cutting rates without knowing the full effect of tariffs. Kashkari is an alternate member of the Fed's policymaking arm this year and a voting member in 2026, so his comments are notable. At the July meeting, two central bankers did vote for a cut. ""There's a bunch of data that I know and that I've got confidence in, and there's data that I don't know and we're not going to know for a while,"" Kashkari said Wednesday on ""Squawk Box."" ""The data that I think we know is that the economy is slowing. Housing services inflation is gently declining. Non-housing services inflation is coming down. Wage growth is coming down. We've seen the jobs number, and consumer spending cooling. All of that suggests the real underlying economy is slowing."" He continued, ""The part I don't have confidence in yet is, what are the ultimate effects of tariffs going to be on inflation? And what I'm realizing is we may not know the answer to that for quarters, or a year or more. That tells me, as one policymaker, that I need to start leaning more on the data I've got confidence in. The economy is slowing, and that means in the near term, it may become appropriate to start adjusting the federal funds rate."" 2. Other data: While the CPI and PPI are the biggest data points of the week, there are a few other releases that the market will be watching due to the heightened focus on the health of the economy post-jobs report. On Thursday morning, we'll get the weekly initial jobless claims report — a measure of both first-time unemployment insurance filings, which can be used to gauge layoff activity among employers, and so-called continuing claims, which offer insights into how easily people who lose their jobs can find a new gig. On Friday, the July retail sales report is out, courtesy of the Commerce Department, offering a look at the level of consumer spending and where people spent their money. Amazon' s Prime Day was held in July, so a measure of online spending in the report will likely be influenced by that. Also on Friday, the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment survey for the month of August will be out. After some dour readings as Trump's tariff rhetoric ramped up earlier this year, the sentiment releases have stabilized. The inflation expectations component of the survey — also closely watched — tumbled to below pre-tariff levels in July . 3. Earnings: After a busy stretch of earnings, Cisco Systems is the lone Club name to report quarterly results in the week ahead. It's the first time we'll hear from the networking and security provider since it joined the portfolio on July 17. For its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, Wall Street expects Cisco to report revenue of $14.62 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of 98 cents, according to estimates compiled by LSEG. Beyond the headline numbers, investors will be keyed into Cisco's orders and commentary around its AI products, along with its guidance for fiscal 2026. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a recent note to clients that expectations are for mid-single-digit order growth, ""which we expect will continue to drive momentum in the stock."" Last quarter, Cisco said it booked more than $600 million in AI infrastructure orders from ""webscale"" customers, its term for large data center operators often called hyperscalers, such as Club names Amazon and Microsoft . A big part of our thesis is Cisco continuing to make inroads into this lucrative market, so we'll be paying close attention to the latest order figure. As for fiscal 2026 revenue overall, Cisco's initial guidance is likely to come in conservative, ""as the environment remains dynamic,"" Morgan Stanley argued.

There’s so much wealth-building advice out there that it’s easy to feel a little overwhelmed. If you ask ChatGPT ""how to become a millionaire,"" you’re likely to get a flood of endless money hacks, conflicting advice and complex economic theory.
But you don’t need any of that to get into the seven-figure club. You can chart a course to the $1 million milestone by simply focusing on three essential numbers.
Here’s a closer look at these crucial wealth-building blocks.
Net worth
You can’t make intentional progress if you don’t know where you currently sit. That’s why the most basic number you should be tracking is your net worth.
Calculating your net worth sounds simple, but for many Americans, it’s not. About 51% say they don’t know how to do it. The numbers are even higher for women (61%) and Gen Z (64%), according to Credit Karma. That means many people have no clear picture of their financial standing.
Fortunately, you don’t need sophisticated tools or AI to track your net worth. A simple spreadsheet that lists all of your assets and liabilities and calculates the difference between the two should suffice.
But, while knowing your net worth is important, this is only the first step. Growing it is what truly counts.
One way to build long-term wealth is through real estate — an asset that can generate passive income, appreciate over time and offer powerful tax advantages. When people talk about real estate investing, they think of home ownership most of the time, meaning residential real estate.
But there are other ways to invest in real estate without committing to a mortgage or setting down roots.
You can tap into this market through First National Realty Partners (FNRP). The real estate platform allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.
With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities.
Through FNRP’s online platform, accredited investors can potentially collect quarterly cash flow through a diverse real estate portfolio and grow their net worth.
Simply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.
Another way to invest in real estate is by leveraging the $34.9 trillion home equity market, which has historically been the domain of large institutions.
Through Homeshares, accredited investors can gain direct access to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund.
The fund focuses on homes with substantial equity and uses Home Equity Agreements to help homeowners access liquidity without incurring debt or additional interest payments.
This hands-off approach lets accredited investors access high-quality residential properties with a minimum investment of $25,000 — without the headache of tenant management.
With risk-adjusted target returns ranging from 14% to 17%, the U.S. Home Equity Fund could unlock lucrative real estate opportunities, offering accredited investors a low-maintenance alternative to traditional property ownership.

Investing wisely in real estate and other assets is important, but it’s only part of the equation for hitting your magic number.

Savings Rate
If you’re trying to reach your magic number, tracking the amount of money you or your family saves every year is an essential task. If you can monitor and raise your savings rate high enough to meet your savings goal, you can make your journey to millionaire status a lot shorter.
But here’s the reality check: Most American families are falling short. As of May 2025, the personal savings rate in the U.S. was just 4.5%, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. At that rate, a family earning $100,000 annually would save only $4,500 per year — and it would take 222 years to reach $1 million in savings.
But, by contrast, if the same family raised their annual savings rate to 20%, it would take them just 50 years to get to that target.
It’s no coincidence that many millionaires — and even billionaires — are famously frugal. They understand that tracking and increasing your savings rate is one of the most effective ways to accelerate wealth creation.
To raise your savings rate, you need to keep a close eye on your expenses. One area that often flies under the radar is home and car insurance, which can quietly eat away at your monthly budget.
U.S. homeowners' insurers have hiked premium rates by double digits over the past two years. If you’re not paying attention, that could be a major hit to your saving power.
Shopping around is one of the best ways to find better rates, but calling individual providers takes time and effort that many working people just don’t have.
OfficialHomeInsurance.com can take the hassle out of shopping for home insurance. In just under 2 minutes, you can explore competitive rates from top insurance providers all in one place.
But home insurance premiums aren’t the only thing coming out of homeowners' pockets. If you own a car, you have another cost to deal with.
Car insurance rates rose an average of 16.5% in 2024, according to ValuePenguin. Like with home insurance, shopping around can lead to substantial savings.
OfficialCarInsurance.com lets you compare quotes from trusted brands — including Progressive, Allstate and GEICO — to make sure you're getting the best deal. Their matchmaking system takes into account your location, vehicle details and driving history to find the lowest rate possible for you.
The final ingredient in the wealth creation recipe is the rate of return on your savings.
Where you place your savings is just as important as how much you save. If you’re stacking $20,000 a year under a mattress, you will take decades to get to millionaire status. By the time you get there, inflation would have drastically reduced the value of a million dollars anyway. Instead, if you invest in robust growth stocks, real estate or fixed income opportunities, you could get to the seven-figure club a lot faster.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, for example, has delivered an annualized return of 14.55% since its inception in 2010. If you assume a similar return going forward and invest $1,000 a month, you could reach the $1 million target in less than 20 years.
Gold can also be a powerful asset for speeding up your journey to millionaire status. In times of economic uncertainty — whether due to trade wars, inflation or market instability — investors often turn to gold as a hedge and a safe haven.
The price of gold has jumped by about 40% since 2023. JP Morgan projects that it will hit the $4,000 mark by 2026.
Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.
To learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.
However, as with any investment, it’s crucial to have a trusted financial advisor by your side. The right advisor can help you evaluate risks, align investments with your goals and make informed decisions that support your overall financial plan.
More than 90% of wealthy Americans work with financial advisors and report high satisfaction with the guidance they receive, according to a Bank of America survey.
A trusted, pre-screened financial advisor can help you develop a solid retirement strategy and protect your wealth at any level.
With Advisor.com, you can quickly connect with a local, qualified financial advisor who can help you build a personalized investment plan based on your goals, timeline and risk tolerance.
Advisor.com offers a free, no-obligation consultation where you can discuss your financial goals and get guidance on retirement planning.
Bottom line: Know your net worth, then grow it with the right team behind you.",673dc51076f6e4c8c670cf927ba29884,trafilatura,9724,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-flip-green-energy-160031734.html,14c43e63074eacc5751de13c9cfac002,Hedge Funds Flip on Green Energy and Start Betting Against Oil,Hedge Funds Flip on Green Energy and Start Betting Against Oil,2025-08-10 17:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds are betting against oil stocks and winding back shorts on solar in a reversal of positions that dominated their energy strategies over the past four years.
Most Read from Bloomberg
Since the beginning of October and through the second quarter, equity-focused hedge funds have — on average — been mostly short oil stocks, according to a Bloomberg Green analysis of positions on companies in global indexes for sectors spanning oil, wind, solar and electric vehicles. That’s a reversal of bets that had dominated since 2021, according to the data, which are based on fund disclosures to Hazeltree, an alternative-investment data specialist.
Over the same period, funds have unwound short bets against solar stocks. The analysis, which is based on a universe of some 700 hedge funds representing about $700 billion in assets — or roughly 15% of the industry’s total under management — also shows that portfolio managers have stayed net long wind in the period.
There has been “a bottoming out with some of these clean energy plays,” said Todd Warren, portfolio manager at Tribeca Investment Partners Pty. That trend has “really occurred at the same time as we’ve seen — in the oil patch — some concerns with regards to supply and demand balance,” he said.
The analysis shows that more hedge funds were, on average, net short stocks in the S&P Global Oil Index than net long for seven of the nine months starting October 2024. By contrast, net longs exceeded net shorts in all but eight of the 45 months from January 2021 through September 2024.
The development coincides with a rise in oil supply as some OPEC+ member nations act to preserve their market share. Joe Mares, a portfolio manager at Trium Capital, a hedge fund managing about $3.5 billion, notes that ratcheting up output has “not historically been great” for the oil industry. Evidence of an economic slowdown in the US and China, combined with an expectation that global oil inventories will continue to rise through the rest of 2025, means there’s growing skepticism toward the sector.
Once investors take in “the general slowdown in everything,” the question then becomes, “who’s buying the oil?” said Kerry Goh, Singapore-based chief investment officer at Kamet Capital Partners Pte.
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Tall Trees Capital Management LP is short oil stocks because “we see much lower oil prices, especially in 2026,” said Lisa Audet, the fund’s founder and chief investment officer.
Investors may get further insight into the supply-demand balance as early as this week, with OPEC set to release its monthly market analysis. Updates are also due from the US Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency.
In the US, meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s quest to add supply in an effort to bring down the price of oil has unsettled local producers.
The Dallas Fed’s latest quarterly energy survey, published on July 2, shows negative sentiment among oil companies toward the Trump administration’s policy on the fossil fuel. One respondent in the anonymized study said the administration’s implied price target of $50 a barrel is simply unsustainable for the industry. Another spoke of the “chaos” caused by current US trade policies, adding the volatility will drive companies to “lay down rigs.”
Meanwhile, the outlook for solar and wind stocks is starting to improve.
The analysis of Hazeltree’s data shows that the average share of funds that were net short stocks in the Invesco Solar ETF dropped to 3% in June. That’s the lowest percentage since April 2021, when green equities were trading near record highs. The number of funds net long stocks in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF reached a 30-month high in February this year. Those positions fell back in June, but net longs still dominated shorts overall.
Other hedge fund managers said AI has the potential to trigger a generational swell in energy demand that is likely to give new support to renewables.
“The market is telling you that AI is the biggest thing we’ve seen in our entire careers,” said Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer of equities at London-based Selwood Asset Management LLP, which manages about $1.6 billion. To meet energy demand from AI, renewables will need to play a big part, not least “because they’re the fastest to market,” he said. Renewables are likely to meet more than half of the required additional generation capacity by 2035, BloombergNEF said in a report last month.
In China, green stocks are now enjoying a rebound after its solar industry started addressing overcapacity concerns. After losing about half its value between the end of 2021 and 2023, the Solactive Select China Green Energy Index — which includes solar giant Longi Green Energy Technology Co. — has advanced around 19% from an April low.
In the US, Trump administration attacks on green energy — including a rollback of Biden-era subsidies — have already contributed to over $22 billion of clean energy projects being canceled or delayed since January, according to an analysis from the E2 advocacy group.
Yet, for a number of fund managers, the decision to slash green subsidies helps end some of the policy uncertainty that had prevented investors from moving into wind and solar.
“At least now we know what the rules are going to be and so people can go back to evaluating these as businesses,” Mares said.
The final version of Trump’s $3.4 trillion budget bill — dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill — was actually more favorable toward some corners of the renewables market than Tall Trees Capital’s Audet expected. Utility-scale solar, for example, has emerged as a relative winner, she said.
For green investors, it’s been “less bad than expected,” said Nishant Gupta, founder and chief investment officer of Kanou Capital LLP, an energy transition-focused hedge fund. “There’s been more protection around US domestic production than expected.”
And this year’s tariff wars have coincided with a broad rebound in green stocks. Since Trump first unveiled his proposed tariffs on April 2 — dubbed Liberation Day by the White House — the main S&P index tracking clean energy stocks has added about 18%. Over the same period, the main S&P index for oil companies is down around 4%.
Much of the clean-energy rebound has been driven by solar. The Invesco Solar ETF, a widely tracked exchange-traded fund packed with solar stocks, is up more than 18% since April 2.
More hedge funds continue to be short stocks in the Kraneshares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF than long — a constant since 2021 as China has steadily displaced Western manufacturers. But the share of net shorts dropped to 2.87% in June, which is the second-lowest level in almost half a decade.
At the same time, there’s an expectation among fund managers that the continued rise in sales of EVs globally will reduce the need for petroleum. That matches BloombergNEF estimates, which anticipate a 25% annual increase in EV sales this year. BNEF also expects that about 40% of vehicles on the road could be electric by 2040, displacing 19 million barrels of oil a day by that year.
The strategy shift among funds reflects the fact that economic growth without low-carbon energy is now inconceivable, according to Trium’s Mares.
“If we are going to continue to grow both in developed and emerging economies, we’re going to need a lot of energy,” he said. “A big chunk of the marginal growth in energy over the last 10 years has come from renewables and it’s hard to see why that isn’t going to continue.”
MethodologyBloomberg Green analyzed anonymized weekly data that around 700 hedge fund managers disclosed to Hazeltree, from January 2021 through 27 June 2025. The hedge funds in the Hazeltree database vary in terms of assets under management, and the analysis is not weighted by hedge fund assets or size of position held. Collectively, AUM for the hedge funds analyzed is around $700 billion. Total assets under management in the hedge fund industry were around $4.7 trillion at the end of the second quarter 2025, according to Hedge Fund Research. Bloomberg also interviewed hedge fund managers on their oil and energy transition bets and on trends from the data analysis.
Hedge funds mostly provided their data to Hazeltree via prime brokers. There is a possibility that some positions may not be disclosed. These will not be included in Hazeltree’s data or in the Bloomberg analysis.
Hazeltree’s data reports percentages of the hedge funds that held net long positions and net short positions for a specific stock. Bloomberg’s analysis categorized roughly 230 stocks based on key ETFs or indices for a sector, and further calculated a sector-wide monthly average. In some cases, the same company could be included in different sectors. Four stocks didn’t appear in the Hazeltree data provided to Bloomberg.
ETFs and indices used in the analysis are S&P Global Oil Index, Invesco Solar ETF, First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF and KraneShares Electric Vehicles & Future Mobility Index ETF.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-president-donald-trumps-tariff-070600087.html,ead34ed6f60dd559bb274ed5db0055c1,Does President Donald Trump Tariff and Trade Policy Have America on a Collision Course With Stagflation ? ,Does President Donald Trump Tariff and Trade Policy Have America on a Collision Course With Stagflation ? ,2025-08-10 10:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Stagflation is the scariest scenario for the nation's central bank, because there's no blueprint to quickly fix a weak economy and jobs market, and lower the prevailing rate of inflation.
President Trump's tariff and trade policy is having a modest inflationary impact at a time when job report revisions point to a weakening labor market.
Despite near-term stagflation concerns, which remain minimal per Fed Chair Jerome Powell, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite are positioned for long-term success.
At any given time, there are one or more significant market headwinds threatening to drive the benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI), and innovation-inspired Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) lower.
For instance, the S&P 500's Shiller Price-to-Earnings Ratio, which is based on average inflation-adjusted earnings over the prior 10 years, recently achieved a closing multiple of almost 39. This makes the current bull market the third-priciest when back-tested 154 years. Historically speaking, when valuations get extended to the upside, the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and/or Nasdaq Composite eventually fall 20%, or considerably more.
For Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the nation's central bank, these correlative events and historical headwinds aren't of much concern -- but there is one exception.
Nothing scares the Fed more than the prospect of stagflation, which is characterized by a period of higher inflation, slower economic growth, and generally higher unemployment. While Powell and the Fed aren't panicking, Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy certainly has the central bank more concerned about the prospects of stagflation in America than they were prior to the president's January inauguration.
The groundwork for the Fed's worst-case scenario is being laid
Normally the Federal Reserve is doing its work at one end of the spectrum or the other. If the economy is firing on all cylinders, its primary goal is to keep inflation (rising prices) from getting out of hand. A growing economy is generally going to exhibit a healthy job market.
On the other hand, if U.S. economic growth has weakened or a recession has taken hold, the Fed will turn its attention to spurring job growth by lowering the federal funds rate. When the economy is weak, the prevailing rate of inflation tends to decline.
Stagflation presents a nightmare scenario for Jerome Powell and the Fed because there's no blueprint for how to approach it. Lowering interest rates to spur growth can fan the flames of higher-than-desired inflation. Meanwhile, raising interest rates to cool the prevailing rate of inflation can weaken an already stumbling economy and jobs market. Regardless of the actions the central bank employs, it tends to be bad news for workers and the stock market.
The concern is that stagflation fears are mounting specifically because of President Trump's tariff and trade policy.
In early April, the president unveiled a 10% global tariff rate, as well as higher ""reciprocal tariffs"" on dozens of countries deemed to have adverse trade imbalances with America. Since initially introducing these reciprocal tariffs, numerous pauses, adjustments, and trade deals have been hashed out.
However, the June inflation report, announced in mid-July by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), pointed to an uptick in the prevailing rate of inflation -- from 2.35% in May on a trailing-12-month (TTM) basis, per the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, to 2.67% in June on a TTM basis. While a 32-basis-point uptick might not sound like much, it represents the first report where the full impact of Donald Trump's tariff policy is being felt.
According to a December-published report (""Do Import Tariffs Protect U.S. Firms?"") from four New York Fed economists working at Liberty Street Economics, the duties President Trump placed on China during his first term in 2018-2019 did a poor job of differentiating between output and input tariffs. Whereas an output tariff is placed on a finished product imported into the U.S., an input tariff is a duty applied to a good used to complete the manufacture of a product domestically. Input tariffs run the risk of meaningfully increasing costs for businesses and consumers... and this may be happening, yet again.
Following the Federal Open Market Committee's June 2025 meeting, the Summary of Economic Projections forecast a 3.1% core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) inflation rate by the end of 2025, which is up from its prior forecast of 2.8% for core PCE. In other words, inflation is expected to modestly pick up, with tariffs driving this trend.
At the same time, the BLS made a major downward revision to previously reported job gains for May and June when it released the July jobs data. May was revised down by 125,000 jobs to a gain of just 19,000, while June was slashed by 133,000 jobs to a gain of only 14,000. Though the unemployment rate of 4.2% (as of July 2025) remains near its historic low, these not-so-subtle BLS revisions intimate weakness in the job market.
Rounding things out, Liberty Street Economics' analysis of Trump's China tariffs in 2018-2019 found that public companies whose stock was negatively impacted on tariff announcement days produced worse future real outcomes. Specifically, companies directly impacted by these tariffs saw an average across-the-board decline in sales, profits, labor productivity, and employment from 2019 to 2021.
Based on existing economic data and historical precedent, President Trump's tariff and trade policy is laying the groundwork for possible stagflation, with higher inflation, a weaker job market, and potentially weaker economic growth.
The stock market's resiliency is unparalleled
While the possibility of stagflation exists, Fed Chair Powell doesn't believe this nightmare scenario will manifest in the U.S. ""We have warned of it, but it is not something that we are facing or that we expect to face,"" said Powell.
Nevertheless, certainty may be hard to come by over the coming weeks or months for Wall Street's major stock indexes. When things are uncertain is often when the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite become more volatile than usual.
But when the lens is widened and historical precedent is applied to Wall Street over a span of one or more decades, it becomes easy to see just how resilient the major stock indexes are to short-term headwinds and emotion-driven fear.
At the heart of this long-term optimism is the nonlinearity of economic and stock market cycles. Even though adverse events are inevitable and sometimes uncomfortable, they're historically short-lived.
For instance, the U.S. economy has navigated its way through a dozen recessions since the end of World War II. The average length of these downturns is a mere 10 months, with no recession enduring longer than 18 months. In comparison, the average economic expansion has lasted for about five years, with two periods of growth surpassing the 10-year mark. Angling your portfolio to take advantage of these extended periods of growth is how significant wealth is created on Wall Street.
Speaking of stocks, this clear-as-day disparity can be seen in Wall Street's benchmark index, the S&P 500.
In June 2023, shortly after the S&P 500 was confirmed to be in a new bull market, the researchers at Bespoke Investment Group published a data set on X (formerly Twitter) that calculated the length of every bull and bear market dating back to the start of the Great Depression (September 1929).
In one corner, the average 20% (or greater) downturn in the S&P 500 has lasted just 286 calendar days, or less than 10 months. Comparatively, the average S&P 500 bull market endured for 1,011 calendar days (as of June 2023), which is about 3.5 times longer than the typical bear market.
Regardless of what's thrown Wall Street's way, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite always find a way to power through it over the long run. Not even stagflation fears precipitated by President Trump's tariff and trade policy can keep these major stock indexes from hitting new highs over the long run.

For truly patient people though, the reward is well worth the wait; you'd be hard-pressed to find better returns on your money than the market's average annual gain of about 10%.
Still, sometimes you get the itch for a bit more gain reaped in a little less time. And every now and then the market obliges with the right prospects.
If you can stomach their above-average risk, there are stocks that have the potential to quintuple your money within the next five years. Even half of that, of course, would still be worth your while.
Carnival Corp.
Anyone who knows anything about Carnival Corp.(NYSE: CCL) knows the leisure cruise company took on a ton of debt during and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It needed the cash just to survive. As of May the $40 billion company was sitting on nearly $26 billion worth of long-term obligations costing it roughly $1.4 billion worth of interest payments per year. That's a pretty big bite out of its annualized top line of almost $16 billion, paring its yearly net income back to something in the ballpark of $3 billion. That's why shares are still down on the order of 30% from their price right before the pandemic took hold, and less than half of their 2018 peak price -- investors are simply worried its balance sheet is untenable.
The thing is, this profitable company is managing to continue paying down its debt while also still growing its business. At its early 2023 peak, for perspective, Carnival's long-term debt stood at nearly $33 billion.
While there's obviously plenty of more work to be done before the company is back to its pre-pandemic condition, the demand it requires to do so is most definitely in place. Last quarter's record-breaking revenue of $6.3 billion was turned into record-breaking operating income of over $900 million, extending an ongoing streak of growth for both measures. Look for more of the same, too. See, also as of the end of last quarter the company's total customer deposits toward future trips reached a record-breaking $8.5 billion.
What gives? As it turns out, consumers are still seeking out affordable luxury experiences even if money is tight. The Cruise Lines International Association believes the industry will serve 37.7 million passengers this year, breaking last year's record of 34.6 million en route to 41.9 million in 2028. Carnival is well positioned to capture at least its fair share of this growth.
Just don't tarry if you're interested. More and more investors are seeing this dynamic, given how shares are well up from their 2022 low and still climbing.
Iovance Biotherapeutics
There's a good chance you've never heard of Iovance Biotherapeutics(NASDAQ: IOVA). Its billion-dollar market cap just doesn't turn many heads, and for those who do find it, the unprofitable biopharma outfit with only one expensive therapy in its portfolio seems like anything but a sure thing.
If there was ever a one-trick pony to take a shot on though, this one may be it.
It's called Amtagvi. Only approved early last year, this drug is the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved cellular therapy (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, specifically) to treat certain kinds of melanoma. The underlying science, however, is promising on far more fronts. Amtagvi -- generically called lifileucel -- is also being tested in a dozen other clinical trials, while similarly made treatments are in the midst of eight more testing regimens. And some of these trials are in their latter stages, like the use of lifileucel as a treatment for certain sorts of non-responsive lung cancer.
There is a challenge. That is, Amtagvi is complicated to administer, and expensive. Each patient's one-time treatment is custom-made in a lab for their particular tumor at a cost of around $500,000 apiece. Some insurers are balking, particularly given that it's still a relatively new medicine, and not a more proven ""front line"" therapy that's also often much cheaper. Anyone who's been watching this company for a while also knows this stock's performed poorly since its 2010 initial public offering (IPO), and even since its 2020 rally when Amtagvi's approval first became imminent.
The fact is, however, Iovance Biotherapeutics' future has never been brighter than it is right now, yet the stock's never been cheaper. The company's also never been closer to profitability than it is at this time. Analysts are expecting bottom-line progress that puts it on a trajectory for a swing to profitability sometime around or even before 2030, when research from Global Data suggests sales of Amtagvi could exceed $1 billion en route to as much as $2 billion per year. This prospect alone is enough to turn up the heat on Iovance stock in the meantime.
Shopify
Finally, add Shopify(NASDAQ: SHOP) to your list of stocks that could turn $1,000 into $5,000 by 2030. The analyst community expects its top line to grow to the tune of 20% per year for the next several years, pumping up its profits at an even faster rate.
It's possible you've used the company's technology without even realizing it. In contrast with Amazon's business model, Shopify helps brands and merchants build their own online stores. This allows for far more customization of the e-commerce experience, ultimately building a stronger -- and more direct -- relationship with consumers as they become customers. Although the company no longer discloses the figure, estimates of the number of online stores put the figure somewhere around 5 million.
The company does, however, still disclose how much business its platform is facilitating. Last year, Shopify's e-commerce technology handled $292.3 billion worth of business on behalf of its customers, generating $8.9 billion worth of revenue for itself. Those numbers were up 24% and 26% (respectively) year over year, extending growth trends that are expected to persist for a long while more.
The key to this growth is the way e-commerce is evolving in the wake of Amazon's heavy-handed dominance of the business.
In its early days Amazon.com was the premier platform for connecting with consumers. As time has marched on, however, Amazon is decreasingly a partner with its sellers, and increasingly a competitor to them. Not only does the e-commerce giant now sell its own merchandise, but it offers third-party sellers the option of paying the company to more prominently feature their goods at the site. Smaller sellers without much of a marketing budget often just can't compete. The issue of fake product reviews also remains a nuisance. All of this dynamic ultimately helps Shopify, of course, by prompting sellers to look for sales platforms where they have more cost-effective control.
Then there's the more philosophical aspect of e-commerce's ongoing evolution. As the industry changes it's increasingly moving toward greater authenticity and more personal connections with consumers. This of course favors Shopify's customizable offerings, and is one of the reasons IMARC Group believes the world's direct-to-consumer market that Shopify serves will grow at an average annualized pace of more than 17% through 2033. Shopify is well positioned to win more than its fair share of this growth.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.84%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +1.05%.
Stock indexes settled higher on Friday, with the S&P 50 posting a 1-week high and the Nasdaq 100 setting a new record high. Stocks are supported by robust corporate earnings results and hopes that the Fed will soon cut interest rates to support the economy.
Monster Beverage rose more than +6% after beating Q2 EPS estimates. Also, Expedia Group closed up more than +3% after reporting better-than-expected Q2 EPS and raising its full-year forecast. On the negative side, Trade Desk plunged more than -38% after giving an outlook that analysts said was underwhelming. Also, Microchip Technology fell more than -5% after pausing most factory expansions and cutting its full-year capital expenditures.
Stocks extended their gains Friday after Bloomberg News reported that the US and Russia are aiming for a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Russia said it would halt its offensive in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine along the current battlelines as part of the deal if Ukraine cedes its entire eastern Donbas area to Russia as well as Crimea.
Friday’s comments from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem were slightly hawkish and bearish for stock and bonds when he said the Fed is missing more on the inflation side of its dual mandate, so ""Given the economy where it stands today, it seems appropriate for the Fed to maintain the policy rate at a constant for now.""
Stocks are seeing support from speculation that weaker-than-expected US economic news and recent dovish Fed commentary will push the Fed to lower interest rates as soon as next month. On Thursday, President Trump nominated Stephen Miran to be a temporary replacement for Adrianna Kugler as Fed Governor until the end of the year. Miran is currently chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors and is seen as dovish and supporting President Trump’s calls for lower interest rates. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 90% from 40% last Friday.
In recent tariff news, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 90% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 63% at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 82% exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.29%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.12%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 climbed to a 2-week high and closed up sharply by +1.85%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Friday closed down by -8.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +3.5 bp to 4.285%. T-notes moved lower on Friday as strength in stocks has reduced safe-haven demand for government securities. Also, rising inflation expectations are negative for T-notes as the 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose to a 1-week high Friday of 2.417%. T-note prices dropped to their lows on hawkish comments from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, who said inflation is still a problem.
Losses in T-notes were limited Friday after President Trump late Thursday nominated Stephen Miran for Fed Governor to replace Adriana Kugler for the rest of the year. Miran views President Trump’s policies as disinflationary and would support a more dovish Fed policy.
European government bond yields on Friday moved higher. The 10-year German bund yield rose +6.0 bp to 2.690%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +5.4 bp to 4.601%.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 9% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
US Stock Movers
Gilead Sciences (GILD) closed up more than +8% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 product sales of $7.05 billion, above the consensus of $6.94 billion, and raising its full-year product sales forecast to $28.3 billion-$28.7 billion from a previous forecast of $28.2 billion-$28.6 billion.
Gen Digital (GEN) closed up more than +7% after reporting Q1 revenue of $1.26 billion, stronger than the consensus of $1.19 billion, and forecasting full-year revenue of $4.80-$4.90 billion, better than the consensus of $4.76 billion.
Monster Beverage (MNST) closed up more than +6% after reporting Q2 net sales of $2.11 billion, stronger than the consensus of $2.08 billion.

Expedia Group (EXPE) closed up more than +4% after reporting Q2 revenue of $3.79 billion, better than the consensus of $3.71 billion, and raising its full-year gross bookings forecast to +3% to +5% from a previous estimate of +2% to +4%, the midpoint above the consensus of +3.3%.
Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) closed up more than +3% after reporting Q2 revenue of $7.01 billion, above the consensus of $6.89 billion.
Tempus AI (TEM) is up more than +3% after reporting Q2 net revenue of $314.6 million, stronger than the consensus of $297.7 million.
Tesla (TSLA) closed up more than +2% after it was granted a rideshare permit in Texas for operating its robotaxi service.
Trade Desk (TTD) closed down more than -38% to lead losers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 41 cents, above the consensus of 40 cents but considered underwhelming by several analysts.
Sweetgreen (SG) closed down more than -22% after reporting a Q2 EPS loss of -20 cents, wider than the consensus of -13 cents, and cut its full-year same-store sales forecast to down -4% to -6% from a previous forecast of no change.

Pinterest (PINS) closed down more than -10% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of 33 cents, below the consensus of 36 cents.
Microchip Technology (MCHP) closed down more than -6% after forecasting Q2 net sales of $1.11 billion-$1.15 billion, the midpoint right on the consensus of $1.13 billion, considered disappointing by analysts.

Nvidia, for example, has seen its stock price grow more than tenfold since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, now topping $4 trillion in market cap.
Some investors may feel like they've missed the boat and they're too late to buy AI stocks at a good price. It's important to consider that today's AI winners might not be the biggest companies to benefit from advancements in artificial intelligence over the long run. Finding a company that's making excellent progress right now with sustainable long-term competitive advantages could end up being an even better stock to own when the dust settles.
These three companies are all well positioned to benefit from the continued growth and advancement in artificial intelligence. Their stocks are all attractive at today's prices, too, which means you can buy them now and hold them forever.
1. Amazon
Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is home to the largest public cloud computing platform in the world, Amazon Web Services, or AWS. The segment generated $116.4 billion over the last 12 months, roughly 50% larger than its next-closest competitor, Microsoft's Azure.
Some have expressed concern about AWS for a few reasons. First, it was caught flat-footed as the generative AI opportunity was getting off the ground. That led it to cede market share to Microsoft and others who were earlier to invest in the space. However, it quickly course corrected, releasing its Bedrock platform, and it's seeing triple-digit growth in AI services. As such, it's been able to maintain most of its market share in a rapidly growing market (even though overall revenue growth has slowed to the high-teens).
The second reason is that AWS saw a significant decline in operating margin in the second quarter. Management explained half of that decline was due to the timing of stock-based compensation. The rest is explained by Amazon's significant investments in capacity, as it notes the business remains capacity constrained. Over time, investors should see margin tick back up. It's worth noting AWS still commands higher margins than its smaller competitors.
Meanwhile, the rest of Amazon looks strong. Its retail operations are seeing improved margins quarter after quarter, thanks in part to a strong advertising business. The international segment is notably on its way to becoming a meaningful contributor to operating income after years of investment.
The stock fell following the release of its second-quarter earnings based on a disappointing outlook. But the long-term potential for Amazon, particularly in AWS, remains strong. The pullback in price looks like an opportunity for long-term investors to buy this AI leader.
2. Salesforce
Salesforce(NYSE: CRM) provides a suite of software often found at the center of many enterprises' operations. The company has seen very good results with its growing set of cloud-based software solutions, but the standout recently has been its Data Cloud offering. Data Cloud provides a single platform to aggregate all of a company's data to create actionable insights from a single source.
Data Cloud recurring revenue grew to $1 billion in Salesforce's most recent quarter, up 120% year over year. It's seeing strong attachment, with 60 of its top 100 deals including Data Cloud in the contract. And the most recent product built on top of Data Cloud, Agentforce, is seeing very strong adoption.
Agentforce allows businesses to build AI agents that can execute tasks or provide customer service with minimal human intervention. The key to building successful AI agents is access to pertinent data, which is exactly what Data Cloud brings to the table. Management says it's made 8,000 deals with Agentforce since its launch last fall, representing $100 million in revenue. That makes it Salesforce's fastest-growing product ever.
Considering Salesforce's software suite is entrenched in the operations of so many enterprises, it's in a prime position to benefit from growing spend on artificial intelligence, particularly through Data Cloud. It's unlikely to lose that position. In fact, its expanding suite of software tools only serves to increase the switching costs for a company. With shares trading for just 22 times forward earnings estimates, Salesforce looks like a great buy at today's price.
3. Meta Platforms
Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) may be the biggest investor in artificial intelligence in the world. It's on track to spend between $66 billion and $72 billion on capital expenditures, and it's only building compute power for itself (unlike the other hyperscalers, who serve cloud customers). There's a good reason Meta is spending more than everyone else on artificial intelligence; it could be the biggest beneficiary of all generative AI has to offer.
Signs of that are already coming through. In the second quarter, Meta's ad prices climbed 9% year over year and impressions grew 11%. CEO Mark Zuckerberg notes a significant portion of that improvement came from its AI-recommendation model. Additionally, time spent on Facebook and Instagram increased 5% and 6%, respectively, thanks to bigger AI models.
But the future is bright, too. Meta's generative AI tools for ad creative are seeing strong adoption. Zuckerberg notes ""a meaningful... [percentage] of our ad revenue now... [comes] from campaigns using one of our Generative AI features."" Long term, Meta is working on an AI agent that can develop and test ad creatives autonomously.
Meta's AI chatbot now boasts over 1 billion users, creating an additional channel for monetization over the long run. Meta only recently started putting ads in WhatsApp and Threads, which should provide additional ad revenue as advertising on Meta grows increasingly easier thanks to generative AI capabilities.
Meta's seeing excellent financial results from the growing adoption of its advertising platform and increased engagement from its users. Revenue climbed 22% last quarter and operating income grew an impressive 38%. Meta's growing depreciation expense will likely weigh on earnings going forward as long as it continues to ramp up spending, but if it continues to produce top-line growth like last quarter, that's easily digestible.
If you back out the depreciation expense using EBITDA, Meta shares trade for an attractive price with enterprise value around 16 times forward EBITDA estimates. Even on a more traditional forward P/E valuation, Meta shares look to be well worth the 27 times multiple you'll have to pay for the stock today.

Stocks of growing companies will usually experience greater volatility than the market average. But investors that ignore those fluctuations and keep regularly buying shares of growing companies will come out ahead over the long run.
Three fool.com contributors see great deals right now for fallen growth stocks like Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Dutch Bros(NYSE: BROS), and Sweetgreen(NYSE: SG). Here's why they believe these stocks are solid investments for a long-term investor.
Amazon: Down 8.5%
Jennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon reported spectacular results for the 2025 second quarter last week, but its stock dropped on the news. While there was a lot to be excited about, the market seemed to home in on certain qualities that didn't fully meet its expectations, and that has created an excellent opportunity for investors who haven't pressed the buy button yet.
Sales growth was strong at 13% year over year, beating expectations. Let's not forget that Amazon is the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales, and to be able to still deliver double-digit sales growth is an impressive feat. It reached $167.7 billion in sales, ahead of Walmart's $165.6 billion in sales in its most recent quarter, and Amazon is on track to become the largest company in the U.S. by sales.
Operating income surged to $19.2 billion, up from $14.7 billion last year, easily topping its guidance. But that wasn't enough for Wall Street.
The market seems to have been spooked by the outlook for operating margin coming in slightly below expectations. Management is shooting for $15.5 billion to $20.5 billion in third-quarter operating income, and Wall Street is expecting $19.5 billion.
It also wasn't thrilled with the performance of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon's cloud business. AWS sales were up 17.5% year over year in the quarter, but that was nowhere near the growth of its two biggest rivals, Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet, which increased 39% and 32%. However, AWS is much bigger than both of them, and in dollar amounts, its increase surpassed them.
CEO Andy Jassy made some remarks about the artificial intelligence (AI) business that may have sounded worse than he expected. He explained that it couldn't meet demand right now, which is why it's investing heavily in the platform. While that could lead clients to find somewhere else to meet their demand, the high demand implied should be great for Amazon down the line, as long as it can build out fast enough to keep it going.
Amazon stock is down 8.5% from its highs, already making its way back up as investors recognize the opportunity to buy on the dip. This was an overcorrection, and now it's a great chance to buy before it reaches new highs.
Dutch Bros: Down 33%
John Ballard (Dutch Bros): Dutch Bros has all the ingredients of a growth stock set up to deliver multi-bagger returns for patient shareholders. It's tapping into growing demand for specialty beverages. The business was founded in 1992, but it's still early in its nationwide U.S. expansion plans.
Analysts expect revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 23% over the next few years. This is in line with the company's current pace of shop openings and same-shop sales trends, which have hovered around the low to mid-single-digit level over the last few years. It currently has over 1,000 shops in 18 states, but management sees tremendous growth potential supporting as many as 7,000 locations over the long term.
Dutch Bros is outperforming Starbucks, which has experienced problems growing sales recently. One reason for Dutch Bros' success is that it likes to hire shop managers from within the company. Even some of the company's franchise partners started out working for Dutch Bros as ""broistas."" This can help promote consistency throughout the company's shops, which is an important quality to look for in any restaurant chain.
Another quality that leads me to have high conviction in the future of this brand is that it is very popular among Gen Z. Dutch Bros offers a fun-loving atmosphere and a focus on the drive-thru experience, and it goes out of its way to delight customers with limited time offerings, such as the recent rubber duck giveaway with every purchase. The little things can go a long way in winning loyal customers, and Dutch Bros seems to understand this well.
The stock is currently down about 33% from its 52-week high. I would consider taking advantage of the dip and adding shares, especially for investors who are interested in finding promising new restaurant brands in the early stages of expansion.
Sweetgreen: Down 77%
Jeremy Bowman (Sweetgreen): Restaurant stocks have struggled this year as a combination of fears about tariffs and weak consumer discretionary spending have weighed on both business results and stock performance.
Sweetgreen, the promising fast-casual salad chain, has been one of the worst-performing stocks in the industry. The stock is now down 61% year to date, and is off 77% from its all-time high shortly after the company went public in late 2021.
It's understandable why Sweetgreen is down based on its recent results. In its first quarter, same-store sales declined 3.1%, and revenue rose just 5.4%. Sweetgreen has also been unprofitable throughout its history.
However, the chain is still small with roughly 250 locations, and it is popular as its restaurants generate average sales of $2.9 million. That puts it on par with Chipotle, one of the most successful restaurant stocks in history.
Sweetgreen has also been unprofitable in part because it's invested in its Infinite Kitchen program, an automated system that measures and dispenses ingredients and helps prep its salad bowls. That innovation seems likely to pay off over the long run. Management has said that restaurants with the Infinite Kitchen generate higher sales, as it helps increase throughput and customer service, in addition to saving on labor costs.
Sweetgreen's comparisons are expected to get easier in the second half of the year, which could turn comparable sales positive. The company expects to open at least 1,000 stores over the long term, meaning it has a long growth runway ahead.
Investors who take advantage of the discount are likely to be rewarded.

These changes include industry leadership, stock-selection strategies, allocation adjustments, and more.
There are still some reliable constants though. One of them is Warren Buffett, and the picks he makes -- or at least approves -- for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. If a stock becomes a Berkshire holding, you can bet it's a quality name with a promising future.
Here's a closer look at three Warren Buffett picks currently held by Berkshire Hathaway that just might work for your portfolio as well.
1. American Express
Buffett's done a fair amount of selling over the past few quarters, lightening up on Berkshire's positions in Apple, Bank of America, and DaVita, and outright exiting its stakes in Citigroup and Nu Holdings.
One stock has remained conspicuously untouched for years now, however, to quietly become Berkshire Hathaway's second-biggest holding (right behind Apple). That's credit card outfit American Express(NYSE: AXP).
It's not too difficult to see why Buffett's such a fan, though; the company's certainly more than proven it knows how to make its unique business model work.
On the surface it's just another credit card company. Under the hood though, it's more. Unlike Visa and Mastercard, which are only payment networks for card issuers, American Express is both the issuer and the payment middleman.
This leveraged position allows it to offer a perks and rewards program that cardholders are willing to pay up to $700 per year just to access. This annual fee also means American Express' cardholders tend to be a bit more affluent than the average consumer, and as such are less likely to miss payments, and more likely to continue spending even when other people are tightening their purse strings.
And the proof is in the company's results. With the obvious exception of 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing, Amex's top line has improved every year going all the way back to 2017.
Profit growth hasn't been quite as consistent. It's remained reliable enough, however, to make American Express a solid dividend stock. Although the company tends to not raise its dividend payments in times of uncertainty -- like in the wake of 2008's subprime mortgage meltdown or during the COVID-19 pandemic -- it still continues to pay a quarterly dividend, and begins raising these payments again as soon as the economy makes it feasible to do so.
2. Occidental Petroleum
If it seems like the oil and gas business is inching its way to obsolescence, that's because it is. With the advent of electric cars and renewable energy sources, consumers just won't need oil like they have in the past. To this end, Goldman Sachs predicts ""peak oil"" -- the point at which the planet's daily consumption of crude stops growing and starts shrinking -- will happen in 2035.
There's a reason, however, that Buffett remains enough of a fan of oil giant Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) to stick with Berkshire's 265 million share position despite the stock's relatively poor performance of late. That is, there's still a great deal of money to be made in the business between now and then, and even after 2035.
See, while demand will likely start to shrink then, it's apt to shrink very, very slowly. Indeed, outlooks from ExxonMobil, OPEC, and Standard & Poor's all suggest that oil will still be the world's top source of energy production as far down the road as 2050. The continued proliferation of alternative energy options just won't be able to keep up with the ever-growing demand for electricity.
And Buffett feels very good about Occidental's ability to deliver, even in an environment where crude oil prices remain subdued. As he noted in 2023's letter (published in early 2024) to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders:
""Under Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.""
That's strong personal praise from the Oracle of Omaha.
The kicker: Buffett also touted the potential of the carbon-capture technology that Occidental Petroleum is developing, which literally sucks carbon dioxide out of the ambient air. While it's not quite yet ready for mass commercialization, that day is coming, and soon, putting Occidental into what's apt to be another multibillion-dollar market.
3. Pool Corp.
Finally, add Pool Corp.(NASDAQ: POOL) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks you might want to buy for yourself right now.
It's the smallest and least-known of the three companies in focus here, with a market cap of only $11 billion. It's not a particularly big Berkshire holding either; the conglomerate's 1.5 million Pool Corp. shares are worth less than $500 million, which is less than 4% of Pool itself.
This relatively small stake makes Buffett's interest in the company all the more telling. While owning this much Pool stock doesn't actually do much for Berkshire's bottom line, Buffett and/or his lieutenants waded in anyway. There's a reason, even if it's not yet clear.
But first things first. Yes, this is the company that sells swimming pool supplies. It's the biggest name in the business, in fact, doing $5.3 billion worth of business last year. Of that, $617 million was turned into net income.
Curiously, both of those numbers were down from 2023's comparisons. Neither figure is expected to improve any this year, either. Berkshire bought the stock anyway despite its relatively rich valuation of 28 times this year's expected per-share profit of $10.88. It's a significant vote of confidence in this company's future growth prospects.
The thing is, it may not be a crazy bet at all.
There's no denying this stock's been a poor performer since 2021's peak, largely due to headwinds on the residential real estate front, where costs have soared. Investors are just worried, and understandably so.
As Buffett says though, ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful."" This business may be struggling right now, but it will eventually thrive again once the economy gets back up to full speed and the highly cyclical homebuying and home-improvement markets perk up, in turn driving demand for pools, and, subsequently, demand for pool maintenance supplies. Berkshire's just positioning in a quality company now for whenever that recovery materializes.

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.
Artificial intelligence startups have minted dozens of new billionaires this year, adding to an AI boom that's quickly becoming the largest wealth creation spree in recent history.
Blockbuster fundraising rounds this year for Anthropic, Safe Superintelligence, OpenAI, Anysphere and other startups have created vast new paper fortunes and propelled valuations to record levels. There are now 498 AI ""unicorns,"" or private AI companies with valuations of $1 billion or more, with a combined value of $2.7 trillion, according to CB Insights. Fully 100 of them were founded since 2023. There are more than 1,300 AI startups with valuations of over $100 million, the firm said.
Combined with the soaring stock prices of Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft and other publicly traded AI-related firms, along with the infrastructure companies that are building data centers and computing power and the huge payouts for AI engineers, AI is creating personal wealth on a scale that makes the past two tech waves look like warmups.
""Going back over 100 years of data, we have never seen wealth created at this size and speed,"" said Andrew McAfee, principal researcher at MIT. ""It's unprecedented.""
A new crop of billionaires is rising with sky-rocketing valuations. In March, Bloomberg estimated that four of the largest private AI companies had created at least 15 billionaires with a combined net worth of $38 billion. More than a dozen unicorns have been crowned since then.
Mira Murati, who left Open AI last September, launched Thinking Machines Lab in February. By July, she raised $2 billion in the largest seed round in history, giving the company a $12 billion valuation, according to reports.
Anthropic AI is in talks to raise $5 billion at a valuation of $170 billion, nearly three times its valuation in March. CEO Dario Amodei and its six other founders are now likely multibillionaires, according to people familiar with the company.
Anysphere was valued at $9.9 billion in a June fundraise and just weeks later was reportedly offered a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion, likely making its 25-year-old founder and CEO, Michael Truell, a billionaire.
Granted, most of the AI wealth creation is in private companies, making it difficult for equity holders and founders to cash out. Unlike the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when a flood of companies went public, today's AI startups can stay private for longer given the constant investment from venture capital funds, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and other tech investors.
At the same time, the rapid growth of secondary markets is allowing equity owners of private companies to sell their shares to other investors and provide liquidity. Structured secondary sales or tender offers are becoming widespread. Many founders can also borrow against their equity.
Open AI is holding talks for a secondary share sale to provide cash to employees. Its proposed valuation of $500 billion follows the company's fundraise in March that provided a $300 billion valuation.
Dozens of private firms are being acquired or merging, also providing liquidity. After Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, founder Alexandr Wang joined Meta's AI team. There have been 73 liquidity events — including mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, reverse mergers or corporate majority stakes — since 2023, according to CB Insights. Following the Meta deal, Scale AI's co-founder, Lucy Guo, who left the company in 2018, bought a mansion in LA's Hollywood Hills for around $30 million.
Still, the AI surge is largely centered in the Bay Area, reminiscent of the dot-com era. Last year, Silicon Valley companies raised more than $35 billion in venture funding, according to the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies. San Francisco now has more billionaires than New York, with 82 compared with New York's 66, according to New World Wealth and Henley & Partners. The Bay Area's millionaire population has doubled over the past decade, compared with New York's growth of 45%.
More homes sold above $20 million in San Francisco last year than in any other year in history, according to Sotheby's International Realty. Rising rents, home prices and demand in the city, attributed in large part to AI, mark a sharp turnaround for a city facing a ""doom loop"" just a few years ago.
""It's astonishing how geographically concentrated this AI wave is,"" said McAfee, who is also co-director of MIT's Initiative on the Digital Economy. ""The people who know how to found and fund and grow tech companies are there. I've heard people say for 25 years 'This is the end of the Silicon Valley' or some other place is 'the new Silicon Valley.' But Silicon Valley is still Silicon Valley.""
With time, and initial public offerings, many of today's private AI fortunes will eventually become more liquid, providing a historic opportunity for wealth management firms. All of the major private banks, wirehouses, independent advisors and boutique firms are cozying up to the AI elite in hopes of winning their business, according to tech advisors.
Like the dot-com millionaires, however, luring the AI wealthy may be challenging for traditional wealth management companies. Simon Krinsky, executive managing director at Pathstone and former managing director at Hall Capital Partners in San Francisco, said most AI wealth is locked up in private companies and therefore can't be turned into wealth management accounts.
""I would say a much higher percentage of the ultimate wealth being created is illiquid,"" he said. ""There are ways of getting liquidity, but it's tiny compared to being employed at Meta or Google"" or another megacap publicly traded tech company.
Eventually, those fortunes will become liquid and prized by wealth management firms. Krinsky said the AI wealthy are likely to follow similar client patterns as the newly rich dot-commers of the 1990s. Initially, the dot-commers used their excess liquidity and assets to invest in similar tech companies they knew through their networks, colleagues or shared investors. He said the same is likely true for the AI wealthy.
""Everybody turned around and invested with their friends in the same kind of companies that created their own wealth,"" he said.
After discovering the perils of having all their wealth concentrated in one highly volatile and speculative industry, the dot-commers turned to wealth management. And being born disruptors, many turned their capital and skills toward reinventing the wealth management industry in their image. Netscape founder Jim Clark, for instance, helped launch MyCFO, a response to his dislike of bankers and the industry.
Krinksy said today's AI entrepreneurs are likely to follow the same path, with huge potential for AI to disrupt — if not replace — many of the traditional functions of wealth management.
Ultimately, however, the ultra-wealthy AI founders will discover the need for the traditional, personalized service that only dedicated wealth management teams can provide, whether it's around taxes, inheritances and estate planning, or philanthropy advice and portfolio construction.
""After people were beaten up or bruised up in the early 2000s, they came around to appreciating some degree of diversification and maybe hiring a professional manager to protect them from themselves,"" Krinksy said. ""I anticipate a similar trend with the AI group.""",97fdda9764832dcbbb997090c534af8f,trafilatura,7585,0

How do everyday investors value them ? ,2025-08-10 14:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Imagine walking into a jewelry store where nothing has a price tag, the shelves are locked and you can’t return anything the moment you change your mind.
That’s a bit like what could be coming to your 401(k)s and other workplace retirement plans under a new executive order from President Donald Trump.
Trump this week signed an executive order that will open the doors for everyday investors to stash their retirement savings in private equity, cryptocurrency, real estate and other alternative assets — a move that echoes a shared interest for some of Wall Street’s largest asset managers and private-equity firms, which for years have wanted to tap into the massive collective piggy bank of 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans.
While the move promises ordinary investors access to a potentially high-yield, low-volatility market — at least on paper — once reserved for sophisticated institutions and the ultrawealthy, it also introduces an unprecedented problem for retirement savers: It’s nearly impossible to know what you really own — and what it is truly worth.
Valuations for private assets are periodic and subjective
Unlike stocks on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, where shares of companies are openly traded, private equity involves investments in private firms that do not offer shares to the general public. And because private assets aren’t traded on public exchanges, the companies and funds behind them are not legally required to disclose detailed financial information to the public.
To be sure, private-equity holdings do get valued because fund managers must provide their private clients — usually pension funds, endowments and family offices — with periodic appraisals of the assets they hold. These valuations primarily rely on the so-called mark-to-model pricing method, which assigns values to assets using financial models as opposed to market trading prices.
This approach also involves comparable company analysis, projected cash flows and assessments from the management themselves. As a result, the valuations are mostly estimates and often inherently subjective.
David Krakauer, senior director of portfolio management at Mercer Advisors, said these valuation methods have to be taken with “a huge grain of salt,” because investors do not know what these private-market investments are actually worth until they have to sell their positions.
“We’ve seen that the mark-to-model [pricing method] is very slow to mark things down and very quick to mark things up,” said Jason Kephart, senior principal of multiasset-strategy ratings at MorningStar. “When markets sell off, the model is slower to react or not as reactionary in general, but when things are doing well, then you’ll see prices marked up a bit quicker.”
That illiquid nature of private assets is another major challenge, as there’s no readily available buyer or seller at any given moment. So even if investors have a valuation and trading prices on paper, they can’t quickly convert the investment into cash whenever they want to exit their position.
That lack of price transparency and liquidity is exactly what makes private assets tricky for 401(k) investors — who are used to logging in and seeing up-to-the-minute price updates for their holdings, and are able to adjust their portfolio allocations accordingly.
Low volatility in private markets?
Private markets are often known for their relatively low volatility and higher returns compared to public markets — but that is largely because of their illiquid nature, and it doesn’t necessarily imply lower risk, according to portfolio managers.
The supposedly superlow volatility of private assets does create “an illusion of diversification, which comes from the valuations not really changing or only changing in a positive direction,” Kephart told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Friday.
“But the small standard deviation of these funds is in no way indicative of the amount of risk investors are taking,” he added.
The lack of public interest in private assets
To be sure, Trump’s executive order doesn’t immediately change policy, but rather serves as directional guidance for government agencies. His order instructs the Labor Department to re-examine its guidance to employers and consult with the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as other federal regulators, to determine what regulatory changes need to be made to facilitate the goal of expanding private-markets access to 401(k)s.
Benjamin Schiffrin, director of securities policy for Better Markets, a nonprofit financial-market watchdog, said Trump’s executive order exemplifies the administration’s determination to prioritize the interests of Wall Street over the interests of retail investors.
“Let’s be clear: Neither 401(k)-plan sponsors or 401(k)-plan participants — regular, hardworking Americans — are asking to replace stocks and bonds in their 401(k)s with risky private assets,” Schiffrin said in a statement shared with MarketWatch on Thursday.
“Instead, the private-funds industry needs a way to get its hands on the $12 trillion in Americans’ retirement accounts to boost its profits and make up for the fact that institutional investors are fleeing the private markets due to mediocre returns, higher fees and more risk,” he added.
A survey of Americans with retirement accounts found that among those not investing in alternative assets, the leading barrier is “fear of fraud or scams,” according to data compiled by Lansons, a financial and strategic communications consultancy. Other cited barriers included concerns about the viability of investment platforms, the belief that alternative assets are too new and lack a track record, and not knowing credible companies to invest with.
However, more than half of the respondents still thought alternative investments offer an opportunity for larger returns than traditional assets, and they saw “diversification potential” in alternatives.
To be sure, the push to add private securities to 401(k) menus has long been a priority for some of Wall Street’s largest asset managers. BlackRock Inc. BLK, the world’s largest asset manager, is preparing to offer a 401(k) target-date fund with a 5% to 20% allocation to private investments in the first half of 2026, the company said in a press release in June.
Jaime Magyera, head of BlackRock’s U.S. wealth-advisory and retirement businesses, told MarketWatch on Friday that “the access to investments long out of reach” will help ensure millions of Americans build stronger, more diversified portfolios designed to increase savings.
Another retirement giant, Empower CA:GWO, which manages around $1.8 trillion in retirement accounts for nearly 19 million Americans, said in May that it would begin offering access to alternative investments — including private equity and private credit — through the retirement plans it oversees. Other retirement-plan providers such as State Street Corp. STT and Voya Financial Inc. VOYA have also announced similar moves this year.
It’s still uncertain how these private-equity investments will actually function within 401(k) plans when it comes to pricing and trading. But MorningStar’s Kephart said there’s a lot of “real-world friction” between what plan sponsors and 401(k) fiduciaries are accustomed to, in terms of fees and transparency — so it could take years before private assets ultimately enter retirement accounts.",4ce4850c02fd96ec4f6470688297c50d,trafilatura,7445,0

That has opened the door for AI on the defense as well. As agentic AI becomes more deeply embedded in the enterprise in areas like finance and legal, cybersecurity AI agents are on the rise, too, becoming a key asset for detection, analysis, and alerts.
""It's a massive challenge to detect, contain, investigate and respond across larger companies,"" said Brian Murphy, CEO of cybersecurity technology company ReliaQuest. ""AI is allowing us to remove a lot of that noise, that tier one or tier two work, that work that's often not at all relevant to something that could be threatening to an organization,"" Murphy said.
Putting a tool in the hands of human workers that can automate otherwise menial tasks or time-consuming ones, freeing them to do more important work, has often been the pitch for agentic AI.
In a message shared with Amazon employees in June, CEO Andy Jassy said ""We have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live,"" adding that he sees a future with ""billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field,"" helping workers ""focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically"" while also making ""our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today.""
Murphy shares a similar view across cybersecurity, where he sees an industry of workers who are inundated with work they likely shouldn't be spending time on, causing more burnout and exacerbating the existing issue of a lack of available talent.
He's also seen the way AI is being wielded to attack companies. ""Those phishing emails, they used to look almost laughable with the misspellings and the fonts wrong,"" he said. ""AI can take the average bad actor and make them better, and so the trick is if you're on the defensive side, they have to use AI because of the reality of what AI can do.""
ReliaQuest recently released what it calls GreyMatter Agentic Teammates, autonomous, role-based AI agents that can be used to take on tasks that detection engineers or threat intelligence researchers would otherwise accomplish on a security operations team.
""Think of it as this persona that teams up with a human, and the human is prompting that agentic AI, so the human knows what to do,"" Murphy said, adding that it's like having a ""teammate that takes that incident response analyst and multiplies their capability.""
Murphy gave an example that is a frequent occurrence for any security team at a global company: international executive travel. Every time a laptop or cell phone is connected to a network in, say, China, the security operations team would be alerted, and the security team would have to verify that the executive is abroad and is securely using their device each day of that trip. With an agentic AI teammate, that security person could automate that task, or even set up a series of similar processes for board meetings, off-sites, or other large team gatherings.
""There's hundreds of things like that,"" he said.
Justin Dellaportas, chief information and security officer at communications technology company Syniverse, said that while AI agents have been able to automate some of those basic cybersecurity tasks like combing through logs, it's also starting to be able to automate actions, like quarantining flagged emails and removing them from inboxes, or restricting access by a comprised account across a variety of logins.
""[AI] is being used by criminals to efficiently find vulnerabilities and exploits into organizations at scale, and all of that is resulting in them having a higher success rate, getting initial access sooner and moving laterally into an organization quicker than we've seen,"" he said. ""Cyber defenders really need to lean into this technology now more than ever to stay ahead of this evolving threat landscape and the pace of cyber criminals.""
Dellaportas said that while every company has a unique risk profile and tolerance when it comes to deploying different types of cybersecurity tools, he views the adoption of agentic AI in cybersecurity as stages of a ""crawl, walk, run methodology.""
""You roll this out, and it's going to reason and then take action, but then it's got to iterate through the actions that it's previously taken,"" he said. ""I come back to a kind of trust but verify, and then as we get confidence in its effectiveness, we'll move on to different problems.""
What AI bots mean for cybersecurity workers
While Dellaportas said AI agents can take over some tasks from human cybersecurity professionals in the future, he still sees the technology as an augmentation to make workers more effective, not as a replacement.
Murphy agrees, and said he does not see agentic AI taking the place of actual cybersecurity workers, but helping with tasks where automation is the better option while also addressing the skills gap that many organizations struggle with when filling cybersecurity roles.
""There may be a shortage of trained and skilled cybersecurity professionals, but there's no shortage of people who would like to be trained and skilled at cybersecurity,"" he said. ""The reason that knowledge transfer takes so long in cyber is that when you get your entry-level job, it's equivalent to working on a help desk.""
Murphy said he understands that there is still plenty of education needed when it comes to deploying agentic AI in any part of a business, as well as concerns about how decisions are made by AI.
Dellaportas said what has helped is the fact that agentic AI is being used by all types of business lines, so discussions of how these AI tools can help accomplish objectives are not new ones.
AI agents are catching on inside companies. A May 2025 poll of 147 CIOs and IT function leaders by Gartner found that 24% had already deployed a few AI agents, with more than 50% of those AI agents working across functions like IT, HR and accounting, compared to just 23% of external customer facing functions.
Avivah Litan, a distinguished vice president analyst on Gartner's AI strategy team, said that in the cybersecurity space, companies experimenting with agentic AI are finding it ""moderately beneficial,"" but there remain some questions as to the ability of these tools to scale beyond simpler tasks.
""Security has always been the low-hanging fruit use case for AI,"" Litan said. ""You first saw AI show up with fraud detection, so it's 100% that we're going to have digital security assistance in the future doing work and freeing up staff to take on the new attacks; the key will be making sure they stay up with all this innovation so they can see the whole attack surface.""
Murphy believes that corporate adoption and evolution of agentic AI in cybersecurity may occur even more quickly than in finance or legal.
""They absolutely understand AI is being used against them, and the only way to defend that is to use it in their own defense,"" he said.",488fb04f7752a041f75702b3b88b5b0d,trafilatura,7126,0

Sometimes, investors will get a little whimsical and come up with catchy names to describe red-hot, winning stocks. The ""Nifty Fifty"" was a popular term for large-cap stocks in the 1960s and 1970s.
Jim Cramer used ""FANG"" to describe Facebook (now Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Google (now Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)). It eventually expanded to ""FAANG"" to include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).
The ""Magnificent Seven"" was coined by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the largest seven technology-focused companies: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).
But the Magnificent Seven has its problems, which is why I'm introducing the ""Ten Titans"" -- the Magnificent Seven plus Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), and Netflix.
Here's why the Ten Titans is a better representation of top growth stocks than the Magnificent Seven.
The Broadcom blunder
The biggest flaw of the Magnificent Seven is that it doesn't include Broadcom. It's up about 450% in the last three years, which has pole-vaulted its market cap well over $1 trillion.
Based on market cap, it deserves to be included in the Magnificent Seven over Tesla. However, some folks may prefer the diversification that Tesla brings to the table with electric vehicles, renewable energy, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). And some may argue that it's redundant to include both Nvidia and Broadcom since they're both chip giants, but Broadcom has a much different business than Nvidia.
Nvidia generates the vast majority of its profits by selling graphics processing units and associated hardware and software to data centers. Like Nvidia, Broadcom makes AI chips, and AI is its fastest-growing segment, making up around 30% of total revenue in its latest quarter. But the bulk of Broadcom's business is not directly tied to AI.
End markets include networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, infrastructure software, and more. In fact, Broadcom was considered a dividend-paying value stock before its recent boom -- similar to another high-yield semiconductor stalwart, Texas Instruments.
Another ""value"" stock turned growth stock
Not long ago, Oracle was seen more as a mature tech stock with an entrenched legacy business and limited upside potential. Investors were more excited about hotter software stocks like Salesforce, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Palo Alto Networks. However, Oracle has completely transformed its business, integrating cloud infrastructure as a complement to its foothold in database software and enterprise applications.
Oracle has carved out a growing role in the cloud that is uniquely different from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Oracle's hybrid and multicloud strategy integrates with the major cloud players, which allows customers to use Oracle's database advantages even if they're with another cloud provider.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers some advantages over AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, including lower prices in some cases, more AI tools, and vertical integration with the company's other database services.
Some drawbacks of OCI are that it has a smaller ecosystem with fewer preset tools for developers. However, Oracle is growing faster than the major players with a 27% year-over-year cloud revenue increase in its most recent quarter, including a 52% rise in cloud infrastructure revenue.
Like Broadcom, Oracle is a great addition to the Ten Titans because it's a highly diversified company that's playing a growing role in AI.
FAANG's anchor is a worthy addition to the Ten Titans
Netflix was an integral part of FANG and FAANG, but it fell out of favor for a while as it underperformed the broad market. The streaming company is now worth around half a trillion dollars, which has catapulted it to the top 20 S&P 500 companies by market cap.
Netflix has pulled back from its recent highs, but the stock has still crushed the S&P 500 year to date. A big reason for its rebound in recent years is its improved cost management and more purposeful spending.
A major problem with the business in the past was the boom-and-bust nature of its earnings. The company would steadily grow subscribers, but it would overspend on content and have dry spells without major success.
As you can see in the following chart, Netflix spent most of the 2010s being inconsistently profitable. But over the last five years, profits have skyrocketed and its operating margin continues to climb in lockstep with revenue.
The company has revolutionized entertainment and remains the gold standard in streaming, despite tons of new competition. A lot of that success comes down to its ability to balance the quantity and quality of content it produces.
It's time to add some all-stars to the team
Expanding the Magnificent Seven to the Ten Titans corrects for the blatant error of Broadcom's omission and includes massively important growth stocks in Oracle and Netflix. Over the next three to five years, it wouldn't be surprising if all of the Titans were worth over $1 trillion due to their industry leadership and runways for growth.
With a combined weighting of 37.7% of the S&P 500, the Ten Titans offer investors a useful way to track the top growth stocks that can really move the major indexes and keep tabs on prevailing themes that are driving the market.

With this rise, many growth stocks have reached new peaks of their own, and a decent portion of these are now sporting lofty valuations.
However, one of my favorite growth stocks has gone in the opposite direction. Despite its promising growth potential and rising margins, international sales helper Global-e Online(NASDAQ: GLBE) is down 50% from its highs as it battles short-term tariff headwinds.
The company is currently trading near its lowest-ever valuation. Here's why it's time to buy this promising, founder-led growth stock.
Growth options abound
Global-e Online aims to help merchants sell internationally as easily as they sell domestically. Typically, selling goods online in a foreign country is a highly complex task that's often not worth the battle for merchants to do in-house.
That's where Global-e's end-to-end platform comes in. Taking this complex sales process off of its merchants' hands, Global-e offers a full suite of global e-commerce enablement solutions, such as:
Region-specific pricing in more than 100 currencies.
More than 150 payment options, adjustable by location.
Local messaging for customers and website layouts in more than 30 languages.
Shipping options from more than 20 providers, with returns.
Duty and tariff calculations in more than 170 markets.
Zero-risk payment fraud.
Local-market knowledge that lets merchants act locally.
Solving these issues in just one country is challenging, but doing this across 20, 50, or 100 countries can be a nightmare. Add in the fact that merchants who have switched to the company's offerings see a 40% conversion uptick, and the value proposition of Global-e Online's platform is clear.
Thanks to the value it provides to its merchants, the company has grown revenue sevenfold since 2020. Despite that incredible growth, Global-e still has less than a 1% market share of the $1.1 trillion cross-border e-commerce industry.
This small market share leaves a lengthy growth runway ahead for the company. Here are the four most crucial growth areas to watch.
1. Add new merchants
In 2020, Global-e added new merchants that did $287 million in gross merchandise volume (GMV). By 2024, this number had quadrupled. Now more than 1,400 merchants strong, the company regularly inks new deals with major retailers and brands such as Manchester United, FC Barcelona, Adidas, Victoria's Secret, and LVMH.
Management has stated that its payback period on new merchants is less than nine months across multiple geographies, meaning that customer growth doesn't take long to become profitable.
2. Grow alongside customers
Perhaps the most potent growth lever for Global-e is its ability to grow alongside its merchant customers. Since 2019, the company has grown its annual GMV per active merchant cohort by four times. This growth highlights the booming sales that new customers see as they expand into international markets with Global-e.
An example of this notion comes from Adidas, which expanded its partnership with the company from eight markets in 2021 to 27 today.
In total, Globel-e's merchants have grown their GMV four to five times faster than the overall e-commerce industry, making the growth stock a compelling investment idea.
3. Geographic and business-to-business expansion
Aside from adding more merchants and growing alongside existing ones, Global-e can also expand its economic footprint to grow. For instance, it's in the process of adding the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Indonesia to its supported countries.
Furthermore, the company has global sales expertise in the business-to-business (B2B) industry, which may be worth two or three times as much as traditional business-to-consumer (B2C). With the global B2B e-commerce market worth roughly $20 trillion in 2024 -- compared to $6.3 trillion for total online retail sales -- there's lots of potential for Global-e.
4. Managed markets with Shopify
Perhaps the best endorsement of Global-e's operations (and why I believe it has a wide moat) is its partnership with e-commerce juggernaut Shopify. The fact that an e-commerce darling as powerful as Shopify would rather partner with Global-e than try to sell internationally on its own speaks volumes.
Since combining to form Shopify Managed Markets, the companies have processed transactions for more than 10,000 merchants, filling orders in over 175 countries. Not only does this help grow Global-e's sales, but it acts as an incubator of sorts for potential customers for the company, as these smaller merchants grow their fledgling companies and brands.
Global-e's lowest-ever valuation
Despite all of these promising growth options and Global-e's widening moat, its stock is down 50% from its highs as the market seems to be worried about how tariffs will impact its business.
However, co-founder and President Nir Debbi believes that while these tariffs create short-term uncertainty, they may create long-term opportunities for the company. Added tariffs make international sales more complex, whether it's B2B or B2C, and that's when Global-e can step in to help.
Regardless, due to these headwinds, the stock now trades near its lowest-ever valuation.
Considering that Global-e expects to grow sales by 24% when it reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 13, this valuation is reasonable. Furthermore, management believes the company's 22% free-cash-flow (FCF) margin could grow to 26% to 28% over the long haul, which would make its valuation even cheaper.
Though the road to success may be bumpy since Global-e Online's operations are tied to tariff volatility, the company's growth potential, wide moat, and rising margins make it a spectacular opportunity at today's valuation.

Even as more Israelis express concern over the 22-month war, Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the ""central camps"" and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed that Israel plans it in both areas.
The crowded camps — sheltering well over half a million displaced people, according to the U.N. — had not been part of Israel's announcement Friday. It was not clear why, though, Netanyahu faced criticism this weekend within his ruling coalition that targeting Gaza City was not enough. Netanyahu said there would be ""safe zones,"" but such designated areas have been bombed in the past.
Netanyahu spoke with Trump about plan
Netanyahu's office late Sunday said he had spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the plan and thanked him for his ""steadfast support.""
Rejecting starvation in Gaza as well as a ""global campaign of lies,"" Netanyahu spoke to foreign media just before an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, a platform for outrage but little action on the war.
""Our goal is not to occupy Gaza, our goal is to free Gaza,"" Netanyahu asserted.
Netanyahu said there is a ""fairly short timetable"" for next steps there, but didn't give specifics. The goals, he said, include demilitarizing the territory, the Israeli military having ""overriding security control"" and a non-Israeli civilian administration in charge.
Israel wants to increase the number of aid distribution sites in Gaza, he said, but in a later briefing to local media, he asserted: ""There is no hunger. There was no hunger. There was a shortage, and there was certainly no policy of starvation.""
Netanyahu also said he has directed Israel's military to ""bring in more foreign journalists"" — which would be a striking development, as they haven't been allowed into Gaza beyond military embeds during the war.
He again blamed many of Gaza's problems on the Hamas militant group, including civilian deaths, destruction and aid shortages. ""Hamas still has thousands of armed terrorists,"" he asserted, adding that Palestinians are ""begging"" to be freed from them.
Hamas responded with a lengthy statement that summed up Netanyahu's remarks as ""blatant lies.""
U.S. defends Israel at Security Council meeting
The United States defended Israel, saying it has the right to decide what's best for its security. It called allegations of genocide in Gaza false.
The U.S. has veto power at the council and can block proposed actions there.
Other council members, and U.N. officials, expressed alarm. China called the ""collective punishment"" of people in Gaza unacceptable. Russia warned against a ""reckless intensification of hostilities.""
""This is no longer a looming hunger crisis; this is starvation,"" said Ramesh Rajasingham with the U.N. humanitarian office. ""Humanitarian conditions are beyond horrific. We have frankly run out of words to describe it.""
Israel faces growing action even by its closest allies. Netanyahu said Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany had ""buckled under"" the growing international criticism by stopping exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza. Merz, for his part, told public broadcaster ARD that Germany and Israel were talking ""very critically"" but Berlin's overall policies of friendship haven't changed.
More Palestinians killed as they seek aid
At least 31 Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in Gaza, hospitals and witnesses said. The Associated Press spoke to witnesses of gunfire in the Israeli-controlled Morag and Netzarim corridors and the Teina area in the south. All accused Israeli forces of firing at crowds trying to reach food distributions or waiting for convoys.
Fifteen people were killed while waiting for trucks near the Morag corridor that separates the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, according to Nasser hospital.
The situation is a ""death trap,"" said Jamal al-Laweh, who said Israeli forces opened fire there. ""But I have no other choice to feed the kids.""
Six were killed while waiting for aid in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, according to Gaza's Health Ministry and Shifa hospital.
In central Gaza, witnesses said they heard warning shots before fire was aimed toward crowds trying to reach a distribution site operated by the Israeli-backed and U.S.-funded Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The AP could not independently confirm who fired. Awda hospital said four people were killed by Israeli gunfire.
Six other aid-seekers were killed while trying to reach GHF sites in Khan Younis and Rafah, Nasser hospital said.
The GHF sites opened in May as an alternative to the U.N.-run aid system, but operations have been marred by deaths and chaos.
Responding to AP inquiries, the GHF media office said: ""There were no incidents at or near our sites today."" Israel's military said there were no incidents involving troops near central Gaza aid sites.
Hunger death toll among children hits 100
Israel's air and ground offensive has displaced most Palestinians and pushed the territory toward famine. Two Palestinian children died of malnutrition-related causes on Saturday, bringing the toll among children to 100 since the war began.
At least 117 adults have died of malnutrition-related causes since June, when the ministry started to count them.
The hunger toll is in addition to the ministry's war toll of 61,400 Palestinians. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, doesn't distinguish between fighters or civilians, but says around half of the dead have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties.
Labor strike urged in Israel over looming offensive
Hostages' relatives have urged a labor strike in Israel next week over the plans to expand military operations, fearing it will endanger their loved ones. Fifty hostages remain after being taken in the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war. Twenty are believed to be alive.
Dozens of people sat outside the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem to protest Israel's offensive. ""I think it's a horrible decision. It's like deciding that we don't want (hostages) alive anymore,"" said one, Milly Rothschild.",77adf3e22a67d0ce8e806445791b1e51,trafilatura,6657,0

Jason Lee and his wife Katie did that when, in July 2024, they moved themselves and their son from Columbus, Ohio, to Taipei, Taiwan.
Jason and Katie, both 34, came up with the idea after they brought Forrest, now 6, to visit his paternal grandparents in Taiwan when he was an infant.
They spent eight weeks together while Jason took paternity leave and saw how special it was for his parents to bond with their grandson.
Jason tells CNBC Make It that during their tearful goodbyes at the airport at the end of the trip, ""I just thought to myself, if I could make something happen where we could gift to [my parents] the extended amount of time that they could spend with this child, what a special moment that would be.""
At first he considered finding a way to move his career to Taiwan, until he realized he didn't want to deal with its demanding work culture.
So, the couple decided to save up for a true career break so they could spend time with family in Taiwan without having to work.
A $60,000 investment
The couple spent the next five years saving up for their sabbatical.
They timed it so Forrest would be in Taiwan for his kindergarten year, and decided to spend 13 months abroad to match up with the academic year, plus summer breaks, to get him back stateside for first grade.
Jason and Katie drew up the numbers and set a goal to save $60,000 for the move.
Jason says he viewed the goal like any household would save up for a home renovation project, and they used the You Need a Budget app to track their savings.
They set themselves up so their stateside expenses would be minimal while they were in Taiwan. Both of their cars are paid off, and the mortgage on the starter house they bought in 2016 is $1,200 a month. Jason says a friend is renting the house from them to cover their mortgage and leasing one of the cars while they stay.
As for their stay, they rented an apartment and spent months preparing their paperwork. Jason used his Taiwanese passport (he was born there and moved to the U.S. when he was 9), Forrest got his own Taiwan passport, and Katie obtained a spousal visa.
By the summer of 2024, Jason quit his job in sales, and Katie left her work at a nonprofit.
'This is not something that can afford to wait'
Jason says timing was important: Not only did he want to make sure Forrest had enough time with his grandparents and to adjust to kindergarten, but taking the leap was also crucial for himself, Katie and the grandparents.
""This is not something that can afford to wait,"" Jason says. ""If I don't do this now, I will forever lose my 30s. And then when am I going to re-explore myself again? In my 40s? My 50s? By the time I retire in my 60s? I just didn't feel like that was a good trade off.""
We are so happy right now, the happiest we've been as a family, and we are living our life on less than what we had before.Jason LeeAmerican on a sabbatical in Taiwan
What's more, he wanted to make sure that Forrest had time to interact with his grandparents while they are still in good health and mobile.
Overall, Jason says, ""as I look back to this year and I think about all the trips we were able to do and all the memories we were able to make, it's absolutely worth it.""
'We are so happy right now'
In addition to spending more quality time with family, Jason set a few personal and professional goals for himself for his sabbatical.
He says his career break has given him time and energy to focus on his physical and mental health, such as going to the gym, meditating, eating healthfully and working with a psychiatrist for the first time, thanks to Taiwan's universal health care system.
With more mental clarity, Jason says he's turned his attention to what he wants out of his career. Prior to his break, he says he put a lot of pressure on himself to have a high-performing sales year; when that didn't pan out, it took a toll on his sense of self.
""The whole last 10 years, I've been dictating my career next steps not based on what I want, but based on what the world or LinkedIn tells me I should want,"" Jason says.
He realized he felt pressure to continue climbing the corporate ladder to earn higher titles and more money. ""I just realized how much of that has set me up for being unhappy, when I don't prioritize myself or what I want.""
By March, he sat down with Katie with a big realization that once they returned to the U.S., they were OK with not chasing the same salaries they had before.
""I realized that our family doesn't need to make as much or more than what we made before in order to be happy,"" Jason says. ""We are so happy right now, the happiest we've been as a family, and we are living our life on less than what we had before.""
Returning to the U.S.
The Lees have big plans for their return to the states.
""The plan was always to return in August, but surprise, we got pregnant,"" Jason says.
The couple had discussed having their second baby during their sabbatical, given Taiwan's high quality of birthing and post-natal care for families.
Katie gave birth to their daughter, Ruby, in early July, so the family of four will return to the states in October when she has a passport and is able to travel.
Jason and Katie say their first career-related priority is for one of them to secure a job back in the U.S. as soon as possible to make sure their family has health insurance coverage. Jason says he'll consider taking a lower-paying job that affords more flexibility, like with a company that makes it easier to work summers remote in Taiwan.
Katie, meanwhile, has spent her sabbatical drafting business plans for two startup ideas, a vending machine business and a play cafe for kids and their parents or caregivers, and hopes to continue building out those ideas in the U.S.
As for their journey so far, ""it's just been so transformative for the family,"" he says.

Its chips can be found in popular consumer products like Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox, and even the infotainment systems inside Tesla's electric vehicles.
However, AMD's biggest opportunity right now is in the data center. The company is planning to launch a new lineup of graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI development in 2026, which could blow the competition -- including Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) -- out of the water.
AMD stock is up 34% in 2025 already, but it's still below its all-time high just north of $200, which was set last year. Should investors scoop it up while it's still trading at a discount? Read on to find out.
AMD is catching up to Nvidia in the data center space
AMD launched its flagship MI300X data center GPU at the end of 2023, more than a year after Nvidia's industry-leading H100 GPU hit the market. Despite being behind, AMD still managed to attract some of Nvidia's largest customers, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms.
While Nvidia continues to leap ahead of the competition with new GPU architectures like Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, AMD is quickly closing the gap. It just started shipping its MI350 series GPUs, which are based on a new architecture the company calls Compute DNA (CDNA) 4. These new chips offer 35 times more performance than CDNA 3 versions like the original MI300X, placing them on par with Nvidia's Blackwell lineup.
In fact, the latest MI355 offers comparable performance to Nvidia's Blackwell GB200 GPU, and it delivers up to 40% more tokens (words, symbols, and punctuation) in AI inference workloads for the same cost. In other words, it's much cheaper to run over the long term without sacrificing any processing power, which is why it's attracting hyperscalers and even leading AI start-ups like OpenAI.
But customers' attention is already turning to 2026, when AMD plans to release its MI400 series. These new chips will be combined with specialized software and hardware systems to create a fully integrated AI data center rack called Helios, which will supercharge their performance. AMD CEO Lisa Su believes these MI400-based Helios systems will be the most powerful in the world when they launch, offering a staggering 10 times more performance over the MI350 series.
Simply put, 2026 could be the year that AMD overtakes Nvidia in the AI data center space, at least in terms of technological capability.
AMD's AI data center revenue hit a speed bump in Q2
AMD generated a record $7.7 billion in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025, which was a 32% increase from the year-ago period. The data center segment was responsible for $3.2 billion of that revenue on its own, but it only mustered 14% growth, which was somewhat disappointing given the competitive, high-stakes nature of the GPU market.
Export restrictions were recently imposed by the U.S. government, and they wiped out AMD's AI GPU sales to China, which was the main reason for the underperformance in its data center segment. However, the company says it has applied for licenses to resume sales, and they are currently under review by the Trump administration.
But there was great news in other areas of AMD's business, like its client segment, where revenue soared 67% year over year to $2.5 billion. This is where the company accounts for sales of its Ryzen AI chips for personal computers, which come with a built-in GPU, central processing unit (CPU), and neural processing unit (NPU). They are installed in a growing number of computers from leading brands like Dell, HP, Acer, and Asus.
AMD's gaming business also roared back to life in Q2, with revenue surging by 73% to $1.1 billion. Revenue declined in this segment last year, and also during the first quarter of 2025, but demand for some of the company's core products is starting to rebound. Console manufacturers are increasing their inventories in preparation for the holiday season, and AMD said demand for its new Radeon 9000 series desktop GPUs is exceeding supply.
Should you buy AMD stock while it's under $200?
Despite the temporary regulatory headwind in AMD's data center business, Lisa Su is as optimistic as ever about its potential. She believes the company's AI revenue will scale into the tens of billions of dollars per year over the long term, driven by the MI400 GPU, which is already experiencing strong customer interest even though it won't hit the market until next year.
On that note, is AMD stock a buy while it's still below its record high? The company generated $3.45 in non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) over the last four quarters, placing its stock at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 46.8. That means it's notably cheaper than Nvidia stock, which is sitting at a P/E ratio of 55.7.
Moreover, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests AMD could deliver $5.97 in EPS during 2026, placing its stock at a forward P/E ratio of just 27.1. That leaves room for significant upside, because the stock would have to soar by 73% over the next 18 months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 46.8.
It's possible AMD stock will perform even better if the MI400 series blows the competition out of the water next year, like Su expects, so it could be a great addition to any diversified portfolio right now.

Trump said next Friday's meeting with his Russian counterpart on U.S. soil would focus on ending the war, now in its fourth year.
In response, Zelenskyy thanked European allies in a post on X, writing Sunday: ""The end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people.""
Trump-Putin meeting spikes worries
Saturday's statement by top European leaders came after the White House confirmed the U.S. president was willing to grant Putin the one-on-one meeting Russia has long pushed for, and suggestions from Trump that a peace deal could include ""some swapping of territories."" That raised fears that Kyiv may be pressured into giving up land or accepting other curbs on its sovereignty.
A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they aren't allowed to speak publicly, told The Associated Press that Trump remained open to a trilateral summit with both the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, but for now, he will have a bilateral meeting requested by Putin.
Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President JD Vance met Saturday with top European and Ukrainian officials at the British Foreign Secretary's weekend residence to discuss how to end the war.
Trump previously said he would meet with Putin regardless of whether the Russian leader agreed to meet with Zelenskyy.
The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there's no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace.
Calls for a lasting peace deal
Saturday's statement, signed by the president of the European Union and leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the UK, stressed the need for a ""just and lasting peace"" for Kyiv, including ""robust and credible"" security guarantees.
""Ukraine has the freedom of choice over its own destiny. Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,"" the statement said.
""The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine. We remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force,"" the Europeans added.
U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told NBC News on Sunday that a good deal would mean preventing an emboldened Russia, and aggressors elsewhere, from trying to once again redraw borders by force.
A Trump ally and Russia hawk, Graham nevertheless said that ""you can't end a war without talking.""
""I do hope that Zelenskyy can be part of the process. I have every confidence in the world that (President Trump) is going to go to meet Putin from a position of strength, that he's going to look out for Europe and Ukrainian needs to end this war honorably,"" he said.
He argued that ""Ukraine is not going to evict every Russian"" soldier, but said the West should give Kyiv robust security guarantees, keep some of its forces on the ground ""as trip wires,"" and keep arming Ukraine ""so that Russia will be deterred by the most lethal army on the continent of Europe.""
A fruitless push toward a truce
A monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking.
Trump also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The deadline was Friday. The White House did not answer questions Saturday about possible sanctions.
The Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO, and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country. Particularly galling for Kyiv is Moscow's insistence that it cede pockets of eastern and southern Ukraine, the Kremlin claims to have annexed, despite lacking full military control.
Mark Galeotti, a British expert in Russian politics who heads the Mayak Intelligence consultancy, says Moscow's tactic of encircling towns in eastern Ukraine has brought a string of territorial gains for Russia, and Putin ""does not appear to feel under pressure.""
For the Kremlin, ""further delaying any more serious U.S. action and the optics of a meeting with the U.S. president will already be wins,"" Galeotti argued in an analysis published Sunday by the UK's Sunday Times newspaper.
Zelenskyy rules out giving up territory
Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine ""will not give Russia any awards for what it has done"" and that ""Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.""
Ukrainian officials previously told the AP privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine's inability to regain lost territories militarily. But Zelenskyy on Saturday insisted that formally ceding land was out of the question.
Galeotti argued that any deal that involves Ukraine abandoning territory would be ""agonizing"" and politically dangerous for Zelenskyy.
Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelenskyy, noted on Sunday that Kyiv will strive to boost its position ahead of the planned Trump-Putin meeting.
""Ahead lies an important week of diplomacy,"" he said.
Pushing for sanctions
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Sunday that European leaders are ""intensively preparing"" ahead of the Alaska summit, while they ""hope and expect"" that Zelenskyy will be invited.
Merz told Germany's public broadcaster ARD that he has for weeks been encouraging Washington to toughen sanctions against Russia, adding that ""Putin only acts under pressure.""
Mikhail Kasyanov, Putin's first prime minister and later a political opponent, similarly told the BBC Sunday that the Kremlin would be more willing to negotiate seriously and make some concessions when sanctions have further strained Russia's economy.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Sunday praised Washington for taking steps such as allowing more military equipment to flow to Ukraine and imposing secondary sanctions on India for purchasing Russian oil, saying Trump ""clearly is putting pressure on Putin.""
""Next Friday will be important because it will be about testing Putin — how serious he is — on bringing this terrible war to an end,"" Rutte said in an interview with ABC News.",3dd5f4e9570b7037418f9875b9bc9065,trafilatura,6576,0

Palantir is a leader in artificial intelligence platforms, but Rishi Jaluria at RBC Capital says the stock could drop 75% due to its unsustainable valuation.
Super Micro Computer was an early leader in AI servers, but Michael Ng at Goldman Sachs says the stock could drop 49% as competition intensifies.
Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) shares have advanced 2,700% since January 2023, while Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) shares have advanced 470%. But certain Wall Street analysts think the stocks are wildly overvalued, as detailed below:
Rishi Jaluria at RBC Capital has set Palantir with a target of $45 per share, which implies 75% downside from its current share price of $182. He cited an unsustainable valuation as the primary reason for his sell rating.
Michael Ng at Goldman Sachs has set Super Micro Computer with a target price at $24 per share, which implies 49% downside from its current share price of $47. He cited margin pressure due to increased competition as a key reason for his sell rating.
Here's what investors should know about Palantir and Super Micro Computer.
Palantir Technologies: 75% implied downside
Palantir develops data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms for the commercial and government sectors. Its software not only helps clients turn complex data into actionable insights, but also lets them train and deploy machine learning models that drive better decision-making over time. Use cases range from retail and manufacturing to defense and financial services.
The International Data Corporation has ranked Palantir as the market leader in decision intelligence software, and Forrester Research recognized the company as a technology leader in artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms. That puts Palantir in a prime position. The data analytics software market is forecast to grow at 28% annually through 2030, according to Grand View Research.
Palantir reported exceptional second-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Customers increased 43% to 849 and the average existing customer spent 28% more. In turn, revenue climbed 48% to $1 billion, the eighth straight acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings increased 77% to $0.16 per diluted share.
Palantir is clearly a fundamentally sound business, but no business is worth buying at any price. The stock currently trades at an absurdly rich 133 times sales. For context, the next most expensive member of the S&P 500 is Nvidia at 30 times sales. That means Palantir's share price could drop 77% and it would still be the most expensive stock in the index.
Investors should never put too much confidence in forecasts from individual analysts, but Wall Street analysts in aggregate see Palantir as overvalued. The average target price is $151 per share, implying 17% downside from the current share price of $182. Investors should steer clear of this stock until it's priced more reasonably.
Super Micro Computer: 49% implied downside
Super Micro Computer (commonly called Supermicro) designs and manufactures storage systems, compute subsystems, and servers, including full server racks tailor-made for artificial intelligence and other high-performance computing tasks. Importantly, the company established itself as an early leader in AI servers based on its ability to quickly bring new chips to market.
To elaborate, Supermicro uses electronic ""building blocks"" across product lines to quickly assemble a broad range of servers. That strategy lets the company rapidly release hardware featuring the latest technologies from suppliers like Nvidia and AMD. In fact, CEO Charles Liang says Supermicro can often bring new AI chips to market two to six months before its competitors.
But that time-to-market advantage alone does constitute a durable competitive moat, and Supermicro has lost momentum as competition has intensified with Dell Technologies. The company announced dismal financial results for the June quarter. Revenue increased 7% to $5.8 billion, gross margin narrowed 70 basis points to 9.5%, and GAAP earnings fell 33% to $0.31 per diluted share.
Last year, management said gross margins would normalize around 14% to 17% by the end of fiscal 2025, but margins have continued to contract in a clear sign Supermicro is losing pricing power as the AI server space becomes more competitive. To that end, the company slashed its revenue guidance to $33 billion (down from $40 billion) for the fiscal year ending in June 2026.
Looking ahead, Grand View Research says AI server sales will increase at 38% annually to reach $850 billion by 2030. But Supermicro's earnings are likely to grow less quickly given it lacks a durable competitive moat. Indeed, Wall Street expects the company's adjusted earnings to increase at 28% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2027.
Admittedly, the current valuation of 23 times adjusted earnings still looks reasonable versus forward earnings estimates, but Wall Street has historically overestimated the company. Supermicro missed the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 13% over the last four quarters. So, while I doubt shares will plunge 49%, I still believe there are better places for investors to put their money.

SMCI stock once again regained traction as investors bet big on its leadership in the artificial intelligence (AI) hardware space, growing demand for next-gen servers, and close partnership with chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) — all of which painted a promising growth story.
But the narrative took a sharp turn in the wrong direction after the company dropped its fourth-quarter earnings report on Aug. 5. Shares of SMCI sank more than 18% in the following trading session, as Super Micro missed Wall Street’s expectations on both revenue and earnings. Even guidance fell short, sparking fresh concerns about slowing growth and rising competition.
Investor sentiment around SMCI stock has clearly taken a hit, and analysts' opinions are now deeply divided. On one end, the most bullish target on Wall Street suggests that SMCI stock could soar to $70, while on the other side, the most bearish sees it dropping all the way to $15 per share. So, with expectations stretched so far apart, can SMCI defy the doubts and reclaim its momentum? Or is there more downside still to come?
About Super Micro Stock
Super Micro Computer specializes in building high-powered, energy-efficient servers to support surging demand from AI, cloud services, and data centers. With operations across the U.S., Taiwan, and the Netherlands, the company has built a solid international footprint and currently holds a market capitalization of $27.8 billion.
After sliding last year under the weight of negative headlines, SMCI stock came roaring back in 2025, hitting a fresh high of $66.44 in February. Even after pulling back some 32% from that peak, the stock remains up an impressive 50% so far this year, well ahead of the broader S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) modest 8.5% gain year-to-date (YTD).
However, the comeback rally appears to be facing turbulence lately. SMCI is once again under pressure following its latest earnings miss, with shares tumbling 19% in just the past five trading days.
A Look Inside Super Micro’s Q4 Earnings
Super Micro’s fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter earnings report released earlier this month came as a letdown to investors, missing Wall Street’s expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue for the quarter rose 7.4% year-over-year (YOY) to $5.8 billion but still fell short of the $5.9 billion analysts had expected. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.41, marking a notable 24% decline from the prior year and falling below the consensus estimate of $0.44, partly because of the impact from President Donald Trump’s tariffs on goods imported into the United States.
While the company pointed to tariffs as a key reason for the earnings shortfall, the miss stung even more given the backdrop of soaring demand for AI infrastructure, which had set investors’ expectations sky high. Instead of a blowout quarter, the results revealed mounting cost pressures and thinner margins, casting doubt on Super Micro’s ability to deliver strong profits even as sales continue to rise.
A key red flag was the drop in gross margin, which slipped to 9.5% from 10.2% a year ago. The decline suggests the company may be facing pricing pressure or higher costs, likely tied to competitive dynamics or more expensive AI components. As of June 30, Super Micro reported $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents, alongside $4.8 billion in total bank debt and convertible notes.
Unfortunately, the disappointment didn’t end at Super Micro’s Q4 financials. The company’s guidance for Q1 of fiscal 2026 also fell short of expectations. Management expects revenue to land between $6 billion and $7 billion, while adjusted EPS is expected to be between $0.40 and $0.52. Both of these figures miss Wall Street’s forecasts for $6.6 billion in revenue and $0.59 in EPS.
Over the longer term, analysts tracking Super Micro project the company's bottom line to rise 19.2% YOY to $2.05 per share in fiscal 2026, then leap 21% annually to $2.49 in fiscal 2027.
What Do Analysts Think About Super Micro Stock?
After the disappointing Q4 showing, several Wall Street analysts struck a more cautious tone. For instance, JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee lowered the firm’s price target to $45 from $46, maintaining a “Neutral” rating. Chatterjee pointed to capital constraints and customer hesitation as key reasons the company fell short of expectations.
On the other hand, Bank of America Securities analyst Ruplu Bhattacharya slightly raised the price target to $37 from $35 while sticking with an “Underperform” rating. The analyst noted that gross margins were pressured once again, this time due to inventory reserves for older products. Bhattacharya explained that many customers are opting to wait for Nvidia’s upcoming B300/GB300 GPUs, which has weighed on current demand.
Overall, Wall Street sentiment on Super Micro is tilting cautious, with SMCI stock earning a consensus rating of “Hold.” Among the 16 analysts covering the stock, opinions are clearly mixed. Only four recommend a “Strong Buy,” while three lean toward a “Moderate Buy.” The majority of analysts take a wait-and-see approach, with six suggesting “Hold.” On the bearish side, one analyst has a “Moderate Sell” rating for SMCI and two assign a “Strong Sell” rating, reflecting growing uncertainty around the company’s near-term outlook.
SMCI stock has a Street-high price target of $70, indicating nearly 54% potential upside. The lowest target of $15 suggests a steep 67% drop from current levels.
Key Takeaways
Super Micro’s wide price target range, spanning from $15 to a Street-high of $70, underscores the uncertainty surrounding its near-term trajectory. While some analysts remain bullish on its long-term AI-driven potential, others are wary of execution risks and margin pressures. With sentiment this divided, the stock’s path forward may remain volatile as investors wait for more apparent signs of sustained growth.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffetts-warning-wall-street-102800895.html,74b0ec50bbedf8ea98e6eecbf42884ae,Warren Buffett Warning to Wall Street on President Donald Trump Tariffs Is Deafening,Warren Buffett Warning to Wall Street on President Donald Trump Tariffs Is Deafening,2025-08-10 12:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) reported its second-quarter earnings results on Aug. 2. Buffett will be stepping down as the company's CEO in a little under five months, and investors are likely paying close attention to the last reports with him at the helm. Although the company's operating results came in strong, investors may have been disappointed that Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its own stock.
In addition to watching the usual earnings metrics, investors are always parsing through Buffett's letters and Berkshire's regulatory filings on the hunt for clues about how Buffett and his team feel about the economy. In its Q2 report, Berkshire specifically mentioned President Donald Trump's tariffs. The company's warning to Wall Street only grew louder.
Berkshire's businesses are emblematic of the economy
While Buffett had expressed concerns about the U.S. trade deficit with other countries in the early 2000s, he and Berkshire have made it pretty clear that they are not a fan of Trump's tariff plans.
Earlier this year, during an interview with CBS, Buffett called tariffs ""an act of war to some degree."" He also said that the U.S., throughout its history, has significant experience with tariffs, and he believes that over time they are a tax on goods. ""I mean the tooth fairy doesn't pay them,"" he said.
About five months later, the tariff drama has wound down, and the market has seemingly gotten used to Trump's negotiating style of seeming to play hardball and then choosing a tariff rate that tends to be a little bit easier to digest. That said, I think tariff rates have come in higher than most experts and pundits expected. Imports from most countries are looking at a rate of 15%, while imports from more than a few countries currently face rates in the 20% to 40% range, as of this writing.
Make no mistake, those rates are significant and will have an impact. While tariffs are projected to bring in significant revenue for the U.S. government, most experts, including Buffett, view them as a tax that someone has to bear. Additionally, Trump's constant changing of tariff rates and the resulting uncertainty are likely leading many businesses to hit the pause button on hiring and their capital expenditure plans.
On its Q2 earnings report, Berkshire wrote:
Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by the impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical conflicts and events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events. The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events. We are currently unable to reliably predict the ultimate impact on our businesses, whether through changes in the availability of products, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services. It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses, as well as on our investments in equity securities, which could significantly affect our future results.
This, in my view, makes more deafening the warning to Wall Street, especially when you consider that Buffett typically tries to stay out of politics.
It's also important to note that Berkshire Hathaway, one of the largest conglomerates in the world, owns companies across most sectors. In addition to its nearly $300 billion equities portfolio, Berkshire owns one of the largest insurance businesses in the U.S., significant energy assets, the Burlington North Santa Fe Railroad, a large mortgage business, and smaller businesses in other sectors, giving the Berkshire team strong visibility into the broader economy.
The big threat from tariffs
While Berkshire did not spell out specifically how tariffs could adversely impact all of its operating businesses, it's reasonable to assume that Berkshire's team is concerned about an uptick in inflation that, paired with higher unemployment, could put the economy and Federal Reserve in a bit of a pickle.
While inflation on the whole has not surged higher just yet, as some had feared, it is starting to rear its head in certain areas that would be more impacted by tariffs like apparel, toys, and appliances. Businesses are also starting to announce charges from tariffs, including the major U.S. car companies, as well as major retail and apparel companies.
It's possible that tariffs lead to a one-time hit to inflation, but the longer the uncertainty continues, the longer companies stay on pause. Already, there are signs of weakness in the labor market. It's also possible that tariffs stall growth and inadvertently lead to disinflation (a slowing of inflation). Regardless, the Fed and most others want to avoid a stagflation scenario where both unemployment and inflation rise, putting the Fed in a bind, where it can't raise or lower interest interest rates without raising unemployment or reigniting inflation.
Since the big tariff scare in April, the market has largely been able to shake off worrisome tariff news and events. But as more and more data piles up, the market won't be able to ignore the signs forever.

And this time they’re eyeing up the Government’s bond market.
It may sound like a boring trade, but investors are making huge profits by borrowing tens of billions of pounds against UK debt, known as gilts.
The aim? To profit from minute differences between the cash price of a bond today and what it may be worth several days, weeks or months from now.
This strategy, known as a “basis trade”, makes money by exploiting the tiny gap between the two prices – buying one for a lower price and selling another for a higher price in a good old fashioned game of arbitrage.
Such is the high risk, low reward nature of these types of trades, that they have been likened to “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller”.
But these “masters of the universe”, as Tom Wolfe once wrote, are far smarter than that. To really make it worth their while, hedge funds borrow money from banks to juice up their returns – turning these fractional pennies into big bucks.
Yet such is the popularity of the strategy that regulators are now becoming increasingly alarmed about the dangers these funds pose to the British financial system.
In many ways, their involvement has been welcome. Hedge funds – which face less regulatory scrutiny than banks – are performing the role of linking buyers and sellers that used to be done by more traditional lenders.
Thriving in an environment of high volatility, hedge fund traders are able to let their hair down in a way that banks cannot.
However, as Richard Hughes, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility recently highlighted, these “fickle and flighty” investors are more likely to be looking for short-term gains than a long-term relationship.
“These overseas investors are, by their nature as comparison shoppers in the global debt market, likely to be more fickle and flighty than their domestic counterparts,” he warned last month.
Andreas Dombret, a former German central bank official, puts it more simply: “They’re the first to leave the party if things get rough.”
The Bank of England is also keeping a close eye on developments. Its latest Financial Stability Report (FSR) warned that the big global footprint of these funds “increased the risk that stress in one market could spill over into others” – triggering huge fire sales in times looming financial chaos.
So what could go wrong?
The role of hedge funds in the bond market has grown significantly in recent years.
Earlier this year, Bank deputy governor Sir Dave Ramsden said that hedge fund involvement in the gilt market had almost doubled from 15pc of trades in 2018 to around 30pc today.
Historically, pension schemes had been the largest buyers of gilts, particularly long-term debt. But this demand has started to dry up, as the era of the final salary pension scheme comes to an end, at least for private sector workers.
Part of the reason for hedge funds’ huge appetite for gilts is that they can be used as collateral to borrow more money from banks.
To juice up their returns on the “basis trade”, hedge funds raise money through so-called repurchase agreements – or repos – where investors can swap bonds for cash.
Gilts are put up as collateral: if banks don’t get paid back they get to keep the gilts. And they use this money to buy more debt. As of June, hedge funds had borrowed £77bn from banks to recycle back into gilts – the highest level since records began in 2016.
This also represents the largest increase in borrowing across the so-called shadow banking sector, according to Threadneedle Street.
But it doesn’t take a genius to spot the risks involved. If hedge funds are using their gilts to borrow money to recycle into more gilts, then it only takes one small unexpected price movement for the house of cards to start wobbling.
The Bank is watching this explosive growth closely over fears it could create another doom-loop spiral.
It said growing holdings of gilts by hedge funds also raised the risk of a borrowing shock, with 90pc of net borrowing on the repo market concentrated among just a handful of hedge funds.
“This concentration means that a rapid unwind of leveraged positions by a few key players could amplify shocks during periods of high volatility,” the Bank warned.
Households and businesses at risk
It’s not just investors that risk getting hurt. The Bank has warned that a wider leverage-fuelled sell-off could push up borrowing costs for households and businesses.
After all, the liability driven investment (LDI) crisis triggered by Liz Truss’s mini-Budget pushed up mortgage costs for millions of borrowers.
Andrew Bailey’s recent inaugural speech as head of the world’s most powerful financial watchdog, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), saw him warn about the dangers of history repeating itself.
Reeling off a list of near misses in terms of financial meltdowns, he noted that American hedge funds were forced to unwind $90bn (£66bn) of their so-called “basis trade” positions as they became largely loss-making.
“Public authorities had to intervene in unprecedented ways to prevent further market dysfunction and strain on the real economy,” said the Bank of England Governor, as he described the US bond market seizure triggered by Donald Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs as a “near miss”.
However, a drive for more financial reporting and disclosure has met with resistance and has been watered down after a backlash from the industry.
Back in the UK, regulators are pressing ahead with proposals for more scrutiny, with a discussion paper in the works that could ultimately push more government bond trading towards central clearing houses, which charge a margin that effectively eats in to how much hedge funds can borrow.
Policymakers are also examining whether regulators can impose lower valuations lower than the market price on assets used to back a repo transaction, also removing the appeal of borrowing this way.
Changes in how the gilt market functions are likely to be permanent.
Regulators must now scramble to keep up as the risks continue to keep central bankers around the world awake at night.
Soros may have broken the Bank of England. But the Bank must be ready to make sure it doesn’t happen again.",28ae554cf12250c6f490f672293b679a,trafilatura,6283,0

In fact, he and his team of investment managers at Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) have been net sellers of stocks for 11 straight quarters.
Buffett's stock sales have accelerated over the past five quarters. That includes monster sales of Berkshire's stakes in Apple and Bank of America. In the meantime, he's stopped buying one stock investors had seen him buy consistently each quarter since mid-2018. As a result, Berkshire's cash pile has climbed to a whopping $344 billion.
But the market may be offering Buffett an opportunity to start buying his favorite stock again, and investors should consider doing the same.
Buffett isn't timing the market
Buffett's big stock sales over the last few years and his lack of purchases may be seen by some as the Oracle of Omaha trying to predict the future and time the market. While it might look like market timing, Buffett is merely sticking to what's worked for him as an investor for the last 60 years or so.
""We try to price, rather than time, purchases,"" Buffett wrote in his 1994 letter to shareholders. The same could be said of Berkshire's stock sales. If the market is offering a massive premium on one of Berkshire's holdings, Buffett ought to sell it, pocket the cash, and look for opportunities in stocks trading well below their intrinsic value. That could even include buying Berkshire Hathaway shares themselves.
In fact, the board of directors updated its share repurchase policy in 2018, allowing Buffett to buy back shares of the company as long as it traded below its intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Buffett quickly went to work buying back shares following that change, indicating that the stock looked like a bargain. Between 2018 and May 2024, Buffett spent $78 billion buying back shares of Berkshire Hathaway.
Over the last 14 months, however, Buffett hasn't spent a single dollar buying back the stock based on Berkshire's quarterly earnings reports. He holds himself to the same high standards he expects of the CEOs of all the companies Berkshire invests in. ""All stock repurchases should be price-dependent. What is sensible at a discount to business-value becomes stupid if done at a premium,"" he wrote in his 2023 letter to shareholders.
But Berkshire shares have fallen considerably since Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year during the company's annual meeting in May. And after a further sell-off sparked by its second-quarter earnings report, shares are starting to look a lot more appealing. That could open the door for Buffett to start buying back Berkshire's stock.
Will Buffett start buying again?
Berkshire Hathaway's earnings disappointed many investors, leading the market to sell off the stock.
After a stellar 2024, the insurance business is back to more normalized operations, including big payouts earlier this year due to the California wildfires. That's led to a drop in underwriting profits, which pushed the conglomerate's total operating earnings down nearly 4% last quarter. It's worth noting, however, that Berkshire faced significant foreign exchange headwinds last quarter, which negatively affected operating earnings.
Berkshire also wrote down its Kraft Heinz investment by $5 billion. That follows a $3 billion impairment charge it took in 2019. That further negatively affected reported earnings.
Nonetheless, Buffett has seen the book value per share of Berkshire Hathaway climb, including a 2.1% gain from the first quarter, and a 10.9% increase from a year ago. Combined with the declining stock price over the last three months, Berkshire Hathaway shares now trade for a price-to-book ratio of about 1.5.
That's an important valuation, because when Buffett last repurchased shares of Berkshire, the stock traded below that valuation. The stock has rarely dipped below that price since last May. But shares are certainly more attractive after the sell-off.
A couple of factors could keep Buffett from buying at the current price. First, Berkshire's marketable equity portfolio is a significant factor in its book value. Buffett may still see most of the stocks in the portfolio as overpriced, especially as stocks continued to climb over the past year. That would push him to require a lower multiple for Berkshire stock, since repurchasing Berkshire shares would also mean purchasing a small piece of its equity portfolio.
The other factor is that he may want to use a significant chunk of cash to bolster the railroad business in the near future. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have agreed to a merger, threatening the competitiveness of Berkshire's Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
When you consider the strength of Berkshire's balance sheet and that it's not relying on insurance float for any capital at this point, it should trade for a higher price-to-book value ratio than it has historically. With shares trading around 1.5 times book value, the stock finally looks to be trading near its intrinsic value again, making it worth buying.

The master limited partnership (MLP) sports a 7.4% yield and has been growing its distribution nicely in the past few years. While MLPs come with some extra paperwork at tax time, the majority of their distributions are deemed a return of capital and are tax-deferred until the stock is sold.
What's even more exciting, though, is that the midstream company is entering a new growth phase, and its backlog of attractive projects is starting to pile up. This should lead to solid growth in the coming years.
The company recently announced a new large growth project right around the time it posted its second-quarter results.
Growth projects keep piling up
Just ahead of its earnings announcement, Energy Transfer announced a new $5.3 billion natural gas pipeline project called the Desert Southwest pipeline that will take natural gas from the Permian to markets in Arizona and New Mexico. The pipeline will be able to handle 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), and it expands the company's Transwestern natural gas pipeline network. The project is expected to be complete by the end of 2029 and is backed by significant long-term commitments.
This follows the company's already announced Phase 1 of its Hugh Brinson Pipeline, which also will have 1.5 Bfc/d of capacity takeaway from the Permian to markets in Texas. Phase 1 of the project is expected to come online by the end of 2026. Energy Transfer also just agreed to go through with Phase 2 of the project, which will give it the ability to transport approximately 2.2 Bcf per day of natural gas from west to east and approximately 1 Bcf per day from east to west. The company said that the project ""establishes Energy Transfer as the premier option for customers seeking a flexible and reliable natural gas solution to support their power plant and data center growth plans.""
Energy Transfer also said it is making substantial progress toward the commercialization of its Lake Charles LNG project. LNG (liquified natural gas) exports are one of the hottest areas of the energy market. The long-awaited project looks like it may finally get the green light, with it finding a partner for the project in MidOcean Energy and signing a number of offtake agreements. The company is also in advanced discussions with some offtake partners for them to take an ownership stake, and it ultimately plans to own about 25% of the project.
The company also remains excited about the opportunities it sees coming from data center customers. It said it continues to see a significant level of activity and that it is in advanced discussions with several facilities in close proximity to its footprint.
Overall, the company is spending $5 billion in growth capital expenditures (capex) this year, and it has a lot more projects lined up. Half its current growth spending will be on natural gas-focused projects.
Turning to its Q2 results, Energy Transfer grew its adjusted EBITDA in the quarter by 3% year over year to $3.87 billion. Distributable cash flow (DCF) to partners fell 1% to $1.96 billion, down from $2.04 billion a year ago.
Volumes were up across its systems, including an 11% year-over-year jump in interstate natural gas volumes, a 10% jump in midstream gathered volumes, a 9% rise in crude oil volumes, and an 8% increase in intrastate natural gas volumes. However, the company saw some reduced pipeline optimization in its Texas intrastate pipeline system due to lower spreads, and it saw lower crude transportation revenues on its Bakken pipeline system.
As a result, the company now expects its full-year EBITDA to be at or slightly below the low end of its $16.1 billion to $16.5 billion guidance.
Time to buy Energy Transfer stock
While the slight reduction in guidance is disappointing, the long-term story for Energy Transfer looks bright. The number of growth projects the company has in front of it is just piling up, with it generally expecting to get a mid-teens return on these projects. The larger projects are still a ways off, but they should provide the company with a strong runway of growth in the coming years.
At the same time, investors get a nice distribution that is well covered by the company's DCF. For Q2, its coverage ratio was a robust 1.7 times. The company is looking to grow its distribution by a 3% to 5% annual rate moving forward, and it increased its quarterly payout by more than 3% year over year last month to $0.33 per unit.
Meanwhile, about 90% of its 2025 EBITDA is coming from fee-based operations, with many of its contracts having take-or-pay provisions, so this is a nice steady business. The company's balance sheet is also in good shape.
Turning to valuation, the stock trades at a forward enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple of just 8.1 times. That's toward the low end of its MLP peers and below the 13.7x EV/EBITDA multiple the average MLP traded at between 2011 and 2016.
With a lot of growth ahead, a robust yield, growing distribution, and cheap valuation, Energy Transfer looks like a great option for income-oriented investors moving forward.

A new survey shows exactly what the average American believes it takes to achieve it -- and if you're falling short, there's a simple way to build a net worth of $1 million or more with a few hundred dollars per month.
There's a high bar for financial comfort
Earlier this year, Charles Schwab conducted a survey of over 2,000 U.S. adults ages 21 to 75. Participants were asked how much money they believe it takes to be ""financially comfortable,"" and the results were broken down by age range.
Among all participants, the average net worth needed to be considered ""financially comfortable"" was $839,000. That's up from $778,000 in 2024 and $624,000 in 2021. The answers also varied across generations, with baby boomers having the highest expectations for financial comfort.
Source: Charles Schwab. Table by author.
The survey also asked participants how likely they thought they were to ever achieve this goal. While 28% said they believed they were already on track to be financially comfortable and another 25% said they could achieve it with some lifestyle changes, 27% said they don't think they'll ever get there.
But it's simpler than you might think to build wealth with the stock market. If you're new to investing or just want a low-maintenance option, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a smart choice.
ETFs are bundles of stocks grouped together into a single investment. With just one share of an ETF, you can own hundreds or even thousands of stocks at once. They make fantastic long-term investments for building significant wealth with minimal effort, and these three choices can help you reach your financial goals.
1. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF
An S&P 500 tracking fund like the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: IVV) aims to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 itself. The fund contains stocks from 500 of the largest U.S.-based companies, many of which are industry leaders and have experienced many decades of consistent growth.
This type of ETF is one of the safer options, making it ideal for risk-averse investors who have plenty of time to let their money grow. It has a flawless track record of surviving periods of volatility, and the extensive diversification within an S&P 500 ETF can also help limit risk.
Historically, the S&P 500 has a compound annual growth rate of 10%. If you were earning a 10% average annual return and had a goal of reaching $1 million in savings, you' would need to invest around $300 per month for 36 years.
2. Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF
The Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: SCHG) is similar to the S&P 500 ETF in that it only contains large-cap stocks. However, it's somewhat smaller, with only 230 holdings, and it's more focused on stocks that have the most growth potential.
This ETF can be a good fit for those looking for a somewhat safer growth fund. Large-cap stocks in general can be less volatile than smaller stocks, and many of them have a long history of surviving downturns. That said, growth stocks often carry more risk than those from more established companies, so growth ETFs are not quite as surefire as, say, an S&P 500 ETF.
Higher risk can often come with higher reward, however, and this fund has earned an average rate of return of 16.73% per year over the last decade. At that rate, investing $300 per month would add up to just over $1 million after around 25 years.
3. Vanguard Information Technology ETF
The Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has the highest risk of the three ETFs on this list, but it's also the one with the highest potential earnings.
With a focus solely on tech stocks, this ETF has earned explosive returns since its launch in 2004. With new innovations in technology -- particularly artificial intelligence -- the fund could have even more room for growth in the coming years.
However, because the tech industry can be incredibly volatile, be prepared for more significant short-term ups and downs. This ETF has, historically, been hit much harder than the S&P 500 and other broad-market funds during slumps. If you choose to buy, be sure you're willing to hold your investment for at least a few years and double-check that the rest of your portfolio is well diversified.
Despite its short-term volatility, this ETF has earned an average rate of return of 21.58% per year over the last decade. If it continues earning those types of returns, you could accumulate $1 million by investing $300 per month for around 21 years.
Achieving financial comfort is a goal nearly everyone shares, and while it may seem out of reach for some, investing in the stock market is one of the most effective ways to get there. No matter how much you can afford to invest, small amounts can add up to more than you might think over time.

To this end, the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick the dividend stocks that support consistent payments.
Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance
Chevron
The first dividend-paying company in this week's list is energy giant Chevron (CVX). The company recently delivered market-beating earnings for the second quarter. However, earnings declined compared to the prior-year quarter due to lower oil prices. Meanwhile, Chevron expects the recently completed Hess deal to begin contributing to its earnings in the fourth quarter of this year.
In Q2, Chevron returned $5.5 billion of cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $2.6 billion and dividends of $2.9 billion. CVX stock offers a dividend yield of 4.4%.
Following the Q2 print, Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott resumed coverage of Chevron stock with a buy rating and a price target of $174. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an ""outperform"" rating on CVX stock with a price target of $171.
McDermott highlighted Chevron's Q2 earnings beat. The analyst said that the recent closing of the Hess acquisition removes a major overhang and strengthens CVX's business. The Hess deal is expected to enhance Chevron's growth and portfolio duration.
Additionally, the 5-star analyst noted that while Chevron has lagged peer Exxon Mobil (XOM) in recent years, the Hess deal, along with the Tengizchevroil (TCO) project and cost-cutting measures, is expected to close the gap on growth, at least over the next 2 to 3 years. ""With a ~$12.5B cash flow inflection underway, CVX's 2026 FCF [free cash flow] yield of 8% compares to XOM at 6% and COP at 7%,"" said McDermott.
McDermott ranks No. 406 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 59% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.6%. See Chevron Statistics on TipRanks.
Rithm Capital
We move to Rithm Capital (RITM), an asset manager with significant experience in managing credit and real estate assets. The company recently announced better-than-expected second-quarter results. Rithm Capital paid a dividend of 25 cents per share for the second quarter of 2025. At an annualized dividend of $1 per share, RITM stock offers a dividend yield of 8.2%.
Reacting to the Q2 performance, RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee raised his price forecast on Rithm Capital stock to $14 from $13 while reaffirming a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on RITM stock.
The top-rated analyst noted that Rithm Capital reported Q2 2025 earnings available for distribution (EAD) of 54 cents per share, surpassing RBC and the Street's consensus estimate of 52 cents. Given the strong results, Lee raised his EAD per share estimate for 2025 to $2.24 from $2.21. He also raised his 2026 EAD per share estimate to $2.30 from $2.27.
""We favor RITM as it pivots towards being an alternative investment manager, with a fee-based, capital-light business model, over time,"" said Lee.
Based on management's comments, Lee noted that Rithm might not spin off or list its Newrez business and would rather focus on growing the earnings stream within the business. He views RITM's renewed focus on growth and ROE (return on equity) enhancement positively. Lee also highlighted that Rithm Capital is seeing notable cost benefits through the implementation of initiatives related to artificial intelligence.
Lee ranks No. 22 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 74% of the time, delivering an average return of 18.7%. See Rithm Capital Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.
AT&T
Finally, let's look at telecom giant AT&T (T). The company delivered better-than-anticipated second-quarter earnings, topping market expectations for wireless postpaid subscriber additions. AT&T offers a quarterly dividend of $0.2775 per share. At an annualized dividend of $1.11 per share, AT&T's dividend yield stands at about 4%.
In reaction to the Q2 results, RBC Capital analyst Jonathan Atkin reiterated a buy rating on AT&T stock with a price target of $31. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" rating with a price target of $30.
Atkin explained that AT&T's Q2 revenue beat was driven by higher-than-expected Wireless equipment revenues. Furthermore, adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) exceeded expectations, thanks to the strength in the company's Wireline business, which offset softer Wireless profits.
The analyst noted that AT&T's revised 2025 guidance reflects cash tax benefits, the improved trajectory of the Wireline business, and a more competitive Wireless backdrop. Atkin added that the company's free cash flow outlook was revised to the low-to-mid $16 billion range compared to the previous guidance of more than $16 billion, which implies that most of the cash tax benefit will be reinvested into fiber capex and pension funding.
The 5-star analyst stated that while estimates for revenue, EBITDA, and EPS for 2026 and 2027 remain unchanged, AT&T's free cash flow outlook was increased by $1 billion for both years to reflect cash tax benefits, net of incremental investments. Atkin stated that he supports management's decision to prioritize capital investments that are expected to drive long-term growth, and ""highlight the company's traction in switching off legacy networks.""
Atkin ranks No. 234 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.3%. See AT&T Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.",7054b8ff57f9f0f8d75a9501a8dc8a25,trafilatura,5876,0

Despite some big instances of volatility and risk factors along macroeconomic and geopolitical lines, the S&P 500 has risen roughly 7% across 2025's trading and isn't far removed from its all-time high.
On the other hand, some strong businesses have actually seen significant valuation contractions this year -- and taking a buy-and-hold approach to the best of the bunch could be a path to fantastic returns. If you're looking for top stocks trading at substantial discounts compared to their all-time highs, read on to see why two Fool.com contributing analysts think that these industry-leading companies stand out as great investment opportunities right now.
Amazon stock: Down 12% from its high
Keith Noonan (Amazon): Sometimes, the market has a gut reaction to a company's earnings report that seems to miss the forest for the trees -- and these instances can sometimes present big opportunities for investors. I think Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock is one of those types of opportunities on the heels of its recent second-quarter report.
The technology and e-commerce giant notched per-share earnings of $1.68 on revenue of $167.7 billion, which crushed the average analyst estimate's target for earnings per share of $1.33 on sales of $162.11 billion. Despite the very strong quarterly results, Amazon stock saw a significant pullback following its second-quarter report.
Amazon stock is down roughly 2.5% across this year's trading, and its share price is down approximately 12% from its all-time high.
The company guided for high levels of spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure to continue, and some investors were concerned about the near-term impact the big build-out initiative will have on profitability.
Amazon's Q2 report also arrived the same day that disappointing July jobs numbers were reported and the day after the Trump administration unveiled a series of new tariffs, which certainly didn't help set the stage for a big post-earnings rally. Amazon's recent business execution and Q2 results don't seem to have gotten all the kudos they probably deserve, but that will likely change with time.
Heavy spending on AI infrastructure, robotics, and other potentially explosive growth drivers will certainly put some pressure on Amazon's earnings in the near term, but making big investments in these categories is probably among the smartest things the company can be doing right now. Amazon's recent quarterly report was a reminder of the company's strengths, and the stock looks like a great portfolio addition for long-term investors.
Target stock: Down 62% from its high
Jennifer Saibil (Target):Target(NYSE: TGT) has been a massive disappointment for shareholders over the past few years. It's been dealing with problems as fundamental as lower consumer discretionary spending and as fleeting as negative public opinion about its political beliefs. However, there are many signs of light amid the darkness, and Target stock's low price looks compelling for long-term investors.
In its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended May 3), sales were down 2.8% from last year, and comparable sales (comps) were down 3.8%. However, digital comps were up 4.7%, driven by a 36% increase in same-day services from its membership program. This category has been a bright spot in Target's reports throughout this challenging time. It's a good indication that loyal customers are finding value, and under better circumstances, Target can rebound.
Today's operating environment is still hostile to a retailer like Target, which is a discount retail chain focused on discretionary shopping. Unlike Walmart, which is one of the country's biggest grocers, Target's sweet spots are categories like apparel and home improvement. Home improvement in particular is still suppressed since the real estate industry has been in a funk.
Target tends to perform well under better conditions, and that's likely to happen again. In the meantime, it continues to upgrade the digital platform and loyalty program, where growth is happening.
Target is a Dividend King, an exclusive status applied to companies that have raised their dividends for at least 50 years straight. It means the dividend is reliable, which is a crucial feature for many dividend investors, and that you can count on it to grow. With the stock down roughly 62% from its high, Target's dividend yields 4.4%, or more than three times the S&P 500 average.
As the S&P 500 continues to rise, it's getting harder to find bargains, but Target stock is still cheap. It trades at a forward, one-year P/E ratio of roughly 13, which makes it a great time to buy for long-term investors, especially if you're looking for passive income.

Can the Stock Go to the Moon ? ","The Largest Space Tech IPO of the Year Just Launched , With a $6 . 3 Billion Valuation . Can the Stock Go to the Moon ? ",2025-08-10 23:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Firefly Aerospace (NASDAQ: FLY) just pulled off its second-most impressive launch of the year.
The most impressive launch came in January, when the company sent its new uncrewed Blue Ghost module to the moon. The mission's success gave Firefly bragging rights as the first U.S. company to execute a fully successful soft lunar landing (that is, landing without causing serious damage to the module). It also generated a huge wave of interest in the company.
That interest is clearly still white-hot, because Firefly's Thursday IPO launched the company onto the Nasdaq at a valuation of $6.3 billion. Can it rocket even higher? Or will it fall back to earth?
What Firefly actually does
Fans of the canceled-way-too-soon space Western Firefly will be sad to learn that the company's name isn't actually related to the TV series. Instead, it's a name Firefly founder Tom Markusic -- a former SpaceX and Virgin Galactic (NYSE: SPCE) engineer -- selected to embody a hypothetical future in which rocket launches are as common in the night sky as fireflies.
Indeed, Firefly Aerospace has gone all-in on making launches more frequent and more accessible. It developed the Alpha rocket, a smaller, lighter rocket manufactured from carbon fiber composites that launched a satellite into orbit with just 24 hours' notice in 2023. While the Alpha is certainly lighter (and thus, less expensive to launch) than most other commercial rockets, the roughly one-ton payload capacity is somewhat restrictive: Firefly's Blue Ghost lunar lander, for example, was too heavy for the Alpha rocket and had to be launched using a SpaceX Falcon 9.
Firefly is also working on the Elytra orbital vehicle and lunar imaging service Ocula. The company has nine planned non-test missions through 2029: five for NASA, one for the U.S. Space Force, and three for commercial clients, for a total current project backlog of $1.1 billion.
Why its stock might take off...
With more companies (and people) heading to space, demand for cheaper spaceflight is likely to skyrocket (no pun intended). As a company offering a more affordable rocket that has already had successful launches, Firefly is well ahead of many would-be competitors.
Additionally, Firefly is receiving investment and support from industry heavyweights including Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and L3Harris (NYSE: LHX). In May, Firefly received a $50 million investment from Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC). Being in the good graces of such major aerospace players is a big advantage for the start-up, both financially and reputationally.
Today's commercial space industry is a fairly crowded place, with companies big and small jockeying for limited funds and contracts. However, early success tends to encourage investment, which fuels future success. Firefly seems to have all the right ingredients, including an active contract pipeline, major industry partnerships, and a few successful early missions. If it can keep it up, it could be the next SpaceX...or maybe an even bigger success story.
...and why it might not
For an 11-year-old company, Firefly has had a checkered past, which includes IP issues, a 2017 bankruptcy, government intervention over national security concerns, and an abrupt July 2024 CEO departure (current CEO Jason Kim took the helm in October 2024). Meanwhile, private equity firm AE Industrial Partners controls the company with a 40.9% stake; the firm's employees currently hold five of Firefly's nine board seats. As the IPO prospectus notes, ""AE Industrial Partners controls us, and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future.""
That's...a lot, and we haven't even gotten to the company's financials.
Because it's an IPO, we don't even have a full quarterly financial report from Firefly yet. But its IPO prospectus shows a net loss of about $125 million in the first half of 2025, along with negative free cash flow of about $97.5 million, with just $205.3 million in cash on its balance sheet and $173.6 million in debt. Not a pretty picture.
Now, it's not unusual for new start-ups to have high net losses and negative free cash flow, but given the lack of context and details, it's worth asking: Does this business deserve a $6.3 billion valuation? How about $8.4 billion, which the company briefly hit on its first day of public trading Thursday?
To me, that seems pretty expensive for an unproven business with opaque financials in a competitive, high-risk industry that's controlled by a venture capital firm and led by a brand new CEO. Before I'd buy shares, I'd want to at least see a few quarterly reports to get a clearer picture of how the company operates. It would still be a risky bet, but right now it feels too risky to buy.

The oil and gas giant's low-cost operations enable it to produce significant free cash flow. This allows it to invest in growing its operations, return cash to investors through dividends and buybacks, and maintain its fortress-like financial profile.
The company's already robust cash flow will become even larger in the coming years. A combination of growth initiatives and cost savings is now on track to add $7 billion to its annual free cash flow total by 2029. That will give the oil stock even more money to return to shareholders.
Drilling down into ConocoPhillips' second-quarter results
ConocoPhillips' ability to print cash was on full display during the second quarter. The company generated $4.7 billion in cash from operations, despite a 19% decline in the average price it realized per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) sold during the period compared to the second quarter of last year. It was able to partially mute the impact of lower commodity prices by significantly increasing its production. Its output averaged nearly 2.4 million BOE per day in the quarter, 446,000 BOE per day higher than the year-ago period. ConocoPhillips benefited from its acquisition of Marathon Oil, as well as a 3% increase in output from its legacy operations.
The oil giant used that cash to fund $3.3 billion of capital expenditures and investments to maintain and grow its output. It also paid $1 billion in dividends, repurchased $1.2 billion of shares, and retired $200 million of debt at maturity. That brought its year-to-date total to $2.7 billion in share repurchases, $2 billion in dividend payments, and $700 million in debt reduction.
The company ended the quarter with $5.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and $1.1 billion in long-term investments, backing its fortress A-rated balance sheet. It padded its cash position by closing the sale of $700 million of non-core assets during the quarter and $1.3 billion through the first half of this year. ConocoPhillips has recently agreed to sell an additional $1.3 billion of non-core assets, which should close early in the fourth quarter. As a result, it has exceeded its target of selling $2 billion of assets following its acquisition of Marathon.
The upcoming free-cash-flow growth wave
ConocoPhillips expects to generate significantly more free cash flow in the future. In the near term, the company expects higher cash distributions from its APLNG investment, tax benefits from the ""one big, beautiful bill,"" and lower capital spending to boost its free cash flow in the second half of the year. That assumes oil prices remain near their current level in the $60 to $70 a barrel range.
The company also continues to expect to get a boost from its acquisition of Marathon Oil. It's on track to achieve its target of hitting $1 billion in cost savings from synergies by the end of this year, double its initial target of $500 million. Additionally, the company now expects to deliver another $1 billion in cost and margin enhancements by the end of next year.
Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips continues to anticipate its long-cycle investments in liquified natural gas (LNG) and Alaska will fuel a $6 billion uplift in its free cash flow through 2029. The company has investments in three LNG projects (Port Arthur LNG in the U.S. and Qatar's North Field East and North Field South) that should come online over the next few years. The energy company continues to secure customers for this gas. It recently signed a regasification agreement for the Dunkerque terminal in France and a sales agreement in Asia, both of which will begin in 2028. Additionally, its major Willow project in Alaska should start producing by 2029.
On top of all this, ConocoPhillips now plans to sell another $2.5 billion of non-core assets by the end of next year. These sales will give it additional cash to strengthen its fortress balance sheet or recycle into higher-quality assets.
The company's growing free cash flow and cash balance will enable it to continue returning more money to investors. ConocoPhillips aims to deliver dividend growth within the top 25% of companies in the S&P 500 in the coming years. It also aims to repurchase over $20 billion of its stock in the first three years of closing the Marathon deal.
A cash-producing juggernaut
ConocoPhillips now expects to capture another $1 billion in cost savings from its Marathon deal. It's also on track to produce $6 billion in incremental free cash flow from its investments in LNG and Alaska. That will give the oil company a lot of money to return to shareholders in the future. Its combination of growing cash flows and rising cash returns could provide the fuel to produce strong total returns in the coming years, making it an attractive oil stock to consider for the long term.

Reddit's (NYSE: RDDT) website doesn't feature flashy graphics or funky designs; rather, it's a set of online discussions about almost any topic imaginable.
This outwardly mundane presentation hides a high-potential operation that has more than proved it can deliver the goods for investors. Given that, I think the stock price growth of the dowdy-looking Reddit can trounce that of social media peers Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) and Snap (NYSE: SNAP) over the coming year.
The social media rock star of the moment
The excitement over Reddit across the past few days stems from its second-quarter earnings report, published Friday morning to a thunderously positive reception by the market (which sent the share price more than 21% skyward in morning trading alone).
Revenue surged 78% higher on a year-over-year basis to $500 million, powered by all-important ad sales that rose 84% to $465 million. The bottom line according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) flipped to a well-in-the-black profit of $89 million, against a $10 million deficit in the same quarter of 2024. Free cash flow (FCF) ballooned by $84 million across that stretch to $111 million. Both headline figures blew past analyst estimates.
As for operational metrics, the company's count for daily active uniques (DAUq) -- users that it defines as those ""whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the Reddit website ... or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period"" -- leaped by 21% year over year to over 21 million souls. How's that for engagement?
Reddit's guidance for its current (third) quarter was similarly impressive. It's projecting $535 million to $545 million for revenue, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $185 million to $195 million. Analysts were anticipating a top line of barely over $473 million.
The right site at the right time
So, what's the secret sauce for Reddit?
Sure, management has launched several clever, growth-fueling initiatives, including dynamic product ads (DPA), rolled out in May. These spots match topics of the site's ""subreddits,"" and embed within them to serve users who are obviously or apparently looking to buy such products/services. In the ideal case, the ads are doubly beneficial, as a shopper in need of guidance gets a tailored recommendation, and a theoretically ideal consumer is targeted by an advertiser.
Also in the realm of ads, Reddit is future-forward with its embrace of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for ad creation. With these, an advertiser can garner real-time information on trends in the discussion threads, plus integrate positive user comments into the ads themselves.
But I don't believe Reddit's big leaps are mostly due to these (admittedly impressive) technologies. Rather, I think it's more a function of what the company offers as a service. With the ability to generate meaningful discussion about almost anything and provide answers for a near-limitless variety of questions or concerns, Reddit is growing in both authority and utility.
As successful as Meta's Facebook and Instagram and Snap's offerings have been, they're not really venues for information swapping or edification. They're fun places to share things with friends and acquaintances. However, you would be hard-pressed to quickly access an effective informational discussion on the history of the Habsburg Empire.
I think analysts tracking social media and big-tech stocks have cottoned on to this. They're modeling nearly 60% (!) annual growth for Reddit on the top line for full-year 2025, with a 31% boost in 2026. The collective estimate for per-share profitability is $1.86, a night-and-day improvement over a $3.33 loss in 2024. That should balloon by 61% (!!) in 2026.
Neither revenue nor profitability are expected to surge anywhere near that high for Meta from 2025 to 2026. Analysts forecast Snap will improve its bottom line by 42% across that stretch, but with revenue growth of 11%.
High performance attracts investors, of course, so Reddit's valuations are comparatively much higher than its social media cousins (a dizzying 121 forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, against Snap's under 37, and Meta's sub-29). Yet this company has clearly captured the zeitgeist and possesses the user stickiness, the resources, and the managerial acumen to keep up those massive growth rates.
Of that trio, then, I would unhesitatingly buy Reddit stock.

The recent legislation provides for extended tax cuts and lays the groundwork for the long-term prospects of clean energy projects. Plug Power (PLUG), as a primary player in the hydrogen fuel cell business, stands to benefit significantly from this legislation.
The OBBB Act provides a 30% credit on all fuel cell purchases, while also eliminating some requirements, which broadens credit access. The act also extends the hydrogen production tax credit.
In the face of bullish sentiments about hydrogen, Plug Power is set to report its second-quarter results on Aug. 11 after the market close. Should you be excited about the upcoming earnings and PLUG stock?
About Plug Power Stock
Incorporated in 1997 and headquartered in Latham, New York, Plug Power develops hydrogen fuel cell systems used primarily to replace conventional batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) and equipment powered by electricity. Plug Power has a market capitalization of $1.73 billion.
Plug Power designs and manufactures fuel cells for applications in material handling, stationary power, and on-road vehicles. Beyond fuel cells, the company is building a comprehensive green hydrogen ecosystem, including production, storage, transportation, and refueling infrastructure. Plug Power is also investing in global expansion and innovation in electrolyzer technology to meet growing demand in the renewable energy and hydrogen markets.
Concerns over Plug Power’s financials have not been favorable to the stock. Over the past 52 weeks, PLUG stock has declined by 27%, and so far this year, it has decreased by 29%. The stock had reached a 52-week high of $3.32 in January but is now down nearly 55% from that high.
Plug Power still has a lofty valuation. Its price-to-sales ratio is at 2.75 times, which is stretched compared to the industry average.
Plug Power’s Q1 Top Line Growth and Bottom Line Snags
On May 12, Plug Power reported its Q1 earnings for fiscal 2025. For the period, net revenue increased by 11.2% year-over-year (YOY) to $133.67 million, surpassing the $132.2 million that analysts had expected. Plug Power cited expanding electrolyzer deliveries, sustained demand in material handling, and “ongoing deployments” of its cryogenic platform as reasons for this growth.
While the topline growth has been holding steady, Plug Power remains unprofitable. It reported a quarterly gross loss of $73.86 million, which reflected an improvement from the prior year’s period. Plug Power also reported a loss of $0.21 per share, marking an improvement over the $0.46 loss per share in the year-ago period but missing the consensus Wall Street analyst estimate of a loss of $0.20 per share.
The company has also formed some meaningful partnerships recently. In July, Plug Power signed a multi-year supply agreement with a popular industrial gas company. This secures a long-term supply of hydrogen while lowering costs and potentially improving profitability. Plug also signed a commercial agreement with Uline, a logistics firm, establishing a strategic relationship that will last through 2030.
For the second quarter, Plug Power expects revenue to be in the range of $140 million to $180 million. The company also expects improvements in its gross margin and working capital levels. With its newly online capacity in Louisiana, the company aims to improve margins and reduce third-party fuel costs.
Wall Street analysts are still optimistic about Plug Power’s ability to recover its losses. They expect the company’s loss per share to narrow by 58.3% YOY to $0.15 for the second quarter. For fiscal 2025, they forecast a 78% improvement to a loss per share of $0.59, then a 42.4% improvement to a loss of $0.34 in fiscal 2026.
What Do Analysts Think About Plug Power Stock?
Several Wall Street analysts, while not entirely bullish on Plug Power, have notably raised their price targets on PLUG stock. In July, analysts at Jefferies raised the price target on shares from $0.90 to $1.60, while keeping their “Hold” rating. Analysts view the OBBB Act as a “clearing event,” although they are not entirely convinced about “the renewable names.”
In the same month, while expecting growth, Susquehanna analyst Biju Perincheril maintained a 'Neutral' rating on Plug Power stock. However, Perincheril also raised the price target significantly from $1 to $1.80, indicating a fresh bout of optimism.
Wall Street analysts recommend caution at the moment, giving Plug Power a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Of the 22 analysts rating the stock, five give it a “Strong Buy” rating, while four give it a “Strong Sell” rating. On the other hand, a majority of 13 analysts play it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $1.95 represents 29% potential upside from current levels.

It is not surprising, then, that investor sentiment is mixed right now. While around 35% of investors feel optimistic about the next six months, according to the most recent weekly survey from the American Association of Individual Investors, around 43% are pessimistic about the future.
Many stocks and funds are still reaching new heights, but is it safe to invest right now? Here's what you need to know.
An unstoppable growth ETF reaching record highs
Despite mixed feelings among investors, many funds are still surging -- including the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF(NYSEMKT: VOOG). This exchange-traded fund (ETF) reached a new all-time high on Aug. 8, climbing by more than 38% since its low point in early April of this year.
Although the market still faces a threat of a downturn or recession -- especially as new tariff policies begin taking effect -- this ETF is more likely than many other investments to withstand volatility while still helping you build wealth.
The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF includes only stocks that are listed in the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC). Making it into the S&P 500 is a high bar, and these stocks are among the largest and strongest in the U.S. While the index itself contains stocks from 500 companies, this ETF includes only 212 stocks with the most potential for growth.
That combination can make this ETF a particularly strong investment. Many stocks within the S&P 500 are industry-leading juggernauts, making them more likely to survive periods of volatility. At the same time, though, because this fund includes only those with the most growth potential, you're also more likely to see above-average returns over time.
In fact, over the last 10 years, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF has earned an average rate of return of 15.79% per year. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, by comparison, has earned an average return of 13.62% per year in that time.
Is it really safe to buy now?
Nobody knows when the next downturn will begin, how long it will last, or how severe it might be. But the good news is that, with the right strategy, there's never necessarily a wrong time to invest.
When stocks take a turn for the worse, your portfolio will likely lose value. But you don't technically lose any money unless you sell your investments for less than you paid for them. If you invest now, the market immediately plummets, and then you sell, you'll likely lock in significant losses.
However, if you simply hold your investment until stock prices eventually recover, your portfolio should regain any value it lost -- without you losing a dime.
For example, say you invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF in January 2022. The S&P 500 was about to descend into a bear market that would last nearly a year, and your ETF would have plunged by nearly 33% by October. But if you simply held on to your investment, you'd have earned total returns of nearly 36% by today.
In another scenario, say you'd waited until mid-2024 to buy. This ETF had fully recovered from the 2022 bear market by then, setting new record highs. While it may have felt safer to invest at that point -- and stocks still had many more months of growth ahead -- you'd have earned total returns of only around 23% by today.
Time is your best friend as an investor. If you can't hold your investments for at least five to seven years (or, ideally, a couple of decades), it can be a risky time to buy. In that case, you may be better off contributing to an emergency fund rather than investing your spare cash.
But if you're able to stay in the market for the foreseeable future, the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF is more likely than many others not only to recover but also to go on to experience long-term growth. Time in the market is far more valuable than timing the market, no matter what the future may hold.

You can then use that money to pay bills, pad your savings, or even have it reinvested back into stocks.
What's important when investing in income-generating investments is picking ones that you can safely rely on. Chasing high yields can lead to trouble later on if those payouts don't prove to be sustainable. In some cases, it's just bad luck where a dividend stock you've invested in ran into challenges that it couldn't get itself out of, and it had no choice but to reduce its payout.
Some risk is unavoidable when you're investing in individual stocks. And that's why, if your goal is to generate safe recurring income, you may want to consider investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can provide you with an easy way to diversify. Two ETFs that can be ideal options in this case are the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF(NYSEMKT: SCHD) and iShares Core High Dividend ETF(NYSEMKT: HDV). They both pay above-average dividends and can be excellent investments to hang onto for years.
Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF
The Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF promises investors a straightforward investing strategy that prioritizes things such as low costs, fundamental strength, and quality and safety when it comes to dividends. Those are essential items to consider when investing in dividend stocks. And at 0.06%, its expense ratio does indeed make it a low-cost fund, which makes it suitable for long-term investing; its fees won't put a big dent in your overall returns, even over several years.
With 103 holdings as of Aug. 5, the fund isn't overly diversified, and there are much larger ETFs. But what makes the Schwab fund ideal for income investors is its focus on quality stocks with good fundamentals. It isn't simply investing in a wide range of dividend stocks; the ETF carefully selects safe stocks, with many of them being high-yielding investments that pay more than the S&P 500 average of 1.2%.
Big-name stocks such as Merck, Verizon Communications, and PepsiCo are among its top holdings. By focusing on such high-yielding stocks, the ETF is able to average an overall yield of around 3.9%. That's exceptional, given the diversification you're getting with the fund.
In the past 12 months, the ETF is down over 1% but when including its dividend, its total return is positive and above 2%. And in five years, its total returns are north of 70%.
iShares Core High Dividend ETF
Another solid ETF to add to your portfolio can be the iShares Core High Dividend ETF. This fund is even more selective in its portfolio as it focuses on 75 of the best high-dividend stocks.
There will be some overlap with the Schwab fund, but one key difference is that in the Schwab ETF, the largest holding accounted for approximately 4.3% of the portfolio's weight, whereas in the iShares Core High Dividend fund, there are multiple stocks above that threshold. The top three stocks in this ETF -- ExxonMobil (8.5%), Johnson & Johnson (6.7%), and AbbVie (5.8%) -- account for a combined 21%.
So you get a bit less diversification with the fund and more of a position in its largest holdings, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's just important to be aware of the stocks you have the most exposure to, to ensure that you're comfortable with them.
The fund's expense ratio is 0.08%, which is comparable to the other fund on this list. Its yield of 3.5% is a bit smaller, but it's still a high payout overall. The bulk of its portfolio is allocated to sectors that have a great deal of long-term stability: healthcare, energy, and consumer staples. Collectively, those sectors represent 64% of all the stocks within the ETF.
This year, as investors have been seeking out safe stocks, the iShares ETF has rallied 6% in value, and with its dividend, the total return is nearly 8%.

It got so bad that the board decided the best course of action was to effect a turnaround under private hands. That deal means that Walgreens won't be a publicly traded company a year from now. But that isn't the whole story, and more aggressive investors might still be interested in the stock because of a unique nuance of the take-private transaction. Here's what you need to know.
From industry giant to going private
There are only a handful of large pharmacy retailers, and Walgreens is one of them. For many years it was a growth business, but eventually the market became saturated. Often there was a Walgreens on one corner and one of its competitors just across the street. It's not shocking that growth stalled out throughout the sector.
What happened next was that Walgreens looked for other ways to keep growing its business. It tried to buy into the pharmacy benefits management business, but that didn't go as well as hoped. And then it started to build out a healthcare clinic operation, but that didn't go as well as hoped. This company, which was on track to become a Dividend King, ended up cutting and then eliminating its dividend (the elimination came after the take-private agreement came about).
Walgreens had recently been working to right-size its business, including closing locations. However, the revamp is likely to be a large undertaking that will be difficult to effect in the public markets. Investors don't like it when companies shrink, and that's exactly what Walgreens is in the process of doing. So, in early March, it agreed to be taken private by Sycamore Partners Management for $11.45 per share. The transaction is likely to close sometime in the second half of 2025.
Why is Walgreens trading for more than the deal price?
Normally in a takeover situation, the stock of the company being acquired trades for slightly less than the takeover price. That's because there is always a risk that the deal falls apart. However, Walgreens' shares are trading hands for slightly more than the takeover price, which suggests that there is something odd going on here.
The wrinkle is that Sycamore Partners is planning on selling Walgreens' medical clinic business. And it will give Walgreens shareholders a chit that could be worth up to $3 per share, depending on the sales price it gets for the clinic business. So investors that are paying over $11.45 per share for Walgreens right now are, essentially, buying that chit, since they are locking in a loss on the Walgreens shares.
There's just one problem. There is no timeline for the sale of the clinic business. And there is no guarantee on the price that Sycamore Partners will extract from the buyer. So the $3 chit could be worthless or, conversely, the length of time it takes to see any money could be very long, reducing the time value of the potential profit. There's just no way to tell what the outcome will be.
And, as such, buying Walgreens today is not something that most investors should do, particularly if they are conservative by nature. More aggressive types that like special situations may like it, since the clinic business probably does have some value. But it is still a high-risk play that has a maximum upside of around 25%. That sounds like a lot, and it is, but only if the cash arrives quickly.
Walgreens will be gone in a year, but not forgotten
In one year, Walgreens will no longer be a public company. But it will linger in the minds of investors because of the $3 chit tied to the sale of the medical clinic business. That said, in the long term, it seems highly likely that Walgreens will eventually go public again -- with completely different shares -- hopefully with a better industry position. However, only aggressive investors should be looking at Walgreens right now.

The proliferation of artificial intelligence tools in web navigation have raised concern that Google, as well as companies that rely on consumers reaching them through search results, could see their business take a hit. A study by the Pew Research Center found that users who encounter an AI summary when searching are about half as likely to click on a traditional search result than those who aren't met with one. Another survey from Bain found that 80% of consumers have come to rely on these ""zero-click"" results in at least 40% of searches — reducing organic web traffic by approximately 15%-25%, Bain said. But investors may be overestimating the hit these companies will take due to this shift. ""The death of search is greatly exaggerated,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives told CNBC. He pointed to Google-parent Alphabet 's latest quarterly figures as a sign that search remains strong. The company's second-quarter earnings and revenue, released July 23, beat analyst expectations. Its search engine business also raked in $54.2 billion in sales , while advertising revenue expanded by 10% to $71.3 billion. GOOGL 1M mountain GOOGL in past month ""Alphabet continues to defy the bears, just like this last quarter, and all of our survey data shows that search continues to be pretty robust from a query perspective,"" said Ives. ""Now, AI is clearly a near-term potential headwind for Google, but we actually believe they turn it into a talent."" Ives believes that Google — as well as rivals such as Meta Platforms — will learn how to monetize AI search. ""Google's key KPIs (traffic, search share, & mobile DAUs) were relatively stable in July, despite rapidly growing AI adoption across several sites, including Gemini. Data suggests AI-driven usage appears incremental, with growing adoption complementing, rather than significantly altering existing search activity,"" Bank of America analyst Justin Post wrote in a Tuesday note. ""We think Street could be underestimating AI driven upside potential for Google search and YouTube monetization. That's not to say all companies will be left unscathed by the rise of AI search. The potential losers While it's hard to pinpoint just exactly how this will affect business' bottom lines, Barclays anticipates that the impairments will begin to emerge more clearly from here. ""Over time, as search referral traffic declines, companies are faced with a challenging situation whereby they can: 1) maintain profit margins while watching their top line decelerate or decline, or 2) supplement the loss of search referral traffic by spending more on customer acquisition across paid channels, which would compress margins but keep growth rates consistent,"" the bank wrote in a July note to clients. ""In general, we view that neither of these are contemplated in the current consensus estimates over the medium term."" Barclays found that companies that rely more on web traffic from search results versus direct traffic are more likely to face a larger disruption. Direct traffic refers to instances where users directly type in a website into their URL address bar or access a website through non-search traffic channels such as social media. For instance, at just 29%, TripAdvisor has much lower direct traffic mix than Airbnb . Therefore, between the two companies TripAdvisor might be faced with a larger disadvantage. The chart below shows a website's direct traffic mix as a percentage of its total. The further right the company is, the more insulated it might be from the rising threat of AI to searches. Robert Pavlik of Dakota Wealth Management highlighted the following as stocks that could be negatively impacted by AI search: eBay , NerdWallet , Wayfair , Booking Holdings, Airbnb and Chegg . Wedbush's Ives believes that a site like Expedia Group has disproportionately more headwinds when compared to one like Booking Holdings . That's because demand trends for Expedia have weakened, while the site is much more exposed to advertising trends, he said. Still, both Pavlik and Ives remain think the impact from AI on search will not be as negative as the Street expects. Pavlik pointed out that while AI can help summarize search results, users will eventually have to click through to a site if searching for a product. ""Those general searches are probably going to be the ones that upset these companies going forward,"" he added. ""But even AI will have to direct you somewhere. ChatGPT doesn't sell you a chair for your living room, so probably will have to direct you to a site some way."" Ives even highlighted Pinterest as a stock he's bullish on amid the shifts in search. ""Just because the newer initiatives on modernization and engagement — I think the Street is underestimating what that's going to look like,"" he said.",a6de8246f07336619481dac1e7efef62,trafilatura,4931,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-buying-realty-income-stock-081200911.html,cd1e5d9fd8349f6eddb6e0ab4dadcfae,Could Buying Realty Income Stock Today Set You Up for Life ? ,Could Buying Realty Income Stock Today Set You Up for Life ? ,2025-08-10 11:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"A strong business foundation is the cornerstone of a company's operations, but also of your portfolio. Investors looking to set themselves up with a lifetime of high-quality income will want to start with great businesses that also happen to have high yields.
That is exactly what Realty Income(NYSE: O) and its lofty 5.6% yield offer today. Here's what you need to know.
Start with Realty Income's dividend
The S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has a miserly dividend yield of 1.2% today. The average real estate investment trust's (REIT's) yield is 3.9%. Realty Income's average yield over the past decade was roughly 4.5%. The net lease REIT's yield today is around 5.6%.
Let's break that down. Realty Income has a high yield on an absolute level. But the yield is also attractive relative to the broader market, REITs in general, and Realty Income's own yield history. If you are looking for a high-yield stock, now is a good time to be considering Realty Income for your portfolio.
But a high yield isn't going to set you up for life if it isn't reliable. So it's good news that Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for three decades. Within that streak, the dividend has been increased every quarter for 110 quarters (roughly 27 years). As if that wasn't enough, the dividend is paid monthly, so it is pretty close to a paycheck replacement. That should particularly interest investors who are entering retirement.
What about Realty Income's business?
If you're ready to buy Realty Income, don't. You still haven't heard about its business, which is the foundation that supports the dividend. As noted, it's a net lease REIT, which means that its tenants pay most of the costs associated with the single-tenant properties they occupy. Although any one property is high-risk, over a large portfolio, the risk is fairly low. Realty Income is the largest net lease REIT you can buy, with more than 15,600 properties.
The portfolio is highly concentrated in the retail sector (roughly 75% of rents), where properties tend to be very similar and, thus, are easy to buy, sell, and release as needed. The rest of the portfolio is split between industrial assets and unique investments in areas like agriculture, casinos, loans, and data centers.
On top of the property segment diversification, Realty Income also layers in geographic diversification. It invests in both North America and Europe, a region where the use of net leases is still fairly new. The company is also starting to offer management services to institutional investors.
Overall, Realty Income has a lot of levers to pull as it seeks to continue growing its business and dividend. But it also has a rock solid financial foundation, with an investment-grade rated balance sheet. Moreover, its industry-leading $50 billion market cap means that it can more easily tap the capital markets than smaller peers. Thus, it also tends to have advantaged access to capital, which allows it to compete aggressively for properties.
If there is one negative to consider with Realty Income, it's that the REIT's size limits its ability to grow. Basically, it takes a lot of investment to move the needle on the top and bottom lines. So slow and steady is likely to be the name of the game here, including when it comes to dividend growth. However, given the high yield, that's probably not the end of the world.
Realty Income is a foundational investment
Basically, if you add Realty Income to your portfolio, you have a reliable high-yield stock on which you can layer lower-yielding, but faster-growing, investments. Indeed, companies with rapid dividend growth rates often have modest yields. Realty Income paired with a dividend growth stock can leave you with a healthy income stream today (from Realty Income) and inflation protection (from the faster-growing dividend stocks). That can set you up for a very happy dividend-filled life.

Revenue soared 9.6% year over year to $94 billion, while diluted earnings per share climbed 12.1%. These headline figures beat Wall Street estimates.
Despite the upbeat results, Apple shares have disappointed. They're down 15% in 2025 (as of Aug. 6). And in the last 12 months, they are essentially flat. The S&P 500 index is up 22% during the same time. This trend doesn't inspire confidence among the investment community.
The general view is that Apple has so far fallen behind in the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) race. Apple Intelligence, its AI system that's integrated with its devices and software, has launched 20 different features for users. But it hasn't exactly had that wow factor that people are accustomed to seeing from Apple.
There was also supposed to be an AI-powered Siri launching in late 2024. However, this more personalized voice assistant won't be introduced until sometime in 2026. Big tech peers have gone full steam ahead in the meantime, while it appears that Apple is playing catch-up.
On the latest earnings call, though, CEO Tim Cook gave investors a reason to be bullish. ""We see AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime,"" he said on the Q3 2025 earnings call. Maybe he's finally starting to regard AI as a serious paradigm shift that can have huge implications for his business.
Apple is raising the amount of money it's spending on AI-related capital expenditures (capex). CFO Kevan Parekh said capex spending ""is going to grow substantially."" In Q3, the company's capex totaled $3.5 billion. Mergers and acquisitions could be part of the plan.
Therefore, investors shouldn't be surprised for Apple to push more aggressively into AI initiatives. This seems to be the right move from a strategic perspective. At the end of the day, it's all about Apple being able to bolster its competitive position. It's hard to say what new products or services will come next from this.
It's also difficult to see any meaningful effect on the company's financials. For Apple, this means being able to sell more devices and simultaneously grow the services segment. According to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Apple's revenue will rise 6.3% in fiscal 2025 and 4.8% in fiscal 2026.
Making accurate predictions is hard
It can be a valuable exercise for investors to understand the current situation that a business is in, as well as what the near future might hold. However, making correct predictions about the direction of a stock is almost impossible to do. There are so many variables at play.
For what it's worth, the consensus price target for Apple shares is $233.61, which implies 10.9% upside from today's price. That would certainly be an improvement from the last 12 months' performance. It's a gain that I wouldn't be surprised by.
But investors looking at Apple shouldn't make a decision based on what could happen over the next 12 months. Instead, it's worth assessing whether or not this is a business that you'd want to own for the next five years. That's the proper way to invest, with a long-term mindset.
Right now, Apple stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31.9. That's a high valuation to pay for a company whose growth is harder to come by these days. To be fair, Apple possesses one of the world's strongest brands, its products and services are hugely in demand, and its profitability is incredible. However, I don't believe investors who own this stock will achieve market-beating returns between now and 2030, regardless of what happens in the next year.

When she heard about President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill,"" which includes a section called ""no tax on tips,"" she said her first reaction was: ""It's a little too good to be true.""
Lopez said that in her experience, tax breaks often seem to include ""a catch,"" and she isn't sure the benefit will be as generous as some workers expect.
It's a reasonable question, experts say: Some key details of the provision — including which occupations and kinds of gratuities may qualify — are still unclear. There's also some confusion among workers about how the tax break works.

""A lot of people don't understand that you will still have to pay the tax on tips,"" she said.
How 'no tax on tips' works
Both Republicans and Democrats floated the ""no tax on tips"" idea during the 2024 presidential campaign.
The ""no tax on tips"" provision in Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" provides a deduction worth up to $25,000. This tax break, which is available even if you don't itemize deductions, reduces taxable income.
The deduction phases out, or gets smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000. The law is also temporary; the tax break is available from 2025 through 2028.
However, ""you're still likely paying state taxes"" on tip income, and you'll owe payroll levies for Medicare and Social Security, said Ben Henry-Moreland, a certified financial planner with advisor platform Kitces.com, who analyzed the legislation.
A lot of people don't understand that you will still have to pay the tax on tips.T. Coopera hair and makeup stylist in New York City
Deductible tips must appear on information returns from your employer, such as Form W-2 or 1099. But the agency's reporting rules for tip income remain unclear, experts say. For example, questions remain about how employers need to report tips on Forms W-2 or 1099 to qualify for the deduction.
Currently, workers who make $20 or more per month in tips must report those earnings to employers, according to the IRS. Tips can include cash directly paid by customers, payouts from tip-sharing structures among employees and credit card payments.
The IRS is expected to clarify which occupations qualify for the tax break in early October, per the agency.
What counts as 'qualified tips'
According to the provision, ""qualified tips"" include cash or gratuity paid by credit card, as well as earnings from a sharing arrangement.
But it also says tips must be paid voluntarily by the customer. That puts automatic service charges — like mandatory gratuity charges restaurants impose on larger parties — in question, experts say.
Adding to the reporting confusion, it's not unusual for those kinds of mandatory gratuities to mix with other tip income and simply appear as tips on tax forms, Lopez, the bartender, said of her experience.
Customers are tipping less
In some industries, tipping has decreased as consumer sentiment declines. During the second quarter of 2025, the average tip across restaurants, cafes and bars was at 14.99%, down from 15.17% the prior quarter, according to a new report by Square, a technology services company.
""As consumer confidence in the economy shifts and tips fall, workers are taking home less,"" Ming-Tai Huh, head of food and beverage at Square, wrote in the report.
Some consumers are also experiencing ""tipping fatigue."" About 41% of Americans said that ""tipping is out of control"" in 2025, up from 25% last year, according to a Bankrate report.
Some workers say higher service costs and reduced consumer spending have contributed to these tipping trends.
In the hair industry, prices typically rise every year as the cost of materials, rent and services go up, said Cooper.
""So it's not that people have an issue with tipping,"" she said. ""The service overall has just become way more expensive.""
In restaurants and bars, it's not unusual to see smaller checks these days, Lopez said, which makes your tip average decline.
For example, previously, a $200 tab could earn $40 in tips. But nowadays, a typical tab could be $100, she said, and ""you're only making $20 on the same guest.""",94fb1006a800a7137903c9790502e8a8,trafilatura,4600,0

Chan, the founder and head of content for branding agency Warm Robots, is also an author, a frequent keynote speaker and a LinkedIn Top Voice.
Still, she describes herself as an introvert at heart — which presented a challenge in growing her career.
""I think a lot of people underestimate introverts in the workplace,"" she says.
According to Chan, building a personal brand was key to her success. Earlier in her career, Chan worked ""completely behind the scenes"" in various marketing and social media roles, she says.
In 2017, she began posting short videos about pop culture branding and marketing on LinkedIn, which was beta-testing its video feature at the time.
Becoming a content creator wasn't initially her plan: ""I really thought, I'm just going to do this until I get my next full-time job,"" Chan recalls.
While in between roles, she posted over 800 consecutive daily videos — a pace she doesn't necessarily recommend ""unless you never want to sleep again"" — and quickly attracted a large audience.
Today, she has over 100,000 followers on LinkedIn, and that platform has helped her land new roles, obtain a book deal and share her expert advice as a Forbes contributor.
""I grew my own personal brand through a lot of consistency and hard work,"" she says.
Chan writes about how introverts can level up their careers in her upcoming book ""Personal Branding for Introverts,"" which debuts in October.
How introverts can master personal branding
Whether you know it or not, ""everyone has a personal brand,"" Chan says.
If the idea of a personal brand sounds intimidating, just think of it as ""something in your career that people know you for,"" whether that's your penchant for public speaking, affinity for colorful blazers or your humorous LinkedIn posts.
Developing a strong personal brand can help introverts bring their talents to the forefront and boost their careers, she says: ""It allows you to shape the story that other people are telling about you.""
Still sound scary? Chan hears that a lot.
""I've had so many introverts who have come up to me and said, 'I'm so terrified of growing my personal brand because I don't want to put myself out there,'"" she says.
Chan herself used to feel the same way. To combat her social anxiety, she challenged herself to speak with a new person at her local coffee shop each day for a month.
Just one small, consistent action can help you break out of your comfort zone, she says.
If you're nervous about reaching out to professional connections, commit to sending one networking email a month, Chan says. Trying to grow an online presence? Post one update a week.
""The more you do it regularly, the easier it is to keep going,"" she says.
Keep in mind that your personal brand doesn't just exist online. According to Chan, participating in social events like hobby groups or networking meetups can also contribute to building your brand.
Your unique interests help set you apart, she says, and you might be surprised at the opportunities that arise.
""A personal brand is never created in isolation,"" Chan says. ""Being involved in groups that interest you, even if they're not directly related to your career, can actually help with your career.""
She describes personal brands as the ""hub in the center of spokes.""
""All these different spokes are all the different things that you do, and they all connect back to a central hub — so whatever small things you do are always going to help your overall personal brand,"" she says.

This year, some of those ""sales tax holidays"" are happening as President Donald Trump's tariffs threaten to hike prices.
These holidays waive state sales tax (and sometimes local levies) on certain purchases for a set period. While eligible items vary by state, many include categories like back-to-school shopping or supplies for disaster preparedness.
""Sales tax holidays are politically popular because everyone likes tax relief,"" said Katherine Loughead, a senior policy analyst and research manager with the Center for State Tax Policy at the Tax Foundation, where she has researched the topic.
But ""it's not as good a deal"" as policymakers and consumers expect, she said.

While sales tax holiday supporters claim the policy boosts economic growth, some research suggests that consumers simply shift the timing of their essential purchases, Loughead said.
""Wealthier taxpayers are often best positioned to benefit from a temporary exemption"" because they have the flexibility to choose when to make purchases, Miles Trinidad, a state analyst for the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, wrote in a July blog post.
However, some middle- to lower-income families do plan for yearly sales tax holidays, particularly for bigger purchases like back-to-school shopping, experts say.
Shelly Werger, a mother of seven in Guttenberg, Iowa, says she tracked the timing of her state's Aug. 1-2 sales tax holiday. ""Everything is just getting so expensive right now that I am doing everything I can to save money here and there,"" she said.
However, in Iowa, the exemption only covers clothing and footwear under $100 and not school supplies, computers or sports equipment — ""we get a little bit of savings but not a lot,"" Werger said.
Which states have sales tax holidays for 2025
""A lot of states are offering sales tax holidays again this year,"" Loughead said. ""Some of them have gotten more generous, while others have been trimmed back.""
For 2025, 19 states have held or will hold sales tax holidays, which matches the number from 2024, according to the Tax Foundation, as of July 22.
Here's a breakdown of the dates for 2025, eligible items and price limits.
A money-saving tool for shoppers
Any money-saving opportunity, particularly ahead of the peak back-to-school shopping season, can be a benefit for families squeezed by higher costs.
A survey conducted last year by ParentsTogether, a national parenting organization, found that 75% of parents said back-to-school shopping causes significant stress, and 47% reported cutting back on food to afford school supplies.
More recently, a report from Intuit Credit Karma found that 39% of parents said they were unable to afford back-to-school shopping this year, up from 34% in 2024. Many of them started shopping earlier than usual to prepare for tariff-related price hikes and to take advantage of sales tax holidays along with other summer sales, the report found.
""Families are kicking off their back-to-school shopping earlier this year and are keeping an eye out for key ways to save, including retailer sales and deals as well as events like tax-free holidays,"" said Katherine Cullen, the National Retail Federation's vice president of industry and consumer insights.
While skipping the state tax could save up to 7% in some places, ""the even bigger impact is when you combine that discount with other savings strategies,"" advised Ted Rossman, Bankrate's senior industry analyst.
For example, ""you can combine that with a store promotion — maybe they give 30% off. You could use a rewards credit card for 5% cash back. And let's say you use an online shopping portal... for another 10% cash back,"" Rossman said. ""Something that would have cost you $100 (inclusive of sales tax) now might cost about half that.""",9bee8daa651bb923d9f4048b92abaa05,trafilatura,4068,0

MicroStrategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, and it's not even close.
-
The company recently reported a mammoth profit due to gains on digital assets.
-
Its Bitcoin-buying strategy has been working tremendously well, and other companies may follow suit.
Did you know that in five years, Bitcoin has risen more than 870% in value? It's a staggering return given that the S&P 500 is up just 91% over that same period. That's still a solid return, but it pales in comparison to Bitcoin.
But what may be even more surprising is that a company that has simply been loading up on Bitcoins has been a far better buy than the cryptocurrency itself. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), which now goes by just ""Strategy,"" has climbed a remarkable 3,000% in five years. It hasn't been experiencing huge sales growth or become a top artificial intelligence (AI) company. Instead, it has just been accumulating Bitcoins, and its enthusiasm for the cryptocurrency has made it a red-hot stock for retail investors to buy.
However, with the company already accumulating such massive gains in a short time frame, is it due for a crash or at least a correction? Or could it still be a good buy today?
More companies are following the same blueprint
Strategy's remarkable returns over the years haven't gone unnoticed by other businesses. More companies are also eagerly investing in the top digital currency in the world as they try to appeal to retail investors. Social media stock Trump Media and Technology Group has recently announced it bought $2 billion in Bitcoin. The stock, largely a speculative play, is likely hoping a similar bullishness in crypto sends its valuation soaring. It's now the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Some other notable names that have accumulated significant amounts of Bitcoin include Block and Tesla.
For Strategy, it is still far and away the leader, owning nearly 629,000 Bitcoins as of Aug. 4. The next-largest corporate position belongs to crypto mining company Mara Holdings, which has 50,000 Bitcoins. But the sheer success of Strategy's approach could entice other businesses to do the same and start accumulating significant holdings of Bitcoin as well. If the novelty of Strategy's stock wears off, that could result in less bullishness and excitement, potentially leading to more muted gains for it in the future.
A disconnect with fundamentals could make the stock ripe for a sell-off
Loading up on Bitcoins has enabled Strategy's valuation to grow to a market cap of $110 billion today. It's large enough to now be part of the Nasdaq 100 index, which is made up of the top non-financial stocks on the exchange. (Strategy is technically involved in providing companies with business intelligence and analytics software.) A quick look at some valuation metrics highlights just how egregiously priced the stock has become: Strategy trades at more than 200 times its revenue, and its estimated forward price-to-earnings multiple, which is based on analyst estimates, is over 1,200.",324c8550c30377a094b653651e65fcec,trafilatura,3038,0

Earlier in the day, Reuters reported Yuyuan Tantian, an account affiliated with Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, said in an article published on WeChat that the Nvidia H20 chips are not technologically advanced or environmentally friendly.
""When a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it,"" the Yuyuan Tantian article reportedly said, adding that the article said chips could achieve functions including ""remote shutdown"" through a hardware ""backdoor.""
In response, a Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC that ""cybersecurity is critically important to us. NVIDIA does not have 'backdoors' in our chips that would give anyone a remote way to access or control them.""
Nvidia on Tuesday similarly rejected Chinese accusations that its AI chips include a hardware function that could remotely deactivate the chips, also known as a ""kill switch.""
Tensions between the U.S. and China on semiconductor export controls have escalated in recent weeks, even after Nvidia resumed sales of its H20 chip to China. Chinese state media has framed the H20 chip as inferior and dangerous compared to Nvidia's other chips, while the company has defended its chips.
The company's resumption of its H20 shipments reversed a previous ban on H20 sales that was placed in April by the Trump administration. Nvidia's H20 chips — a less-advanced semiconductor compared to its flagship H100 and B100 chips, for example — were developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market after initial export restrictions on advanced AI chips in late 2023.
U.S. export controls on some Nvidia chips are rooted in national security concerns that Beijing could use the more advanced chips to gain an advantage broadly in AI, as well as in its military applications.
Chinese officials, meanwhile, are pushing for the U.S. to ease export controls on high-bandwidth memory chips as part of a trade deal before a possible summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has supported Trump's policies while also lobbying for export licenses for the H20 AI chip. Huang has said he wants Nvidia to ship more advanced chips to China, underscoring his outspoken stance that Nvidia's chips becoming the global standard for AI computing is ultimately better for the U.S. to retain market dominance and influence over global AI development.
China is among Nvidia's largest markets. Nvidia took a $4.5 billion writedown on its unsold H20 inventory in May and has warned that its topline guidance for the July quarter would have been higher by $8 billion without the chip export restrictions.
Nvidia shares were up 1% to close at $182.70 on Friday and are up 36% this year.",19ef2422ddae2d1e1042ca0de6a990c3,trafilatura,3000,0

1. Co-buying property
Ramsey despises the prospect of buying property with anyone besides a spouse. He advises against this even in long-term relationships.
This advice is rooted in the fact that separating assets between an unmarried couple can be complicated. They do not always share the same property rights as married couples.
However, the housing crisis has pushed more people to consider co-ownership of property. A report by Co-Buy, a platform that helps multiple buyers share a property, says 26.7% of home purchases in 2023 were co-purchases, while 30% of those co-purchases were completed by unmarried couples.
If you’re not in a position to purchase a home — whether on your own or with a spouse — you can still take advantage of real estate’s income-generating potential.
You can tap into this market by investing in shares of vacation homes or rental properties through Arrived.
Backed by world-class investors including Jeff Bezos, Arrived allows you to invest in shares of vacation and rental properties, earning a passive income stream without the extra work that comes with being a landlord of your own rental property.
To get started, simply browse through their selection of vetted properties, each picked for their potential appreciation and income generation. Once you choose a property, you can start investing with as little as $100, potentially earning quarterly dividends.

The company is absorbing an acquisition and had some contract delays.
-
A high-risk stock, Redwire looks like a promising technology developer with a lot of upside.
Shares of Redwire (NYSE: RDW) collapsed over 30% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The space and defense technology company had a drop in revenue last quarter and is posting large net losses. It is working on promising new technologies in satellites, drone surveillance, and even biotechnology solutions in space.
As of 3:34 p.m. ET on Friday, Redwire stock was down 35.1%. Here's why the high-risk company sank this week.
Delayed contract plans, new acquisition
On Aug. 6, Redwire released its earnings for the second quarter of 2025. Revenue was $61.8 million, down from $78.1 million in the same quarter a year ago. Profits were also elusive, with the company posting a net loss of $78.9 million, larger than its revenue in the quarter. While this is one of the first revenue drops for Redwire in many quarters, selling space and defense solutions to the U.S. government can sometimes be a lumpy business. Redwire said contracts were delayed to later in 2025 and into 2026 for projects such as the Golden Dome, which will have a huge budget from the United States.
On a positive note, Redwire was awarded over $90 million in contracts last quarter and has a pipeline of potential revenue at a staggering level of over $11 billion. As the company dives into cutting-edge technologies such as satellites and military surveillance drones, it will aim to win more and more contracts from the United States military and its allies. It is also looking into on biotech research and drug development in space with its new subsidiary, as well as working on missions to the moon and Mars.
The net loss figure for Redwire looks ugly, but some of that can be explained away as one-time occurrences. There were major one-time expenses in the quarter in relation to its acquisition of drone maker Edge Autonomy, as well as changes to contract estimates. Over time, most of these expenses should go away as the company completes contracts. It had a book-to-bill ratio of 1.47 in the period, meaning that the company had more orders placed than it fulfilled as its backlog ramps up.
Should you buy or sell Redwire stock?
Investing in new space and defense technology companies is tough. Many remain private such as Anduril or SpaceX, while Palantir Technologies trades at a premium valuation.
Redwire is unprofitable at the moment, but with a market cap of just $1.3 billion chasing technologies the U.S. government plans to spend tens of billions (if not hundreds of billions) on in the near future, it has a potentially bright future ahead of it. It remains a risky stock, but one investors may want to take a small position in if they want to get exposure to cutting-edge space and defense technology development.",1f86705716ce19d4386ab7b8d1396bbb,trafilatura,2913,0

After months of murmurs, the Trump administration is reportedly prepping to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) public, per the Wall Street Journal. The report adds that officials believe the offering could raise $30 billion in such a debut, valuing the two at ""roughly $500 billion.""
The two firms are operated by the federal government, which receives its profits and manages its day-to-day business through a conservatorship. The two firms were taken into government control after they faced significant losses on mortgage securities during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008.
In particular, the firms were heavily exposed to subprime mortgages. The government's takeover of the firms at the time helped stabilize the market. However, after 17 years under government management, officials in the White House believe that the firms have replenished their reserves and should be privatized.
One big incentive to doing so? A multi-billion dollar windfall for the federal government.
Related: Bill Ackman’s net worth in 2025: The hedge funder's wealth & income
Why IPO Freddie and Fannie?
An IPO of the two firms might read as perplexing for the unacquainted, seeing as though the two firms have traded on the OTC markets for nearly two decades despite being government-supported enterprises (GSEs). However, while the firms are run by the government, it is not a majority owner (at least, not directly.)
Instead, as part of the 2008 agreement, the U.S. government received warrants which entitled it to acquire the vast majority of the two businesses. Aside from that, the companies maintain their current private ownership. Among their largest shareholders is Pershing Square's Bill Ackman, a vocal proponent of their privatization.
Ackman, who has owned a sizable stake in the two for over a decade, has been banking on their privatization. In January, Ackman claimed that ending that conservatorship could boost the two stocks and help the government realize billions in profits from an IPO. Since the start of the year, when Ackman began boosting his investment case, Fannie and Freddie are up 183% and 132%, respectively.
What Happens After Privatization?
The GSEs currently serve a public mission: expanding housing access and increasing mortgage market stability. They do this by effectively guaranteeing the mortgages and lowering the risk of borrowing.
However, analysts warn that if Fannie and Freddie were privatized, doing away with this guarantee and public mission could affect housing access and affordability. Fair housing advocates say that those impacts would be most dramatic for lower income Americans and minorities. However, privatization of the two firms would almost certainly lead to higher rates, as the firms focus on shareholder value.",d024ce7b406a9ffc42dd0984bdf1a9ec,trafilatura,2906,0

Revenue for the quarter was $528 million, a 37% increase from $384 million a year earlier. Chime CEO Chris Britt attributed the revenue growth on the company earnings call to ""an acceleration relative to our seasonally strong Q1, when tax refund activity [drove] higher levels of re-engaged active members, purchase volume and revenue.""
Even though the company's main product line involves money management through digital high-yield savings and checking accounts, Britt emphasized to investors on the company earnings call that Chime is not a bank. ""Our member deposits reside in regulated FDIC insured accounts at our partner banks,"" he said.
Chief Financial Officer Matt Newcomb asserted that the lack of brick-and-mortar locations serves as a competitive advantage for the neobank.
""In contrast to incumbent banks, the [digital] platform allows us to efficiently scale our services over a growing active member base without needing to make massive investments in infrastructure or people,"" he said in the earnings call.
Chime currently serves 8.7 million active members, or consumers who have initiated a money movement transaction on the platform within the last month. According to the earnings report, 67% of those consumers rely on Chime for their primary financial relationship, a term the company defines as describing a consumer ""who made 15 or more purchases using their Chime cards in the past calendar month or who had at least one qualifying direct deposit of $200 or more through Chime.""
A William Blair analyst report said that ""investors should build Chime positions and see the company rapidly standing up a traditional bank alternative focused on spending, savings, and short-term liquidity products. … We see Chime as the top destination for individuals making up to $100,000 seeking to switch direct deposit relationships.""
The fintech's net income came out to -$923 million for the quarter, and diluted earnings per share came out to -$7.29 for the quarter. Chime gives employees a ""double-trigger"" stock option as part of their compensation plans, and those stocks vested due to the IPO. The stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes resulted in a one-time operating expense of $928 million for the company.
Chime's stock went down by 14% in trading on Friday.
Chime's successful IPO opening day in June set the stage for other fintechs considering or starting IPOs this year. The company also signaled a soft reopening of the IPO window for the U.S. market when it became the first fintech to file after the uncertainty of April's tariff announcements, particularly after Klarna delayed its IPO due to tariff-induced market volatility at the time.",391127e923538bc3e25b46f03de50faa,trafilatura,2802,0

Costco (NASDAQ: COST) is a good example. It is a great business that is growing well right now, but the valuation is so rich it probably isn't worth buying.
Then there are other growth stocks, like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), which is performing well, and yet the shares are still attractively priced.
Coca-Cola is a well-known giant
Coca-Cola isn't some unknown company; it is one of the most important beverage companies on the planet. It sells its products throughout the world, and its namesake brand is one of the best-known brands on planet Earth. It has industry-leading distribution, marketing, and research-and-development skills. And it can easily act as an industry consolidator, buying up-and-coming competitors to fill out its own brand portfolio.
Much like Costco, which is an industry leader in the club store space, Coca-Cola is a great company. That's highlighted by the fact that Coca-Cola's dividend has increased annually for more than six decades. That makes it a Dividend King, one of a highly elite group of companies that have proven over time they know how to survive through thick and thin.
What's interesting right now is that the consumer staples sector, particularly companies in the food and beverage spaces, are kind of out of favor. There's a shift toward healthier fare, and regulators in the U.S. are getting a bit more stringent with their rules. That has Wall Street a little down on the whole sector, even with regard to companies that are performing relatively well. And Coca-Cola is, indeed, performing well.
In the second quarter, Coca-Cola's organic sales advanced 5%, which is more than twice the pace of PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), the No. 2 beverage maker. Moreover, Coca-Cola updated its earnings guidance, going from growth of 2% to 3% to growth of approximately 3%. That's not a huge change, but it is clear that the business is performing at the high end of the company's own expectations.
Coca-Cola's valuation isn't outlandish
Here's the interesting thing: While Costco's strong recent performance has left it trading with a high valuation, Coca-Cola's valuation is fairly reasonable. To put some numbers on that, Costco's price-to-sales (P/S), price-to-earnings (P/E), and price-to-book value (P/B) ratios are all notably above their five-year averages. The club store retailer has a dividend yield of just 0.6%, which is way below the 1.2% of the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).",13158a5f1a32a8c41e23120b43985f6d,trafilatura,2776,0

The plans being discussed within the administration, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, could value these firms at a combined $500 billion or more and involve a 5% to 15% sale of Fannie and Freddie shares.
Still being debated is whether the mortgage giants would go public as two separate entities or one combined company. The president is still weighing all of his options.
The over-the-counter shares of Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) both jumped 21% on Friday following the report. They are up over 190% and 130%, respectively, year to date.
Chiefs of the country's biggest Wall Street banks, JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS), and Wells Fargo (WFC), have visited Washington, D.C., in recent weeks to meet with President Trump one by one to discuss plans for Fannie and Freddie, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Freddie and Fannie, attended some of these meetings, according to the report.
These giants play integral roles in the US housing market by purchasing mortgages and repackaging them as securities. Both fell under government conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis when mortgage defaults soared.
Investors in the mortgage-backed securities offered by Fannie and Freddie rate them as lower risk compared to their private-sector equivalents, given the implicit guarantee that they have the government's backing.

It remains unclear whether the Trump administration plans to fully relinquish its stakes in these major institutions.
""I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES, and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social in late May.
Many housing experts and critics alike worry that fully privatizing these firms will cause investors to view their mortgage obligations as more risky, creating a ripple effect across the US housing market that would raise mortgage rates for homebuyers.
Making such a guarantee explicit without the government's ownership would require an act of Congress. That kind of federal guarantee could even prompt mortgage rates to fall, benefiting borrowers, but ""political gridlock makes this unlikely,"" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi noted in June.",50ef4b20bd1f4744b6580cf36af6dab9,trafilatura,2771,0

Howard Stern may be wrapping up one of the most lucrative runs in radio history—but if the mic goes quiet, don't worry. The $650 million man already built himself a retirement plan with wine cellars, walk-in closets, and ocean views.
The 71-year-old host of The Howard Stern Show signed his first deal with Sirius Satellite Radio in 2004, worth a then-unthinkable $500 million over five years. The contract included salary, production, staff, and stock awards, and marked the beginning of Stern's move off terrestrial radio. His debut Sirius broadcast aired January 9, 2006, after leaving New York's WNBC and then CBS Radio (Infinity Broadcasting), where he had spent two decades stirring the airwaves.

Since then, Stern has re-upped his deal three times—in 2010, 2015, and most recently in 2020, when he signed a $500 million, five-year extension with SiriusXM. That contract is set to expire later this year.
While rumors have swirled about the show being canceled, SiriusXM president and chief content officer Scott Greenstein told The Hollywood Reporter in 2024 that there's no indication Stern wants to step away. ""He's been with me and the company going on two decades, and so he's pretty happy, but he's also able, like many great artists, to stop whenever he wants,"" Greenstein said. ""Nobody will ever replace them. We would never try to replace them.""
On a separate 2024 earnings call, Greenstein added that he hopes Stern ""continues forever.""
But if he doesn't? Stern's fallback plan involves an empire of real estate that would make most billionaires blush. According to Realtor.com, he's spent the better part of the past two decades transforming radio checks into high-end residences in Florida, New York City, and the Hamptons—all of which double as private studios.

Stern dropped $52 million on this 3.23-acre ocean-to-lake compound in 2013, then poured another $13 million into renovations.

Journeys' Parent Genesco Raises Full-Year Guidance After Q2 Sales Growth
These results beat analyst expectations, which called for net sales between $2.3 billion and $2.38 billion in Q2, according to Yahoo Finance.
Skechers noted that the second quarter’s net sales include a favorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rates of $33.9 million. The company also said that its wholesale sales grew 15.0 percent in Q2, while its direct-to-consumer sales increased 11.0 percent in the period.
Net earnings also increased in Q2 to $170.5 million and diluted earnings per share were $1.13, a 21.5 percent increase compared with prior year net earnings of $140.3 million and diluted earnings per share of 91 cents in Q2 2024.
No executives provided comment in the Friday earnings release.
These latest numbers come amid Skechers’ bid to become a private company this year. In May, Skechers announced a $9 billion go-private deal with Brazilian private-equity firm 3G Capital — the biggest shoe buyout in history.
The deal structure has one election at $63 a share and the other at $57 a share in cash and one unlisted, non-transferable equity unit in a newly formed entity that will become the parent of Skechers upon the closing of the transaction.
The blockbuster move is a reflection of the business prowess of Robert and Michael Greenberg, the father-son duo that has taken the company from family start-up to global powerhouse during the past three decades.
And the Greenbergs have been working diligently on closing the deal. In July, a California federal district court judge in Los Angeles ruled against a pension plan investor’s bid for a preliminary injunction to delay the closing of the planned acquisition of Skechers by 3G Capital. Marking a win for Skechers as it works to move forward.
When the deal was announced in May, the expectation then was that a closing date likely would be in the third quarter.
The footwear firm will remain headquartered in its hometown of Manhattan Beach, Calif. and its current management team will continue to steer the company.

Timberland properties are becoming a go-to investment for the wealthy, and regular investors are starting to catch on.
An Overlooked But Powerful Portfolio Play
Timberland is giving investors a chance to earn steady returns, hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios with a sustainable asset. “Forest investors are typically not looking for high risk and high return,” Campbell Global President Angela Davis told Forbes. They’re looking for yield, inflation protection, “environmental virtue” and something that doesn’t move with the stock market. The company, which was acquired by J.P. Morgan Asset Management in 2021, manages $10 billion in timberland.

Davis oversees 1.4 million acres of timberland across the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. According to her, a properly managed forest can deliver around a 4.4% annual yield from harvested wood alone. Add long-term log price growth and carbon credit sales, and total returns can hit 7%.
“Let it grow. Sell a higher volume at a higher price later,” Davis told Forbes about her long-term approach to timber prices. Unlike public real estate investment trusts tied to mills, she can afford to be patient.
Even with all the natural obstacles like wildfires, pests, protected areas, and hungry bears, Davis says sustainable forestry still works. Her team of 75 foresters actively manages risk, cuts compromised trees, and builds firebreaks.

Hims & Hers posted record revenue this quarter.
-
It is still selling patented weight loss drugs on its platform and is now getting sued by the pharmaceutical companies.
-
Investors would do best to avoid this stock until the legal battle is resolved.
Shares of Hims & Hers (NYSE: HIMS) stock sank 17% this week, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The telehealth platform is delivering huge revenue growth but is at risk of a legal battle with weight loss drugmakers. Shares of the stock are down 25% from all-time highs but are up 400% in the past five years due to the platform's fast growth.
Here's why the stock sank this week.
Fast growth but a looming lawsuit
In the second quarter of 2025, Hims & Hers' revenue grew 73% year over year to over $500 million, making it one of the fastest-growing companies in the world. This was driven by 30% growth in total subscribers to Hims & Hers products and 30% growth in spend per active subscriber. The company offers telehealth services for basic pharmaceuticals such as hair loss, sexual wellness, and weight loss drugs.
While the company is growing quickly and now generating a profit, Hims & Hers is facing a looming legal battle with Novo Nordisk. The innovator in weight loss drugs originally had a partnership with Hims & Hers but pulled out of the deal because of disagreements over Hims & Hers selling knockoffs of its weight loss drug formula. Hims & Hers was permitted to sell patented weight loss drugs while they were in shortage, but now that the shortage is over, it is breaking the law by selling patented drugs to customers at a discount.
Unsurprisingly, Hims & Hers is getting sued for this practice, which is a fast-growing part of its business. Investors are worried about the future impacts of this legal battle and how it could hurt Hims & Hers' future revenue growth and profitability.
Should you buy Hims & Hers stock?
Hims & Hers has been an incredible stock to own over the last few years, making shareholders rich. It has $2 billion in trailing revenue, up over 1,000% in the last five years. By far, it is the leading telehealth provider for drugs and medical treatments over the internet, making a ton of inroads in market share gains in the last few years.
If there were no legal battle looming, Hims & Hers would probably be a buy on this dip. However, we cannot ignore the potential legal ramifications and huge risk Hims & Hers management is putting on itself and shareholders by blatantly selling patented weight loss drugs on its website. This legal battle is not likely to end well. Don't buy the dip on Hims & Hers stock until its dispute with the weight loss drugmakers is resolved.",39094e8e994026d4be23fa1d2410be2d,trafilatura,2701,0

Shares of Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) jumped this week. The quantum computing start-up's stock rose 9.3% from last Friday's close. The move came as the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100 rose 2.4% and 3.7%, respectively.
Rigetti and other quantum stocks were lifted this week by news that researchers at the University of Southern California may have found a way around obstacles the technology faces in its development.
A ""rescued"" particle could boost quantum
Researchers at the University of Southern California said that they had identified a new type of particle they call ""neglectons,"" which could help solve one of quantum computing's biggest issues. The particles earned their name from their once-overlooked status; researchers had previously dismissed them as ""mathematical garbage.""
Quantum computing faces a number of hurdles in its ongoing development. Chief among them is the inherent difficulty in error correction. These systems are fragile and hard to keep from degrading. The new particles could help scientists solve this issue through an approach called ""braiding.""
Investors should remain cautious
While the news is positive, it by no means indicates the issue is solved -- or is close to being solved. This is a highly experimental field at the very edge of human knowledge and theory, let alone practical engineering.
I think many investors are getting ahead of themselves, and it could be many years, if not decades, before we see viable quantum computing at scale.
Rigetti is one of the more promising quantum companies, but at its current valuation, I would not invest.

Wall Street banks have recently adopted policies to curb private equity poaching of junior bankers.
-
Each bank has a different stance, from reassigning bankers to terminating their employment.
-
Business Insider broke down the current rules juniors should know at each of the five major banks.
Private equity recruiting on Wall Street has turned into a bit of a saga this summer.
It started in June when JPMorgan sent a memo to incoming junior bankers that it would fire those who accept future-dated jobs at buyout firms. Within days, three PE shops, starting with Apollo, began announcing that they'd stall recruiting until 2026. Since then, the other biggest banks have hopped on the train to roll out their own new policies for junior bankers interested in one day jumping to the buy-side.
Every week seems to bring a new twist, and it has undoubtedly been a whirlwind for recent grads starting their first investment banking jobs.
In the interest of clarifying all the disparate developments, Business Insider has compiled the policies on accepting pre-dated private equity jobs from the five largest banks — Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley — in one place.
The policies run the gamut. Some banks will terminate you immediately if they find out you've accepted a pre-dated job. Others won't fire you so long as you tell them you have the job lined up, but may move you to another team. They've all said that their rules are directed at preventing potential conflicts of interest — since investment banks often seek to advise the very firms young bankers can agree to work for two or three years down the road.
Understanding the rules will help junior bankers navigate their careers. The stakes are high. Young bankers who lose their banking jobs, or are reassigned to a non-dealmaking job, risk losing the very private equity offers banks are now eager for them to disclose. These firms sign future candidates with the expectation that by the time they arrive at their own offices, they'll have two years of experience under their belt in M&A.
Here's how top investment banks are defending against private equity poaching of junior bankers, in alphabetical order by name:
Bank of America
Analysts will be asked to disclose whether they have offers for future-dated jobs, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. BofA juniors who accept future-dated job offers will not be terminated but rather reassigned to another area within the bank.
Citi
Citi sent out a memo to new junior bankers in July telling them they'll have to ""complete an attestation disclosing whether they have accepted any future employment offers from other employers.""",9f4cefb9e1c0706240bb43315120313b,trafilatura,2690,0

It’s getting closer every year. This reality check means it’s the time to prepare for a more stable retirement.
Trending Now: 4 Ways Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Will Change How You Plan for Retirement
For You: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?
One of the best ways to prepare isn’t just by saving more but by downsizing assets that quietly drain your wallet year after year. It may hurt to let go of things you’ve worked hard for, but it will save you money during retirement. Below are six assets every Gen X should downsize as they approach retirement.
Also here are four reasons Gen X feels unprepared to retire.
House
For many Gen Xers, the home is their biggest asset. While it may hold decades of memories, a larger house often means higher costs, including property taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and repairs.
As you approach retirement, these ongoing expenses will eat into your savings. Downsizing to a smaller home can lower your expenses and free up cash you can use to boost your retirement savings or reduce debt.

Vacation Home
Owning a vacation home may seem like the best retirement goal. However, it can quickly turn into a financial burden. Between mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance and travel costs, a second home often becomes more expensive than it’s worth. Even if you’ve paid off the mortgage, ongoing maintenance and repairs can drain funds that would have covered your everyday retirement needs.
Instead of owning, consider renting a vacation home when you want to go on a vacation. This way, you won’t be covering expenses for a property that sits empty almost all year. Additionally, you won’t be tied to one location when going on a vacation.
Extra Vehicles
Having more than one car may have been practical years back when raising a family. But as kids grow and move out, you may no longer need more than one or two cars. Even if the vehicle sits in the driveway, it’s still costing you money in insurance, registration fees and maintenance.
Selling unused cars before retirement can provide immediate cash to boost your emergency fund or cover other important expenses. In fact, couples who can share one reliable car can save thousands of dollars each year.

Goldman Sachs published new coverage on Peloton stock after the exercise-tech company published its quarterly results yesterday.

Goldman raised its rating on Peloton from neutral to buy and increased its one-year price target on the stock from $7 per share to $11.50 per share.
-
Peloton's margins have recently improved significantly thanks to cost-cutting moves, and the company is making moves to help stabilize sales.
Pelton (NASDAQ: PTON) stock closed out Friday's trading session with big gains. The company's share price gained 10.3% on the day's trading and had been up as much as 11.5% earlier in the session.
Peloton's valuation bounded higher today thanks to bullish coverage on the stock published by Goldman Sachs. The positive analyst coverage came on the heels of better-than-expected quarterly results released by the company -- and the new analyst note helped extend the exercise-machine specialist's rally.
Positive analyst coverage helped Peloton stock soar today
Yesterday evening, Goldman Sachs published new coverage on Peloton -- and the note had a big impact on the stock in today's trading. With its new coverage, Goldman raised its rating on Peloton stock from neutral to buy. The investment firm also increased its one-year price target on Peloton stock from $7 per share to $11.50 per share. Even after a big gain for Peloton's valuation today, Goldman's new price target on the stock still suggests additional upside of roughly 47%.
What's next for Peloton?
Peloton recently published results for the fourth quarter of its last fiscal year, which ended June 30, and the company's cost-cutting initiatives pushed the business to an unexpected profit in the period. While the company's sales still declined by roughly 6% year over year in the quarter, cost-discipline led to margins that were significantly better than anticipated.
Wall Street had expected the business to record a loss of $0.05 per share in fiscal Q4, but Peloton actually recorded a profit of $0.05 per share in the period -- and its margin improvement appears to be sustainable in the near term. Management also anticipates that the business's sales decline will slow in the current fiscal year. There are some indications that efforts to grow sales among enterprise customers are bearing fruit.

The order instructs the Department of Labor to review and clarify ERISA fiduciary guidelines for offering alternative assets in defined-contribution plans. If implemented, the changes could expand advisors' toolkit to include asset classes such as private equity, private credit, infrastructure, real estate and digital assets.

Annuities in 401(k)s? Savers show interest, but advisors are hesitant
The executive order calls for the Labor Secretary to examine past and current guidance on fiduciaries' duties when including alternatives in asset allocation funds, such as target date products. Within the next 180 days, the department must clarify the criteria fiduciaries should use to weigh the higher costs of these investments against potential long-term gains and broader diversification benefits.
American Retirement Association CEO Brian Graff argued that fiduciaries, not the government, should be the ones deciding if an investment class is appropriate for plan participants.
""Professional retirement plan fiduciaries that are subject to strict fiduciary standards — not the federal government — are in the best position to assess developments in the financial markets and determine what is in the financial best interest of retirement plan participants and beneficiaries,"" Graff said in a statement.
The move also aims to curb ERISA litigation that has historically deterred plan sponsors from offering private market and digital assets.
Industry interest in alternatives has been building in recent years. In 2024, 3.9% of plan sponsors offered alternative investments to participants, up from 2.2% in 2023, according to PLANSPONSOR's latest Recordkeeping Survey.
In the Financial Planning Association's 2025 Trends in Investing survey, researchers saw a sharp increase in the use of alternative investments among advisors. Nearly 1 in 5 advisors surveyed said they currently use or recommend investing in private debt to their clients, up 55% from the previous year.
Proponents say alternative assets offer an opportunity for improved returns and diversification, but critics warn that higher fees, lower liquidity and a lack of transparency could ultimately harm retirement savings for the average investor.",26d60e19aedc524b1a7e583eaf2d3aa9,trafilatura,2669,0

Amazon’s revenue and diluted earnings per share both beat analyst estimates in the three-month period that ended June 30.
-
The tech giant’s capital spending is soaring, as management aims to remain a leader in AI.
-
At the current price, the stock’s valuation still looks very reasonable.
Earnings season is in full swing, and some of the most closely watched companies have given investors crucial information to chew on. On July 31, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported earnings for the second quarter (ended June 30).
Revenue of $167.7 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.68 both came in well ahead of consensus analyst estimates. However, it's important to view this fresh information in the context of Amazon's bigger picture.
Here's what this ""Magnificent Seven"" stock's latest earnings report means for long-term investors.
Second-quarter highlights
I think it's appropriate to first give a brief high-level overview of the latest quarter's most important financial drivers. Revenue increased 13% year over year. The top line was bolstered by an 11% gain in the key North America segment.
Operating income soared 31% to $19.2 billion in the quarter. CEO Andy Jassy has focused relentlessly on cost controls and operational efficiencies in recent years, so it's very encouraging to see this strategy play out in the form of rising profits.
However, the stock tanked immediately following the news. The market is a forward-looking machine. And investors were not happy with management's forecast for operating income in the third quarter to be $18 billion at the midpoint. This would translate to just a 3% year-over-year gain, much slower than the recent growth Amazon has put up.
Zoom out and focus on the big picture
Every company's quarterly results are scrutinized by the investment community, but it's important to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Amazon's latest financial update provided some key insights for long-term investors.
The first takeaway is that the leadership team is intensely focused on the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom. This is evident by looking at its surge in spending. Capital expenditures totaled $31.4 billion in the quarter.
If this pace continues, it translates to more than $125 billion on an annualized basis. These are huge moves meant to expand the company's technical infrastructure and better serve demand for AI.
Another takeaway is that Amazon is a well-rounded enterprise, which should make it the envy of other companies. Yes, this business is known first and foremost for how it totally disrupted the retail sector. Consequently, e-commerce remains key to its success.",64e023541fd72d1237cab08ca6e8a517,trafilatura,2662,0

AMD turned in mixed results, hurt by the Chinese export ban.
-
With the ban expected to be lifted, this should be a temporary headwind.
-
The company still has a huge opportunity in the inference market.
After being a laggard to start the year, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) has rallied strongly during the summer. However, its shares took a dip following the announcement of its second-quarter results, after earnings came in a bit light.
The stock now finds itself up about 30% year to date after the pullback, as of this writing.
Let's take a closer look to see if this decline is an opportunity to buy the stock.
Data center in focus
AMD's data center segment has been its biggest growth driver in recent quarters, but revenue rose just 14% in Q2 to $3.2 billion. The slowdown in growth largely stemmed from the company no longer being allowed to sell its MI308 graphics processing units (GPUs) in China during the quarter. This led to a year-over-year revenue decline in its artificial intelligence (AI) business. However, sales are expected to resume in the future once the U.S. government approves its export license to China.
Outside of China, the company said it saw solid progress with its MI300 and MI325 GPUs, with increasing adoption. Seven out of 10 of the top model builders and AI companies now use its GPUs. Meanwhile, AMD claimed with the launch of its MI355 GPU that it matches or exceeds the performance of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) top B200 chip for both training and inference.
At the same time, AMD's central processing units (CPUs) continue to gain market share in the server space. Growth is also being driven by increasing demand for cloud and on-premises compute, and the investments being made in AI infrastructure.
AMD's client and gaming segment, which provides CPUs for computers and GPUs for gaming devices, saw revenue surge 69% in the quarter to $3.6 billion. The company saw strong CPU share gains during the quarter and was helped by strong sell-through for AMD-powered commercial notebooks. Meanwhile, it saw strong demand for its newly launched gaming GPUs, as well as an uptick in semi-custom chip revenue.
AMD's embedded segment, meanwhile, saw a 4% decline in revenue to $824 million. It expects sequential growth in the second half as demand improves across several key markets.
Overall, the company's revenue climbed by 32% to $7.69 billion. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS), however, plunged 30% to $0.48. Analysts were looking for EPS of $0.49 on sales of $7.42 billion, as compiled by LSEG. Note that its EPS was hurt by its $800 million inventory write-down related to Chinese export controls.",20b7f587dc335451e7f7d0ea07a54271,trafilatura,2659,0

Wall Street strategists point to other factors fueling the major averages higher: optimism over the AI trade and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September.
""August could very well be a little bit of a volatile month,"" Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas region, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday morning.
""I don't know that any pullbacks we see in the market will be long-lived. I think they'll be short-lived in nature,"" she added, highlighting that investors may want to add short-term, fixed-income investments to their portfolios as a way to diversify.
Even as Trump's tariff deadline landed on Thursday, with imports from nearly 200 countries now facing duties ranging from 10% to 50%, strategists downplayed longer-term risks to equities.

""Our base case remains that the US effective tariff rate will settle at around 15% — enough to weigh on growth and lift inflation, but not enough to derail the US economy or the equity rally,"" said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Strategists also point to companies' ability to navigate the tariff front, with heavyweights like Apple (AAPL) and TSMC (TSM) receiving exemptions due to their US investment commitments.
""On a margin and short term, sure, the tariffs will affect earnings,"" Rockland Trust vice president and portfolio manager Michael Sayers told Yahoo Finance.
""But once the tariffs rates are finally set, then it will be a one-time adjustment to company earnings, and then I think long-term fundamentals will take over.""
Overall earnings have come in strong this season, with roughly 82% of the companies that reported beating estimates, according to Bloomberg data.
Wall Street has its eyes set on the AI trade, which has led the market. Data analytics firm Palantir (PLTR) saw its market cap balloon past $420 billion this week after posting a boom in revenue and contracts.
Bullishness around AI followed strong quarterly results from software and cloud leader Microsoft (MSFT), social media giant Meta (META), and cloud and search engine provider Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), all among the biggest data center spenders.
""I think the big story that's driving the market, as it very well should, is how the large-cap, quality tech and friends — if we can call it that name — continue to have absolutely stellar earnings growth,"" said Chaudhuri.",206991c3be1592298dd5c43bc1e2a0d8,trafilatura,2655,0

GoDaddy's Q2 earnings jumped to $1.41 per share, slightly beating the consensus estimate of $1.38.
-
The stock fell more than 11% because investors expected a bigger earnings surprise.
-
Today's price drop could create a buying opportunity for growth-focused investors.
Shares of GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY) fell as much as 11.5% on Friday, following a solid earnings report with modest guidance. By 3:30 p.m. ET, the domain name registrar's shares had dropped by 11%.
GoDaddy's modest earnings beat
GoDaddy's second-quarter sales rose by 8% year over year, stopping at $1.21 billion. Earnings jumped from $1.01 to $1.41 per diluted share. The analyst consensus pointed to earnings near $1.38 per share with a top-line revenue target right in line with the reported figures.
GoDaddy also issued third-quarter and full-year revenue guidance roughly on par with the current analyst views. In short, GoDaddy performed almost exactly as expected with a slight lean to the upside.
When barely beating expectations isn't enough
So why did the stock fall more than 11% on this robust report? Because the slight earnings surprise just wasn't impressive enough.
GoDaddy isn't a terribly expensive stock, but it has outperformed the broader market in the last three years. Its financial results don't always beat the Street targets, but when they do, the surprises tend to be large. This mild outperformance just wasn't enough.
The price drop may have opened a buying window for growth investors, though. GoDaddy's revenue is rising and its margins are growing wider. And the company is taking advantage of recent share price cuts, investing $906 million in share buybacks in the first half of 2025. I see it as a vote of confidence in GoDaddy's business prospects, suggesting that investors could follow the same strategy.

Nvidia's stock has been rallying this year after a tough start due to tariffs.
-
Easing China-U.S. relations should have a positive impact on Nvidia's business.
-
Tech companies continue to spend heavily on artificial intelligence (AI), suggesting demand for Nvidia's chips remains robust.
Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) had a rough start to 2025, with macroeconomic concerns and tariffs weighing on the stock. But it has seemingly shaken off those fears, and year to date, the stock is now up close to 30% (as of Aug. 4), becoming the first to reach a valuation north of $4 trillion.
While its valuation is undoubtedly high, there's one thing that has the potential to send its shares up even more, and that's a strong earnings report. With Nvidia's earnings set to come out later this month, on Aug. 27, is that likely to be a catalyst that sends the chipmaker's scorching-hot stock to new heights?
How has Nvidia's stock typically performed after earnings?
The chart shows how Nvidia's stock has performed over the past few years, while also indicating when it reported earnings. There has been notable movement following earnings in both directions, but it hasn't normally been a move straight up or straight down afterward. This suggests that other factors may play much more important roles in Nvidia's stock's performance, and that strong earnings numbers may already be priced into its valuation.
Nvidia last reported earnings on May 28. At the time, the stock was trading at around $135, and it has gone on to surge since then. But in the first few days after reporting earnings, its shares didn't take off -- a clear sign that the earnings report itself wasn't likely the reason for its recent rise in value.
Instead, the rally may be due to progress in China-U.S. trade talks, with the U.S. government recently permitting Nvidia to sell its H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China. Another catalyst is tech companies still expecting to spend more on AI in the near future, indicating that demand for Nvidia's chips isn't likely to slow down anytime soon.
Could Nvidia's high valuation make it too difficult for the stock to rally after earnings?
Back in April, when the U.S. government announced reciprocal tariffs, Nvidia's stock was trading at close to 30 times its trailing earnings. And that low valuation may have made it easier for it to rally since then. But by the same token, now, with the AI stock looking much more expensive and valued at a price-to-earnings multiple of over 56, that could restrict gains from here on out, even if Nvidia does demonstrate strong growth for the upcoming quarter.",23f4844fe9638148420254a8f74cbe7b,trafilatura,2629,0

American private equity giant Carlyle is expected to swoop on the company in the coming weeks through a complex debt-for-equity swap, bringing to an end more than 20 years of ownership at the hands of the Barclays brothers, former proprietors of the Telegraph.
If Carlyle pulls off the move, it would mean the family would have surrendered control of the vast majority of its business empire in the space of just two years – as various creditors have caught up with them.
The Telegraph was taken over by Lloyds in the summer of 2023 amid a long dispute with the Barclays over outstanding debts. The following year, their parcel delivery outfit Yodel narrowly avoided collapse after it was bought by rival operator Shift.
The Barclay siblings – Aidan and Howard – have also recently parted with their prized super-yacht Lady Beatrice, named after their late mother – after reducing the asking price.
Carlyle’s anticipated takeover of Very Group, which has 4.5 million UK customers, comes amid growing expectations that a loan it has made to another Barclay-controlled entity will not be repaid on time, according to a source close to the discussions.
It was described as one of “several triggers” for Carlyle to move in. Another is a £280m loan that it made to Very Group last year, which expires at the beginning of November. This year it has borrowed a further £83m in two tranches from the private equity house.
City sources believe Carlyle will seek to carve-up ownership of Very Group with IMI, the Abu Dhabi-based vehicle that ended up as a major lender to Very Group as part of a convoluted deal related to its brief ownership of the Telegraph newspaper titles. The United Arab Emirates investor is positioned to emerge from the protracted tussle with a 15pc stake in the newspaper’s parent company.
City sources believe the ownership change at Very Group will open the door to a long-mooted merger with arch-rival N Brown. Its smaller competitor was taken private last year by members of the Alliance family, which are the controlling shareholders.
Carlyle’s decision to call in its debts – first reported by Sky News – is likely to spark a fierce battle between other lenders to recover their loans. Very Group’s parent company, Shop Direct Holdings Limited, has amassed a debt pile totalling £2.8bn, according to its most recently filed accounts. Owners have repeatedly sought to stave off looming repayments with new borrowings.",cd8b4316468b324c825f0f687e763d65,trafilatura,2620,0

The Ripple-linked token was recently changing hands around $3.29, a 7.5% jump over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Dogecoin meanwhile jumped 6.2% to $0.22, while Ethereum’s price eclipsed the $4,000 mark for the first time since December.
Bitcoin’s market cap accounted for 57.8% of the crypto market on Friday, down from 61.3% a week ago, according to CoinGecko. Within the past three months, Bitcoin has accounted for as much as 65% of the $3.9 trillion crypto sector—and as little as 57.07%.
With each market cycle in Bitcoin’s existence, altcoins have experienced a sustained period of outperformance after asset’s price peaked, often referred to as an altcoin season.
That could happen again, but it likely not to the same degree, Gerry O’Shea, head of global markets insights at crypto asset manager Hashdex, told Decrypt, pointing to structural market changes as a result of exchange-traded funds in the U.S. and corporate buying.
“You have these institutional buyers that are kind of backstopping it at this point,” he said. “That's not to suggest that we're not going to see a fair amount of volatility with Bitcoin going forward, but I do think it's going to be a lot different than what we've seen in previous cycles.”
Previous altcoins seasons have been marked by speculative investments like NFTs, meme coins, or ICOs, but O’Shea said investors could gravitate with projects that put utility front and center because of regulatory progress in the U.S. and the passage of stablecoin legislation.
“Ethereum [and] Solana, the smart contract platforms that provide infrastructure for stablecoins, are obviously demonstrating utility here,” he said. “I think that could certainly be contributing to Bitcoin’s falling dominance.”
On Friday, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization hovered around $116,000, a 0.1% increase over the past day. And its price was up 96% over the past year. In a Myriad Linea Markets prediction table, nearly two in three participants predict that Ethereum will reach $5,000 by year's end.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
It's not every day Dave Ramsey tells someone to take on debt. In fact, his entire brand is built on helping people get rid of it. But when a recently divorced dad called ""The Ramsey Show"" asking if a home equity line of credit could help him pay his ex-wife her share of the house, Ramsey surprised him with a rare ""yes"" — followed quickly by a reality check.
The caller's situation was tight. He owed his ex-wife $150,000 for her half of the equity in their home. He had $70,000 saved but needed the rest by the end of August. His first mortgage balance was $110,000, the house was worth about $430,000 to $440,000, and his interest rate was a jaw-dropping 2.25 percent. His solution? A HELOC — short for home equity line of credit — which allows homeowners to borrow against the equity in their property and pay it back over time.
Don’t Miss:
""I don't tell people to borrow money,"" Ramsey told him, ""but you're already in debt. You're in debt to your ex-wife, and we're going to change that to another kind of debt called a HELOC."" In other words, he wasn't advising the caller to pile on more debt, just to restructure the kind he already had. ""Get her off your back,"" Ramsey said.
Then he pivoted to the bigger question: ""Why are you keeping the house?""
The caller explained that he loved the home, wanted to keep his kids in the school district, and thought stability was important for them. Ramsey didn't buy it. ""Neither one of them care,"" he said of the children, ages four-and-a-half and five months. ""You're the only one that cares... A 5-month-old does not have any feelings except food and wet diapers.""
Co-host George Kamel suggested a hybrid approach — take out the HELOC, list the house, and use the sale proceeds to pay it off and put the remainder toward a new place. Ramsey agreed that was worth considering, especially for one very human reason: ""Your next wife probably doesn't want to live in the house where your ex-wife used to live in the same bedroom.""

I have a few questions about retirement accounts. Thanks in advance.
1) In a few years I will have to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from my traditional IRA (currently my only retirement account). I plan to work until age 80 or so. Will I be able to continue contributing to the IRA even after beginning RMDs?

2) I’m self-employed. No employees and not incorporated. My income is reported on a 1099-K (basically a pass-through from the company that processes my clients’ credit-card payments). I contribute the max to my IRA every year. I will soon, in addition, derive income as an independent contractor and that income will report on a standard 1099. So I’ll have both. My key question: Can I open a SEP-IRA for the 1099 income (and possibly even the 1099-K income)? If so, can I contribute to both?
Sincerely,
Self-Employed Saver
See: I’ve been getting the wrong Social Security Disability benefit for years. How do I fix it?
Dear Self-Employed Saver,
To answer your first question simply — yes. Because it is an IRA, you will have to take RMD — but thanks to the Secure Act, you can continue to contribute to the account so long as you receive earned income.
To answer your second question simply — also yes. You can use 1099 income to fund a SEP-IRA since it is self-employment income. The same goes for your 1099-K income if it’s self-employment income, too. With this question, there’s a bit more to know, though.
A SEP-IRA is basically just a traditional IRA for business owners, so it follows many of the same rules as the account you’ve already come to know. There are, however, a few differences. For example, the maximum you can contribute to a SEP in 2025 is the lesser of up to 25% of your total compensation, which is determined by your net earnings, or up to $70,000.
“There is no limitation when coordinating a SEP-IRA and a traditional IRA,” said Byrke Sestok, a partner at Moneco Advisors. You can contribute to a SEP as well as to your traditional IRA, since the SEP is funded with employer contributions and the traditional IRA is made with personal contributions.
“You can both receive employer contributions to a SEP-IRA and make regular, annual contributions to a traditional or Roth IRA. Employer contributions made under a SEP plan do not affect the amount you can contribute to an IRA on your own behalf,” according to the Internal Revenue Service.",a65c17f2b72171ee2e141ad83443f560,trafilatura,2598,0

""This company is not aspirational — it's operational.""
Firefly Aerospace (FLY) CEO Jason Kim said this to me on Yahoo Finance as his company was going through its rite of passage at the Nasdaq on Thursday. It felt so electric in the room, I asked Firefly's employees to clap us in at the top of the interview (video above).
The stock opened at $70 a share and closed the session at $60.35 — up 34% from its IPO price of $45. The company's market cap at the end of its first trading day stood at $8.48 billion.
Just last week, Firefly said it had planned to sell 16.2 million shares at a range of $35 to $39. A new regulatory filing on Monday came with a much higher range of $41 to $43. The company ended up raising $868 million from the IPO after selling 19.3 million shares at $45.
I think Kim's comment perfectly captures why recent IPOs have been embraced enthusiastically by investors. The early-stage companies coming to market are more mature. The businesses are more complete. The leaders are more well-rounded. (Kim told me off camera he is very ready for his first earnings call.)
Firefly may still be early stage with no profits, but it's not just hot air with no substance. It's not a SPAC with a suspect leader — hearkening back to the flops from 2020. Kim is an Air Force veteran who spent considerable time working at Boeing's satellite business.
His company is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. Its lunar lander Blue Ghost successfully touched down on the surface of the moon in March. The company's new Eclipse reusable rocket is expected to launch sometime in 2026, joining the already proven Alpha rocket in the portfolio.
In its prospectus, Firefly boasted $1.1 billion in backlog and lists partnerships with Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, NASA, Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Space Force.
Another recent IPO that is more operational than inspirational?
Figma (FIG) shares were priced at $33 for its market debut on July 31 and ended the day at $115.50. The company makes software that allows people to collaborate on slide decks and digital whiteboards, among other bells and whistles.

But there are a few stocks that could be considered undervalued in the current market. Here are four that might make decent buys right now.
V.F. Corporation (VFC)
VF boasts well-known apparel and outdoor brands such as Vans, North Face, Timberland and Dickies, but it has struggled to gain much momentum on Wall Street. The company’s stock price is down more than 40% so far in 2025. Shares currently trade for about $13 a share — well below the record price of $100.25 set in early 2020.
Two of VF’s main problems are a heavy debt load and a “modest” revenue growth forecast, according to Simply Wall Street. Despite those challenges, VF has produced decent earnings and trades at a discount to Simply Wall Street’s estimated fair value.
Try This: I Asked ChatGPT What the Stock Market Will Look Like in 100 Days — Here’s What It Said
Travelzoo (TZOO)
Like VF, Travelzoo has had a challenging 2025, with a stock price that is down about 45% for the year. In fact, Travelzoo’s shares haven’t shown much of a growth trajectory in nearly 15 years. The internet media company fell well short of consensus earnings estimates during its most recent quarter, although it did top revenue forecasts.
On the bright side, the stock is cheap at about $10 a share, and Zacks recently noted that Travelzoo is “likely undervalued” right now when you factor in the company’s earnings outlook.
Robert Half International (RHI)
This provider of talent solutions and business consulting services hasn’t had much to cheer about lately, at least in terms of its stock market performance. Shares are down about 43% in 2025 and currently trade near a nine-year low.
Robert Half’s stock took another hit last week after the company reported mixed second-quarter results that beat revenue estimates but included a weaker-than-expected Q3 earnings outlook. Even so, RHI is solidly profitable and trades at 4.7% below its fair value, according to Simply Wall Street.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE)
HP is another company rated as “likely undervalued” by Zacks, which has a “Buy” rating on the stock and gives it an “A” value grade due to the strength of its P/E ratio and earnings outlook.",a928241ed8b0ebac812fabffa2b10363,trafilatura,2588,0

Why gold is winning so far this year.
Gold futures scored another record high Friday — with the precious metal extending its lead over bitcoin this year and, despite some volatility, reinforcing its status as the go-to safe haven in uncertain times.
While both assets have rallied in 2025 and repeatedly notched fresh highs, gold has pulled ahead even after paring gains Friday afternoon. Gold futures GC00 rose earlier in the day after the U.S. ruled that 1-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars would be subject to tariffs, but trimmed gains after reports said the Trump administration planned to clarify that imported gold bars would be exempt.

Still, gold’s edge this year may reflect a broader trend where elevated geopolitical tensions and tariff concerns have given traditional risk-off assets an extra edge over newer alternatives. Crypto bulls have long pitched bitcoin BTCUSD as “digital gold,” arguing it could eventually play a similar role. But for now, analysts say gold’s legacy as a crisis hedge is prevailing.
“Gold has certainly benefited from safe-haven flows more so than cryptocurrencies like bitcoin” this year, said Rob Haworth, senior investment-strategy director at U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. He noted in a phone interview that bitcoin still tends to move in lockstep with risk assets, limiting its appeal during times of uncertainty.
In particular, gold has seen strong support from global central-bank purchases, which have accelerated in response to geopolitical tensions, tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainties this year, according to Konstantin Anissimov, chief executive at Currency.com.
“I think the overall theme is uncertainty. And when there is uncertainty, sovereigns flee to what they know best — an asset that has weathered the storms of millennia rather than just decades or centuries,” Anissimov said in a phone interview.
In contrast with gold, no major government has adopted bitcoin as a reserve asset, though Anissimov sees strong long-term potential for it to serve as a store of value. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to establish a federal bitcoin reserve, though few details have emerged since. Anissimov also noted that corporations have been increasingly adding the cryptocurrency to their treasuries.",4f53530d7580aef64e397c2ecb22f372,trafilatura,2580,0

Firefly went public at $45 on Thursday before shooting up past $60 a share.

On Friday, the stock gave up $10 of yesterday's gains, and closed closer to $50.

Firefly stock remains a very expensive space IPO.
Firefly Aerospace (NASDAQ: FLY), the Nasdaq exchange's newest space stock, went public at $45 on Thursday and quickly surged to close its first abridged day of trading up 34.1% at $60.35.
On Friday, it didn't quite lose all its gains, but it did lose most of them.
Firefly's Freaky Friday
Firefly stock tumbled to close down 16.9% on Friday at $50.17. That's still $5 and change more than the initial public offering (IPO) price, but a lot of Thursday's IPO gains got vaporized as sentiment turned against the stock -- or perhaps it's more accurate to say, against space stocks in general.
Thursday, you see, also saw weak earnings reports out of other spacefarers, including BlackSky Technology and Redwire Corp., both of which continued to fall in Friday trading.
Even Rocket Lab, one of the most popular space stocks lately, received little love from investors after reporting mixed earnings (sales ahead of forecasts, but profits below) Friday, and its stock closed up only 1.1%.
Is Firefly Aerospace stock a buy?
The good news for investors who missed out on Firefly's IPO is that today, at $50 and change, Firefly stock already sells much closer to its original price, giving would-be IPO buyers a second bite at the apple. The bad news, as I described in my pre-IPO note on the company, is that Firefly stock was already looking pretty pricey at the $45 IPO price.
Valued at an ""astronomical"" 27 times, I thought Firefly stock probably cost too much on IPO day already. At $50-plus a share today, its valuation is pushing 30 times sales. Even with a phenomenal sales growth rate, that's probably more than the stock is worth.
My advice: Even if you're tempted to buy Firefly now, wait for a better price.

“Monogram’s technology is a major leap forward, demonstrating our commitment to becoming the boldest and broadest innovator in surgical robotics and navigation.

While analysts from RBC Capital and BTIG reaffirmed their positive view, the agreement has not changed the opinion of BofA analyst Travis Steed, who reiterated a Hold rating and a $110 price target following the deal announcement. He noted that while the acquisition strengthens ZBH’s position in the semi-autonomous robotics market, the financial benefits will be modest in the near term.
As per the company management, the transaction will be funded through cash and available debt and is expected to be EPS neutral through 2027 and accretive thereafter. However, Steed believes the company’s already strong margins limit further EPS upside, and while the move broadens ZBH’s competitive edge, material revenue contributions are not expected until 2027.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's central bank has a problem communicating that has injected an element of unpredictability into interest rate policy when global uncertainty is already high, and its proving costly for investors.
It all stems from an April shake up at the Reserve Bank of Australia that shifted rate-setting power entirely to a new nine-member Monetary Policy Board.
At just its second meeting in May, the board decided to cut cash rates by a quarter point to 3.85% and sounded more dovish than analysts expected, even briefly considering an easing of 50 basis points given the uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs.
This, combined with some soft economic data, led investors to wager heavily on another cut in July while a Reuters poll of 37 economists found 31 expected an easing.
Crucially, investors were encouraged to pile into these positions because the RBA did not push back on expectations, as they had often done in the past.
Imagine their surprise, then, when the MPB held rates steady in a rare spilt decision of six to three, leaving many investors with painful losses.
Speaking to the media after the decision, RBA Governor Michele Bullock explained that the bank could no longer offer guidance because the rate decision was up to the board alone and it could not be pre-empted.
Essentially, the RBA had changed the way it communicates to markets, without telling those markets it had changed.
""Since no single MPB member can front-run the whole Board, future inter-meeting communication is unlikely to endorse or push back against market pricing,"" said Luci Ellis, chief economist at Westpac and a former assistant governor at the RBA.
""This implies that markets will be surprised more often than in countries like the United States, where the central bank puts more weight on avoiding surprising the market.""
RBA A MINORITY ON ITS OWN BOARD
Since then, a benign inflation report now has investors equally convinced the MPB will cut rates to 3.60% at its next meeting on August 12, in part on the hope it would not want to shock twice in a row.
Yet the MPB's unusual composition makes for added uncertainty as it has just two RBA officials, along with a top Treasury official and six part-time external members with backgrounds in economics, business and banking. The latter are appointed by the Treasurer of the day with input from the RBA.
Markets have little to no idea what the views of these six are, and that is unlikely to change as there are only vague plans for each to make one public appearance a year.",df148e5a3dc810b6699929cd500b0113,trafilatura,2551,0

With that, the stock is also among the only two stocks on our list of best defensive stocks that have posted positive share price performance (as of August 1), the second one being STERIS plc, covered at number 5.
As the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, quarterly results across corporations were under increased scrutiny, and Coca-Cola’s results were no exception.

While the company maintained its organic revenue growth guidance of 5% to 6% for the full year, it narrowed its adjusted EPS outlook to around 3% tightening it from the earlier 2% to 3% range.
Following the Q2 earnings report, an analyst from BofA maintained his Buy rating and raised the price target slightly from $77 to $78 on July 23. The update reflects better-than-expected Q2 2025 earnings per share, which surpassed the analyst’s expectations.
However, the analyst noted that despite the earnings beat, the stock underperformed on the day of the release, which he attributed mainly to the weaker-than-expected unit case volumes and broader market pressure. The analyst acknowledged these short-term challenges but pointed out that the volume comparisons will ease in the third quarter, which could help improve performance sequentially.

In an effort to skirt steep tariffs on Chinese-made goods, Volvo plans to move some production of its electric vehicle stock to Europe — and will debut a new model in its wake.
The Swedish carmaker plans to build the compact Polestar 7 EV at its new plant in Kosice, Slovakia, starting in 2028, InsideEVs reported. The latest model will be the first Polestar car made in Europe, and the facility will be able to produce 250,000 units per year when it opens.
The move comes in the wake of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which will heavily impact companies that outsource manufacturing to China. Volvo has chosen the Slovakia plant for EV production to sidestep this issue and continue sales to the crucial U.S. market.
Volvo's premium EV spinoff marked the start of 2025 with an exciting finish to the first quarter, which saw a 76% sales increase year over year. Polestar has struggled to gain ground in the EV market, though a recent strategic reset for the brand and shifting interest for buyers has played to its advantage.
By taking advantage of new momentum with this manufacturing shift, Polestar is jockeying for a favored position among American drivers looking to switch to an EV. More potential buyers are moving toward this option for cost reasons, namely the savings on routine maintenance and fuel.
Many also see EVs as the most environmentally friendly option because of the lack of tailpipe pollution. While there are concerns about lithium battery production, as well as the pollution created through charging these cars, the Department of Energy notes that EVs produce six times less carbon pollution annually than gas-powered counterparts.
Combined with other clean energy measures — like home solar panels to charge an EV — owners can limit energy consumption while saving money over time. EnergySage makes the solar installation process easy, allowing potential buyers to compare quotes from local installers — and even save up to $10,000 on the investment.
While the latest Polestar model won't be available stateside until at least 2028, potential EV buyers can expect the car to feature Volvo's next-generation software-defined vehicle platform,
cell-to-body battery packs, and more of the Swedish brand's most cutting-edge features.

In fiscal 2025, the company delivered more than $16 billion in shareholder returns, including $9.9 billion in dividends and $6.5 billion through share buybacks.
Following the results, TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow reiterated his Buy rating on Procter & Gamble, maintaining a $168 price target. His view remains constructive, even as the company wrapped up the fiscal year on a softer note and issued a wide earnings guidance range for FY26.

Moskow believes that there is uncertainty in the near term due to macroeconomic challenges such as geopolitical risks and shifting tariff policies that could weigh on performance. However, he sees these factors as manageable as he remains confident over P&G’s strategic direction.
A key part of the bullish thesis lies in P&G’s commitment to product innovation. Moskow expects this focus will help the company gain ground against peers, particularly as it looks to reclaim market share in core U.S. categories like Skin Care and diapers. While pricing dynamics may fluctuate, especially if tariffs begin to impact cost structures, he believes P&G will continue to adjust pricing to preserve margins.
The company has already announced a CEO transition (COO Shailesh Jejurikar to become CEO effective January 1, 2026), which is also seen as an opportunity for renewed strategic clarity. Moskow anticipates that under new leadership, P&G will sharpen its execution and prioritize initiatives that support longer-term growth.

Carney said there is a lot to do in Canada and his government is focused on ""what we can control.""
""Yes we are having discussions with the Americans but Canadians want us to focus here at home,"" the prime minister told reporters in Ottawa.
Trump escalated his trade war last week by hitting Canada with a baseline 35 per cent tariff that applies only to goods not covered by the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement on trade, better known as CUSMA.
Just after midnight on Thursday, U.S. tariffs on goods from more than 60 other nations and the European Union were increased. The duties range from a low of 10 per cent to 50 per cent for Brazil.
""BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!"" Trump posted on social media just after the duties took effect.
The EU, Japan and South Korea — which have brokered trade agreement frameworks with the Trump administration — saw U.S. tariffs increase to 15 per cent. Bangladesh and Vietnam were hit with 20 per cent duties. Switzerland saw its tariff increase to 39 per cent.
Nations are also being hit with Trump's separate tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and automobiles.
American tariffs are now at a level not seen in the U.S. in almost a century. The Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research centre, has said Americans will see an average tax of 18.3 per cent on imported products, the highest rate since 1934.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford told media outlet CNN on Wednesday that ""a tariff on Canada is a tax on the American people.""
""This is hurting the American people,"" Ford said, adding that Canada and other countries are ""diversifying our trade.""
When asked how Canadians view Trump, Ford said he's ""probably the most disliked politician in the world in Canada because he's attacked his closest family member, and that's the way we look on it.""
""And when I talk to the governors, senators and congresspeople, even Republicans totally disagree, but they're too scared to come out and say anything because the president will go after them,"" he added.
Signs are emerging that Trump's tariffs are starting to drag down the American economy. After the release of a bleak jobs report last week, Trump fired the head of the agency that produces the monthly figures.",6076b4bfb0377dc27185aee5466d171d,trafilatura,2505,0

TMC The Metals Company stock has been a huge winner in 2025, and its share price has more than quadrupled year to date.
-
The company has seen huge gains as the importance of the the United States' domestic mineral sourcing capabilities has come into focus.
-
TMC is a very risky investment, but there are realistic scenarios in which the stock could keep rocketing higher.
TMC The Metals Company (NASDAQ: TMC) has been one of the market's most explosive stocks across 2025's trading. Even after a recent pullback, the company's share price has surged roughly 368% year to date as of this writing.
TMC's huge gains have been powered by expectations that regulatory shifts and other political dynamics will fast-track the seabed mining specialist's path to operational deployment and rapid growth. If you're wondering whether the mining company has what it takes to turn a $10,000 investment into $50,000 or more over the next five years, read on for a look at key dynamics that could shape the stock's performance over that time frame.
Could TMC 5x over the next five years?
TMC's business is still in a pre-revenue state, and its stock is a risky investment candidate. On the other hand, some key dynamics have been moving in the company's favor -- and there are feasible outcomes that could result in its share price surging far above current levels.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April to expedite permitting applications for seabed mining operations, and TMC responded by submitting several applications for regulatory approvals. Seabed mining capabilities could be crucial to helping to improve the United States' ability to source rare earth minerals domestically. Along those lines, the recent pullback for TMC stock has actually been driven by signs suggesting that the Trump administration could reach a trade agreement with China that secures future access to Chinese minerals.
With a market capitalization of roughly $1.9 billion, TMC is still a relatively small company. Its stock is also a highly speculative investment play. While the company's shares come with a very high level of investment risk, I think there's actually a very good chance that its valuation will bound well above current levels. Whether or not the company's stock can deliver 5x returns over the next five years remains to be seen, but geopolitical dynamics and the importance of rare earth mineral sourcing suggest the potential is there even if that outcome is far from a safe bet.",6cb293480e12760efd6a97fd64585822,trafilatura,2504,0

Ripple announced a major new acquisition on Thursday, leading to today's spike.
-
Ripple says the acquisition builds a ""comprehensive"" stablecoin solution.
-
Investors hope this will drive XRP demand.
XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) is gaining on Friday. From 4 p.m. ET yesterday, the cryptocurrency is up 5.1% as of 3:52 p.m. ET. The move comes as Bitcoin was mostly flat.
Ripple, the company behind XRP, announced a major acquisition that could help boost XRP demand.
Ripple is betting on stablecoins
Ripple announced yesterday that it has agreed to purchase Rail, a stablecoin platform, for $200 million. Ripple says that the acquisition will deliver the ""most comprehensive stable coin payment solution on the market.""
Ripple is trying to take advantage of the excitement around stablecoin adoption. With the recent passage of the Genius Act, stablecoins could become a substantial part of the traditional financial system.
Ripple President Monica Long said in a statement that with the acquisition, ""Ripple was uniquely positioned to drive the next phase of innovation and adoption of stablecoins and blockchain and global payments.""
While investors appeared to believe the acquisition would lead to increased adoption of XRP itself, it's not clear yet how much this will hold true.
XRP could be overvalued
It's possible that, like other aspects of Ripple's business, Rail won't directly translate to XRP adoption.
I continue to have doubts about its valuation. To be sure, XRP is a crypto with real-world utility already in widespread use -- and in a world of meme coins that is worth something -- but I'm not sure its current market cap of nearly $200 billion makes sense.
Should you buy stock in XRP right now?
Before you buy stock in XRP, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and XRP wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Savage noted that picking between sticking with sky-high valuations and looking for value in an expensive market isn't a black and white decision. The S & P 500 currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 22 times, near the top of its historical average over the past 20 years, when it's averaged about a 16 times multiple, according to FactSet data. Megacap technology stocks are responsible for the majority of the S & P 500's rise in 2025, and much of its earnings growth in the second quarter. Some of the headwinds hanging over the market, he said, are how the Federal Reserve will handle short-term interest rates in September and President Donald Trump's tariffs. ""The idea of concentration risk of only a handful of stocks [that] are making all of the money and seeing all of the flow is not unique — we've seen this movie before,"" Savage told CNBC Pro in an interview. ""It usually gets taken out in a rotation trade. Are we due for a rotation trade? Sure, but it needs a catalyst, and that catalyst usually comes from the cycle changing."" ""It's really easy for us to pontificate on potential great story policies, but they're [only] narratives and the current environment is impeding clear investment goals,"" he added. With the market setting itself up for a pullback of maybe 5% in the near-term, Savage said he prefers commodities as opposed to equities. When looking for equities, he said he largely favors companies offering high cash flow. The concern, Savage said, is that there's little sign that the current makeup of the market is headed for a cycle change. For that to happen, there needs to be more clarity as to how the Federal Reserve will handle short-term interest rates, as well as how Trump's tariffs will affect the economy. For example, Savage said that the economy likely won't feel the full effects of the tariffs until October or November, two or three months from now. ""It's really hard for anyone to argue with me about growth or value when return on investment is a fundamental part of the math equation,"" Savage said. ""So even if the Fed does cut 50 basis points [half a percentage point], as everyone expects, it might not be sufficient to make that equation work."" ""Welcome to my world of uncertainty,"" he added.",580772ae1806e7e10eef97e1e1910740,trafilatura,2492,0

The San Francisco-based company’s shares have been trading on-and-off all week below the $85 level, where they opened on July 31, their first day in the market. Despite modest rebounds, the design software firm’s stock has given back much of the increase that briefly mesmerized Wall Street.
Figma’s 250% first-day pop was the largest in at least three decades for a US-listed company that raised more than $1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. After further gains last week that lifted the stock to more than quadruple the price IPO buyers paid, Figma is now trading at around $80, down from a peak of $142.92 on Aug. 1.
“Figma was a testimony to the speculative nature of this market, abetted by some of the peculiarities of the IPO process,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Folks will probably lose interest and move onto the next situation if the stock persists below its opening print, even with the stock still up more than double over its IPO price.”
Part of the raucous debut can be credited to a tiny pool of available shares to trade — just 7% of the outstanding stock is in the public domain — meaning it was partly a product of an imbalance in demand and supply.
While recent debutants like Circle Internet Group Inc. have seen eye-popping returns, the drop off in trading volume and chatter on social media platforms that cater to individual investors show the group moved on after a few days as activity stalled. Recent IPOs including CoreWeave Inc. and Circle have more than tripled from their IPO prices, though both have wiped out more than 30% of their value from closing highs.
Figma’s market value currently stands at roughly $39 billion, down from a closing peak of almost $60 billion. However, the current price is still well above the range investors had been pitched in meetings before the IPO. The stock now trades at a price-to-sales ratio of roughly 37, vastly outstripping comparable firms like Adobe Inc., which attempted to buy Figma in 2023 and trades at a less than six times sales.",cf0f2ddfdd111cae59c5352da9022c9e,trafilatura,2485,0

Zuber Issa, who owns a 25pc stake in EG, said the company should hive off its American forecourts to a single buyer rather than pursuing a listing of the entire group as planned.
Mr Issa, along with his brother Mohsin, who also owns 25pc, built EG Group from a single station in Bury, Manchester into a major empire spanning hundreds of petrol stations.
EG is now 50pc owned by private equity group TDR Capital, which has been laying plans for a float of the business in New York.
However, in an apparent rebuke to TDR’s plans, Mr Issa has called for the separate sale of the US business rather than an outright float of the whole company.
“There are people who want to buy the US assets. It will be an auction process which would get to a clear end goal much quicker [than an IPO] and we can pay the debt off,” he told the Financial Times.
“The shareholders are still thinking about the options. Other options would be trying to sell the US in its entirety. And I think that should be an option we should do”.
New ventures
Mr Issa stepped down as co-chief executive of EG last year and is now a non-executive board member, focusing on his new venture EG On the Move after buying EG’s last forecourts in the UK.
EG Group was earlier this year exploring plans to sell off some European assets in countries like France and Germany to offload debt ahead of a stock market listing.
The Blackburn-born brothers founded Euro Garages, or EG, in 2001, after acquiring a single petrol station and proceeding to buy up forecourt sites from oil giants like Esso.
In 2016, they partnered with TDR Capital and merged Euro Garages with its European Forecourt Retail Group, turning it into EG Group. The rapid expansion was fuelled by borrowing, with the return of higher interest rates forcing the group to sell off parts to bring down debt.
In an ill-fated venture, the Issa brothers bought supermarket chain Asda in an £6.8bn acquisition with TDR in 2021. Zuber has since sold his 22.5pc Asda stake to TDR, giving them majority control.
EG Group employs nearly 40,000 people across more than 5,500 sites, serving close to 1bn customers a year. Among its operations in nine countries, the US generates the most revenue.
EG Group and TDR Capital declined to comment.",93a96d8167f075b6815989b420f5817b,trafilatura,2443,0

The company also declared a quarterly dividend, authorized a significant share repurchase program, and completed a lease renewal in Ghana. Despite a decline in gold production, these developments likely bolstered investor confidence, contributing to the company's 36% share price increase over the last quarter. This upward movement aligns broadly with the market's positive trend, which included record highs in the Nasdaq and increased overall investor optimism amidst additional stock buyback activity and dividends within the sector.
Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Newmont you should know about.
With Newmont's latest results showing a boost in sales and net income, the company's operational and strategic developments could reinforce its current narrative of resilience, focusing on gold demand and asset synergies. However, despite a recent uptick in its share price—36% this past quarter—the stock has achieved a total shareholder return of 63.75% over the past three years. This long-term performance reflects a complex mix of operational efficiency and market conditions, aligning with the company's efforts to maintain stability amidst fluctuating gold production rates.
Over the last year, Newmont's performance has outpaced the broader US Metals and Mining industry, which returned 24.1%. This indicates a strong relative positioning, likely aided by the company's proactive engagement in shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchase programs. As for revenue and earnings forecasts, the recent lease renewal in Ghana and other long-term initiatives might offer sustained revenue support, though the decline in gold production introduces a risk to achieving the expected 1.6% annual revenue growth over the next three years.
Currently trading at US$68.98, Newmont's share price aligns closely with the consensus price target of US$70.36, suggesting the market views the stock as fairly priced given current conditions. The modest price differential indicates skepticism about substantial immediate upside but acknowledges the potential for incremental value in alignment with forecasted earnings of US$6.3 billion by 2028. As such, the current developments signal a stable, though cautious, investor sentiment focused on sustainable growth.",137a682bc24c75cf0eaf03d886e60a99,trafilatura,2442,0

Stocks Settle Higher on Solid Earnings and Hopes for a Ukraine Peace Deal
Pinterest stock has been in a sharp uptrend over the past four months. Despite today’s plunge, it’s up nearly 50% versus its low set in late April.
Here’s Why the Q2 Release Is Still Positive for Pinterest Stock
While the NYSE-listed firm did come in slightly shy of the EPS estimate for its Q2, the company’s financial release was, nonetheless, largely positive for long-term investors.
For starters, Pinterest continued to grow its user base at an exciting pace, ending the quarter with 578 million monthly active users (MAUs), up some 3.5 million sequentially.
More importantly, the San Francisco-headquartered company guided for $1.033 billion to $1.053 billion in revenue for its current financial quarter, handily beating analysts at $1.025 billion.
Together, this suggests the post-earnings decline in PINS shares may be a buying opportunity, especially if you plan on owning them for the long term.
BofA Recommends Buying the Dip in PINS Shares
Bank of America analyst Justin Post recommends buying Pinterest shares on the post-earnings decline since the company’s revenue grew a more than expected 17% to nearly $1 billion in Q2.
According to him, AI-powered advertising tools like Performance+ will likely unlock significant further upside in PINS stock in the back half of 2025.
Additionally, Pinterest stands to benefit from expanding partnerships with the likes of Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), the BofA analyst told clients in his research note today.
The social media firm’s transformation into a personalized shopping and ad platform positions it to capture more market share and boost monetization, he added.
Post raised his price target on Pinterest stock this morning to $44, indicating potential upside of well over 20% from here.

Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, is seeking a pardon from President Donald Trump for money-laundering violations.
Zhao has been out of prison for two years and is now pushing for a pardon, backed by a sophisticated influence operation.
Zhao’s campaign is notable even in a time when many seeking pardons are paying substantial fees to lobbyists and lawyers with connections to President Trump.
The implications of Zhao’s pardon could be significant for the cryptocurrency industry. Zhao and his team are employing a variety of strategies that have previously helped wealthy interests secure preferential treatment from President Trump.

Publicly, Zhao has praised the president’s crypto policies in podcast interviews. Behind the scenes, his team has hired lobbyists with ties to Trump’s circle.
As per the report by The New York Times, Binance has also fostered a business relationship with the Trumps, striking a deal that profited the family’s own crypto firm, World Liberty Financial.
Both Zhao and Binance pleaded guilty to serious crimes in 2023, admitting that a flawed compliance system allowed illicit actors to move money on the platform. However, the Trump administration appears to be considering the possibility of granting clemency.
The White House has received pardon applications from both Zhao and Binance, and according to sources, these applications are currently under review.
The potential political fallout of a pardon for Zhao has been discussed among Trump’s advisors.
Democrats are worried that Trump will grant the pardons to reward Binance for directing business to World Liberty Financial, thereby paving the way for a more profitable partnership. Zhao has dismissed claims that Binance’s dealings with World Liberty are related to his pardon push.
The pardon of Zhao could have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry. If granted, it could set a precedent for other crypto industry leaders facing similar charges.",8bc79d645a88418987fa196af1820b86,trafilatura,2421,0

(Reuters) -SoftBank has selected investment banks to help organize a potential initial public offering in the United States for its Japanese payments app operator PayPay, according to two people familiar with the matter.
The banks leading preparations for the listing are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Mizuho Financial Group and Morgan Stanley, the sources said.
The PayPay offering may raise more than $2 billion from investors when it takes place, which the sources said could be as soon as the final quarter of this year.
The sources declined to be named as the information is not public and cautioned that factors including timing and the amount the IPO could raise are subject to market conditions.
SoftBank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Mizuho, and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
SoftBank's shares rose around 7% on Tuesday after the Tokyo market was closed for a national holiday.
PayPay played a role in encouraging Japanese consumers to move away from a long-standing preference for cash by offering rebates on payments through its mobile app.
It also offers financial services including banking and credit cards.
Reuters reported two years ago that SoftBank was considering a U.S. listing for PayPay, with the conglomerate saying earlier this year it wanted to IPO the business.
Should it happen, it will be the first U.S. listing of a SoftBank majority investment since the blockbuster IPO of Arm Holdings. SoftBank took the chip designer public in 2023 at a valuation of $54.5 billion, which has subsequently increased to today's market capitalization of more than $145 billion.
U.S. IPO activity has gained momentum in a long-awaited rebound, supported by strong tech earnings and signs of progress in trade negotiations that have helped restore investor confidence.
The wave of solid market debuts marks a reversal from earlier this year, when uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariff policies stalled new listings.
PayPay's ownership is split between a number of SoftBank entities: wireless carrier SoftBank Corp, the Vision Fund investment arm, and internet business LY Corp, which is a joint venture between SoftBank and Naver Corp.
Shares in SoftBank Corp and LY Corp rose 2% on Tuesday.

(Reuters) -Television broadcaster Nexstar Media Group is in advanced talks to acquire rival Tegna, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Shares of Tegna surged 30% in extended trading following the report, while Nexstar's shares were largely flat.
A deal could be finalized soon, provided talks avoid last-minute obstacles, the source said, who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential.
A potential deal between the two companies would mark a significant step in the ongoing consolidation of the U.S. television industry, as broadcasters adapt to shifting consumer habits driven by cord-cutting and the rapid expansion of streaming, amid expectations of looser regulations under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
During Tegna’s August 8 earnings call, CEO Mike Steib cited a recent decision by the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals striking down the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) ""Top Four"" rule, which prohibited ownership of two top-rated stations in the same market.
Steib said the ruling, along with a more permissive FCC stance under Chairman Brendan Carr, could soon ease ownership limits, allowing companies like Tegna and its rivals more room to expand through mergers and acquisitions.
""We believe deregulation is coming and will create significant opportunities. We are open to being a buyer or seller, depending on the opportunities, and are disciplined in our approach,"" he said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. Both Nexstar and Tegna declined to comment on the report.
Tegna has been subject to takeover interest in the past. In 2022, it agreed to be taken private by Standard General in a deal valued at $8.6 billion, including debt, but later terminated the merger agreement following regulatory scrutiny.
Nexstar owns or partners with more than 200 stations across 116 markets. It also operates prominent media properties such as The CW and NewsNation, and has recently ramped up its focus on sports content.
Tegna controls 64 stations and runs networks including True Crime Network. The company has a market valuation of about $2.42 billion, compared with Nexstar’s $5.56 billion, according to LSEG data.

One such company is BigBear.ai Holdings (BBAI), which has captured market attention with a 120% surge in share price over the past three months.

BigBear.ai has built a reputation for delivering mission-ready solutions that closely align with government and commercial demands. With its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings scheduled to release on Aug. 11 after the market close, the coming days may offer a clearer view of its trajectory.
About BigBear.ai Stock
BigBear.ai, headquartered in McLean, Virginia, specializes in AI-driven software designed to help organizations interpret complex data and make critical decisions with precision. Its market capitalization stands at $2 billion, and while a significant portion of its revenue flows from government contracts, its reach extends to manufacturing, healthcare, and life sciences.
BBAI stock has been on a remarkable run, reflecting the market’s appetite for AI-linked plays. Over the past year, BBA has delivered a 480% gain, far outpacing the broader market. Year-to-date (YTD), shares have risen 60%.
From a valuation lens, however, the stock is trading at a premium. At 12 times sales, BBAI stock sits well above the industry average, a sign that the market is already pricing in substantial growth.
BigBear Misses on Q1 Earnings
On May 1, BigBear.ai reported its first-quarter earnings, which fell short of analysts’ expectations. Revenue came in at $34.8 million, marking a 5% increase from the same quarter last year, driven mainly by additional revenue from the Department of Homeland Security and Digital Identity awards. However, this figure missed the consensus estimate of $40.24 million.",280cd3050755d40d2a99fccd1f160d0f,trafilatura,2352,0

Williams pointed to solid, better-than-expected performance across key metrics, including EBITDA, free cash flow, and mobile subscriber growth. He noted that Comcast’s broadband business is starting to show signs of stability, with improving trends in subscriber connections and churn, even as competition remains intense.

Comcast’s growth is being driven by several business lines. Its broadband and mobile segments continue to perform well, and its streaming operations are making meaningful contributions. The analyst believes that these areas give the company multiple paths to sustain revenue growth over the coming years.
The analyst also highlighted Comcast’s strong financial footing. Among the most notable financial health metrics highlighted were the company’s healthy balance sheet, ongoing share repurchases, consistent dividend payouts, and expected tax-related benefits.
Although it’s still early to gauge the full impact of Comcast’s recent strategic initiatives, Williams sees the initial results as encouraging. In addition, the combination of operational momentum and sound financial management supports his positive outlook on the stock.

Ives’ bullish remarks arrive only days after the Denver-headquartered firm reported a blowout Q2 and raised its full-year guidance, citing robust demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) offerings.
More News from Barchart
Palantir stock has been a true millionaire-maker since early 2023, having delivered some 2,000% gains in less than three years.
Wedbush Sees Palantir Stock as a Top AI Pick
In a recent interview with CNBC, Dan Ives maintained his position that PLTR shares are “the Messi of AI,” saying the firm trumps every other company within the tech sphere in terms of software and use cases.
According to him, Palantir is uniquely positioned to benefit from sovereign AI demand, while its commercial segment is growing at an exceptional rate as well.
The Wedbush analyst recommends owning Palantir stock for the long term also because it is “obliterating” the “Rule of 40” as the firm’s CEO Alex Karp told investors on the latest earnings call.
Note that Palantir currently commands a market cap of roughly $430 billion only. An increase to $1 trillion, as Ives forecasts, translates to more than 100% growth over the next three years.
Why Valuation Isn’t a Concern for PLTR Shares
Palantir shares are currently going for a forward price-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 450x, uncomfortably aggressive for conservative investors.
However, “if you focus on valuation, you missed every transformational tech stock in the last 20 years,” Ives told CNBC this week.
Ives maintained his “Outperform” rating on PLTR stock, citing “continued hyper growth demand for the company’s artificial intelligence product suite.”
In a research note this past Tuesday, he raised his price target on the AI stock to $200, indicating potential upside of another 7% from current levels.
Wall Street Disagrees with Dan Ives on Palantir
Other Wall Street analysts, however, recommend steering clear of Palantir stock due to valuation concerns.
The consensus rating on PLTR shares currently sits at “Hold” only with the mean target of roughly $147 indicating potential “downside” of more than 20% from here.",ffc9cf65576ad22f6d7b1698e6c7a8ba,trafilatura,2282,0

SkyBridge Capital founder and leading cryptocurrency advocate Anthony Scaramucci endorsed the Avalanche (CRYPTO: AVAX) network on Wednesday, suggesting it is on the verge of significant growth.
Scaramucci Sees Potential In Avalanche
Scaramucci stated in an X post, “Avalanche has been building and its moment is coming,” indicating his firm support for the Layer-1 blockchain.
John Nahas, Chief Business Officer at Ava Labs, Avalanche's lead developer, responded to the post with a saluting emoji.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
Scaramucci cited a video from the Tokenized Asset Coalition in which Nahas discusses the concept of “purpose-built chains” for specific use cases.
Nahas highlighted how Avalanche is moving away from piling everything into single chains, instead focusing on the idea of ""Your business, your blockchain.""

The company generates more than $750 million in free cash flow annually, with guidance pointing to $770 million for FY 2026. This strong cash generation supports consistent shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks. Most recently, STERIS raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.63 per share, pushing its dividend yield to approximately 1%.

In its Q2 2025 results report at the end of June, the company highlighted headwinds from tariff costs over FY 2025, which it plans to offset through adjustments in sourcing of materials, pricing, and cost discipline.
However, pricing seems to be slightly less elastic for the company, and most of the revenue growth appears to be coming from higher volumes, as pricing has declined for the last three quarters, while it contributed only 0.3% towards the organic sales growth of 1.6% in Q2.
McCormick’s share price has already lost around 8% YTD, and the market appears cautious on the consumption trends. In a note dated July 29, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Matthew Smith revised his outlook on the company and lowered the price target from $82 to $76 while maintaining a Hold rating. Smith expressed a cautious stance ahead of the second-quarter earnings season, particularly for food sector stocks under his coverage.
The analyst pointed to ongoing softness in consumer demand that persisted through the second quarter, contributing to a more conservative view on the group’s performance. For 2025, Stifel projects only about 1% organic sales growth across its food and beverage coverage universe, alongside an average EPS decline of 15%. Given these subdued expectations, the analyst advised investors to take a selective approach when considering exposure to the food sector.

On August 7, UBS analyst John Hodulik reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $540.00 price target. The rating affirmation follows Applovin’s second quarter results, beating Wall Street’s targets and guiding higher for sales in the current period.
The firm increased its fiscal year 2026 EBITDA estimate to $6.18 billion, above the Street consensus of $5.65 billion. This was driven by better-than-expected gaming-related trends in the second and third quarters.
The firm is optimistic that AppLovin’s staggered rollout of its self-serve web-based ad platform, which begins in October, reduces medium-term risk for web-based advertising revenue growth. The rollout will start with referral-based advertisers before moving to general availability in the first half of 2026.

This will allow the company to deliver multi-quarter revenue growth particularly with expansion into international markets.
Once the ad platform becomes generally available, advertisers will likely spend faster. The stock dip after-hours is therefore a buying opportunity:
“From here we see scope for GA advertisers to ramp spend faster as they benefit from more iteration on the platform. All-in, we’d take advantage of the AH weakness and reiterate our Buy rating on the basis of attractive risk/reward (2.1x), attractive valuation (37x FY26 P/E vs 42% 3-YR EPS CAGR) and improving catalyst path visibility.”

On July 23, Goldman Sachs analyst Carly Davenport reiterated a Buy rating on NextEra Energy and kept the price target unchanged at $91. Despite a recent pullback in the stock following Q2 results, Davenport remains confident in the company’s long-term outlook through 2029.
Investor concerns were primarily related to limited visibility beyond 2027 on development plans and earnings growth. However, Davenport pointed to potential upside from upcoming regulatory decisions, particularly the Florida Power & Light rate case, which could serve as a positive near-term catalyst.

The analyst also discussed the implications of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” While the planned phase-out of solar and wind tax credits by 2027 introduces some uncertainty, Davenport believes NextEra is well-positioned to benefit due to its large project pipeline and strong execution capabilities. This gives the company a competitive edge, which, along with a healthy balance sheet and continued access to tax equity markets (i.e., investors provide capital in exchange for tax benefits), supports the analyst’s constructive stance on the stock.
NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is one of the largest electric power and energy infrastructure companies in North America, having a diverse portfolio of assets, primarily including natural gas, wind, solar, and nuclear generation facilities and battery storage facilities.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is one of the best battery tech stocks to buy right now. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives is very positive about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and thinks the company has a strong future ahead. He gave Tesla stock an Outperform rating on August 4, and kept his price target at $500. With the stock trading at $322.50, this means there is a possible upside of around 55%. That shows Ives believes Tesla can grow a lot more.

A big reason for this belief is the upcoming refresh of the Model Y. Many people are waiting for the new version, and it could help Tesla sell more cars. Also, Tesla is working hard on self-driving technology, and the planned robotaxi is expected to be a big step forward. If that project does well, it could open up a new area of business for Tesla. Wedbush also said that the current political climate under a Trump administration could make things easier for Tesla when it comes to rules and regulations. That might help the company move faster and focus more on its new products.
Ives sees many reasons to stay confident in Tesla. Between the new cars, the robotaxi, and support from the government, the company could keep growing. With a stock price much lower than the $500 target, some investors may see this as a good opportunity.
Tesla is a battery technology company because it designs and manufactures advanced lithium-ion battery cells, energy storage products like Powerwall and Megapack, and integrates these technologies into its electric vehicles and energy grid solutions, driving innovation in sustainable energy storage and usage.

Data analytics firm Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is one of the hottest stocks on the market in 2025. Its shares have gained a whopping 148% year-to-date as the firm has managed to consistently outperform investor expectations. Software stocks, such as Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR), are evaluated by their Rule of 40 score, which combines a firm’s revenue growth percentage and its profit margin to determine business performance. In his previous comments, Cramer has commented that instead of a Rule of 40 score, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) has a Rule of 80 score. The firm’s shares are up by 16% after the firm’s latest earnings, and Cramer was nothing but full of praise for the firm’s CEO, Alex Karp:
“And, Alex Karp, congratulations again for getting the stock up. What a guy. What a sweetheart. That’s a word that’s not used by anyone in the world, remember pistol competition he does.”
Previously, Cramer discussed Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR)’s earnings. Here is what he said:
“Palantir Technology reported a spectacular quarter after the close, much better than expected revenue, up 48% year-over-year, 2 cent earnings beat off a 14 cent basis, management raising their full year forecast dramatically. Company’s Rule of 40 score, which combines the revenue growth rate with the adjusted operating margin, came in at 94 for the quarter. I’ve never seen anything like it, so no wonder this already red-hot stock could surge in after-hours trading.

(NASDAQ:PLUG) from $1.00 to $1.80, but he kept a Neutral rating on the stock. This update came after the firm reviewed its alternative energy estimates ahead of the second-quarter earnings reports. Despite the higher price target, Susquehanna remains cautious about the entire group because of uncertainties related to tariffs and possible changes to subsidy rules under the Inflation Reduction Act.
These risks make the market less predictable for companies like Plug Power. The firm prefers businesses that have strong manufacturing bases in the United States and solid backlogs of orders, such as First Solar and GE Vernova. Given Plug Power’s current market price of $1.50, the upside potential is limited, with only about 20 percent room to grow. Investors should keep an eye on how policy changes and market conditions develop before making big decisions. Overall, the alternative energy sector faces challenges, but some companies might handle them better due to their structure and order flow.

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is considering buying batteries from Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), a Chinese company, for the second version of the Chevrolet Bolt electric car, according to an August 7 report from the Wall Street Journal.
This move will happen even though there are tariffs on goods from China. People close to the plan told Christopher Otts at the Wall Street Journal that GM will use these batteries for about two years. During this time, LG Energy Solution, a Korean company working with GM, will start making cheaper batteries in the United States. This step lets GM keep building cars without waiting for local production to begin. Choosing to get batteries from China shows how important it is for GM to have enough supplies, even if it costs more because of the tariffs.
When LG Energy Solution begins making batteries in the U.S., GM hopes to rely less on imports. This plan shows how car companies try to balance costs and make things at home. Overall, GM’s choice to buy batteries from China for now is a practical way to keep making electric cars during a time when demand is growing fast.
GM is a battery tech stock because it invests heavily in battery production and technology to power its electric vehicles. The company partners with suppliers and plans domestic manufacturing, aiming to lead in battery innovation and secure its position in the growing EV market.

I want to see what happens with the quarter. I wish I could be more definite, but sometimes it’s better just to say I don’t have a handle on it.”

Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) offers CRM technology and a suite of AI-powered platforms and tools, including Agentforce, Data Cloud, Slack, Tableau, and field service solutions to improve customer engagement, analytics, and business productivity. In an April episode, Cramer mentioned the best-performing stocks of the last 20 years and mentioned the company stock. He said:
“Next, in 14th place is one of my all-time favorites, and that’s Salesforce, up 6,738%. This company started as a customer relations management software play, basically invented the cloud software strategy, and now is one of the largest and most successful enterprise software companies on the planet. Salesforce now offers an entire suite of products spanning sales, marketing, customer service, and data analytics.

According to Pierce, the company has made progress in its technology and has built important partnerships. In the past few months, Solid Power has taken important steps to move its technology forward. The company began shipping its first EV cells to automotive partners for testing. This is a key milestone that could help show how well the batteries work in real-world conditions. Solid Power also expanded its pilot production line to improve its ability to make more solid-state cells.
In addition to technical work, the company signed agreements with major carmakers, including BMW and Ford, to support battery development. These partnerships may help Solid Power gain more attention and resources. The company is also focused on improving safety and energy performance compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries.
Solid Power develops solid-state batteries, aiming to create safer, longer-lasting, and more energy-dense alternatives to lithium-ion batteries.

Moreover, the company accepts its AI initiatives, such as Acrobat AI Assistant and Firefly, to contribute almost $250 million to the revenue in FY2025.

According to the analyst, Merck’s Quantum medication is unlikely to pose a major threat to Zoetis’s current market standing. Its medication Simparica Trio, which protects against a range of parasites, including heartworms, is already well-established in the U.S. and continues to drive a significant portion of Zoetis’s sales. In contrast, Quantum’s requirement for vet-administered dosing and its inconsistent duration may impact its uptake, especially in the U.S. market.
The analyst also notes that Zoetis could indirectly benefit from Quantum because its injectable heartworm preventive product ‘ProHeart’ could be used alongside Quantum as a combination therapy.

The feature will mean that new tokens previously only available via decentralized platforms will be available via Coinbase's mobile app. The feature won't be available for New York State-based users.
New digital coins and tokens are frequently minted—including via Coinbase's Base network—and the exchange said it wants to make them available more quickly on its app. The exchange will first allow tokens minted on Base before rolling out support for Solana.
""Every day, more tokens are launched on Base than anywhere else,"" the exchange said. ""Coinbase isn’t just building for traders to access them—we're also empowering the builders creating them.""
It added: ""This means you do not have to wait for a traditional listing to get access to Coinbase’s distribution. For retail users, it means earlier access to new tokens. For Base builders, it unlocks seamless retail distribution directly through the Coinbase app.""
Base is an Ethereum scaling network, created by Coinbase, that allows developers to build new crypto products.
A decentralized exchange—of DEX—is a platform that lets users trade digital coins or tokens directly. Unlike major crypto exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, anyone can execute trades on a DEX because the platforms do not ask for customer information like name, address, or ID from traders—information required by most know-your-customer financial regulations.
In a Friday post on the social media platform X, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that the move was part of the firm's push to become an ""everything exchange."" Coinbase, which went public in 2021, is currently seeking approval from the SEC to introduce tokenized equities.

Astera Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALAB) is a semiconductor company that makes and sells connectivity chips used in enterprise computing and AI. Its shares have gained 32% year-to-date and jumped by 32% in August alone on the back of its second-quarter earnings report. The results saw Astera Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALAB) revenue grow by a whopping 150% annually to convince investors about the merits of its presence in the AI industry. Cramer regretted being unable to find the time to discuss Astera Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALAB) in his Stop Trading segment:
“Carl, had I had a chance to do a Stop Trading I would have mentioned Astera Labs, ALAB, up 43. Lot of that is because the NVIDIA deal they signed in May but I don’t have any time to talk about that.”
Here are his previous thoughts about Astera Labs, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALAB):
“Okay, Astera Labs is a company that is incredibly well run, that has tremendous growth, but like many other companies, that stock has come down in value. I actually think it’s a good place to buy, given the fact that so many of these other stocks actually even have higher price-to-earnings multiples.”

Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a large company that works in many areas, including aerospace, building technologies, and energy solutions. The company has been making progress in battery-related projects this year. For example, Honeywell was chosen to provide automation systems for LG Energy Solution’s new electric vehicle battery factory in Arizona. This shows Honeywell is involved in the growing market for batteries, which are important for electric cars and clean energy.
Even with this progress, Wells Fargo remains careful because the overall market conditions are uncertain. There may be challenges that affect Honeywell’s sales and profits in the short term. Investors might want to wait and see how the company performs before making decisions. The lower price target suggests that gains from the stock could be limited for now, but Honeywell’s broad business areas could help it do well in the future.

On August 8, Piper Sandler analyst James Fish raised the price target on the stock to $144.00 (from $140.00) while maintaining an Overweight rating.
The price target raise follows Twilio’s second-quarter results that demonstrated top-line strength and steady demand for services such as Messaging and Voice AI. However, the firm highlighted several issues that sent shares lower after hours.
“Q2 results showed top-line strength and demand drivers like Messaging and Voice AI remaining well intact, but the combination of lower GPM due to new A2P fees and increasing Messaging (i.e. international) mix, lack of EBIT guide raise given ongoing investments, coming stop of business-unit disclosures, minimal near-term anticipated impact from pricing given the deployment (which is better frankly for long-term), and 2H FCF reduction, has sent shares lower AH.”
Regardless, Twilio’s core business seems to be doing well with actual dollars of profitability/FCF continuing to increase. This is why the firm is recommending to buy the stock, particularly those who wish for an exposure to digital communications and Voice AI infrastructure.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico has set minimum export prices for fresh tomatoes to protect its domestic production and ensure internal supply after a bilateral agreement with the U.S. expired, Mexico's economy and agriculture ministries said in a joint statement on Sunday.
The decision follows Washington's withdrawal in July from a 2019 deal between the two countries which regulated Mexican tomato exports to the U.S..
The Trump administration on July 14 announced a duty of about 17% on imports of fresh tomatoes from Mexico.
While the new pricing rules apply exclusively to definitive exports, they don't restrict export volumes or impose maximum prices. Prices will be reviewed annually or sooner if market conditions demand, the Mexican ministries said.
Minimum export prices per kilogram are set at $1.70 for cherry and grape tomatoes, $0.88 for Roma tomatoes, $0.95 for round tomatoes, and $1.65 for round tomatoes with stems. Other varieties, such as cocktail and heirloom tomatoes, will also have a minimum price of $1.70.
According to official figures, Mexico exported $3.3 billion of tomatoes last year.
""This action reinforces the government's commitment to agricultural competitiveness, dignified rural employment, and food sovereignty,"" the ministries said.
The ministries added that Mexican associations of tomato producers have expressed support for the agreement, which entered into force immediately after its publication on August 8 in the government's official gazette.

The stake, reported in a Form 13-F on Friday covering holdings as of June 30, 2025, represents one of the largest known bitcoin allocations by a U.S. university endowment. IBIT, launched in January of last year, is a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund that allows investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly holding it.
The position places the university among a growing cohort of institutional investors — from hedge funds to pension systems — adding regulated bitcoin products to their portfolios.
The disclosure comes as total assets across U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs have climbed into the tens of billions of dollars, driven by both retail inflows and large-scale institutional allocations.
