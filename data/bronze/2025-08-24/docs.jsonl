For its part, American Eagle said the ad \"is and always was about the jeans.\"\nMore recently, an advert from Swatch sparked backlash for featuring an Asian model pulling the corners of his eyes, in an offensive gesture. The Swiss watchmaker pulled the ads and apologized.\nColgate-Palmolive's ad for Sanex shower gel was banned in the U.K. for problematic suggestions about Black and white skin tones. The U.S. consumer group disagreed that the ad perpetuated negative racial stereotypes, stating that it had featured models with different skin tones as part of its commitment to diversity, according to the U.K.'s advertising watchdog.\nMeanwhile, consumers derided Cracker Barrel's decision to ditch its overalls-clad character for a more simplistic text-based logo as \"sterile,\" \"soulless,\" and \"woke.\"\nIt follows recent product launches from Adidas and Prada that have raised allegations of cultural appropriation.\nAll of this has reignited the debate about when an ad campaign is effective and when it's just plain offensive, as companies confront increased consumer scrutiny.\nOutdated playbooks\n\"Each brand had its own blind spot,\" David Brier, brand specialist and author of \"Brand intervention\" and \"Rich brand, poor brand\" told CNBC via email.\nHe noted, however, that too many brands are attempting to respond to consumers with an outdated playbook.\n\"Modern brands are trying to navigate cultural complexity with corporate simplicity. They're using 1950s boardroom thinking to solve 2025 human problems,\" he continued.\n\"These aren't sensitivity failures. They're empathy failures. They viewed culture as something to navigate around rather than understand deeply.\"\nSome companies have had success in tapping into the zeitgeist — and, in some cases, seizing on other brands' shortcomings.\nGap, for instance, this week sought to counter backlash against Sweeney's advertisement with a campaign in which pop group Katseye lead a diverse group of dancers performing in denim against a white backdrop.\nBrier said companies should consider how they can genuinely connect with consumers and be representative, rather than simply trying to avoid offense.\n\"No brand can afford to fake understanding. No brand can 'committee its way' to connection. No brand can focus-group its way to authenticity. In 2025, customers can smell the difference from a mile away,\" he added.\nBalancing the risk\nNevertheless, ads are meant to spark conversation, and at a time when grabbing and maintaining consumers' attention — and share of wallet — is increasingly difficult, brands have a fine balance to tread.\nAmerican Eagle, for example, saw a share price surge after U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in with support for the company's Sydney Sweeney ad, and Google trend data shows search interest for the brand hit its highest level in more than 20 years amid the controversy.\n\"Brands live and die by standing out and grabbing attention. On top of that, iconic and culturally relevant brands want to stand for something and be recognized for it. Those are tough asks,\" Jonathan A.J. Wilson, professor of brand strategy and culture at Regent's University London.\nIn an age of social media and with ever more divided public opinions, landing one universal message can be difficult, Wilson noted. For as long as that remains the case, some brands may still see value in taking a calculated risk.\n\"It's hard to land one universal message, and even if you try and tailor your message to various groups, others are watching,\" he said.\n\"Controversy grabs attention and puts you at the front of people's minds. It splits crowds and forces people to have a decision when otherwise they probably wouldn't care. That can lead to disproportionate publicity, which could be converted into sales.\"", "content_hash": "969bf10dd7458ddaef9b2ca9d40d6cac", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(A smaller percentage of plans also offer after-tax contributions, which are different from Roth, and allow big savers to exceed the employee deferral limit.)\nFor 2025, you can defer up to $23,500 into your 401(k), plus an extra $7,500 in \"catch-up contributions\" if you're age 50 and older. That catch-up contribution jumps to $11,250 for investors aged 60 to 63.\nWhile pre-tax contributions offer an upfront tax break, you'll owe regular income taxes on withdrawals in retirement, depending on your tax bracket.\nPre-tax funds are subject to required minimum distributions, known as RMDs, or you may face an IRS penalty. The first deadline for RMDs is April 1 of the year after you turn 73, and Dec. 31 is the due date for future years.\nBy comparison, Roth contributions are after-tax, but your balance grows tax-free. For Roth accounts, the original account owner won't face RMDs, but certain heirs are subject to the 10-year rule, meaning the account must be emptied within 10 years of the original owner's death.\nFor some investors, especially for those with a large pre-tax balance, RMDs can be a pain point in retirement, Whitledge said.\nThis can also be an issue for heirs who may have to empty pre-tax accounts and boost their adjusted gross income during their peak earning years, experts say.\nPre-tax vs. Roth contributions\nWhile tax-free growth may be appealing, you should consider your broader tax plan before picking Roth contributions, experts say.\n\"Many financial advisors recommend a mix if possible, but prioritizing based on your current tax bracket and expected future rates,\" said CFP Mike Casey, president of American Executive Advisors in McLean, Virginia.\nIf you expect higher tax rates in retirement, \"Roth options shine for locking in today's rates,\" he said.", "content_hash": "e9e50ab9f746f18fd584807aa9f61808", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The pill's efficacy also appeared to come in slightly below that of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide for obesity, which showed strong data in a separate study.\nShares of Eli Lilly fell about 13% on the day the trial results were released, although they're up about 12% since then.\nBut some analysts say Eli Lilly's daily pill, if approved, could still be a viable competitor in the weight loss drug space — even if it will likely be second to enter the market. It's a highly lucrative area that is eager for more convenient options that could ease the supply shortfalls and access hurdles created by the pricey weekly injections currently dominating it.\nAnalysts note that Eli Lilly's pill could have a few advantages over the daily oral version of Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug semaglutide, which is on track to become the first needle-free alternative for obesity to win approval in the U.S. later this year. Eli Lilly hopes to launch its pill globally \"this time next year,\" CEO David Ricks told CNBC in early August.\nBoth drugs work by mimicking a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress appetite and regulate blood sugar. But while Novo Nordisk's pill is a peptide medication, orforglipron is a small-molecule drug.\nThat means Eli Lilly's pill is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk's does. Orforglipron will also be easier to manufacture at scale, which is crucial as demand for obesity and diabetes injections outpaces supply.\nNeither company has released prices for its respective pill, but some analysts said Eli Lilly's drug could potentially have a lower price than Novo Nordisk's pill. That would be a notable edge, as many health plans in the U.S. still don't cover obesity treatments.\n\"It's a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison because Novo Nordisk could have difficulty manufacturing enough of the product, given the high cost and requirements to manufacture oral semaglutide,\" Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in an interview.\n\"Whereas Lilly plans to blanket the world with orforglipron, and very quickly it will generate dramatically more sales,\" he continued. \"It can launch globally in an extraordinary manner with lower prices and with no food intake consideration.\"\nGoldman Sachs analysts seem to agree, based on a note in August. They forecast daily oral pills will capture 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion.\nThe Goldman analysts said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment. The remaining 19% slice will go to other emerging pills, the analysts said.\nThe race to develop a more convenient obesity pill has been fraught, as companies such as Pfizer have had to scrap previous contenders and bring forward new ones. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are also exploring other experimental oral drugs, along with a slate of other companies such as Viking Therapeutics, Structure Therapeutics, AstraZeneca and Roche.\nIn a statement, Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustar said \"we strongly believe in the efficacy\" of the oral drug. The Danish company added it will be \"laser-focused on getting this product to patients without supply constraints\" in the U.S.\nDr. Mihail \"Misha\" Zilbermint, director of endocrine hospitalists at Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, said it's hard to crown a winner between Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk without knowing how their respective pills will be priced and whether insurance will cover them.\n\"I think both of the drugs are going to be gamechangers,\" he said. \"When it comes to which company is going to win the game — cost is the biggest issue.\"\nWeight loss, side effect comparisons\nIt's difficult to directly compare the results of separate clinical trials, especially as investors wait for Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to release the full data from their phase three studies.\nEli Lilly's ATTAIN-1 trial also followed 3,000 patients, while Novo Nordisk's OASIS 4 study evaluated a much smaller group of roughly 300. There are currently no studies directly comparing the two drugs, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said.\nBut Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide appears to cause a greater level of weight loss than Eli Lilly's pill based on the available data, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman.\nIn the trial, the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight on average at 72 weeks. The pill's weight loss was 11.2% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations.\nWall Street had hoped Eli Lilly's pill would generate weight loss of around 15%, the same level as Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Wegovy and its diabetes counterpart Ozempic.\nMeanwhile, the 25-milligram dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average at 64 weeks, according to results from the trial presented at a medical conference in 2024. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.\nA Novo Nordisk spokesperson added that 20% of weight loss was observed in nearly one-third of patients in the trial.\nStill, the slightly lower efficacy of Eli Lilly's pill may not be significant enough to deter patients from taking it.\n\"For many patients, 12% is a really great number,\" said Seigerman. \"There's definitely a market there\" for orforglipron.\nIn a note earlier this month, Bank of America analysts shared a similar sentiment.\n\"Yes, weight loss fell a bit short, but ask 100 prescribers whether this new data will really make a difference in who they'd put on orforglipron, and our belief is the vast majority would say, 'not really,'\" they wrote, referring to Eli Lilly's trial data.\nSome investors raised concerns about the side effects and discontinuation rates in the trial of Eli Lilly's pill. But Seigerman said the drug's tolerability data — how well patients tolerate it — appears to be relatively in line with that of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide.\nAbout 10.3% of patients who took the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill — 36 milligrams — discontinued treatment due to side effects, compared with around 2.6% of those who took a placebo.\nThose side effects were mainly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting, and mild to moderate in severity. An estimated 24% of those who took the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill reported vomiting, while 33.7% had nausea.\nLeerink's Risinger said he is watching to see how persistent those gastrointestinal issues are once Eli Lilly presents the full data.\nThe side effects in the trial on Novo Nordisk's pill were mostly gastrointestinal-related: 30.9% of those who took oral semaglutide reported vomiting and 46.6% reported nausea, according to the trial results.\nJohns Hopkins' Zilbermint said it's difficult for him to decide which one has a better safety and tolerability profile based on the available data.\nMeanwhile, Seigerman pointed to a different factor \"that will also matter a lot\": dietary requirements.\nFood requirements, manufacturing, price\nUnlike Eli Lilly's pill, patients need to take Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide in the morning on an empty stomach with no more than four ounces of plain water. They're instructed to wait 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other oral medicines.\nSeigerman said that could be a hurdle for some patients.\nFor example, \"if you're a parent with kids and you have to take this drug and wait half an hour before you can drink your coffee, you're going to drive yourself crazy, especially if you have to take this every day,\" he said. \"I try to think about the real-world use of these drugs in a market like this. It's going to matter.\"\nLeerink's Risinger said oral semaglutide will also be \"extremely expensive to manufacture\" since it is a peptide medication, and \"is likely going to have to be priced higher than orforlipgron.\"\nA Novo Nordisk spokesperson said the pill will be made mostly in the U.S., and the company is excited about the potential the pill \"provides millions of Americans living with obesity.\"\n\"Currently, all typical launch readiness activities [for the pill] are fully underway and building momentum,\" the spokesperson said. They added that over the past decade, the company has invested $24 billion in the U.S. to expand manufacturing capacity and fuel research and development. That includes investments aimed at increasing manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and capacity for the final stages of production for both current and future injectable and oral products.\nSmall molecules are chemically simpler and easier to produce at scale, making them generally cheaper for companies to formulate. But it is still unclear how Eli Lilly will price orforglipron.\nDuring an earnings call in August, Eli Lilly's Ricks said the pricing will be based on the value orforglipron brings, considering health-care savings and the comorbidities it can address.\nIn the note earlier this month, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect the pill to be \"priced at parity\" to Eli Lilly's tirzepatide, the active ingredient in the company's obesity injection Zepbound and diabetes counterpart Mounjaro, which list for just over $1,000 for a month's supply.\n\"They should be cheaper than injections because they are easier to produce. But it does not mean they will be cheaper,\" Johns Hopkins' Zilbermint said. \"We just don't know — for example, we don't know how much went into research and development.\"\nSeigerman said commercialization strategies will also be key when the pills compete on the market.\nHe questioned whether Novo Nordisk will lean into the deal it recently struck with CVS's pharmacy benefit manager, Caremark. Under the deal, Caremark started to prioritize Novo Nordisk's Wegovy on its standard formularies on July 1, making that weekly injection the preferred GLP-1 drug for obesity over Zepbound.\nBut it is unclear whether oral semaglutide could receive a similar preferential status.\nSeigerman also questioned whether Eli Lilly will offer orforglipron through its direct-to-consumer pharmacy, LillyDirect. That offering bypasses insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, allowing patients to directly purchase Zepbound and some of Eli Lilly's other drugs from the company.\nSeigerman said he expects \"a lot of nuances in the go-to-market campaign for these drugs,\" adding \"that's going to matter.\"\nOther competitors trail behind\nOther obesity pills are in earlier stages of development, making it difficult to directly compare them to the drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk without longer and larger trials.\nBut so far, some experts think they pale in comparison.\nFor example, Viking Therapeutics on Tuesday released mid-stage trial data that disappointed investors, sending its stock down as much as 40%.\nJared Holz, Mizuho health care equity strategist, said in an email Tuesday that the results on Viking's drug \"look inferior\" to those of Eli Lilly's pill \"on almost all metrics.\"\nViking's once-daily pill helped patients lose up to 12.2% of their weight at around three months, with no plateau, which means patients could lose even more in a longer-term study.\nHolz pointed to the high rate of patients who discontinued Viking's drug for any reason over 13 weeks, which was around 28%. Meanwhile, around a quarter of people discontinued Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, for any reason over 72 weeks.\nThat's \"a much longer trial and therefore [Lilly] looks far better head-to-head,\" Holz said.", "content_hash": "f381da3f05b1fba6d0929c29df97dac6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In those moments, they can't focus on your words. What they need most is your calm, steady presence.\nAs a dual-certified child life specialist and therapist, I've supported more than 1,000 kids and teens through some of life's most difficult moments. And as a parent myself, I've seen how kids' \"thinking brain\" goes offline and their \"feeling brain\" takes over.\nA child can borrow calm from a trusted adult — a process child development professionals call \"co-regulation.\" Research shows that co-regulation is one of the most powerful ways kids learn to manage stress.\nWhy silence works\nWhen kids are upset, they aren't being difficult or ignoring you. Their brains simply aren't in a place to process explanations, compromises, or corrections. What they need is to feel safe again. Your presence brings that safety back, making them more ready to work through things.\nBy sitting nearby, offering touch, modeling calm, providing tools, or playing alongside them, you send the message: \"You're not alone. I'm right here with you.\" You validate their feelings and build resilience — without saying a word.\nOver time, these quiet, supportive gestures teach your child how to manage emotions and recover from stress, even when you're not by their side.\nHere are five ways to silently connect with your child in a difficult moment:\n1. Sit beside or near them\nSitting quietly next to your child, or even outside their bedroom door, silently communicates: \"I'm here if and when you need me.\"\nFor kids who say they want space, you can respect their request while staying available. As long as they know where to find you, they'll feel a sense of predictability and security.\n2. Offer a hand or gentle touch\nNot every child wants to be touched in a difficult moment, and that's okay. But if they're open to it, putting your hand on their back, holding their hand, or even stretching out your palm toward them can offer calm and connection.\nLet them decide whether to take your hand. Sometimes just knowing it's there is enough.\nRespecting their boundaries shows them you'll meet their needs on their terms, which makes it easier for them to reach out when they're ready.\n3. Breathe together\nRather than instructing your child to \"calm down\" or \"take a deep breath,\" show them. Take slow, visible, audible breaths yourself. Kids often start to match your rhythm without even realizing it.\nNo one responds well to being told to calm down, but being in the presence of calm makes it easier for their body to settle into the state they need.\n4. Bring a calming tool or toy\nChildren usually have comfort items that help them feel grounded. Gently offering one or placing it nearby gives them the choice to pick it up when they're ready.\nBeyond stuffed animals, consider introducing simple coping tools during calm times, like pinwheels for practicing deep breaths or stress balls for squeezing and fidgeting. Then, in stressful moments, they'll already know how to use these tools and why they help.\n5. Engage in parallel play\nWhen words feel too heavy or inaccessible, quiet play or connection can bridge the gap.\nTry coloring, building with blocks, or doodling beside a younger child. Perhaps even use stuffed animals or figurines to play out the situation indirectly. For older kids and teens, this might look like working on a puzzle, reading out loud, or even co-watching a show or video game.\nShared activities create connection without pressure and can make zoning out together feel intentional.\nAt the end of the day, your child won't remember your exact words. But they will remember how you made them feel: safe, seen, and supported.\nKelsey Mora is Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

That's the question I wanted to answer when I set out to build what might be one of the smallest livable homes around — at a little over 6 feet by 3 feet — in my front yard in southern Ohio.\nI've always been obsessed with tiny living. I love seeing people get creative with small spaces. Over the past six years, I've traveled the U.S. documenting more than 300 unique Airbnbs, from treehouses to caves to luxury villas.\nOne day, after seeing someone attempt to live in a 22-square-foot home, I thought: I can build something even smaller … and better.\nBuilding a tiny home in just one month\nIt all started with an old utility trailer sitting on my property. It had rust and electrical issues, but there was potential and it was the perfect foundation for a creative challenge.\nThe build took a month. Thankfully, we barely had any rain and wife helped me with a lot of it. I spent a total of about $5,000, which is less than it would typically cost since I already had a lot of the material. The majority of expenses went into lumber, insulation, solar, and electrical.\nThe most expensive part of this home was the battery system. These can run up to $2,800, but luckily I already had one. The second priciest item was the AC and heating unit. I bought a refurbished one for about $600. It was a big investment, but worth every penny because it's part of what gives this tiny house a luxury feel.\nA house this small needs to be incredibly efficient. I installed shed windows for natural light and framed a structure tall enough to allow standing room. For the exterior, I got a great deal on cedar wood, stained it black, and sealed it — giving the home a sleek, finished look.\nDespite its size, the house has the necessary essentials: a compact AC and heating unit, a tilting bed in the vaulted loft space (I'm 5'9, but if you're 5'10 or taller, it might be a little bit tight), a storage bench with space for the massive battery unit, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower system.\nThe kitchen area has a mini fridge, a folding faucet, and a sink beneath the walnut countertop. When not in use, a cutting board covers the sink to create a seamless prep surface. The space isn't ideal for cooking lavish meals, but with a hot plate or camping stove, you could prepare some simple dishes.\nEverything, including the mini fridge and outdoor shower, is powered by the solar panels on the roof. You can also charge the battery by plugging it into an outlet somewhere (this is faster, since solar powering requires the sun).\nI slept in the house during a snowstorm ... and it held up\nMy wife, kids, and I live in our 2,500-square-feet home, but I've stayed in the tiny home a few times, including once during a massive snowstorm. I wanted to test the structure against nature, and it held up better than expected. I had heat, electricity, and a fire outside.\nAnother time, I camped in it with my 3-year-old son. He slept on a small mattress on the floor beneath my bunk. We made s'mores and watched a movie on a laptop. It was tight but cozy, and we had a lot of fun.\nWould I live in it full-time? Probably not, but someone could. Sure, it's really small, but it's also proof that you can create a livable space with almost no square footage if you think creatively. With a truck, I could haul it off-grid or to a campground with no problem.\nFor anyone wanting to build their own tiny home, my advice would be to decide on your priorities first. My goal was to build the smallest, most functional tiny house possible. If your goal is comfort over minimalism, go slightly bigger — maybe 30 to 50 square feet. Even a few extra inches in width or ceiling height makes a huge difference.\nCan you build a smaller livable home than mine? Let's see who takes me up on it.\nLevi Kelly is a tiny homes expert and builder. His YouTube channel is dedicated to showcasing unique, short-term stays, including treehouses, container homes, and luxury accommodations. He lives in Ohio with his wife and two kids.

That's unlikely to change anytime soon — most certainly not in the week ahead, when its earnings report is the market's biggest event. On Wednesday night, Nvidia is set to release its results for the three months ended in July, in what's become the most anticipated earnings report of the season during the generative AI boom. The hype has gotten out of hand before — remember the time a New York City bar held a watch party for the chipmaker's earnings? Nevertheless, for better or for worse, all the other quarterly releases and conference calls crescendo to this one. At some level, it makes sense. The AI gold rush has lifted the market for some two and a half years, and Nvidia's premier picks and shovels enable it. Let us not forget that other companies exist, including fellow Club holding CrowdStrike , which is one of the leading providers of another essential technology for our era in cybersecurity. It is also scheduled to announce results Wednesday evening. Historically, the market has also paid attention to economic reports that contain potentially market-moving data. One of those will drop Friday morning, when Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge for July is due out. Here's a closer look at what we're expecting when Nvidia and CrowdStrike report, and the implications of Friday's inflation data, which will be one week after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's tacit interest rate cut signal sent the stock market soaring . 1. Nvidia earnings: An interesting wrinkle to Nvidia's earnings reports is that its largest customers — the likes of Alphabet and fellow Club names Microsoft and Meta Platforms — offer major clues about demand for its chips when they issued their own results in the preceding weeks. When those so-called hyperscalers signaled they're still spending tens of billions of dollars on capital expenditures, as they did again this earnings season, investors know a significant amount of that money eventually makes its way into Nvidia's coffers. Remarks from executives on their earnings calls also carry implications for Nvidia, as analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out in a recent note to clients. \"At the end of last year, [hyperscaler] commentary focused much more on supply constraints as a limiting factor for growth,\" the firm wrote. \"That's still the case, but more recent comments emphasize a surge in inference demand that's making it more challenging to install capacity to meet it – a very good signal for the durability of Nvidia's revenue growth even as Blackwell begins to ship in greater size.\" Indeed, right now it is the supply of Blackwell generation chips that ultimately determines just how much revenue Nvidia's data center business rings up in a given quarter; all signs still indicate demand isn't the limiting factor. Blackwell is Nvidia's most advanced brand of AI chips, and it began shipping to customers in small quantities late last year and ramping up from there. It succeeded the Hopper generation chips that entered mass production a few months before ChatGPT launched in late 2022. The consensus estimate calls for Nvidia's quarterly revenue to be $45.89 billion, with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.00. NVDA YTD mountain Nvidia YTD As robust as demand for Nvidia's technology may be, the market is a forward-looking machine with a proclivity to be hard to please — especially for a high-flying stock like Nvidia. As a result, investors need to be prepared for a range of stock reactions. Nvidia could potentially deliver better-than-expected results with above-consensus sales guidance, only for shares to fall anyway because the guidance \"beat\" wasn't big enough. This dynamic hurt the stock in February. On the other hand, Nvidia shares rallied after earnings in May because its outlook would've surpassed expectations if not for U.S. government curtailing its ability to sell chips to China. China is once again a big variable, but for the exact opposite reason. With the Trump administration granting Nvidia export licenses for China in exchange for 15% of revenue, the company should eventually start to resume booking revenue from that sizable market. It's just a matter of how much, at what profit margin given the 15% cut, and when. Hanging over it all is the Chinese government discouraging purchases of Nvidia made-for-China H20 chips in favor of homegrown alternatives — is that why Nvidia reportedly told supplier Foxconn to stop work on the H2? Or is that because Nvidia is working on a Blackwell-based version for China instead? Investors will be looking to the conference call with CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress for answers on those questions. Some sell-side analysts, whose estimates form the basis of the Wall Street consensus, continue to exclude China in their projections. So, if the company includes some China contributions in its guidance, that could result in an upside surprise to the tune of $2 billion to $3 billion, according to analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets. However, the analysts expect Nvidia will \"guide conservatively\" around China, just like peer Advanced Micro Devices did. Morgan Stanley shares that view. Here's what the Street expects Nvidia to report for the July quarter: 2. CrowdStrike earnings: The cybersecurity company's quarterly results Wednesday night will offer some counter programming to Nvidia. Big picture, there's been no change to our belief that investors need exposure to cybersecurity companies because their customers cannot afford to cut back on defending their sensitive data, corporate networks and devices. It's such a big theme that we own both CrowdStrike and peer Palo Alto Networks , which last week reported strong results and better-than-expected guidance. With CrowdStrike's stock prone to volatility around earnings, keeping that 30,000-foot view in mind can help investors identify buying opportunities when shares sell off on, say, good-but-not-great numbers. In addition to revenue and earnings, the big metrics to watch for CrowdStrike are annual recurring revenue (ARR), which is a key metric for companies selling software subscriptions; remaining performance obligation (RPO), which is a measure of contracted revenue that has yet to be booked; and free cash flow (FCF) margin, which has experienced some pressure as a result of expenses tied to last year's global IT outage. The hope is, as that incident moves further into the rearview, CrowdStrike's FCF margin can get back to pre-outage levels. CRWD YTD mountain CrowdStrike YTD It's been tough sledding for shares of CrowdStrike since early July, which theoretically should keep investor expectations in check relative to a company reporting with a stock near its highs. Then again, CrowdStrike was also beaten up into its early March earnings report and still ended up tumbling in response to the print. A few days later, though, the stock bottomed out — just as we bought the dip — and began a fierce rally. While no one knows if history will repeat itself this time around, we're prepared for all possibilities. Here's what Wall Street expects on the top and bottom lines: Revenue of $1.15 billion and adjusted EPS of 83 cents. 3. Inflation: The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index for month of July is due out before the opening bell Friday, and it lands on the heels of Powell's Jackson Hole speech. At the central bank's annual confab, Powell hinted that the Fed may need to cut rates as a result of weakening labor market conditions — one side of the Fed's dual mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices. While still expressing some concern about tariff-driven inflation, Powell said he now believes it unlikely that tariffs could spark a prolonged period of inflation and would more likely be a one-time step up in the price level. Powell did take a little bit of the intrigue out of Friday's PCE, saying: \"The latest available data indicate that total PCE prices rose 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core PCE prices rose 2.9 percent, above their level a year ago.\" Powell's numbers are likely based on information contained in a pair of other inflation reports: the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), which we've already gotten for the month of July. While the CPI is the best-known measure of inflation, the Fed prefers the composition of the PCE because it measures expenditures by both consumers and businesses. Among the key differences between the two gauges are how health care and housing costs are calculated. What matters most for investors right now, at least, is how tariff pressures are showing up in the numbers and the implications for Fed policy. But as Powell's speech at Jackson Hole made clear, the Fed sees greater downside risk in the jobs market.

The company recently announced an agreement to acquire Northwind Delaware Holdings LLC for about $2.38 billion. The deal is expected to enhance the company's Permian Basin natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) value chains.\nMeanwhile, MPLX reported distributable cash flow (DCF) of $1.4 billion for the second quarter, enabling the return of $1.1 billion of capital. MPLX offers a current dividend yield of 7.5%.\nRecently, Stifel analyst Selman Akyol reaffirmed a buy rating on MPLX stock and increased the price forecast to $60 from $57. The analyst explained that while MPLX's Q2 results fell short of his expectations, he remains encouraged by the company's growth, further bolstered by its recent Northwind acquisition and its gathering and downstream operations. The analyst added that it may take 12 to 18 months to see the full impact as expansions roll out.\n\"Management remains confident in its ability to grow its distribution at 12.5% for the next several years,\" said Akyol. The analyst highlighted that MPLX has grown both its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) and DCF at a compounded growth rate of 7% over the last four years. He expects this trend to continue with assets that produce durable cash flows coming online.\nOverall, Akyol is bullish on MPLX, thanks to its diverse asset base and the Northwind acquisition. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on MPLX with a price target of $55.\nAkyol ranks No. 319 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.6%. See MPLX Ownership Structure on TipRanks.\nEOG Resources\nOil and gas exploration and production company EOG Resources (EOG) is the next dividend pick this week. The company paid $528 million in dividends and repurchased $600 million shares in the second quarter. EOG has declared a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share, payable on Oct. 31. With an annualized dividend of $4.08 per share, EOG offers a dividend yield of 3.4%.\nRecently, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on EOG stock with a price target of $140. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also upbeat about EOG and has an \"outperform\" rating with a price target of $133.\nEOG is bolstering its position in the Utica shale with the acquisition of Encino Acquisition Partners. Hanold expects the company's solid track record of improving operations to reflect in the Utica region over the upcoming quarters. \"The Utica should garner a lot of investor attention moving forward, as we think it can become a foundational asset for EOG in fairly short order,\" said the analyst.\nHanold also expects EOG's first mover activity in the Gulf Nations (Bahrain and UAE), targeting unconventional activity to present longer-term value opportunities. Moreover, Hanold expects EOG's growing natural gas exposure to exceed 3 Bcf/d (billion cubic feet per day), on a net basis, by the end of 2025, thanks to the company's Dorado pure-gas focused development and the opportunity in the Utica.\nThe analyst added that the long-term secular outlook for natural gas remains robust and EOG is well-positioned to capitalize on that opportunity. Given that EOG was an early mover to secure premium gas commercial agreements, Hanold thinks its two gas plays could attract attention from hyperscalers due to their massive scale.\nFinally, Hanold pointed out that EOG's solid balance sheet, which remains best in class across the energy spectrum, enables management to generate high levels of shareholder returns, despite macro uncertainty. He stated that increasing the fixed dividend at a leading rate continues to be a \"core tenet\" and is supported by the company's lower break-even level.\nHanold ranks No. 26 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 28.9%. See EOG Resources Statistics on TipRanks.\nHome Depot\nFinally, let's look at home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD). While the company's Q2 adjusted earnings and revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, it maintained its full-year guidance. Home Depot said that momentum continued to improve in its core categories throughout the quarter. At a quarterly dividend of $2.30 (annualized per share dividend of $9.20), HD stock offers a yield of 2.2%.\nFollowing the Q2 print, Truist analyst Scot Ciccarelli reiterated a buy rating on Home Depot stock and increased his price forecast to $454 from $433, citing improving underlying trends in the core business. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $458 with an \"outperform\" rating on HD stock.\nCiccarelli noted that Home Depot witnessed its broadest sales growth across categories and geographies in over two years. He added that the company delivered its third consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth in the U.S., with accelerating trends as weather normalized.\nThe analyst contended that while large (financed) project spending remains subdued, demand continues to rise, with big-ticket (over $1,000) transactions growth accelerating to 2.6% in Q2 FY25. Moreover, Home Depot is experiencing a double-digit increase in sales to professionals, who use their new trade credit and leverage the same/next-day delivery services.\nAdditionally, Ciccarelli noted that Home Depot is more insulated from tariff-led volatility than other companies in Truist's coverage. The analyst attributed HD's ability to sail through the ongoing tariff challenges without raising prices to its buying power and diversified sourcing model.\nCiccarelli ranks No. 11 among more than 9,900 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 76% of the time, delivering an average return of 19.2%.

On the other hand, your reflective brain uses reason and deep thinking to work through problems.\nThough the autopilot brain uses far less energy, it does have its shortcomings.\nThe autopilot brain \"assumes, judges, blames, and avoids,\" Stosny, who founded Compassion Power, where he treats conditions like chronic resentment and anger, wrote in a recent article for Psychology Today. It can't help you overcome prejudices against people, for example, or work through anger.\nInstead, the autopilot brain leaves you stuck inside those thoughts and feelings.\nThat's why, whether in a moment of frustration or of judgment toward another person, Stosny advises you turn to your reflective brain. That's \"the regulatory part of the brain,\" he says, and \"the part that calms you down when you're upset, or revs you up if you're feeling down.\"\n'How can I make this a little better?'\nTo help his clients activate their reflective brain in their day to day, Stosny directs them to pay attention to how they're feeling. If they encounter a moment in the day when they're feeling disappointed or angry, for example, he encourages them to ask themselves, \"how can I make this a little better?\"\nThat in and of itself will start to activate their reflective brain and take them out of the cycle of negative emotion, he says.\nHelp us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals\nThe brain has confirmation bias, Stosny notes. So, he also tells his patients to answer this question: \"what's the evidence against what I'm believing right now?\"\nYour brain will notice what confirms your theories and ignore or dismiss what's contrary to them.\n\"I might believe that my neighbor is a terrible person and my brain is automatically going to look for evidence of how terrible my neighbor is,\" Stosny says. \"But if I say, 'what's the evidence against that? Well, you know, my neighbor is a good parent. They keep their lawn nice.'\"\nThese habits help you train your brain to be more reflective on a regular basis, as opposed to leaning into that autopilot and getting stuck in loops that drag you down. And that helps rewire your thinking so that being reflective becomes automatic.\n\"Anything you do repeatedly, your brain will eventually do automatically,\" he says.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Newsom vehemently opposed the move, accusing Trump of \"hoping for chaos so he can justify more crackdowns, more fear, more control.\"\nTrump deployed the National Guard to D.C. earlier this month as part of a stated effort to fight crime, though at the time of his announcement, violent crime had decreased 26% compared to last year, according to D.C. police data.\nNBC News reported last week that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed an order authorizing about 2,000 National Guard troops in D.C. to carry weapons. Law enforcement agents have arrested hundreds of people in D.C. since Aug. 7, according to a White House official.\nMaryland's Moore said Friday that \"many of the comments that are being made from the White House come off as so, so tone deaf and so ignorant\" about fighting crime.\n\"It's because they have not walked our streets,\" he said on CNN on Friday. \"They have not been in our communities, and they're more than happy of just making these repeated tropes about us, but not actually working with us to be able to make sure that our streets are safe and that people can have a real opportunity to feel safe in their own neighborhoods.\"\nTrump criticized Moore's remarks in his Sunday Truth Social post, saying he assumed that Moore \"is talking about out of control, crime ridden, Baltimore.\"\n\"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a 'walk,'\" Trump added.\nRead more NBC News\nHomicides in Baltimore have decreased by more than 24% this year compared to the same period last year, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said earlier this month. His office has also said that nonfatal shootings have declined 18% this year.\nMoore said earlier this month on CNN that Trump was using the military as a \"tool\" for political purposes.\n\"I take very seriously about how, when and why I deploy members of our National Guard in cases of emergency and in true crises,\" he said in the interview. \"And I will not authorize the usage of Maryland National Guard forces for missions that I do not deem to be either mission critical or mission aligned.\"\nThe president on Sunday also threatened to pull federal funding for the replacement of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed in 2024. The federal government had previously agreed to pay for the bridge's replacement.\n\"I gave Wes Moore a lot of money to fix his demolished bridge,\" Trump wrote. \"I will now have to rethink that decision???\"\nMoore slammed Trump's message, saying in a statement that \"any threats to this funding will cause irrevocable damage to the national economy and to the entire State of Maryland.\"\n\"We have already begun rebuilding, and now that Maryland is showing great progress, our President is threatening to intentionally harm Maryland,\" he continued.\nRep. Johnny Olszewski, D-Md., said in a statement responding to Trump's post that \"Baltimore is making real progress, but sustaining our momentum requires collaboration at all levels of government.\"\n\"President Trump's threats to deploy troops to American cities and cancel funding approved by Congress are illegal, unhelpful and directly at odds to that progress,\" added Olszewski, who represents parts of Baltimore.\nIn recent days, Trump has also threatened to deploy the National Guard to other cities. He praised the National Guard's work on Friday, going on to say, \"I think Chicago will be our next, and then we'll help with New York.\"\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker hit back on Saturday, accusing Trump in a post to X of \"attempting to manufacture a crisis, politicize Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he's causing families.\"", "content_hash": "6f0e8684ec2ebfdef1ef6546016c7db6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

With a market that had been headed down every day, except for deep cyclicals and housing-related stocks, the setup seemed extreme. By the end of the week, the bet was one way: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell , perhaps because he wanted to go all-in on irony, would seek to frustrate President Donald Trump 's desire for three interest rate cuts and say that tariffs call for a continued wait-and-see attitude. Powell, addressing the central bank's annual economic symposium in the mountains of Wyoming, did express concern about tariffs and inflation. However, the other half of the Fed's dual mandate, jobs, just worried him more. That led to the Fed chief signaling rate cuts ahead, which touched off a powerful Friday market rally . In the lead-up, all of the different rotations tended to throw people off, but that's par for the course played by the too-smart-for-school hedge funds with the typical bear-side response post \"liberation day.\" The reality was quite different. The data, which Powell has relied upon, even as the president found it a firing offense, clearly showed a dramatic deceleration in hiring, one that caught everyone by surprise. The lack of private sector hiring and the beginning of post-severance federal firings created a one-two punch that did switch the calculus. The mistake the negatively biased hedge funds made was to think that the tariffs would offset the layoffs. Foolish. The tariff laboratory that is Walmart showed that inflationary tariffs would be muted: some eaten by the manufacturer, some devoured by Walmart, and the rest served up to the consumer. The gradual nature of the hit to the consumer while occurring simultaneously with the slowdown in hiring made the Fed's switch imperative. The only fly in the ointment was the inability of the hawks to create an empirical, granular analysis to back up their seat-of-the-pants judgments. That combustible set-up blew up in the faces of the bears who needed nothing short of a Powell decrying everything Trump, not realizing that Powell favors two wonderful factors: honesty and truth. Powell is pathologically judged by some as being late, even as the data has set his view free. I say his record is Pat Mahomes-like, and while Mahomes, to my delight, did throw a pick six to Cooper DeJean in the Chiefs-Eagles Super Bowl, his greatness has never been in doubt. Contrast that with the sainted former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who raised rates endlessly despite ample evidence of a bout of stupidity worthy of Trump's wrath. With the rip and the lack of a selloff even after the heights reached on a Friday afternoon, Monday's importance can't be underestimated, given the levels blown through by so many stocks. Big Tech For me, the big question is not the future of the Magnificent Seven megacaps because each has its own set of issues. Amazon involves its web services cloud hit and its slowdown in growth — as opposed to an actual slowdown. Alphabet 's got a \"Mehta\" gun to its head, Judge Amit Mehta in antitrust legal challenges, not Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Platforms , which actually just threw Google a bunch of cloud business. Tesla has to make some trades to become more of a tech company. Microsoft needs to do nothing — saints don't need to be beatified a second time. Apple 's stuck in Judge Mehta purgatory, too. Nvidia is still being questioned as the center of the bubble without ever being labeled as such. Too much money was lost fighting the last 70 points up. Too much underestimation of Jensen Huang and his relationship with the president. We'll find out the real story Wednesday evening when Nvidia reports earnings . The non-monolithic nature of these comes down to the endless laziness of the media-analyst-complex that I have railed upon endlessly. So, any skein of thought that says it's \"Mag 7 versus the other 493\" has to do with the usual lazy thinking that corrupts the equation. Housing, dealmaking To me, the undercurrent involves an outrageously bullish narrative — buy anything related to housing, mergers and acquisitions (M & A), and initial public offerings (IPOs), all three responding hard to a \"don't fight the Fed\" analysis, thanks to the easily-ChatGPT'd dictum of the late Marty Zweig, credited with predicting the 1987 stock market crash. It's both time-honored and ineluctable, because at this stage, the worst shall be first. That's why, for example, Toll Brothers and Lowe's resonated as strongly as they did. They were both relatively cheap versus their cohorts. They are now your bellwethers for housing. Goldman Sachs for M & A and IPOs. No need for any other ideas to watch, although I am drawn to Wells Fargo and Capital One , the latter because we await synergies and buybacks. Industrials For the industrials, you need to just look at underperformers such as DuPont and Honeywell , which keep coming to mind. But those are Club portfolio ugly ducklings on the precipice of third and fourth quarter split-ups. You don't want to play against type at this moment. It's Nucor 's time, and Whirlpool's , the latter a hold-your-nose pick if there ever were one. There's room for utilities, high-yielding oils, and retailers wedded to housing, such as the aforementioned Lowe's and Club-owned Home Depot . Software Where are the pain points? Sorry, but it's health care, excluding medical devices, and enterprise software, judging by the poor reception to stalwarts Workday and Intuit . These are two that are considered to be most vulnerable to the \"artificial intelligence eats software\" drumbeat that's too loud to be proven wrong. Yes, I know that DataDog , Salesforce , ServiceNow (perhaps), and Adobe are poorly positioned to fend off a decline in seats among clients. But look for Palo Alto Networks to keep advancing: it was truly a bang-up quarter. Along with Nvidia, our other cybersecurity name, CrowdStrike , reports its quarter on Wednesday evening. Befitting the down-and-out semis, Analog Devices put up good numbers, causing a headlong rush into internet of things (IoT). I find the exercise annoying: stick with Broadcom and Nvidia. Catch-up stocks Catch-up plays include entertainment, how sweet it is that Disney returned within three points of where it started its descent, and cable, don't overstay your welcome with Elon Musk 's Starlink on the horizon. Is there any wonder why good content that can't be Musk'd when separated from a cable bundle company reflects negatively on the cable company's valuation and causes a cliff-jump's worth of points? Non- Targ et, non-Walmart retail. Would it have really mattered who Target picked CEO? Don't forget Club name Costco , which has come down hard despite excellent results, and restaurants without much beef or coffee, talking our anti-book here with Texas Roadhouse and Starbucks struggling until the peak of beef and coffee. Anything steel, wood, or home, save perhaps Best Buy , given its inability to capitalize on its sales because of tariffs, works for me. Other loved stocks: Dick's Sporting Goods , Nike , Williams-Sonoma , and the newly canonized Wayfair . Also, anything pets. Becton Dickinson , post-spin, is back. I really like it. Intel saga The monkey-wrench, as usual, is the president. The sideshow of Intel , for example, occupies so much mind space, as if Trump hasn't done outrageous things in the past. The fine print on the deal is cartoonish. The deposed visionary Pat Gelsinger sought to do exactly what Intel will now do, with the money that was earmarked to be turned into a stake for the government. Many have decried this as socialist intervention or \"industry selection.\" That's nonsense. Go read the balance sheet: new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan had run out of options. The share stake, as humongous as it is, beats bankruptcy, where Intel was headed. Disagree? Ain't you people ever heard of cash flow? Can you imagine how solicitous of the president Lip-Bu was, and who can blame him? The sedition charge, made so lightly and maliciously unformed by a senator, and then held as gospel by Fox News, coupled with the canard about the Intel board disagreeing with the strategy put forward by them to Lip-Bu assured that with more help, the money to shore up the sheet would not be forthcoming. Having watched the stock gain made by Nvidia after the presidential blessing and having to go for a 15% \"sales tax\" on China chips, the president wasn't going to be precluded from the real upside this time. Trump can both castigate former President Joe \"Pinata\" Biden and claim still one more saving of a few billion to the deficit if the gambit pans out. The appropriate analogue is the Chrysler save in the 1980s. As a fan of Lip-Bu, call it a win. Bottom line The president has eight months to be able to torture Powell and torment Fed heads for not resigning. He's so good at it that only true masochists stay on. I judge Powell, a masochist par excellence. He's got the whole Diogenes Greek philosopher thing going, which makes for its awkward moments. Why tarnish his rep now? The bake-off could be drawn out to pull the wings off of housefly Powell. I do hope there is a shred of decorum, but that has nothing to do with the market, which will be happy with three cuts now versus three cuts later. I presume the president will find some economic targets to bring up if only just to keep his relevance. I mean, when was the last time Mexico was called on the carpet? He needs bigger name prey than anyone else on the Fed; those under attack barely rise to the relevance of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" for heaven's sakes. Now, unfortunately, starts the seasonally worst month of the year, made heavier by the gains in so many stocks that need to be locked in, and the sea change that comes from no hikes to fast hikes. September will be the first month that we will see across-the-board lifting of prices, but it will also be the first month of increased joblessness, with the latter already regarded as the preeminent Fed concern. So, what does get sold? At the risk of repeating myself: enterprise software, which seems in death rattle mode, autos and auto-related, too hard, pharma, but not Johnson & Johnson , because of its medical device business, but not McKesson or Cencora , either, worshipped by Congress and now ignored by the president. My last thought, here, beware of the endless gibberish about the hazards of rotations. They are harmless. Don't worry about the Mag 7, they don't have the profits that say a Netflix has worth preserving. Pay attention to the decline in the price of homes now that there is inventory, even if there are cancellations galore. And, by all means, recognize that we are on the homestretch of tariffs, and despite the president's endless desire to re-trade won't mean that much anymore.

Your own bank or credit union may have competitive options, but shopping around is key to getting the best rate.\nFind Out: 4 Moves to Make if You Can’t Pay All Your Bills this Month\nRead Next: 10 Cars That Outlast the Average Vehicle\nBefore you borrow, it helps to understand the biggest factors that determine what rate you’ll pay. Here are seven key things you need to know about personal loans.\nThese Factors Determine Personal Loan Interest Rates\nInterest rates on personal loans are determined by larger economic forces and the individual borrower’s credit history and score. Some of the factors that have the biggest impact are:\n-\nEconomic environment: Federal Reserve policy, inflation and overall credit market conditions drive rates up and down.\n-\nLender’s risk tolerance: Rates also reflect the lender’s own costs, operational overhead and their risk tolerance for potential loss if a borrower defaults.\n-\nBorrower-specific factors: Lenders evaluate individual borrowers’ credit scores, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio employment status and repayment history.\nCheck Out: 8 Smart Ways Frugal People Are Living Like There’s Already a Recession\nCredit Score Has a Big Impact on Your Rate\nOf all these factors, credit score plays a big role in the rate you’ll be offered, as it’s the lender’s way of understanding their level of risk in loaning you money.\nHigher credit scores (670 and up) may qualify for lower rates, while those with scores in the fair (580 to 669) to poor (below 580) credit tiers may see significantly higher interest rates.\nLoan Length Affects Interest Rates\nThe loan length determines how quickly or slowly you’ll repay the money you’ve borrowed and will also affect how much interest you pay. Shorter-term loans (24 to 36 months) tend to come with lower rates as a kind of incentive for the likely lower risk the lender is taking. Thus, longer-term loans (60 to 84 months) tend to come with higher interest, since there’s a greater likelihood of missed or defaulted payments the longer you have to pay it back.\nWhile a longer-term loan often results in a lower monthly payment, over the life of that loan you’re paying a lot more in interest.\nFor example: A $10,000 loan at 10% over three years costs around $1,600 in interest. The same loan at 12% over seven years will cost you around $4,800, additionally — a significant amount of money.\nFixed vs. Variable Rates\nThere are two main ways that interest can be applied to your loan, either fixed-rate or variable-rate loans.", "content_hash": "b606cd4e9f84d5f9949dafe59a1098a5", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Friday's surge came on the heels of a downbeat week for markets, as tech stocks took a hit amid AI trade doubts.\nFed Chair Powell raised the prospect of the central bank lowering interest rates in September on Friday, saying in his speech that \"the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"\nWith the speech touching on both the country's economic outlook and the Fed's new policy framework, Powell noted that risks from inflation remain \"tilted to the upside,\" saying that tariff-related inflation pressures \"are now clearly visible.\"\nHis remarks shook up rate-cut bets, which had been waning after a weak monthly jobs report.

The central bank is grappling with whether to hold interest rates steady in September to counter inflation or lower rates in light of weaker labor market data.\nAdditionally, Powell is expected to describe changes to the central bank’s policy framework. The Fed is expected to drop its average inflation targeting policy, which sets an inflation rate goal for the Fed to achieve over the long run. It was put in place pre-pandemic, when inflation ran low and Fed officials wanted to avoid deflation.\nUS stocks rose at the open on Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech in Jackson Hole at 10 a.m. ET.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose around 0.6%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up about 0.3%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) inched up nearly 0.1% — with those gains coming after another downbeat day for stocks Thursday.\nThe US benchmark indexes are still on track for a weekly loss after tech stocks got beaten up by AI trade doubts.\nGrace O'Donnell\nNio stock rises after the Tesla rival unveils affordable SUV\nChinese electric vehicle maker Nio (NIO) revealed its new ES8 SUV on Thursday, sending US-listed shares of the Tesla (TSLA) rival 5% higher in premarket trading on Friday.

(INTU) stock fell 6% before the bell on Friday after forecasting first-quarter revenue growth below analysts' estimates on Thursday.\nWorkday's (WDAY) stock dropped on Friday before the bell after the software company raised its full-year subscription revenue forecast on Thursday, but a forecast in line with expectations for the current quarter pushed the human resources software provider’s shares down.\nAMD (AMD) shares fell 1% in premarket trading following the news that Nvidia (NVDA) has told partners to halt work on H20 chip for China.\nGrace O'Donnell\nZoom stock jumps as Enterprise revenue accelerates\nShares of Zoom (ZM) jumped 5% in premarket trading on Friday after the communications software provider posted earnings that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year outlook.\nZoom CEO Eric Yuan highlighted artificial intelligence as a driver of its strong quarter, with its AI agents underpinning profit growth.\nThe company posted earnings per share of $1.16, compared to Wall Street analyst estimates for $0.72, per S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The Gold Reserve group, whose bid does not include a payment provision to the bondholders, is betting its offer will be deemed superior due to its coverage of 11 of the 15 claimants lining up to cash proceeds.\nJudge Leonard Stark earlier this year instructed Pincus and court advisors in the auction to prioritize price over \"certainty of closure,\" a term defining a proposal's chances of becoming a real takeover.\nAmber, whose bid offers $5.86 billion to creditors and $2.86 billion to the bondholders, is required to show proof to the court of its agreements. The Gold Reserve group has the option of objecting to any competing bid due to procedural issues. It can also boost its own offer if it loses.\nAmber and Dalinar did not immediately reply to requests for comment.\nUnder a new calendar approved by the court on Friday, Gold Reserve's Dalinar will only have three days to match any superior proposal. Gold Reserve said on Friday it engaged investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald & Co as financial advisor in connection with its bid.\nA potential strategy by Dalinar to raise its bid could involve adding more creditors to its proposal, something that is in negotiation, the sources said.\nAmber also has been in talks with at least two creditors in the auction willing to turn their claims into credit bids, according to one of the sources.", "content_hash": "6d58dde94bc5c8267c0b3929aec63933", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Motley Fool Money starts now.\nTravis Hoium: From Fool Global headquarters. This is Motley Fool Money. I'm Travis Hoium joined by Lou Whiteman and our Disney expert for today, Rick Munarriz. UnitedHealth stock is up 10% this morning after Warren Buffett and some notable hedge fund managers disclosed positions. Paramount is private again, but making big deals in the content game. But first, we do have to talk about inflation. Inflation has been the boogeyman from the market for months. Tariffs were supposed to lead to higher costs, which haven't materialized yet, but that boogeyman did peek its head out this week, Thursday, PPI or the producer price index increased 3.3% versus a year ago as food, energy and machinery costs went up. Lou, I want to start with you. Is this a blip or is this actually something to worry about as we think about inflation for the rest of the year?\nLou Whiteman: I'm continuing with my boiling frog economy thought here. We want inflation to be a light switch. We want it to match the headlines, what we see on TV, it's just inflation here or inflation not. But in reality, it's a slow creep and taken together, we had the CPI too, which didn't show any real uptick, but PPI did. Consumers aren't seeing it, but producers are. It suggests that there is this slow creep higher of expense, and it may be the consumer hasn't felt it yet, but I think it's still really an open question of whether or not they will. My answer is yes, the consumer will feel this, and the PPI hinted at it.\nTravis Hoium: Rick, this is something that I think is a little bit confusing so PPI is the producer price index. That's going to be what people making stuff are seeing from inflation costs. But the CPI includes things like housing. How is this dynamic something that we need to think about maybe a little bit differently as investors, where PPI could be that leading indicator that tells us what inflation is going to look like a few months from now, but isn't going to necessarily tell us if housing costs, for example, are going to go up?\nRick Munarriz: That is part of the problem. But again, overall, as a leading indicator or in this case, a bleeding indicator, the fact that CPI came in fine, PPI came in hot two days later, to me, that's problematic. I think, it's going to be very tricky. Everyone's assuming that the Fed was going to cut rates next month. But I don't know if it's too soon to have a soundtrack for the month ahead, but I think green days wake me up when September ends is probably a good way to get through what should be a very volatile month in September as we work out this inflation news.\nTravis Hoium: Yeah, that really is the topic of the day is those fed rate cuts. It seemed a few days ago that that was a done deal, that if inflation was relatively low, we weren't going to need to keep rates high. Rick, where is your hat at with rate cuts? Is that something that you even think about as an investor? Because it's definitely something that's helping buoy stocks over the past couple of weeks.\nRick Munarriz: I think there's almost an obligation to have a small downtak in the Fed with their interest rates.\nTravis Hoium: Is that just because everybody's calling for it or is there an economic rationale behind it, I guess. That's what I struggle with is we are seeing inflation. If that's really the concern, then I don't know why cutting rates would be the right thing to do right now. But then if you're cutting rates because the economy is weak, then that should be bad for stocks, so it's like this strange tension in the market.\nRick Munarriz: Yeah, prices going up while the economy is going down. There's a scary word for it, and I don't mention it, but it starts with a stag, and it ends with inflation. I don't want to go there.\nLou Whiteman: It is, I think, important, Travis, to your point that this whole dual mandate we talk about with both inflation and jobs. The scary thing is, like Rick says, the job market doesn't look terrible, but it doesn't look great. It feels like the best I can figure it out, there isn't mass layoffs in the economy, but no one's hiring, either. I think there is the beginnings of an argument to cut rates on the job side. That's really hard to do with the inflation. Again, I continue to believe that the Fed doesn't want to be stuck at zero or anywhere near zero. I continue to think that we probably will get a cut, but the Fed is much less anxious to cut than investors are anxious for the Fed to cut.\nTravis Hoium: What does this ultimately do for the stock market, Lou? Because the last time that we had inflation was 2022. The numbers went up really quickly, but things were also very different back then. Auto -ompanies could raise the prices of vehicles by $10,000, and there was no supply, so people just had to pay whatever the price was for vehicles. It seemed that way for everything. I remember going down the chip aisle at the grocery store, and it seemed like prices had doubled from the last time I was there. That's probably not where we are today. There may be whether it's tariffs, whether it's higher commodity costs, there may be higher costs, but is there a difference between the inflation that we saw a few years ago and the potential for maybe 3, 4% inflation being the norm Lou?\nLou Whiteman: Yeah, it's going to be interesting to say. I think that is the potential, it's hard to be overly bullish about this. Taking literally the PPI and CPI together would suggest bad news for margins because the companies are seeing higher prices and they're not passing it on. I think that they will pass it on over time. I think if not bull case, the non bear case from here is, is that if this is gradual enough that we can adjust and we aren't going to get a shock to the system and that maybe there won't be a market panic. But it does feel like at best, even if you're trying to make a bullcase trying to figure out earnings growth from here, that this cost is going to be a headwind, and maybe lower margins because of it's going to be a headwind for the second half of this year and into 2026.\nTravis Hoium: Yeah, and let's keep in mind that the tariffs were announced a little over four months ago. It seems like an eternity ago, but the prices that we're seeing in stores today were not set in April. Retailers are making their plans months and months in advance, what I have to wonder is Christmas time? The holiday season is that going to be really when we see inflation start to hit. Rick, I don't know if that's something you're thinking about as we go toward the end of the year. Hey, are we going to see a little bit higher costs, and maybe should I front run some of my shopping? Maybe time to start thinking about.\nRick Munarriz: Some layaway shopping, layaway investing. I think as a consumer, yes. As an investor, these events don't normally correlate. You were talking about when prices spiked when the pandemic happened that we had this I remember when I was paying for a 12 pack of diet Coke was very different in 2019 and early 2020 than it was when aluminum prices and all these other things were factoring into play or when there used to be a McDonald's dollar menu, and it really was $1 menu, and then it just totally changed. The market was fine with that. Stocks appreciated over that time. I don't think it's necessarily the market may not have a negative reaction to this, but as consumers, we will probably feel a pinch.\nTravis Hoium: Speaking of prices going up, we are going to see higher prices for sports content. I think that's probably pretty clear ESPN is going over the top with their app. I believe it's next week that's actually coming out. But the big news this week, we've talked about ESPN in Disney cozying up with the NFL on this show over the past couple of weeks. But the big news this week, Rick, was the UFC making a $1.1 billion deal per year with Paramount. What do we need to know about this? Because this seems like Paramount is now going to be the UFC app.\nRick Munarriz: You figured, Hey, Paramount Plus, they're like it's almost like a bottom feeder of the premium streaming services. Once in a while, it'll have a hit show, but it's not something that's just totally driving the platform. Paramount itself was having issues. Again, that's why it's gone through all these transformations. The fact that it was able to sign this seven year 7.7 billion dollar deal, that's quite a jackpot Fool. To me, this is the thing where while it helps Paramount. I don't think it helps consumers necessarily when they have to keep, this movable feast to find content, but I do think it's interesting, but I don't know if it's in the best interest for UFC. I saw what Joe Rogan had to say. I saw what a lot of fans about MMA were saying after this. But I don't think this is what the sport needs, the UFC needs to draw a larger audience.\nTravis Hoium: Yeah, I want to put some numbers to this, and this is from Ariel Helwani who reported that the social exposure for ESPN, 300.8 million followers across Twitter, Instagram, and I believe it was TikTok. Paramount CBS 32 million. ESPN has 10 times the reach if you're UFC, you have to think about two things. You have to think about how much money do we have coming in the door? This was probably the biggest check they were going to get. But you also have to think about how many people are going to be watching us. Do we want to be MLB and be somewhat irrelevant to the younger generation? Lou, this is a real tension for these companies who are trying to play two games at once here.\nLou Whiteman: Yeah. Absolutely. First of all, I got to give some credit to Paramount Plus. For those of us who do enjoy second and third-tier English soccer, they are already a go to app, so enough with this UFC only. But Travis, it's a good point, but there's a few things to consider. Unlike what MLB has done with Apple TV and MLS has done with Apple TV, there is a \"over-the-air component here,\" or the old-fashioned. Paramount brings CBS and some other outlets, so it's not just all behind the paywall. I don't think it's just going to disappear off the face of the Earth. I think it's also fair to say, look we can't compare it to what has been. ESPN is changing, too. This idea of just all access everywhere from anybody is going away. Things are going behind paywalls. It's just a question of whose paywall are you going to. I don't think this is a move to irrelevance. If anything, Disney's deal, it was a double dip for UFC fans because you had to subscribe and then pay preview. Pay Perview goes away here, which is a benefit for the fans. But I think comparing it to five years ago deal, which included a lot of just over the air or on your cable box for free, I don't know ESPN or anyone that is really going to highlight that going forward. It's hard to just say, Well, what we had five years ago was better.\nRick Munarriz: To Lou's point, Travis, I think that the CBAs angle is interesting because it won't all be on Paramount Plus. Once in a while, they'll have content available freely through CBS, which is a great way for the UFC to remain relevant. But to me if Billy Joel giving up his residency at Madison Square Garden for an exclusive engagement and an eccentric billionaires bunker. This is going to be a problem, because, again, this is CBS of 2025. This isn't CBS of 2015, 2005, or 1980s, sorry. This is not the same reach that CBS used to have anymore. It is a changing media landscape. I don't think that this is what UFC needs beyond just the instant pay. They have the $1.1 billion a year that they'll be getting in the whole process.\nTravis Hoium: Well, thinking about what these companies are bundling together is interesting, too. You're right, CBS is going to have some of this UFC content, but it's going to be along with their other flagship content, which is CSI and content that, young males who are typically going to be the UFC watchers are not going to gravitate toward the same things on CBS. Does that name, CBS mean anything to them? Fox is kind of running into the same thing. They announced that they're going to be at least an option to bundle in with ESPN for an additional $10 a month. But Fox is trying to sell Fox One with some college football games and FOX News, which doesn't necessarily make a lot of sense together. At least, it seems to me if you're trying to build a streaming service, at least the Disney Plus, that's for families, Hulu, the General entertainment, ESPN. It's just sports. All these other ones are mishmashing everything together. But am I overthinking this, Lou?\nLou Whiteman: Maybe. The truth is we don't know how it's going to end up. My pushback on Rick's analogy and what you're saying is I don't know if ESPN is Madison Square Garden going forward, either. I think the days of like you said, the CBS, the over the top, it's going to be there for the NFL. It's going to be there for your college football game of the week. But I think increasingly, wherever you are, you are going to be in some a limited access pay to play world. Why not max out the money?\nTravis Hoium: TKO is going to be fascinating to watch because they're playing both sides WWE, signed with ESPN and obviously UFC, which they also own, signed with Paramount. They're playing all of these cards here. Next up, we are going to talk about some of the big buys from the biggest investors in the world. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nThe day every investor waits for 13F, filing day is today. That's when big hedge funds, big public investors like Warren Buffett have to file. What's called a 13F tells us the stocks that they actually own. The quarterly filings we get what those values are, but we don't necessarily get these specific stocks. The interesting one that came out last night was Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway disclosed what they owned for the quarter, continued selling shares of Apple. But the one that's getting a lot of news today, Rick, is buying $1.6 billion worth of shares of UnitedHealth are up 10% on that news. What do you take of it?\nRick Munarriz: I think, especially with UnitedHealth, a lot of people even in the weeks leading up to this, my whole social was paid with UNH is just so cheap right now. How can this happen? How can this be? But there's usually a good reason why stocks are this out of favor. In this case, it's Warren Buffett being a contrarian at a time when there seems to be a lot of contrarians out there. It's encouraging if you are a long suffering United Healthcare investor. But to me, it's not one of my favorite picks that Warren made this past quarter.\nTravis Hoium: Lou, the other thing, Buffett and we should mention Greg Abel is going to be taking over as CEO, so he definitely has his fingerprints all over these moves. We don't necessarily know exactly who's making the final calls there. But the other thing that he was buying was housing stocks. This is something that I think a lot of people have been bullish on for a long time. Is this, again, a play on interest rates? Is this a recovery of the economy play? What could be going on here?\nLou Whiteman: Travis, full disclosure. I'm not Warren Buffett and me questioning his stock picks takes a lot of hubris, but I am a Berkshire Hathaway investor. Look, I'm really underwhelmed by this, everything you're talking about. Real quick United Healthcare, that scares me because healthcare is changing. I don't think anyone knows how this will end up. I don't think it's a given that yesterday's winners will be tomorrow's winners. This feels like it has all of the potential to be a falling knife you don't want to catch. Then you mentioned the Home Builders. I think this is a logical play on Big Macro. We need more homes over time, but the headwinds in this industry are still very strong. At best, this is early. I want to know if Home Builders look attractive today, why not just get back into repurchasing? Why not initiate a dividend? As a shareholder, I'm not going to question Warren Buffett. I'm not going to just go hide, run away and have a temper tantrum. But this is very underwhelming, the moves they're making both buying and selling.\nTravis Hoium: Rick, the other one that they did sell is T-Mobile. That was one that you brought up, I think that is interesting. But a lot of little moves at the margins, buying more POOL CORP, Nucor, just some interesting. With as much cash as they have on the balance sheet, they could be buying stocks like crazy. They could also be continuing to raise more cash as they can generate a pretty good income just from treasuries. But what is the overall takeaway from at least Buffett's moves. He's mired a lot of the big hedge funds this quarter?\nRick Munarriz: I think you mentioned it. They have a lot of money. They didn't put anywhere close to all of it to work, which is just a very cautious stance, which I think is probably the right approach right now. I'm not necessarily a fan of all the moves that Berkshire Hathaway made, but they do make sense to me. Some of them do. But again, not a full commitment. It wasn't necessarily a very bullish move by still keeping the cash hoard so large.\nTravis Hoium: Lou, what are your final thoughts here?\nLou Whiteman: This is intentionally provocative, and I am not selling Berkshire Hathaway, but I look at all this and nothing is going to move the needle. Selling Apple as much as Apple's gone doesn't really.\nTravis Hoium: Well, they could go out and buy one of the big tech companies like Alphabet seems to fit a lot of the things that Buffett likes.\nLou Whiteman: But they're not. That's my point. Increasingly, like I said, I'm not dumping the shares, but why bother? If this is what the portfolio is going to be, then maybe I should just buy a total market index and get a little bit of a dividend on the side, too, or something. I feel like that there needs to be just something more in the quarters to come. It doesn't need to be overnight. You don't want to be not patient with Warren Buffett and Berkshire. But it feels like that the status quo quarter after quarter of, just nibbling at the edges. I don't know how long that's going to go on.\nTravis Hoium: He's been complaining about having too much cash to invest for quite a while, and we're getting to that point where unless he finds another Apple idea, it's a tough position to be in. Next up, we're going to be playing. Let's go with some big stock moves. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nAfter earning season, we have some big stock moves to talk about. Some companies who are performing pretty well, but their stocks are down. I want to get an idea whether these stocks are, oh, no, they're really in trouble. Or is this a back the truck up moment and let's go? Those are your options. Lou and Rick, the first stock that I want to talk about is one that always seems to look like a value. Shares are down another 10% over the past month. That's Lululemon. But revenue was up 7.3%. Of course, that revenue growth rate has come down, but net income was down. Rick, are you an oh, no or a let's go with Lululemon stock right now?\nRick Munarriz: I'm a let's go, but not with an exclamation point at the end. To me, Lululemon is it's not the same growth stock. It was 5, 10, 15 years ago. That is not the Lululemon you're getting now. It's a more competitive landscape in Athletia. You have the tariff concerns, which are weighing on just about everybody. But, again, I think the fact that the valuation here is at a point. Yes, it seemed like a value stock and almost a value drop that's tripping people up, but I do think that Lululemon will appreciate from here, and it's a good buying spot here.\nLou Whiteman: I'm, oh, no. I hate to be because it's quality stuff, and I really do believe in this stuff. It's an reflection on that. But I do feel like this was a bit of a fad company, and this is just a one quarter thing, Travis. This has been trending in the wrong direction for a long time now. There are more affordable options that have at least pretty good quality. That's always bad news. I don't know. I'm not convinced they can get it back.\nTravis Hoium: If I got to break the tie here, I have to agree with Lou. The local Lululemon store, which is in an upscale mall here, closed and it became an Alo store. I think and maybe I'm seeing all these names incorrectly. I'm not the target market there, but that is just shows that they are not necessarily the brand that they once were, so little warning signs there, even though the stock is pretty cheap at about 14 times earnings. We talked a little bit about the changes in streaming where UFC and WWE are going. The market has reacted positively to TKO group who owns a lot of this content. Shares are up 13% over the past month. Revenue was up 10% last quarter, net income nearly double. That's before really any of these new deals kicked in. Rick, is TKO Group a little bit too rich in, oh, no, or are you let's go with their shares?\nRick Munarriz: Yes, I'm going to go with the let's go, and I'm not excited over the TKO deal with Paramount. I think it's bad for consumers in the short run, bad for the league in the long run, and eventually bad for TKO investors in the long run. But I get it. Live sports continues to be that one thing that defined gravity among the media network. It's great to be in that driver's seat with two very strong products out there that people demand to see. I think the company is doing fine, and I think, it's a let's go.\nLou Whiteman: Near term, I'm going to let's go because there is a lot of money coming in, and that's good. But I'm a long term investor, and long term, I'm oh, no, because I'm going to call it, guys. This feels like a top for sports fees. There's a gold rush going on right now among sports leagues as these streaming services try to just grab territory. I think for a lot of these leagues, it'll never get better than this. I think certain properties NFL maybe will sustain, but I don't think it gets any better than this deal, and so for long term, I think you got to adjust down over time.\nTravis Hoium: The stock looks expensive at 110 times earnings, but forward PE ratio is 34. Rick, the thing I wanted to ask you about is these new deals that we're talking about, TKO typically doesn't have the same cost structure as a lot of bigger leagues who have unions where there's a revenue share with players. Are they going to actually be able to push their margins higher so they double their fee from moving from ESPN to Paramount? Do they get to keep that extra $500-$600 million, or is there going to be some work stoppage on the horizon?\nRick Munarriz: I think you've answered the question right there. Yes, they're going to keep it initially, but down the line, again, the money's coming in, the talent will want to get paid. Obviously, we've seen the WWE over the year where you can dump talent if they ask for too much, if they want too much. But I think it's a different story now. It is something that I still think margins will overall improve. I think they know this, and I think they will reward their talent and their content producers in the process.\nTravis Hoium: Let's move on to Quantum Computing. Rigetti Computing shares are up another 31%. The stock is just absolutely on fire. But revenue was down 42%. Not that, that really matters because this is a pre-revenue company. Net income was negative, so that growth is irrelevant. But Lou, is this a oh, no, or let's go?\nLou Whiteman: I really want to say neither, but that's cheating. But look, they hit every buzzword in the world. They are Cloud. They are AI. They are Quantum. I don't know what any of that means, Travis, and I refuse to. Maybe it's just a solid investing, but for me, if anything, it's an oh, no. Let's see actually what you do and how you make revenue from it and what the profitability is. Then maybe let's talk, but for now, just my brain's not big enough for this.\nRick Munarriz: I'm going to go with oh, no, and to me, it's not the numbers. Travis, the stock up 31%. You see revenue down 42%, income growth negative. Those are scary things, but you're not buying into Rigetti Computing for what happens in the next quarter or even in the next year. This is a future story on Quantum Computing, which is going to continue to grow. It's a long term play, and I don't want to focus too much on this. But, valuation wise, even looking a couple of years out to when it becomes more of a reality, I'm not convinced. I'm going to go, oh, no.\nTravis Hoium: Five point eight billion dollar market cap, despite not really proving out a business model. I struggle with those but it continues to go higher. Let's move over to healthcare. Eli Lilly's shares are down 11% over the past month despite a 38% increase in revenue, net income almost doubled. Lou, oh, no, or let's go.\nLou Whiteman: I'm on cautious let's go here. This probably wouldn't be my first choice here. But I'm too old to believe that this is a one hit wonder, that it's just that bound or nothing. This is a really good company that opportunities and risks involve the GOP ones, but I wish they had a better dividend. You can actually get better dividends out of some of these that are maybe more attractive.\nTravis Hoium: They're just 29% today.\nLou Whiteman: Yeah. But I do think that we are getting overly caught up in that one product. Yes, they need to build out the rest of a pipeline and actually do more but I think they haven't. This isn't again, it's not an enthusiastic let's go, but I'd rather walk toward this than away from it.\nTravis Hoium: I'm also very lukewarm. Let's go. Again, seeing the revenue and the earnings growth right now, that's right now. This is a company that's basically in a two company monopoly right now. There's a lot of companies fighting for this space. While there has been good news for Eli Lilly and for Novo Nordisk in that some of the other treatments have basically fumbled on their way to the end of the Phase 3 finish line of clinical trials. I do think that Eli Lilly is still attractively priced here. Again, when you are successful and you're making a lot of money you will find ways to buy, you will acquire growth if you can't make it in house. Reddit is one of the hotter stocks in the market up 64% over the past month. I've completely missed this one. Revenue has jumped 78% when they were public. I didn't think they would be able to post those numbers and now net income is positive. Rick is Reddit stock. Oh, no, at this valuation, or let's go.\nRick Munarriz: I'm going to say, oh, no, for the stock but I'm a big fan of Reddit. I think the company itself is great. To me, it's impressive how when the company was going public just a couple of years ago, this was a matter of no, it's terrible, it's not going to be able to monetized. These communities of communities they're going to basically have a revolution and it happened early on with API and other stuff just other issues that were happening. But I think Reddit the stock itself, I think, has extended itself, overextended the reality of the situation and the fact that there will be monetization challenges once we get to that point which will probably happen sooner or later so I'm going, oh, no.\nLou Whiteman: Yeah, I'm, too. I love the platform, but oh, no, we've just seen it with so many of these, whether it's Twitter, Pinterest, the monetization is hard. They might have some levers to pull but I want to see it to believe it.\nTravis Hoium: I didn't have you two as Reddit heads, but I guess here we are. Their content continues to end up everywhere in artificial intelligence so it seems like that will be a tailwind as these AI companies try to figure out how to get up to date information. Apparently Reddit is the best place to get it right now. Let's move over to the company from Rick's neck of the woods and what I have sitting next to me is a can of Celsius. Stock is up 25% in the past month, year over year revenue growth is 84%. That does include the Alan new acquisition. Net income is up 28%. Rick, have things turned around and is this a let's go?\nRick Munarriz: Yes. I'm going to go with let's go. The stock has more than doubled this year, so it's one of the many surprises stocks that have more than doubled. Again, it's not organic growth, but the Celsius brand after three quarters of negative growth, did grow 3%. Obviously, 84% was all basically the Alani Lou lifting but I think they found themselves a great brand. More importantly, was that their profitability came in a lot stronger than expected. This is a company that was able to integrate with Alani Lu in April and just some three months was able to make it very profitable and help on the bottom line. I think as far as the stock has gone I do think that there's some potential upside at least the next three quarters here.\nLou Whiteman: Never, ever underestimate America's desire for carbonated tang. This is let's go. I personally, I can't stand the stuff people just drink water, but I do think that Rick's right. I'm a very lukewarm, let's go. I think they have their momentum back.\nTravis Hoium: It's one of those. I feel at least a little bit better about myself drinking a Celsius than a mountain dew. I don't know if I really should, but I guess I'm the average American. Let's end things with the company that I think Rick and I are licking our wounds on. Crocs is down 16% over the past month. Revenue was up a little bit. Guidance was really weak. Is this an oh no moment for Crocs or such a good value that it's let's go?\nRick Munarriz: I'm going to say, let's go. I get it. This is not the same. There are holes in the shoes, there's holes in the stocks, there's holes in the company. The hey dude thing should have been a hey don't acquisition, but add it all up together. Crocs is the company that when it does take a hit history tells you, get back in. This is not a flash in the pan, a trendy, one trick pony. They find ways to become relevant here and abroad, it's an international play, too. I'm bullish on Crocs and when the stock sells off I think it's usually a good opportunity. History tells us to slide in some comfortable shoes.\nLou Whiteman: I was skeptical about this one. I get it, though, guys. I might be a tentative let's go, or I find it intriguing just as value over value trap. I still don't like buying into investor or consumer trends and that still scares me. But they have reached a point where I don't think they're going out of business so maybe I need to try a pair on, Rick.\nTravis Hoium: I was at Vikings training camp yesterday and there was a bunch of kids running around with no shoes on and I was trying to figure out what was going on and they were trying to play football in crocs and decided that it was better to just take their shoes off. Apparently, the kids are still wearing crocs. Next up, we're going to talk a little bit about ChatGPT's latest update and get to the stocks on our radar. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.

Rick, is this something or nothing for either ChatGPT or the rest of the tech space right now?\nRick Munarriz: To me, this seems to be that rare case where the pick and shovel plays are more impressive than the blueprints. An upgrade that makes GPT stronger, deeper and less buggy, great. But this doesn't necessarily a race that I'm going to be racing to buy Microsoft with this 49% stake in Open AI. This is still a race with a very blurry finish line. To me, the safer catch all plays continue to be NVIDIA's AMD's and even Ono, even CoreWeave of the world than the actual companies behind the platforms.\nTravis Hoium: CoreWeave has taken a hit. Are you worried about their depreciation schedule? This is something we don't talk a lot about on the podcast, but how long you're expensing those GPUs which may just burn up in a couple of years seems to be really important to investors right now.\nRick Munarriz: It's accounting and also it may be it's a commodity game at the end of the thing. But again, I still think that these are the plays that are going to do better right now until we decide the platform that comes out on top.\nLou Whiteman: CoreWeave scares me for just what you said. The one thing on ChatGPT I'd say is, is that the chatbots are getting all the attention because that's what people are interacting with. Some of this, wow, I don't think the chatbot was as good. But we're talking about the consumer. It's the enterprise is what matters. Even if it isn't as warm and cozy or whatever with the chatbot this time around, if the programmers think it's better that's probably good news for the company.\nTravis Hoium: It is going to be interesting to see how this all plays out. The company that keeps coming up in this is Alphabet. They are the other big competitor with Gemini. The interesting news to me this week was that Oracle, who is OpenAI's partner on these massive Stargate data centers announced that Gemini is going to be on Oracle's Cloud. Meanwhile, some of ChaGPT anyways is running now on Google's Cloud. It seems like even though they are the biggest competitor in the company that everyone thinks is going to be disrupted by Open AI they seem to find their way into these markets. Is that a reason to say, maybe the easy answer is just like Rick said, some of these bigger companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, NVIDIA what do you think, Lou?\nLou Whiteman: I do think there's a risk that even if AI goes as planned there's some commoditization effect. I do think that that's at least something investors need to watch and NVIDIA should like Rick said, NVIDIA should work out fine, even if that happens, right?\nTravis Hoium: We like to end the show with stocks on our radar, along with some comments and questions from our producer Dan Boyd behind the glass. Lou, you are up first. What is on your radar right now?\nLou Whiteman: I'm looking at QXO. Dan, I know, sponsored by Sesame Street. But no. QXO is a building products roll up, it's in its early stages. Just one deal so far. But the person behind the roll up, Brad Jacobs, he's done this before. His last two companies, they are two of the top 10 best performing Fortune 500 stocks of the last decade so there's a great track record here. QXO reported earnings and revenue. Both topped expectations this week. They say they are on track to double EBITA at Beacon Roofing Supply, their first acquisition. I'll be honest, the stock looks fairly valued right now, but QX's goal is to use M&A to be five times as large within a decade. A lot of risks there, a lot of deal making, but an intriguing track record. I'm very interested in how this plays out.\nTravis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about QXO?\nDan Boyd: I think that it's great that the spirit of Ron Gross is still here at Motley Fool Money. We've got old economy Lou coming at us once again, Lou, here's a question for you. Brad Jacobs, he's successful, sure, but can he please start an interesting company?\nLou Whiteman: You know what? The funny thing is, some of the best investments are outside of the interesting space and thanks for the compliment, Ron Gross, may you long live on the shelf.\nTravis Hoium: Rick, what is on your radar?\nRick Munarriz: I'm going with BBB Foods, ticker symbol TBBB. It's a fast growing deep discount grocer in Mexico. You're thinking, grocery stores in Mexico, it's gone from zero stores 20 years ago to more than 3,000 right now. Posted great results this week. Revenue was up 38%, largely on expansion and added more than 500 stores. But comps were up nearly 18%. You don't see double digit comps very often, especially when it's stacked on top of double digit comps from a year ago. This is a company that's a low cost product, razor thin margins but it's able to make it work, operating profits great, just an overall solid growth stock that's really not really outside of most radars, really is outside of most radars to investors right now.\nTravis Hoium: Dan, how do you feel about investing in grocery stores in Mexico?\nDan Boyd: Grocery stores in Mexico is a little bit daunting I'm not going to lie. Grocery stores, of course, have razor thin margins and are just I don't know, maybe not my favorite investment. But as they say in Mexico. Rick, my question to you is Mexican food, what's your go to?\nRick Munarriz: I'm a good fan of chimichangas, if you have to get down to actual Mexican food. But, yeah, no pain, no gain, no risk, as you mentioned before.\nTravis Hoium: Dan, what is going to be added to your watch list QXO or TBBB?\nDan Boyd: As much as I like to make fun of boring companies, I do like boring companies, Travis, but I'm quite interested in TBBB. I think I'm going to go south of the border with Rick Munarriz today and put TBBB on my radar.\nTravis Hoium: Rick, have you shopped at a BBB store?\nRick Munarriz: No, they are only in Mexico. I have not been in Mexico in about 10, 12 years. Like I said, no, I have not shopped in, but it's a deep discounter, I get it.\nLou Whiteman: Dan, the 12-year-old boy inside of you is really upset that you think getting a new roof is boring but going to the grocery store is exciting.\nDan Boyd: Good boy, Lou.\nTravis Hoium: For Lou Whiteman, Rick Munarriz and our production magician behind the glass, Dan Boyd and the entire Motley Fool team, I'm Travis Hoium. Thanks for listening to Motley Fool Money. We'll see you here tomorrow.\nDan Boyd has positions in Berkshire Hathaway and Walt Disney. Lou Whiteman has positions in Berkshire Hathaway and Qxo.

", "published_at": "2025-08-24T04:15:00+00:00", "source_id": "gdelt_finance_yahoo_com", "source_name": "finance.yahoo.com via GDELT", "crawl_method": "gdelt", "language": "en", "paywall": false, "text": "Ethereum (ETHUSD) is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies available, and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) has been the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) for the entire year 2024 and so far in 2025. In fact, Palantir’s dramatic rise has pushed its market capitalization into the top 25 of all publicly traded companies, currently at $370 billion.\nHowever, a recent surge in Ethereum, coupled with a few days of underwater trading for Palantir, has the market on edge. Ethereum’s price is up 13% in the last month, pushing its market cap over $500 billion, and once again making Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin a billionaire.\nNow, as we look toward the future, which of these heavyweight investments is the better buy: cryptocurrency stalwart Ethereum or data analysis powerhouse Palantir? Let’s look at both in this head-to-head matchup.\nEthereum’s Big August\nEthereum got a lot of attention this month when it had a rally of nearly 20% in a single week. It’s the second-largest cryptocurrency on the planet, behind Bitcoin (BTC), but there’s a lot of people who prefer Ethereum over the OG of crypto. Unlike Bitcoin, which is purely a store of value, Ethereum functions like a layer of infrastructure for blockchain itself. Its network allows decentralized applications and platforms to function on the emerging Web3 ecosystem. Developers and institutions use Ethereum to build products and services on the blockchain.\nWhile investors could trade Ethereum on some exchanges, the first Ethereum exchange-traded funds didn’t launch until last year. Ethereum got yet another boost on Aug. 7 when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could allow alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum to be included in 401(k) retirement accounts.\nInstitutional adoption of Ethereum could potentially bring millions of new investors that could push the coin even higher.\nPalantir’s Dynamic Potential\nUntil recent days, Palantir could seemingly do no wrong. The data mining company’s stock has been on a roll since it released its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which incorporates generative AI into Palantir’s extraordinarily powerful products.\nPalantir provides real-time analytics and insights to its customers. By tapping into hundreds of data sources, including satellites, Palantir quickly established itself as a valuable military contractor after its founding in 2003. It has even been credited with helping to lead U.S. sources to the final hiding place of September 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden. The company's Gotham platform provides intelligence agencies and the military with real-time analysis and data, so commanders could make rapid but informed decisions.\nIts Foundry platform, meanwhile, is used more often by commercial clients. Foundry uses AIP and Palantir’s powerful analytics platform to help businesses do things such as manage supply chains, modernize operations, simulate scenarios and monitors workflow to help managers run companies more effectively.\nEarnings in the second quarter were strong. Palantir reported $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, with its sales jumping 48% from a year ago. U.S. commercial revenue was up 93% to $306 million, and U.S. government revenue was up 53% to $426 million.\nEthereum Versus Palantir\nWhile Ethereum has the advantage in terms of market capitalization, it would be a mistake to assume that the asset with the higher market cap would be the best investment. Ethereum has the advantage today – on that one metric – but how long will that last?\nCurrently, Ethereum is priced at roughly $4,300, which is only about 13% below its all-time high. But this cryptocurrency is wildly volatile; the price has been as low as $1,386 in the last 12 months. Ethereum had one of these run-ups before, in October 2021, but lost 81% of its value by June 22, falling to less than $900 briefly.\nPalantir has its own questions. The company has been wildly successful in the last two years, but there are critics who say that the company’s valuation is out of hand. And they could be right. Palantir’s price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is a woeful 709, meaning that investors are paying $709 for a single dollar of PLTR earnings. That’s a lot for a company that didn’t start turning a profit until 2023, and that dumps a massive amount of its revenue back into the company for research and development. Even in Palantir’s wildly successful second quarter, the company recorded earnings of only 16 cents per share. Its forward P/E ratio of 400 shows that profits are already baked into what the market thinks Palantir will do in 2026 (analysts surveyed by Barchart are expecting 450% earnings growth this year, but only 31.8% in 2026).\nChoosing a Winner\nBoth of these opportunities could rightly give an investor pause. Ethereum’s role in Web3 and makes it compelling for risk-tolerant investors, but its volatility and lack of earnings make it speculative compared to Palantir’s predictable growth. Palantir, meanwhile, is revolutionizing commercial enterprises and governments with its AIP platform and massive data mining capabilities.\nPalantir is bringing in new business hand over fist. It signed 157 deals in the second quarter valued at least $1 million, with 42 of them valued at least $10 million. In addition, Palantir’s government work is continuing to grow as the Trump administration gives the go-ahead for Palantir to work with the State Department, Homeland Security, Health & Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, and more.\nPalantir is taking a dip now on sentiment – that’s going to happen to every company. But in the long term, Palantir is the better investment, regardless of what happens with Ethereum’s market cap.\nOn the date of publication, Patrick Sanders had a position in: PLTR.

After getting past its previous food health scares, the fast casual Mexican chain has steadily grown its unit count and per store sales, driving earnings higher and higher. Investors believed there was a huge runway for unit growth, both in the United States and internationally, and gave Chipotle stock a premium valuation because of it.\nChinks may finally be showing up in Chipotle's armor. Last quarter, the company reported a sharp drop in its per-restaurant sales, which inspired investors to panic sell out of the stock. Chipotle is now down 28% year-to-date (YTD), severely underperforming the market indices in 2025. Let's dive into the current problems with Chipotle and decide whether this is a short-term blip and buying opportunity or a long-term concern for investors.\nSlowing store traffic\nChipotle reported its latest quarterly earnings in July. Revenue grew 3% in the period to $3.1 billion, driven by more restaurant location openings. However, this was not the metric investors were focused on. What alarmed Wall Street was a 4% decline in same-store sales -- measuring year-over-year revenue growth from existing restaurants -- driven by customer traffic falling off a cliff. The company has even been implementing price increases, meaning that traffic declined even more than the 4% year-over-year comparable store sales decrease.\nComparable store sales growth is vital for a restaurant chain. If it cannot match or outpace inflation that is currently running at 3%-5% across various cost inputs, then it is going to see declining profit margins. That is exactly what happened to Chipotle in the quarter. Its restaurant-level operating margin was 27.4%, down from 28.9% a year ago.\nWhat is driving these traffic declines? It is hard to pinpoint an exact reason, which is providing even more uncertainty for shareholders. Some may point to increased unemployment for young professionals, who have a higher share of spending at fast casual chains like Chipotle compared to older generations. It also could be broad-based trading down to cheaper options for consumers, which has helped other chains such as Domino's Pizza and McDonald's.\nRegardless, a 4% same-store sales decline is wrecking Chipotle's profits. If traffic problems do not get fixed, the company's profits will keep sliding lower and lower.", "content_hash": "e85f98cc2b0fdcb5c3ce716a67f3d227", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

You’re likely diversifying your investments and keeping an eye on your life insurance policies. But have you factored in healthcare expenses?\nFor You: The Retirement Account That Could Cut Your Taxes — Forever, According to a CFP\nLearn More: 3 Advanced Investing Moves Experts Use to Minimize Taxes and Help Boost Returns\nIf your answer is no, then Suze Orman thinks you’ve made a massive mistake. The author and financial expert believes that no retirement plan is complete without addressing the significant burden of healthcare costs. As Americans live longer, they’re more likely to need medical services, potentially including in-home care or long-term care.\nOrman wants you to start thinking about healthcare costs whenever you think about retirement planning — because if you don’t, the consequences could be dire.\nNot Factoring in Healthcare Means Not Understanding Your Financial Risks\nOrman has compared retirement planning to a juggling act, where you’re balancing multiple risks at the same time. Many of the balls in the air relate to your health and longevity. Ask yourself: How long do you think you’ll live? Will you need in-home care or even a long-term care facility? Could a market downturn early in your retirement put pressure on your finances just as your healthcare costs increase?\nAccording to Fidelity Investments, the average 65-year-old couple can expect to spend at least $12,800 on healthcare within their first year of retirement. That’s a significant amount of money — one that could derail your retirement if you’re unprepared.\nMany people view market fluctuations as their biggest financial risk during retirement years. Instead, Orman wants them to consider their longevity and healthcare expenses as the greatest threat, even before the market itself.\n“If you enter your 60s in good health, your retirement plan needs to be based on the assumption you will live at least until 90. Honestly, 95 is better. That’s because there is a not-small probability you will in fact live that long,” she wrote. “And the last thing you want for yourself — and for loved ones who may someday step in and care for you — is to run out of money.”\nRead Next: Suze Orman: 4 Tips To Protect Your Finances in Retirement\nMedicare Is Not a Perfect Solution\nA big part of Orman’s concern is that many soon-to-be retirees assume Medicare will fully cover their healthcare costs. However, Medicare is far from a catch-all approach to healthcare. It comes with significant gaps and out-of-pocket expenses. While enrollees can choose Medicare Advantage plans or Part D coverage, these options don’t cover everything, often prompting people to purchase supplemental insurance, known as Medigap.", "content_hash": "3a463f14390d8706c52fab9a8f0d4762", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The true picture of what just happened is anything but reassuring for retirees.\nIf you are retired, you probably need to live off the income from your investments, particularly bonds and certificates of deposit. So what you want are higher interest rates, low inflation and a strong, independent Federal Reserve that can keep inflation low in the future.\nBy far the worst news was about the Fed. Chairman Jerome Powell, in his highly anticipated annual speech in Wyoming, did nothing to defend the central bank, nor his fellow governor Lisa Cook, who is currently under sustained personal attacks from the president and his underlings. Nor did he defend former governor Adriana Kugler, who suddenly “retired early” from the Fed a few weeks ago after comparable political pressure. Nor did he defend federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose commissioner was fired by the president a few weeks ago — are you spotting a pattern here? — for producing numbers he didn’t like.\nNot only did Powell not defend the Fed, but he appeared to mollify the president and his allies by opening the door to a possible interest-rate cut next month. This is what sent the stock market booming Friday. But Powell’s comments were gratuitous — there was no economic reason to make them. The market was already anticipating rate cuts; the only reason to make them was political: to appease the White House and its allies.\nIt’s almost impossible to overstate how important the independence of the Federal Reserve is to retirees, and everyone else for that matter. It is the cornerstone of price stability. It was a political Fed that let inflation run amok in the 1960s and 1970s and an independent Fed, under legendary Chairman Paul Volcker, who crushed that inflation in the 1980s. For example, if you were to buy a long-term bond paying 4% a year and inflation averages 2% a year, you are ahead of the game. If inflation averages 3%, you are in trouble, and if it averages 4% or higher … well, do the math.\nDonald Trump has already claimed that real inflation is effectively 0%, even though the official rate is 2.7%. And he has demanded that the Fed slash short-term interest rates by at least three percentage points, from the current 4.25% to 4.5% to around 1% or even lower. One can only imagine what the situation would look like — or will look like — if he gets his way.\nBut this isn’t the only worrying news for retirees.\nEven while Powell was hinting at interest-rate cuts, he also explained how inflation is rising and how Trump’s arbitrary import taxes, known as tariffs, are causing it.\nThis isn’t me saying this — it’s Jerome Powell himself.\n“Turning to inflation, higher tariffs have begun to push up prices in some categories of goods,” he said. “Estimates based on the latest available data,” he noted, indicate that prices rose 2.6% in the 12 months through July, while the so-called core inflation rate, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose 2.9% — well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Goods prices, which were falling in 2024, are now rising, he added.\n“The effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible,” Powell said. “We expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts.”\nAnd those higher prices “could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic,” he added. This is the feared inflation spiral last seen in the 1970s — when higher prices drove workers to demand higher wages, which in turn led to even higher prices.\nIn these circumstances, rational savers should logically demand more, not less, interest on their money to compensate for lending. Instead, interest rates actually fell Friday, amid growing Wall Street euphoria about the prospects of an imminent rate cut by the Fed next month. The yield, or interest rate, on 5-year U.S. Treasurys BX:TMUBMUSD05Y fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.76%. The 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell 7 basis points — or 0.07 of a percentage point — to 4.26%. Interest rates on corporate bonds eased as well. Bond prices rose, because bonds are like seesaws: When the yield falls, the price rises.\nIf this move keeps going, you might want to grab those nine-month, one-year and two-year certificates of deposit sooner rather than later.\nLower interest rates are certainly not bad news for everyone. On the contrary, they’re good news for many, such as investors and borrowers. But they’re bad news for those who live on income from bonds and savings.\nRight now, Wall Street thinks the Fed will cut short-term rates by a quarter of a percentage point, or 25 basis points, next month. It sees another quarter-point cut before the end of the year and another half-point cut in the first half of next year. That would take short-term rates down from today’s levels to 3.25% to 3.5% by July.\nIt’s too early to see if Wall Street’s initial reaction to Powell’s comments on rates will be sustained. It’s been wrong before.\nMeanwhile, retirees are being offered higher inflation risk and lower inflation compensation on their investments. Not a winning combination.\nBut look on the bright side: If they rig the inflation figures going forward to hide rising prices, your annual Social Security cost-of-living increase will get wiped out as well.", "content_hash": "f27708e74d847326b4f9f4e777f024b6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Prices tend to start low on Monday and increase as the week goes on. Crypto can be traded 24/7 but more people tend to buy and sell during working hours. The market slows down at night and on the weekends. So, a Monday after a slow weekend can be the best time to buy.\nNote that this analysis refers to buying cryptocurrency, not trading it. When you trade, you are buying and selling at the same time. According to SGT, you want to trade crypto when trading volume is high. When trading is active, you have more volatility and higher liquidity, which can be an advantage when you’re buying and selling at the same time.\nLearn More: 13 Cheap Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Potential Upside for You\nTrading Days and Times\nSGT recommends timing your trades to coincide with the opening hours of the major global financial hubs. The opening of Asian markets happens between 12:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). European markets are in session from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. UTC, and the U.S. market is open from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. UTC. (Note that UTC is five hours earlier than U.S. Eastern time, so the U.S. market is open from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET.)\nIf you are trading Asian or European currencies, you may want to make your trades during the time those markets are open. If you’re trading currencies of different geographic areas, look for the period when the markets overlap to find the highest volume hours.\nSGT also recommends trading mid-week. The consensus seems to be that traders are ramping up on Mondays and winding down on Fridays, making Tuesdays through Thursdays the days that see the most trading activity.\nOther Factors That Can Influence Trading Times\nThe day of the week and time of the day that you trade may matter, but there are other factors that can influence the best times to trade as well. Here are some of these factors, according to SGT.\nMarket Sentiment\nWhen there is favorable or unfavorable news in the crypto market, prices can rise or fall considerably. If a social media influencer posts about their recent purchase of cryptocurrency, for example, the currency may see a spike in interest from those who are not yet in the market. Conversely, a negative mention can cause traders to unload a particular currency.", "content_hash": "f21e90556aa9435a3eae707ceeb56a3a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

This Palantir Rival Could Be the Biggest Winner -- at Just One-Third the Price\nIt's no secret that investors have gone bananas for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past few years. What's a little peculiar, though, is how concentrated the AI trade has become -- dominated by the \"Magnificent Seven\" and a handful of high-profile outliers, one of the most widely discussed being data mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR).\nPalantir isn't alone. One of its closest rivals in enterprise software is Databricks, a data warehouse platform that just found its name in the headlines. Earlier this week, Databricks announced a fresh funding round that valued the company at over $100 billion. For context, Palantir's market cap sits around $340 billion -- making it more than 3 times the size of Databricks.\nSo, what's Databricks planning to do with its war chest of new capital? According to management, the company will be using the funding to \"accelerate its AI strategy\" -- spearheaded by the launch of Agent Bricks, a new product aimed at the emerging opportunity of agentic AI. This could prove to be a masterstroke, as Nvidia's Jensen Huang believes AI agents could swell into a multitrillion-dollar market, making this a strategically timed play by Databricks.\nThe bigger question that looms is whether or not Databricks is closing the gap with Palantir. Let's dig into how Databricks is positioning itself to challenge larger rivals in the software-as-a-service (SaaS) arena, and whether its valuation disparity with Palantir is justified.\nWhat is Databricks?\nLarge enterprises typically rely on a patchwork of specialized tools to run their operation. Sales and marketing live in customer relationship management (CRM) platforms like Salesforce. Financial ledgers are often managed in Intuit, while human resources data resides in systems such as Workday.\nWhile each tool serves a purpose, a major pain point persists: The data is fragmented and siloed. In tech jargon, this is known as \"unstructured data.\"\nThis is precisely where Databricks steps in. The company's flagship Lakehouse platform unifies these disparate data points into a single, governed source. Once this information is consolidated and structured, organizations can extract insights far more efficiently, accurately, and at scale -- turning raw data into actionable intelligence.\nThe value proposition is already resonating. More than 15,000 businesses use Databricks in some capacity -- including over 60% of the Fortune 500.\nWhat is agentic AI?\nTraditional large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude are designed to generate responses based on human input. Put simply, as powerful as they've become, they are still reactive tools -- waiting for a prompt before producing an output.\nAgentic AI represents a transformational leap beyond reactive models. Instead of passively responding to queries, AI agents can take autonomous, proactive steps to analyze a problem, formulate an execution plan, and carry it out with minimal oversight.\nConsider a retail example. An AI agent could identify pricing discrepancies with competitors or uncover deeper consumer shopping patterns, then simulate scenarios to recommend a targeted sales campaign. It can even model how consumers might react and automatically send a polished proposal to a decision maker -- all without the micromanagement of a supervisor.\nIn essence, AI agents are not generic chatbots. Instead, they function more like digital operators -- capable of spotting opportunities, streamlining workflows, and executing on complex tasks. For large corporations, the efficiency gains from these tools could be game-changing.\nIs Databricks closing the gap with Palantir?\nAs a private company, Databricks is not obligated to disclose detailed financials or key performance indicators. However, once a start-up begins to reach the scale of its public peers, revenue estimates often surface.\nAccording to reports, Databricks is generating an annual recurring revenue (ARR) run rate of roughly $3.7 billion. For comparison, the midpoint of Palantir's 2025 financial guidance is $4.1 billion in annual sales.\nWhile ARR run rate and forward sales guidance are not perfectly equivalent metrics, they can be used directionally to illustrate scale. On this basis, Databricks and Palantir appear to be operating in a similar revenue ballpark.\nSo, what's fueling the valuation gap between Palantir and Databricks?\nPalantir's premium stems from consistent profitability and its established platforms -- Gotham and Foundry -- serving as AI backbones for large businesses and government agencies alike.\nDatabricks aims to close the valuation gap by evolving into a comprehensive, end-to-end operating system unifying enterprise data architectures. Its aggressive push into agentic AI could make it a major winner as AI investment migrates downstream -- shifting from infrastructure to software applications.\nFor now, gaining exposure to Databricks is limited to accredited investors or through secondary offerings. However, its strategic advancements in agentic AI positions Databricks as a compelling business to monitor for a potential initial public offering (IPO) down the road -- possibly at a steep discount to Palantir.\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

OpenAI’s board formally rejected Musk’s bid in February.\nMusk worked with Sam Altman to found OpenAI a decade ago before going on to launch a rival startup, xAI. He has been locked in a legal skirmish with OpenAI, repeatedly trying to derail the startup’s plans to restructure as a more conventional for-profit business. The billionaire filed two lawsuits against OpenAI for allegedly straying from its founding principles and asked a court to block the company’s restructuring efforts.\nEvidence that Musk was quietly trying to persuade one of OpenAI’s chief rivals to help him acquire the startup could undercut the billionaire’s legal claims that Altman’s partnership with Microsoft Corp. betrayed the OpenAI’s charity mission. The judge overseeing the legal battle previously has written that “efforts by Musk to incorporate OpenAI into Tesla or to convert it into a for-profit company are relevant because they may be inconsistent” with his claims against Altman and OpenAI.\nOpenAI asked in the filing Thursday for the judge to order Meta to turn over documentation related to any communication the tech company had with Musk.\nIn a letter Friday, Musk’s lawyer argued to the judge that OpenAI should be barred from getting information from Meta about the February bid. It should also be barred from gathering other material from third parties related to its claim that Musk is waging a harassment campaign to damage Altman’s startup and boost xAI, the lawyer said.\nMusk’s attorney also said OpenAI has already signaled that it wants to question three other parties who signed the February letter of intent to purchase the startup.\nAt the time, Musk enlisted a group of wealthy allies for a cash bid to buy the nonprofit’s assets.

The clinical-stage biotech's share price inflated by over 6% that trading session thanks to regulatory news it delivered in the morning. Even the surging S&P 500 index couldn't come close to that kind of increase, with its 1.5% gain on the day.\nRegulatory progress\nBiohaven revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it has been updated on the progress of its New Drug Application (NDA) for troriluzole. The company said that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed it that an advisory committee meeting to discuss the submission at the regulator was no longer necessary.\nTroriluzole is a drug that targets spinocerebellar ataxia, a cluster of inherited and progressive neurological disorders that affect the body's movement. The development and regulatory application process for the drug has been halting, with the FDA initially refusing to accept the company's filing.

Investors are best advised to wait until the actual decision is rendered to make a decision on whether or not to buy this stock.\nGood chance for success, apparently\nHaving said that, according to research from RBC Capital Markets analyst Leonid Timashev cited by Investor's Business Daily, around two-thirds of applications where an advisory committee meeting is cancelled ultimately won approval (from 2019 until the present).

Those levels could serve as important clues for investors, Ciana said in a note, who have seen stocks trade in a tight range since the explosive rally following the market's trough in early April.\nSpeaking to CNBC on Thursday, Ciana added that he had two concerns about the market from a technical perspective:\n-\nSeasonal weakness. The last days of summer tend to be a historically weak time for stocks.\n-\nMomentum indicators. The market's steep rally in recent weeks could be a sign stocks are about to turn in the other direction.\n\"So, the rally into almost 6,500 — slowdown, according to momentum and trending indicators,\" Ciana added, referring to the benchmark index recently notching a fresh record as traders shrugged off concerns about tariffs.\nHere are the two levels on Ciana's radar:\nIf the S&P 500 drops below 6,200\n6,201 is a technical resistance level for the S&P 500, Ciana said. The benchmark index has traded above the 6,200 level since early July.\n\"In round numbers, we're in a range from 6,200-6,500. I think if we break through 6,200, which was a key low about six weeks ago or so, then we could be a deeper decline and a worse scenario,\" he said.\nThe S&P 500 falling to that level would imply a 2% drop from the index's closing price on Tuesday.\nBank of America said it didn't see a \"stop pattern,\" or a bearish technical signal in the benchmark index yet. In the note, Ciana reiterated his price target of the S&P 500 reaching a record 6,625 later in the year.\nIf the Dow breaks past 45,000\n45,000, meanwhile, is the resistance level the Dow has traded under recently. The index briefly edged above that level for the first time on July 22 before dropping in the following days.\nThe market rally needs more breadth to continue, Ciana told CNBC, adding that it was \"really disappointing\" the index has remained below the 45,000 level in recent weeks.\n\"A weekly close above 45,000-45,200 would be paramount in signaling the epic recovery from the April lows can continue with rotation into the large cap INDU components,\" Ciana wrote in the note referring to the Dow's ticker. \"Without this, headwinds for the rally may persist as intraweek rallies by the INDU continue to roundtrip the psychosocial resistance at 45,000.\"", "content_hash": "2e4059eeb82d03a56e1a6e9a4d61dadb", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

For the markets, it doesn't get much bigger than this.\nInvestors will have their antennae up, scanning for signs and signals that a long-awaited interest rate cut is coming in September. At this point, that expectation is pretty much baked into the markets. Anything less would be a shock.\nBut while expected, it isn't the only possible outcome — and we want you to be as prepared as possible.\nOne of BI's executive editors, Joe Ciolli, has outlined three scenarios for Powell's address — as well as how markets are likely to react in each instance. Here's a quick snapshot:\nThe dreaded scenario: Powell strikes a more hawkish tone than expected. That could be grim for the markets. Stocks have climbed a mountain toward record highs and Powell could send them tumbling down.\nThe best-case scenario: Powell signals a rate path that's more dovish than expected. Deeper, faster cuts are the stuff investors' dreams are made of. It would be jet fuel for the future earnings growth of major companies, Joe writes. However, there could be one caveat for mega-cap tech names.\nThe boring scenario: A rate cut in September and then another one by year-end. Yawn. It's exactly what everyone's expecting. In theory, the market should barely flinch. But as Joe pointed out, there's one twist that could rattle stocks: Investors might just \"sell the news.\"\nAnalysts at Bank of America, meanwhile, are expecting big swings in one particular area of the stock market after Powell speaks: small-cap companies.\nBrace yourself, the market moves may soon be in motion.\n3 things in markets\n1.

The clinical-stage biotech's share price inflated by over 6% that trading session thanks to regulatory news it delivered in the morning. Even the surging S&P 500 index couldn't come close to that kind of increase, with its 1.5% gain on the day.\nRegulatory progress\nBiohaven revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it has been updated on the progress of its New Drug Application (NDA) for troriluzole. The company said that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informed it that an advisory committee meeting to discuss the submission at the regulator was no longer necessary.\nTroriluzole is a drug that targets spinocerebellar ataxia, a cluster of inherited and progressive neurological disorders that affect the body's movement. The development and regulatory application process for the drug has been halting, with the FDA initially refusing to accept the company's filing. Biohaven ran a new late-stage clinical trial and is using its data for the current NDA.\nAlthough the cancellation of the advisory meeting implies the regulator has, in effect, already reached a decision, it might not necessarily be one favorable to the company. Investors are best advised to wait until the actual decision is rendered to make a decision on whether or not to buy this stock.\nGood chance for success, apparently\nHaving said that, according to research from RBC Capital Markets analyst Leonid Timashev cited by Investor's Business Daily, around two-thirds of applications where an advisory committee meeting is cancelled ultimately won approval (from 2019 until the present).

I need some advice and I hope you can provide a little enlightenment.\nShort backstory: My second husband had a gambling addiction and unbeknownst to me, cleaned out our savings and joint investment account over the course of six years for a total of almost $900,000. He managed these accounts and assured me we were in the $1 million territory. However, he never showed me documents to prove it and I didn’t ask because I loved and trusted him utterly; he also handled filing taxes.\nI never saw the losses on our tax returns, until a forensic accountant brought it all to light during the divorce. I learned a hard lesson — a very, very hard lesson — about abdicating my financial responsibility. I’m 65 and have been making six figures in a new job for the past four years. I have about $80,000 in my 401(k) and $10,000 in savings. I had an inheritance that I paid off all my debt with. I’m a renter and do not own real estate since my divorce.\nI am a dual citizen of the U.S. and U.K. and I’m about to relocate to the U.K. for a new position within the global company I work for. I hope to work for five more years and then retire. Unfortunately, I will no longer be able to contribute to Social Security, but will be contributing to the U.K. pension system, which won’t do me any good as one has to work 10 years to draw that benefit. But the cost of living will be cheaper there.\nI’ll be staying with family members for a few months after my move. I hope to find something affordable that I’m able to put 50% of my £80,000 income as well as my 20% bonuses into the company pension plan for the next five years (they do an 11% contribution). Now it’s all about saving every penny, dollar and dime. (Don’t worry about him, he already remarried a much older woman who’s affluent and who’s also wise enough not to put his name on any of her assets.)\nRegarding my Social Security, I was planning to contribute to it until age 70 so I could get the maximum amount. However, I’m a bit confused, I was under the impression I needed to continuously contribute all the way up until age 70 to get the maximum amount, but others have said that even if I stop contributing now with this move to the U.K., I will still get the same maximum dollar amount just by waiting until 70. Is that true?\nShould I pull my 401(k) out and use it as a down payment on a home in the U.K.? I have serious concerns about financial stability as I age and it is not in my plans to seek another marriage. I had hoped to buy a little piece of land and put a prefabricated HebHome on it and have it paid off by the time I retire so I at least have the security of my own home and not be subject to rising rents as I age. I will likely be living off Social Security, and whatever I manage to accumulate.\nAny financial wisdom you can impart is greatly appreciated.\nI salute you for the courage it has taken to get to this point.\nWhenever I face a difficult or unwelcome development, I tell myself: “Quentin, this is another human experience you get to have.” You’ve had to journey through one such unexpected detour in your life. Anyone who has experienced financial loss, either through bad investments or a third party’s misdeeds, will know the kind of stamina it will have taken to get you this far. Now you are on the precipice of your new life and the U.K. is a great place to start.\nFinancially, you probably come out ahead if you use that $80,000 to buy a home when you move to the U.K. If you bought a home for $300,000 (I’m sticking with dollars to keep it simple) using your $80,000, at a 6.7% interest rate, you would have a monthly payment of $1,420. You would have $195,000 left on the mortgage after 10 years and, with 3% annual increase in value, end up with a house worth $403,000. That’s $208,000 in equity.\nIf, on the other hand, you left that $80,000 in your 401(k) for the next 10 years, assuming a moderate 7% annual return (again, to keep it simple) you would probably/maybe have $157,372 in your 401(k). So you would come out ahead by $50,600, but you would still be renting. So the math/logic suggests you’re better off buying. The scales would tip in favor of you keeping your 401(k) invested if you had more money invested, but you would not have those 10 years living in your own home.\nThe good news: You will still reap the benefits of delayed retirement credits if you wait past your full retirement age (67) to collect Social Security. Each year you delay, your benefit increases by 8% until you reach age 70. Your Social Security benefits will be determined by your 35 highest earning years. You will be able to collect those benefits when you reach the appropriate FRA, or beyond, if you decide to wait.\nYour joint U.K./U.S. citizenship will serve you well after your reversal of fortune. You will require an income of around £44,000 a year for a comfortable retirement in the U.K. and £32,000 a year for a moderate retirement, all depending on where you live, according to Pensions UK, a nonprofit organization that aims to help people plan their retirement. In the U.S., you would need closer to $1.25 million, based on the latest estimates from Real World Investor, an investing website.\nThe U.S. has a tax treaty with the U.S., meaning that you don’t have to pay income tax twice on your income or investments while living in the U.K. as a dual U.K./U.S. citizen. If you are no longer employed by a U.S. company you, however, you are not typically permitted to contribute to a 401(k). In addition to the U.K., Germany and Canada, among others, have treaties that allow credit for U.S. taxes paid.\nThe truth is a happy and peaceful retirement will depend on whether you have enough money to cover your expenses, your lifestyle and quality of life. Even though some people require millions of dollars in retirement to take cruises and live large, the latter is not ruled by money. It’s ruled by your own tastes. Would you, for example, prefer a weekly card game with friends or would you rather be a member of an exclusive country club?\nYou have five years until retirement and many more to build a community.", "content_hash": "d9980d3a7e96596cd7112e7a1aa229f4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Why? That was the day OpenAI commercially released ChatGPT.\nSince then, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have climbed to new highs on multiple occasions. Businesses across nearly every major sector have poured billions of dollars into AI-powered chips, software, and services, while next-generation applications -- from self-driving cars to humanoid robots -- promise to transform daily life and unlock unprecedented efficiencies.\nThe AI ecosystem is like a boiling cauldron of innovation, brimming with too many ingredients to track at one time. Yet one constant has always managed to rise to the top of this mix: semiconductor behemoth Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\nLet's explore just how much a modest investment of $1,000 in Nvidia stock at the time of ChatGPT's launch would be worth today. More importantly, I'll discuss why the stock could still be worth holding despite its already historical performance.\nHow has Nvidia stock performed since ChatGPT's launch?\nWhen ChatGPT made its debut in late 2022, Nvidia's market cap hovered around $345 billion. Fast forward to today, and the company is valued at an astonishing $4.4 trillion -- making Nvidia the most valuable company in the world.\nTo put this into perspective, consider the chart above. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia stock at the time of ChatGPT's launch would now be worth roughly $10,700 -- nearly a 10x return in less than three years. On an annualized basis, this translates into an average return of 139% per year.\nAre returns of this magnitude typical?\nOver the last century, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the S&P 500 index -- inclusive of dividend reinvestment and adjusted for inflation -- has averaged about 6.9%.\nBy comparison, Nvidia's joyride over the last few years not only dwarfs the long-run performance of the S&P 500, but it also stands out as an anomaly of historic proportions.\nOf course, returns of this magnitude are anything but typical. Yet, there remain several compelling reasons to stay optimistic that Nvidia stock could continue climbing -- fueled by rising investment in AI infrastructure, continued robust demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), and expanding opportunities in new industries.\nKeep a long-term investing mindset\nFollowing ChatGPT's debut, a wave of competing large language models (LLMs) has entered the market -- including Gemini from Alphabet, Anthropic (closely integrated with Amazon), xAI's Grok, and Perplexity.\nMore LLMs inevitably means more competition and a greater demand for compute power. This surge translates directly into rising AI infrastructure spending from tech hyperscalers -- many of which rank among Nvidia's largest customers.\nBeyond the private sector, Nvidia also has enormous potential when it comes to sovereign investment in AI ecosystems. The company plays a central role in Project Stargate, a $500 billion initiative led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank, which aims to supercharge U.S.-based AI infrastructure and systems domestically over the coming years.\nInternationally, Nvidia is becoming equally indispensable. The company is deeply involved in data center buildouts across the Middle East and recently secured an agreement with the Trump Administration that allows it to continue conducting business in China -- a market that CEO Jensen Huang estimates to be worth $50 billion on its own.\nMeanwhile, emerging business opportunities in autonomous driving and robotics have yet to fully scale commercially. While neither industry is meaningfully moving the financial needle today, both represent massive long-term upside for Nvidia.\nIt's difficult to predict with any certainty whether Nvidia stock will 10x again from its current levels. What is clear, however, is that Nvidia remains firmly entrenched as a technological backbone for AI infrastructure. For that reason, I remain bullish on Nvidia's long-term growth prospects and see further gains ahead for the chip king.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The Chinese toy and home goods retailer notched convincing beats on both the top and bottom lines for the period, hence the excitement. By contrast, the S&P 500 index only managed a 1.5% gain.\nNot so mini these days\nIn its second quarter, Miniso saw its revenue surge by 23% to just under 4.97 billion yuan ($692 million), which topped even the most optimistic internal forecast. That was on the back of improvements in same-store gross merchandise value (SSSG) growth, an important metric for the company; all three of its operating segments saw growth over the previous quarter.\nNon-GAAP (adjusted) net income, meanwhile, saw a less impressive but still meaningful boost. It rose by almost 11% to nearly 692 million yuan ($96 million). That shook out to 2.24 yuan ($0.31) per ADS.\nOn average, analysts tracking Miniso were modeling only 4.86 billion yuan ($677 million) for revenue, and 1.75 yuan ($0.24) per ADS for adjusted bottom-line profitability.\nIn its earnings release, Miniso pointed to strength in its home market as a key source of growth. It quoted CEO Guofu Ye as saying that \"outperformance in Miniso mainland China in such a hyper-competitive domestic physical retail environment further underscores our strong execution and resilience of our business model.\"\nNew dividend declared\nMiniso isn't keeping all of that profit for itself.

A spate of big-box retail earnings came and went this week, as did minutes for the July FOMC meeting, with barely a rumble from investors.\nThey instead remained laser-focused on the prospect of an interest-rate cut in September — which has been priced in with near-certainty for weeks — and also on what Powell seems prepared to do through year-end.\nIt will come amid a confusing landscape. The labor market is in dire straits, but GDP has been fine. Inflation has been kept relatively in check, at least for consumers. Wholesale producers? Not so much.\nDetailed below are three possible outcomes for Powell's address on Friday, as well as what markets are likely to do in each instance.\nScenario 1: More hawkish than expected\nThe dreaded outcome: Powell signals a rate path that's more conservative than what people expect.\nAs it stands now, the likeliest outcome being priced in by investors is two rate cuts by year-end (47%). Bullish investors are banking on a lower cost of capital boosting future earnings growth, which has historically been the primary driver of stock gains.\nHow stocks could react:\nDespite some selling this past week — especially in AI and chip names — the market is still largely priced to perfection, and within shouting distance of record highs.\nThat leaves it vulnerable to any recalibration in rate-cut expectations. If investors see companies getting less access to capital they can then use to reinvest, make acquisitions, and generally boost bottom lines, they could trim positioning and send the market tumbling.\nScenario 2: More dovish than expected\nThe best-case scenario: Powell signals a rate path that's even more accommodative than what people expect.\nHow stocks could react:\nThis would mean further jet fuel for the future earnings growth of major companies, an unabashedly bullish prospect that would likely push stocks higher. Unfortunately, this is probably the lowest-likelihood outcome.\nOne additional caveat is that — while more rate cuts would be positive — there could be some rotation under the surface of the stock market. With the field for stronger earnings revisions leveled by easier access to capital, it's possible that the mega-cap tech names that have led market gains could fall out of favor.", "content_hash": "770aa242868603b04430c2fd69125d41", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The legislation holds banks, payment providers, and financial services firms accountable for fraud committed by employees, agents, contractors or other “associated persons” acting on their behalf.\nThis is a significant development that raises the bar for fraud prevention. Yet many financial institutions remain unprepared for the operational and cultural changes needed to meet the requirements of the new offence.\nExpanding liability for financial institutions\nThe new offence covers a range of fraud-related crimes such as false representation and abuse of position. Its extraterritorial scope means UK-based customers or operations can trigger liability even if misconduct occurs abroad.\nFor multinational banks and payment providers, this heightens the need for comprehensive, group-wide risk assessments and coordinated fraud controls. A failure in a subsidiary, whether in Hong Kong, Luxembourg, or elsewhere, can now lead to consequences at the UK parent level.\nAddressing the quiet threat of insider fraud\nInsider fraud continues to be one of the most challenging threats for financial institutions. It occurs when individuals with legitimate access – staff, vendors or contractors – exploit their position to misappropriate funds, manipulate records, or bypass controls.\nTraditional fraud detection tools often focus on external attacks, leaving blind spots for sophisticated insider threats. Real-time monitoring integrated into payment workflows is essential to detect suspicious behaviour early and intervene before losses occur.\nMeeting the reasonable prevention standard\nTo comply with the new offence, financial institutions must demonstrate they have taken reasonable steps to prevent fraud. The UK government outlines six core principles to guide this: risk assessment, proportional measures, top level commitment, thorough due diligence, clear communication, and ongoing monitoring.\nIn practice, this means:\n-\nDocumented, regular fraud risk assessments tailored to the institution’s specific exposure\n-\nTargeted staff training focused on roles with heightened fraud risk\n-\nRigorous third-party due diligence and contract terms addressing fraud prevention\n-\nStrong governance, control testing and audit trails to provide oversight and evidence of compliance\nThese measures are fundamental to both regulatory compliance and operational resilience.\nManaging third-party risk in financial services\nFinancial institutions rely heavily on third-party vendors for services ranging from cloud infrastructure to customer support and analytics. Under the new offence, inadequate oversight of these providers can expose firms to legal and regulatory consequences.", "content_hash": "ecb302a554ba0f3e3087c4c2c2222191", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That's why attacking a big debt early is a great move, but the longer you wait, the more time it has to compound.\nA 30-year-old man recently went on Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) for advice on tackling an $83,000 debt. He's only 30, so he has plenty of time, but it can get worse if he isn't financially disciplined. He's married, and the couple brings in $160,000 per year. They also have two young children.\n\"We don't have any savings or emergency fund,\" the husband said.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nWould You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early?

The remaining $54,000 is on their credit cards. The couple has a combined $70,000 in their retirement accounts and is holding off on further contributions as they get out of debt.\nSeveral Redditors jumped in the comments and shared their suggestions.\nFocus On What You Can Do Now\nThe top comment came from a Redditor who encouraged the original poster to stop thinking about what could have been done differently and start focusing on how they can change the situation. This thought came up because the original poster mentioned that he felt like he was behind where he should be.\nSome people are younger and richer than you, but that doesn't impact your finances. You can feel good about other people reaching their financial goals at younger ages without feeling bad about your progress. Getting your mindset right is a key part of getting out of debt and building a significant nest egg. Technically, the couple still has plenty of time since they are in their early 30s.\n\"Don't let someone else's situation make you feel like it is hopeless for you to right your own ship,\" the commenter wrapped up his thoughts. The couple won't have to retire for a few decades. That's enough time to get out of an $83,000 debt, buy a house, and contribute consistently to your retirement accounts.\nTrending: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\nPrioritize Credit Card Debt\nSeveral Redditors encouraged the 30-year-old to tackle the credit card debt first.

That means he's less likely to make similar mistakes as he gets on the path to becoming debt-free.", "content_hash": "f9eb32856452d0822cda72e34cf6c6d2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Next week, Nvidia (NVDA) , the world's most valuable company, will report earnings and offer investors a glimpse into the state of the 'AI boom.'\nIn recent days, AI trades have staggered amid worries of a \"bubble\" in the industry. It's a harsher reality today than it was last quarter, with high-flyers like Palantir (PLTR) down 15% from its August highs.\nAnd peers such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have already reported, teasing strong revenue and weaker profits. Nonetheless, there remains a path to land the earnings, assuming there are no surprises.\nHowever, there is a big shadowy unknown lurking in the background of the biggest report of the season: China.\nNvidia's China Problem\nNvidia's China problem is that we don't know how big of a problem it might be, if at all.\nLast fiscal year, Nvidia made $17.1 billion in revenue from selling to China, making it the company's fourth-largest market. That represented about 13% of its total sales for the year. This share declined in the latest quarter, but the company's total sales continued to rise.\nOnly, the concern is that Chinese sales aren't really 13% of the company. That's just the sales we know about.\nOutside of the U.S., which represents the lion's share of Nvidia's sales, Singapore and Taiwan are #2 and #3 in sales by country. They represented $23.7 billion (18.1% of sales) and $20.6 billion (15.8%). However, Nvidia concedes that some of this might look misleading.\nIn a footnote of their latest quarterly filing, they acknowledge that, although Singapore represented 20% of its first quarter revenue, \"customers use Singapore to centralize invoicing while our products are almost always shipped elsewhere.\"\nThey go on to add that \"over 99%\" of that revenue was for U.S. based customers. However, sales to customers outside the U.S. surpassed 53% in their latest quarterly filing (up from 48% in the quarter last year.)\nWho are these customers? Well, some analysts warn that it's actually just China in a trench coat.\nIts presumed that much more than 13% of the company's sales are from Chinese firms. In fact, some analysts warn that up to a third of Nvidia's revenue might well be coming from China when accounting for indirect purchases. That's because firms might be employing indirection means to acquire chips in the face of aggressive chip sanctions and restrictions levied on the country by the U.S. government.\nGiven recent developments, that could be cause for alarm.\nChina Warns Its Tech Industry\nA new deal between domestic chipmakers and the White House will see 15% of their revenues from Chinese sales paid to the Federal Government. Not withstanding the weirdness of the profit-sharing, it might not generate as much revenue as this administration believes.\nThat's because China has directed its tech giants to stop buying Nvidia's last-gen H20 chips. The controversy stems from an interview where U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that, \"We don't sell them our best stuff,\" adding that, \"You want to sell the Chinese enough that their developers get addicted to the American technology stack.\"\nIt's hard to tell how Beijing will reduce its reliance on Nvidia; the country's own domestic chipmaking industry still is not producing AI chips of the same sophistication as Nvidia, AMD, and others. For those reasons, this might amount to a big bluff by Beijing. For all we know, Nvidia might even be able to start selling next-gen chips to China in the coming months (or an all-new chip for the Chinese market).\nHowever, the threat of a slowdown in sales is an incalculable risk given the unknowns. We know exactly how China directly contributes to revenue and how that might be affected if they change their buying behaviors.\nOn the other hand, we don't know the true scale of its indirect buys. That could create some surprises if they are, indeed, large enough to affect the company's growth story.\nWhy Does It Matter?\nThat's not just a problem for Nvidia investors, but everybody. Nvidia is the largest component of the S&P 500, the most-tracked index in the country. Trillions of dollars in 401(K)s, IRAs, and brokerages are tracked to the value of the index.\nThat means that, in the event Nvidia stock does fall, the S&P 500 likely will be going down with it. As of Aug. 22, 2025, it represented 7.49% of the index, with a market capitalization of $4.35 trillion.\nIt also sits atop the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (14.19%) and sits #20 in the 30-strong, price-weighted Dow (2.4%). In the latter, it's the best-performing stock this year.\nHowever, investors don't seem to care so far. Up 28.7% year-to-date, the company is outperforming the broader market. And aside from a few brief pullbacks, the stock has been up-and-up, no end in sight.", "content_hash": "6218d295fd56b5806ee7b48c7c9769be", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The flexibility to choose has the potential to lower costs and deliver better authorisation rates, but before making any decisions, it’s important to understand the landscape.\nThe most straightforward way for a retailer to access multiple acquirers is through an acquirer-agnostic payment service provider (PSP), whose payment gateway will connect them to a range of national and international acquirers, providing guidance as to which one will be most appropriate in the circumstances.\nStrategic advantages\nSmaller retailers are often offered all-in-one payment services, but as they scale across countries and sales channels, changing their payment infrastructure becomes increasingly strategic. The all-in-one approach offers convenience through bundled services, but a more flexible, acquirer-agnostic payment setup can provide significant competitive advantages.\nCost efficiency\nAcquirers charge varying fees based on product type, market, and transaction channel. For retailers operating in multiple countries or online and offline simultaneously, the optimum choice is to work with a PSP that connects to multiple acquirers, allowing them to shop for the best rates and terms in each specific market – and perhaps most importantly, identify acquirers with the best payment conversion rates. This freedom to select or switch acquirers translates directly into reduced transaction costs. Additionally, the ability to quickly pivot between providers enhances the retailer’s leverage during contract negotiations, helping secure favourable rates and fair terms that reflect current market conditions.\nMaximising availability\nBeyond cost, operational resilience is another critical benefit of an acquirer-neutral PSP. One key metric here is the ‘availability rate’ — the percentage of time credit card payments are functional during a shop’s overall uptime.\nWith the flexibility to onboard multiple acquirers, merchants can establish a backup system. If one acquirer experiences technical downtime, another can step in immediately to ensure uninterrupted payment flow. This redundancy minimises lost sales and improves customer experience, especially during peak traffic periods or major online events.\nAccelerated international market entry\nFor multinational businesses, speed-to-market is everything. Expanding into new countries can be slowed significantly if payment options aren’t aligned with local preferences or regulatory requirements. Different markets often favour different card brands or have unique payment behaviours. A PSP that connects to regional or local acquirers enables a business to offer payment methods that are familiar and trusted by local consumers.\nMoreover, most international acquirers operate on region-specific processing platforms. This means a contract and technical integration that works in the EU may not be applicable in the US or Asia. At Computop, however, we develop API’s that allow merchants to access different acquirers across multiple countries from the United States to Japan and from Denmark to India. With a flexible PSP that already supports multiple platforms globally, merchants can avoid the burden of negotiating and integrating entirely new systems. This infrastructure-ready model shortens the timeline for going live in new markets.\nIndustry specific advantages\nNot all business models are treated equally by acquirers. Industries with elevated risk profiles — such as travel, ticketing, or made-to-order goods — often face hurdles in securing acquiring partners. These businesses may be subject to higher transaction fees or even denied access altogether due to the potential for chargebacks or long delivery cycles.\nIn such cases, the ability to choose from a wide portfolio of acquirers is crucial. Companies in high-risk or ‘critical’ sectors benefit significantly from an acquirer-agnostic model, as they can identify partners with risk tolerance or even specialisation in their vertical. This reduces dependence on a single acquirer and ensures business continuity, even if a long-time partner exits the industry or raises rates.\nImportant use cases\nWhile an acquirer-agnostic approach offers wide-reaching advantages, it's not the right solution for every business. Its relevance becomes particularly pronounced in two core scenarios:\nInternational operations Retailers operating or expanding into multiple regions often need tailored payment support in each location. Regional acquirers typically offer better acceptance rates and fees due to local expertise, making them more attractive than global bundled solutions.\nHigh-risk or regulated industries Merchants in industries seen as high-risk benefit from having a choice, as they might be turned away by conservative acquirers or charged high risk premiums. Flexibility allows them to find partners who understand and cater to their business needs.\nIs acquirer agnosticism right for all?\nNot necessarily. All-in-one providers still hold strong appeal, especially for small and mid-sized businesses with straightforward operations. These bundled solutions are easy to set up and manage, reducing the need for specialised knowledge or dedicated technical resources. For businesses processing relatively low volumes, the potential savings from switching acquirers might not justify the complexity of managing multiple partners.\nHowever, larger retail chains, fast-scaling startup businesses or merchants entering new international markets can reap significant rewards. The ability to optimise fees, ensure uninterrupted processing, and maintain a competitive edge in diverse regulatory environments makes the acquirer-agnostic model a powerful tool in global payment strategy.\nPhilip Plambeck, Managing Director, Computop UK\n\"Why acquirer-agnostic payment gateways can lead to growth and lower costs\" was originally created and published by Electronic Payments International, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

These are the top investing rules they said their wealthiest clients never break.\nKeep Things Liquid\nInvesting like a millionaire often requires having a little more knowledge than the average person. For many high net worth individuals, one investing rule is to keep some things liquid.\n“One of the first things our millionaire clients do is apply for a Pledged Asset Line of Credit on their nonqualified brokerage account. For example, if a client has a brokerage account valued at $2,500,000, that client could get a line of credit from their brokerage account of approximately $1,400,000,” Hernandez said. “In my experience, wealthier clients are entrepreneurial and like to have access to liquidity to make investments outside of the stock market.”\nSo how does this work?\n“Instead of having to cash out their positions and possibly pay taxes on any gains, they can access their line of credit, make the investment, and only pay interest on what they borrowed, while their capital continues working for them,” Hernandez said. “Once the investment pays off, they tend to pay off their line of credit, so they have access to the funds in the future and can continue to create more and more wealth.”\nRead Next: Money Influencer Delyanne Barros: Why Boring Could Be Best for Investing\nConsider Time In Rather Than Timing the Market\nThe stock market is always in flux, so trying to time it is a fool’s game.

This determination and dedication are among the reasons they have become so successful. If an opportunity or emergency arises unexpectedly, they are already prepared and can approach it proactively rather than reactively.”", "content_hash": "ed51f3935f891c8ed1deb4a8f4ab4399", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The analysts believe that the company’s results could come in above consensus, with expectations for fiscal Q2 revenue of $45.8 billion and EPS of $1.00.

It's a good gauge to determine whether the stock has the strong mix of value and growth potential to be a solid investment.\nThe point is not about whether you can quickly double your money from an investment, but whether it has enough upside to be a good growth stock.\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is an intriguing option because it isn't a cheap stock. In fact, it's one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of around $2.5 trillion. For it to double in value, you would need to believe it can get to $5 trillion. The business has been expanding and continues to grow, but does it truly have the potential to double your money within the next five years?\nLet's lay out both the bullish and bearish cases.\nWhy Amazon could double in value\nAmazon has no shortage of catalysts that could help its top and bottom lines rise in the future.\nA big one is undoubtedly Amazon Web Services (AWS). As companies spend more money to invest into artificial intelligence (AI) and put more data onto the cloud, AWS is likely going to benefit from an increase in demand.\nAnd that's great news for investors because AWS accounts for the bulk of the company's operating income. During the first six months of the year, Amazon's operating income has totaled $37.6 billion, and $21.7 billion of that has come from AWS.\nThere are many other opportunities related to AI for Amazon to pursue as well. For example, it has launched an Alexa+ subscription service, which will give users access to an AI-enhanced personal assistant. For Prime members, there's no added charge for now, but those who aren't will pay $19.99 per month for Alexa's cutting-edge capabilities.\nAmazon has also been investing billions into Anthropic, the company that developed the AI chatbot Claude. And it has launched an AI-powered assistant, Rufus, on its online marketplace. By leveraging generative AI more deeply into its operations, that could help the company not only cut costs but also boost revenue by unlocking new growth opportunities and selling more products.\nThere's a ton of growth potential for Amazon related to AI, which is why the upside can be significant for the stock in the long run.\nWhy Amazon's stock might not double\nAs robust as Amazon's business is, it remains vulnerable to macroeconomic conditions. If there's a recession in the near future due to tariffs and global trade wars, that could lead to a pullback on spending on its online marketplace.\nCompanies may also trim their AI and tech-related budgets, and slowing growth for AWS could be what triggers a sell-off of the stock. AWS is often seen as the big growth machine for Amazon, and how it performs could weigh heavily on its shares.\nA more serious long-term concern is that its sheer strength may be its undoing. The Federal Trade Commission alleges that Amazon has an online retail monopoly. How that plays out could not only affect profitability but also cast doubt over its long-term prospects. Its online marketplace is still the company's core business, and an unfavorable antitrust ruling could severely hurt the stock's valuation.\nFurthermore, amid a flurry of AI stocks and new tech companies garnering attention from investors, there may simply not be as much of an appetite to pay a big premium for Amazon anymore. In the past, it wasn't uncommon to see the stock trading at well over 50 times its trailing earnings. Now, it's trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 35. If Amazon doesn't show that it's a leader in AI, investors may not be prepared to pay as much of a premium for the business as they have in the past, which could limit its upside.\nIs it likely that Amazon's stock doubles in five years?\nAmazon may not be the flashiest AI stock right now, but it's been leading the charge on AI for years. Investors may be focusing on other stocks instead, which could explain its lackluster 5% gains since the start of the year.\nBut with so much potential and so many opportunities related to AI, I believe this is a stock that could double in five years. Despite its underwhelming performance this year, Amazon is one of the best growth stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $650,499!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,072,543!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.

These next-generation algorithms are being used by creatives to generate original content, by businesses to streamline processes, and by developers to write and debug computer code -- and new use cases are being uncovered regularly.\nMost AI processing takes place in data centers, and the most widely known names in technology are scrambling to keep up with demand. In fact, the four horsemen of technology, namely Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon, have announced plans for nearly $400 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, with the vast majority dedicated to the servers and data centers needed to support AI.\nThe biggest beneficiary of this trend is arguably Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which supplies the graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computational horsepower that underpins AI. Two Wall Street analysts believes investors don't fully appreciate the opportunity and suggest this will vault the chipmaker's value to $6 trillion by the end of next year.\nA decade in the making\nWhen generative AI burst on the scene in early 2023, Nvidia was vaulted from near obscurity to superstardom, and many viewed the company as an overnight success. However, students of history know Nvidia's accomplishments were more than a decade in the making.\nBack in 2013, CEO Jensen Huang realized academics and researchers were using Nvidia's processors to accelerate deep learning and machine learning (earlier branches of AI). Secure in that knowledge, Huang positioned Nvidia for an AI-centric future. When generative AI began to spread like wildfire, Nvidia's GPUs quickly became the gold standard.\nThese chips utilize parallel processing, which breaks up complex mathematical tasks into smaller jobs, leveraging multiple cores to process the calculations simultaneously. The combination of cutting-edge processors and the proprietary software instructions embedded deep within the GPUs has cemented Nvidia's place as the industry leader -- and has fueled its rapidly growing profits.\nThe numbers are compelling\nIn its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), Nvidia generated record revenue that surged 69% year over year to $44 billion. Excluding a one-time charge, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 62% to $0.96. The biggest contributor was the company's data center segment, which houses chips used for AI, cloud computing, and data centers. Revenue for the segment soared 73% to $39 billion, fueled by persistent demand for AI.\nThere could be much more to come. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company calculates that generative AI could increase corporate profits by $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade.\nThe road to $6 trillion\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse recently weighed in on Nvidia's prospects, maintaining an overweight (buy) rating on the stock and boosting his price target to $240. That represents potential upside of 37% compared to Tuesday's closing price and a market cap of $5.9 trillion.\nMuse believes investors continue to underappreciate the scale of the data center build-out underway. He estimates that Nvidia will generate data center revenue of $200 billion this year and $300 billion next year, fueling the next leg of its growth.\nHe isn't the only one. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $250 on Nvidia stock. This represents potential upside of 42%, which would push Nvidia's market cap to $6.1 trillion over the coming 12 to 18 months.\nThe analyst predicts that the use of generative AI and widespread adoption of AI factories could generate spending of $2 trillion over the next few years, with Nvidia reaping the rewards.\nFurthermore, Nvidia controls a dominant 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics, so the company stands to benefit the most from the rapid growth in the data center space.\nNvidia is already the world's most highly valued company, with a market cap of $4.2 trillion (as of this writing). Despite that and the company's enviable growth rate, the stock is selling for just 29 times next year's sales. Given Nvidia's industry-leading technology, strong execution, and the persistent secular tailwinds, I'd submit that's an attractive price to pay for a company with such excellent prospects.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The perennial winner in restaurant dining saw a sudden collapse in customer traffic and same-store restaurant sales growth, which hurt the company's profitability. Chipotle stock sank big time on the news and was down 37% from all-time highs.\nShort-term blips in business performance can provide buying opportunities for long-term stock winners. Does this drawdown make Chipotle stock a can't-miss buy today?\nLosing customer traffic\nEither due to macroeconomic factors or losing customer loyalty, Chipotle's store traffic declined last quarter, causing its per-restaurant revenue -- what's known as comparable store sales growth -- to decline 4% year over year. This is a huge change from Chipotle's post-pandemic same-store sales growth, which has ranged from positive 5% to 10% depending on the quarter.\nOne quarter of weak traffic is not the end of the world for a restaurant brand, but it is indicative of changing customer habits. After years of dominating market share gains, the fast-casual category has hit a speed bump and lost share to traditional fast food and casual dining brands, which are posting better traffic and comparable store figures than Chipotle.\nWhat's more, for years shoppers in the United States have shifted from spending money on groceries to spending money at restaurants on pre-made food away from home. This trend has stalled due to inflation in recent quarters. A confluence of factors may have finally caused Chipotle to hit a growth wall. Now, its profit margins have begun to decline, as its comparable store sales growth is declining while input costs like food and labor are increasing due to inflation.\nInternational expansion plans\nInvestors should keep a close eye on Chipotle's same-store sales figures. The metric may struggle for a few quarters due to macroeconomic factors, but it should -- and needs to -- recover eventually to help Chipotle get back to earnings growth.\nAs long as same-store sales growth recovers, what matters most for Chipotle over the long run is expanding the store count. Management believes it can eventually hit 7,000 stores in North America, which it is well over halfway to achieving. In the longer term, it plans to bring the Chipotle brand to new regions around the world. This includes Western Europe, the Middle East, and a new location in Mexico starting this year. One Mexican location is not going to revolutionize Chipotle's financials, but if an American-Mexican restaurant chain can succeed in Mexico, it can likely succeed in any country.", "content_hash": "94c42efb467506dc54431fc45a7a1e31", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It's a good gauge to determine whether the stock has the strong mix of value and growth potential to be a solid investment.\nThe point is not about whether you can quickly double your money from an investment, but whether it has enough upside to be a good growth stock.\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is an intriguing option because it isn't a cheap stock. In fact, it's one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap of around $2.5 trillion. For it to double in value, you would need to believe it can get to $5 trillion. The business has been expanding and continues to grow, but does it truly have the potential to double your money within the next five years?\nLet's lay out both the bullish and bearish cases.\nWhy Amazon could double in value\nAmazon has no shortage of catalysts that could help its top and bottom lines rise in the future.\nA big one is undoubtedly Amazon Web Services (AWS). As companies spend more money to invest into artificial intelligence (AI) and put more data onto the cloud, AWS is likely going to benefit from an increase in demand.\nAnd that's great news for investors because AWS accounts for the bulk of the company's operating income. During the first six months of the year, Amazon's operating income has totaled $37.6 billion, and $21.7 billion of that has come from AWS.\nThere are many other opportunities related to AI for Amazon to pursue as well. For example, it has launched an Alexa+ subscription service, which will give users access to an AI-enhanced personal assistant. For Prime members, there's no added charge for now, but those who aren't will pay $19.99 per month for Alexa's cutting-edge capabilities.\nAmazon has also been investing billions into Anthropic, the company that developed the AI chatbot Claude. And it has launched an AI-powered assistant, Rufus, on its online marketplace. By leveraging generative AI more deeply into its operations, that could help the company not only cut costs but also boost revenue by unlocking new growth opportunities and selling more products.\nThere's a ton of growth potential for Amazon related to AI, which is why the upside can be significant for the stock in the long run.\nWhy Amazon's stock might not double\nAs robust as Amazon's business is, it remains vulnerable to macroeconomic conditions. If there's a recession in the near future due to tariffs and global trade wars, that could lead to a pullback on spending on its online marketplace.\nCompanies may also trim their AI and tech-related budgets, and slowing growth for AWS could be what triggers a sell-off of the stock. AWS is often seen as the big growth machine for Amazon, and how it performs could weigh heavily on its shares.\nA more serious long-term concern is that its sheer strength may be its undoing. The Federal Trade Commission alleges that Amazon has an online retail monopoly. How that plays out could not only affect profitability but also cast doubt over its long-term prospects. Its online marketplace is still the company's core business, and an unfavorable antitrust ruling could severely hurt the stock's valuation.\nFurthermore, amid a flurry of AI stocks and new tech companies garnering attention from investors, there may simply not be as much of an appetite to pay a big premium for Amazon anymore. In the past, it wasn't uncommon to see the stock trading at well over 50 times its trailing earnings. Now, it's trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 35. If Amazon doesn't show that it's a leader in AI, investors may not be prepared to pay as much of a premium for the business as they have in the past, which could limit its upside.\nIs it likely that Amazon's stock doubles in five years?\nAmazon may not be the flashiest AI stock right now, but it's been leading the charge on AI for years. Investors may be focusing on other stocks instead, which could explain its lackluster 5% gains since the start of the year.\nBut with so much potential and so many opportunities related to AI, I believe this is a stock that could double in five years. Despite its underwhelming performance this year, Amazon is one of the best growth stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $650,499!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,072,543!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,045% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.

These next-generation algorithms are being used by creatives to generate original content, by businesses to streamline processes, and by developers to write and debug computer code -- and new use cases are being uncovered regularly.\nMost AI processing takes place in data centers, and the most widely known names in technology are scrambling to keep up with demand. In fact, the four horsemen of technology, namely Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon, have announced plans for nearly $400 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, with the vast majority dedicated to the servers and data centers needed to support AI.\nThe biggest beneficiary of this trend is arguably Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which supplies the graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the computational horsepower that underpins AI. Two Wall Street analysts believes investors don't fully appreciate the opportunity and suggest this will vault the chipmaker's value to $6 trillion by the end of next year.\nA decade in the making\nWhen generative AI burst on the scene in early 2023, Nvidia was vaulted from near obscurity to superstardom, and many viewed the company as an overnight success. However, students of history know Nvidia's accomplishments were more than a decade in the making.\nBack in 2013, CEO Jensen Huang realized academics and researchers were using Nvidia's processors to accelerate deep learning and machine learning (earlier branches of AI). Secure in that knowledge, Huang positioned Nvidia for an AI-centric future. When generative AI began to spread like wildfire, Nvidia's GPUs quickly became the gold standard.\nThese chips utilize parallel processing, which breaks up complex mathematical tasks into smaller jobs, leveraging multiple cores to process the calculations simultaneously. The combination of cutting-edge processors and the proprietary software instructions embedded deep within the GPUs has cemented Nvidia's place as the industry leader -- and has fueled its rapidly growing profits.\nThe numbers are compelling\nIn its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), Nvidia generated record revenue that surged 69% year over year to $44 billion. Excluding a one-time charge, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 62% to $0.96. The biggest contributor was the company's data center segment, which houses chips used for AI, cloud computing, and data centers. Revenue for the segment soared 73% to $39 billion, fueled by persistent demand for AI.\nThere could be much more to come. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company calculates that generative AI could increase corporate profits by $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually over the coming decade.\nThe road to $6 trillion\nCantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse recently weighed in on Nvidia's prospects, maintaining an overweight (buy) rating on the stock and boosting his price target to $240. That represents potential upside of 37% compared to Tuesday's closing price and a market cap of $5.9 trillion.\nMuse believes investors continue to underappreciate the scale of the data center build-out underway. He estimates that Nvidia will generate data center revenue of $200 billion this year and $300 billion next year, fueling the next leg of its growth.\nHe isn't the only one. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has a buy rating and a Street-high price target of $250 on Nvidia stock. This represents potential upside of 42%, which would push Nvidia's market cap to $6.1 trillion over the coming 12 to 18 months.\nThe analyst predicts that the use of generative AI and widespread adoption of AI factories could generate spending of $2 trillion over the next few years, with Nvidia reaping the rewards.\nFurthermore, Nvidia controls a dominant 92% of the data center GPU market, according to IoT Analytics, so the company stands to benefit the most from the rapid growth in the data center space.\nNvidia is already the world's most highly valued company, with a market cap of $4.2 trillion (as of this writing). Despite that and the company's enviable growth rate, the stock is selling for just 29 times next year's sales. Given Nvidia's industry-leading technology, strong execution, and the persistent secular tailwinds, I'd submit that's an attractive price to pay for a company with such excellent prospects.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The perennial winner in restaurant dining saw a sudden collapse in customer traffic and same-store restaurant sales growth, which hurt the company's profitability. Chipotle stock sank big time on the news and was down 37% from all-time highs.\nShort-term blips in business performance can provide buying opportunities for long-term stock winners. Does this drawdown make Chipotle stock a can't-miss buy today?\nLosing customer traffic\nEither due to macroeconomic factors or losing customer loyalty, Chipotle's store traffic declined last quarter, causing its per-restaurant revenue -- what's known as comparable store sales growth -- to decline 4% year over year. This is a huge change from Chipotle's post-pandemic same-store sales growth, which has ranged from positive 5% to 10% depending on the quarter.\nOne quarter of weak traffic is not the end of the world for a restaurant brand, but it is indicative of changing customer habits. After years of dominating market share gains, the fast-casual category has hit a speed bump and lost share to traditional fast food and casual dining brands, which are posting better traffic and comparable store figures than Chipotle.\nWhat's more, for years shoppers in the United States have shifted from spending money on groceries to spending money at restaurants on pre-made food away from home. This trend has stalled due to inflation in recent quarters. A confluence of factors may have finally caused Chipotle to hit a growth wall. Now, its profit margins have begun to decline, as its comparable store sales growth is declining while input costs like food and labor are increasing due to inflation.\nInternational expansion plans\nInvestors should keep a close eye on Chipotle's same-store sales figures. The metric may struggle for a few quarters due to macroeconomic factors, but it should -- and needs to -- recover eventually to help Chipotle get back to earnings growth.\nAs long as same-store sales growth recovers, what matters most for Chipotle over the long run is expanding the store count. Management believes it can eventually hit 7,000 stores in North America, which it is well over halfway to achieving. In the longer term, it plans to bring the Chipotle brand to new regions around the world. This includes Western Europe, the Middle East, and a new location in Mexico starting this year. One Mexican location is not going to revolutionize Chipotle's financials, but if an American-Mexican restaurant chain can succeed in Mexico, it can likely succeed in any country.", "content_hash": "94c42efb467506dc54431fc45a7a1e31", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company started out by developing chips to speed up graphics rendering in video games. However, it later realized that its graphics processing units (GPUs) could be used for tasks outside of this market. As such, it created a software platform called CUDA that allowed developers to program GPUs for other tasks. While many didn't know it at the time, this completely changed Nvidia's future.\nTo speed up the adoption of CUDA, Nvidia decided to give the software program away for free and pushed it into research labs and universities. This turned out to be a brilliant move, as it ended up creating a generation of developers trained to use its platform. Soon, entire libraries of software were being built on top of CUDA. That created a wide moat, because companies that wanted to switch to another GPU provider would both have to rewrite a ton of code and retrain their programmers.\nNvidia added to its moat by developing NVLink, a high-speed connection that lets its GPUs operate together as a single unit. It later increased its networking advantage through its acquisition of Mellanox in 2020. That deal gave Nvidia control of cutting-edge networking technology, strengthening its position in data centers.\nAs you can see, Nvidia's dominance today is about much more than chips, but about developing an entire ecosystem around them.\nIonQ(NYSE: IONQ) sees itself doing the same thing in quantum computing. CEO Niccolo de Masi has said flat out that IonQ wants to be the \"Nvidia player\" in this space. IonQ isn't just trying to make the best quantum computer; like Nvidia, it's trying to create a broader ecosystem of hardware, software, and networking that can create a wide moat.\nIonQ's technology\nIonQ uses a method called trapped-ion technology. In simplistic terms, it works with actual atoms, known as ions, and those atoms act as its qubits (basic units of information in quantum computing). Many competitors try to build artificial systems to copy quantum behavior, but IonQ starts with nature's own building blocks. Since every atom is identical, they are stable, reliable, and hold information longer with fewer mistakes.\nHere's the basic idea: IonQ holds ions in place, cools them with lasers, and puts them into states that can be zero, one, or even both at the same time. That \"both at once\" feature is what gives quantum computers their edge over traditional machines. When IonQ strings ions together in chains, it can tackle problems that would stump even the fastest supercomputers today.\nThe real benefit is how easy it is to grow. IonQ doesn't have to design new chips every time it wants more power. It can just add more ions, making the system bigger in a simpler and more cost-friendly way than rivals.\nBuilding a Nvidia-like moat\nIonQ also isn't afraid to make acquisitions to add both technology and talent. Its pending purchase of Oxford Ionics, for example, will help it increase the number of qubits it can hold on a chip.\nAnd like Nvidia did when it acquired Mellanox, the company is using acquisitions to get into the networking side of the business. Its acquisition of Lightsynq gives it faster connections that could let machines talk to each other at much higher speeds, while its Capella purchase gives it an entry into space-based quantum distribution networks. Overall, IonQ plans to use these acquisitions as a jumping-off point to build the secure infrastructure needed to connect future systems.\nThe most overlooked piece of the IonQ story is software. Nvidia's biggest edge came from CUDA becoming the standard platform for programming GPUs. IonQ is building its own moat with compilation software and error correction tools that make quantum computers more practical for businesses. Once companies adopt IonQ's software stack, they'll be locked in, just as developers were with CUDA.\nIonQ also has plenty of cash to continue to execute its vision. With more than $1.6 billion on the balance sheet as of July 9, it has one of the strongest financial positions in the sector. That money gives it the freedom to invest in technology, expand partnerships, and make acquisitions without worrying about near-term funding. The company's new 65,000-square-foot manufacturing facility also shows it's preparing to build machines at scale.\nThe Nvidia of the 2030s\nBecoming the dominant player in quantum computing will take more than just great hardware. That is why IonQ is trying to follow Nvidia's playbook and create an entire quantum computing ecosystem. Its trapped-ion technology provides a solid foundation, and its push into software and networking could create a Nvidia-like moat in the future.\nThat is why it has the best chance of becoming the Nvidia of the 2030s.\nShould you invest $1,000 in IonQ right now?\nBefore you buy stock in IonQ, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and IonQ wasn’t one of them.

It went public on Dec. 8, 2021, at $9, started trading at $11.25, and rallied to a record closing price of $15.89 on Nov. 11, 2024. But on April 4, 2025, Nu's stock closed at its lowest post-IPO price of $9.01.\nIt nearly took a round trip back to its IPO price as investors fretted over rising interest rates, currency headwinds, and political instability in Brazil and Mexico; the saturation of its mature markets, and its expansion into newer, lower-margin markets to plant its seeds for future growth. However, Nu's stock now trades at about $13 a share. Let's see why it bounced back over the past four months, and where it might be headed over the next year.\nHow fast did Nu grow after its IPO?\nAs a digital-only direct bank, Nu can expand at a much faster rate than its brick-and-mortar competitors. From the end of 2021 through the second quarter of 2025, its total number of customers surged from 33.3 million to 122.7 million, its activity rate (its active customers divided by total customers) rose from 76% to 83%, and its average revenue per active customer (ARPAC) jumped from $4.50 to $12.20. That rapid growth was driven by its three biggest markets -- Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia -- and the expansion of its ecosystem with more credit cards, lending services, e-commerce services, and cryptocurrency trading tools.\nFrom 2021 to 2024, Nu's revenue grew at a CAGR of 89%. It turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2023, and its net income surged 91% in 2024. Its profits rose as economies of scale kicked in, it kept its average monthly cost to serve each active customer steady, and it streamlined its platform with more generative AI services. Those numbers looked impressive, but the economic and political risks in its top markets cast dark clouds over its future. The devaluation of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar was another major issue: Nu is based in Brazil, but it reports its earnings in U.S. dollars.\nWhat happened to Nu over the past year?\nDespite those challenges, Nu's activity rate is holding steady, its ARPAC is rising, and its average costs for serving those active customers are staying comfortably below $1. Those core strengths, along with a broader buying frenzy in high-growth stocks, pulled Nu's stock back from its post-IPO lows. But if we look at its performance over the past year, we'll notice that its year-over-year growth in total customers and revenue is still cooling off.\nData source: Nu Holdings. YOY = Year-over-year. *Currency-neutral basis.\nThat slowdown can be attributed to the saturation of its top market, Brazil, where it already serves over 60% of the adult population; increased competition from similar fintech platforms like MercadoLibre's Mercado Pago, and a more cautious expansion of its credit business as its percentage of non-performing loans gradually rises.\nAs Nu's top-line growth decelerated, its gross and net interest margins declined. That compression was caused by its deeper expansion into Mexico and Colombia, which both required higher funding costs and credit loss allowances than Brazil, and the expansion of its lower-risk (but lower-margin) secured lending and payroll-backed loans. On the bright side, those margins expanded sequentially in its latest quarter and stabilized its stock price.\nData source: Nu Holdings. YOY = Year-over-year. *Currency-neutral basis.\nNu only serves 13% and 10% of the adult populations of Mexico and Colombia, respectively, so it still has plenty of room to expand. However, that expansion could squeeze its near-term margins and throttle its earnings growth. That pressure, along with the persistent macro headwinds in Latin America, is still weighing down its stock.\nWhere will Nu's stock be in a year?\nFor 2025, analysts expect Nu's revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to rise 29% and 36%, respectively. For 2026, they expect its revenue and EPS to grow 24% and 38%, respectively. Those are stellar growth rates for a stock that trades at 17 times next year's earnings.\nIf Nu matches analysts' expectations and trades at a more generous 25 times forward earnings, its stock could rise about 46% to $19 a share within the next 12 months. But for that to happen, the economic and political situation in Brazil needs to stabilize, and Nu needs to tightly control its expansion in Mexico and Colombia so it doesn't crush its margins.\nShould you buy stock in Nu Holdings right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nu Holdings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nu Holdings wasn’t one of them.

However, a new generation of fintech companies -- which are modernizing traditional payment and banking services with their tech platforms -- are growing a lot faster than those aging industry leaders.\nBut it can be tough to separate the winners and losers in that fragmented fintech market. So today, I'll discuss three potential winners which have plenty of long-term growth potential: Upstart(NASDAQ: UPST), Adyen(OTC: ADYE.Y), and Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU).\n1. Upstart\nUpstart is an online lending marketplace that uses AI to approve loans. Instead of using traditional data like an applicant's annual income or credit score, it uses non-traditional data points like standardized test scores, GPAs, and previous jobs to approve a broader range of loans for younger and lower-income applicants with limited credit histories.\nUpstart doesn't provide any loans of its own. It only serves as an AI-powered middleman for its partners, which mainly include banks, credit unions, and auto dealerships. It generates most of its revenue by charging those partners processing fees for approving their loans.\nUpstart suffered a severe slowdown in 2023 as soaring interest rates curbed the market's appetite for new loans. But its growth accelerated again in 2024 as interest rates declined, and analysts expect its revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to grow at a CAGR of 36% and 245%, respectively, from 2024 to 2027. Those are incredible growth rates for a stock that trades at 21 times next year's adjusted EBITDA. The near-term concerns about slower interest rate cuts are likely squeezing its valuations, but its stock could soar a lot higher once those headwinds dissipate.\n2. Adyen\nAdyen is a Dutch fintech company that doesn't provide any consumer-facing payment apps. Instead, it develops backend software for processing payments, analyzing customer data, and organizing financial information. Its software works behind the scenes and can be directly integrated into a merchant's existing online, mobile, and on-store payment platforms. It also enables merchants to develop their own digital wallets and branded payment cards.\nThat flexibility makes it popular choice for businesses that don't want to lock themselves to a bigger payments platform like PayPal(NASDAQ: PYPL). That's probably why eBay, PayPal's former parent company and top e-commerce partner, chose Adyen to replace PayPal as its preferred payment platform in a five-year transition from 2018 to 2023.\nAdyen's revenue growth accelerated during the pandemic as more customers ramped up their online spending, but it suffered a slowdown in 2022 and 2023 as it lapped those gains. Rising interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds exacerbated its slowdown.\nBut Adyen's growth accelerated again in 2024, and analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EBITDA to rise at a CAGR of 22% and 28%, respectively, from 2024 to 2027. Adyen still looks reasonably valued at 22 times next year's adjusted EBITDA, and it should keep growing as it pulls more merchants away from centralized payment platforms.\n3. Nu Holdings\nNu Holdings owns NuBank, the largest digital bank in Latin America. It's based in Brazil, and it also provides its services in Mexico and Colombia. Without any brick-and-mortar branches, it expanded much faster than traditional banks. It served 122.7 million customers at the end of the second quarter of 2025, compared to 33.3 million customers at the end of 2021. As Nu gained more customers, it increased the stickiness of its platform with credit cards, e-commerce services, and cryptocurrency trading tools.\nAs a result, its average revenue per active customer (ARPAC) jumped from $4.50 in 2021 to $12.20 in its latest quarter. Its average cost for serving each customer also held steady, and its margins expanded. Nu has plenty of room to grow because about a quarter of Latin America's adult population remains unbanked.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Nu's revenue and net income (which turned positive in 2023) to rise at a CAGR of 23% and 36%, respectively. Yet its stock still looks dirt cheap at 18 times next year's earnings per share (EPS) -- presumably because investors are concerned about the persistent inflation and political instability in its top markets. If you expect Nu to overcome those challenges -- as it did in the past -- then it deserves a much higher valuation.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Upstart right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Upstart, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Upstart wasn’t one of them.

They used the popular Doge meme as inspiration, and thus Dogecoin became the world's first meme token.\nDespite its founders calling the whole exercise a joke, Dogecoin's market capitalization soared to over $90 billion in 2021 as speculative investors flooded into the crypto space in search of quick returns. Unfortunately, such frenzies never last, and the meme token had lost more than 90% of its peak value by mid-2022.\nAfter a directionless couple of years, Dogecoin found its feet again when Donald Trump won the presidential election last November. He promised to create an ideal environment for the industry to thrive, with friendly policies and less regulation. Since Dogecoin is still trading below its 2021 record high, should investors buy it ahead of a potential run to the $1 milestone?\nDogecoin's latest burst of momentum is fading\nDogecoin's speculative rally in 2021 was partly driven by the support of Tesla CEO Elon Musk. He had been sharing Dogecoin-related memes and participating in banter with other enthusiasts on social media since 2019, leading investors to think he might have a long-term plan to create value for the meme token.\nThat belief reached a fever pitch when Musk appeared on Saturday Night Live (SNL) on May 8, 2021. Rumors swirled that he would make a bullish Dogecoin announcement, but all he did was participate in a comedy skit. In fact, he even joked that his Dogecoin support was a mere \"hustle.\" The token reached a record high of $0.73 during the show, which would prove to be its peak.\nAfter crashing to as low as $0.05 in the aftermath of the SNL saga, the crypto found some momentum again following last year's presidential election. It soared by almost 200% after Nov. 5, reaching a 52-week high of $0.47.\nWhile still short of its all-time high, investors were as enthusiastic as ever because President Donald Trump announced Elon Musk would run a new external agency called the Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE for short), which was tasked with reducing wasteful spending to help lower the national debt.\nCalling the agency DOGE was a deliberate reference to Musk's favorite cryptocurrency. There was never any indication that it would serve a purpose in this new agency, but it didn't stop investors from buying it just in case Musk revealed a concrete plan to create real value.\nBut no such plan came to light, and he has since left DOGE to focus on his various business ventures. As I write this, the token is trading at $0.21, which is 55% below its recent 52-week high.\nDogecoin's never-ending supply growth could prevent further upside\nMusk's dwindling influence over Dogecoin's price might not be its biggest issue. The token still lacks a function in the real world, with just 2,103 businesses around the world willing to accept it as payment for goods and services, according to crypto directory Cryptwerk. Plus, it has a supply issue that could be a major barrier to sustainable upside over the long term.\nThere are around 150.5 billion Dogecoin tokens in circulation, and although there is a cap on how many new tokens can be mined each year, there is no end date. In other words, new tokens will be introduced until the end of time, which means existing investors will suffer constant dilution.\nScarcity is often what makes an asset valuable. Take Bitcoin, for example, which has a capped supply of 21 million coins. Its price continues to rise because investors know additional Bitcoins will never be created, so they feel confident buying and holding the asset for the long term.\nSince scarcity will never be a feature for Dogecoin, I think its chances of reaching $1 are almost zero. Therefore, this is one cryptocurrency investors might want to avoid.\nShould you buy stock in Dogecoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Dogecoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dogecoin wasn’t one of them.

But they can take steps to mitigate the impact of commodity volatility and to ensure they have the financial wherewithal to survive the industry's frequent swings. And while energy prices are a little weak, now is a good time to buy this particular high-yield energy giant.\nThe bad side of energy stocks\nEnergy stocks are a tough sell for conservative investors because they tend to rise and fall along with the price of oil and natural gas. The business swings that this sector goes through can be harrowing, given that commodity prices often swing dramatically and rapidly. Supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and economic cycles all have a huge impact on the energy sector. But energy is also an important part of the global economy, and most investors should have at least some exposure.\nThat's where integrated energy companies come in. This business model includes businesses in the upstream ( oil and natural gas production), the midstream (pipelines), and the downstream (chemicals and refining), all under one single roof. Since each segment of the energy industry operates just a little differently, having a vertically integrated business helps to soften the business swings that companies like Chevron (NYSE: CVX), ExxonMobil, TotalEnergies, BP, and Shell go through.\nThose are the largest and most important public independent integrated energy giants. There are other large companies that use the same basic model, but they often have material government ownership, so they aren't as \"independent\" as you might think. Of the five companies above, Chevron is probably the most attractive right now for long-term investors who are seeking out energy exposure.\nWhy Chevron? Why now?\nEvery investment you make requires trade-offs. That's as true of Chevron as it is of technology giant Apple. What you are looking for is the best balance between risk and reward. And Chevron offers a very attractive balance right now.\nFor starters, the stock is offering a 4.5% dividend yield. That's well above the market and the 3.3% yield of the average energy stock. The dividend has been increased for 38 consecutive years despite the industry's inherent volatility. Clearly, Chevron knows how to survive through the energy cycle while continuing to reward investors well for sticking around.", "content_hash": "d6134f36fa8759aa6335398c63f499bb", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It means interested investors can still get in near the ground floor.\nHere are two promising AI-powered healthcare stocks to consider stepping into before they take off.\nRecursion Pharmaceuticals\nDeveloping a new drug isn't cheap. Estimates range from hundreds of millions of dollars to over $1 billion apiece, with most of the ones that begin clinical trials never even getting close to an actual approval; most failures are seen in phase 2 (of 3) clinical testing. It's such an expensive waste that some fantastic prospective drugs may forever remain undeveloped, or even tested in pre-clinical trials.\nWhat if, however, there were a way to pre-test the potential of a new drug without actually risking any real time or significant funding in doing so? There is. Recursion Pharmaceuticals(NASDAQ: RXRX) built it.\nIt's called Recursion OS. Using 36 petabytes (36 million gigabytes) of biological and chemical data, Recursion OS can virtually test how a particular drug idea might perform in a real-world setting at a fraction of the cost of an actual clinical trial.\nIt's not a replacement for a clinical trial, to be clear. The FDA and other nations' regulatory agencies will still require actual patient testing for any drug. But when the odds of success or failure can be determined in a matter of hours for a pittance rather than found out the hard way -- over the course of years at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars -- Recursion Pharmaceuticals' platform helps pharmaceutical companies know where to focus, and what to not bother developing.\nIts business model is twofold. Recursion is working on some drugs of its own, including a handful of cancer therapies in early-stage testing. It's also working with established outfits like Roche and Sanofi, granting them paid access to Recursion OS in hopes of the co-development of a new drug.\nThere's no real revenue to speak of yet. The company's top line through the first six months of this year is just under $34 million, versus a net loss of $374 million. These sorts of results, of course, fuel plenty of volatility for the stock, which is further fueled by an unclear and ever-changing future. Just bear in mind there's nothing unusual about sizable or persistent losses for young drug developers.\nAnd for what it's worth, the analyst community thinks Recursion Pharmaceuticals' bright future isn't too far down the road. It expects revenue to triple between now and 2027, halving its losses in the process en route to profitability.\nTempus AI\nThe other AI-powered healthcare company worth a closer look is Tempus AI(NASDAQ: TEM).\nIts tech isn't nearly as eye-popping as Recursion's; Tempus' solutions are far more practical and accessible to caregivers. But this makes them immediately more marketable ... and profitable. The $13 billion company did $693 million worth of business last year, up 30% year over year. While still operationally in the red, most of last year's losses stem from stock-based compensation and employment taxes. If it continues to grow as expected, Tempus AI could outgrow these losses and move into the black as soon as fiscal 2027.\nBut what is it? It's a little of everything, but it's best described as all-encompassing software that helps caregivers take better care of patients. For instance, it can help diagnose diseases that aren't readily evident, suggest clinical trials that may be of value to a patient who's running out of options, or even predict the efficacy of a particular course of treatment. It's possible to use its platform, however, without even realizing you're utilizing AI.\nIt's not just for doctors and caregivers, though. Patients also have a portal, as do pharmaceutical companies like the aforementioned Roche and Sanofi.\nAll of these platforms are designed with the same goal in mind, however. That's improving patient outcomes by streamlining the delivery of a lot of often overwhelming information. This is actually a pretty savvy and common-sense use of artificial intelligence.\nTempus AI is also a stock that interested investors may not want to put on the back burner for too long, waiting to see what happens next.\nAlthough the company's still unprofitable, that's changing quickly. More and more investors know it, too. While this hasn't helped shares make any major net progress since last June's initial public offering (IPO), it certainly seems like the bulls are increasingly testing the waters as the narrative takes on a more bullish tone. The company recently raised its full-year guidance, for example, due to new product launches. Analysts are also gradually raising their price targets, with some of them seemingly waiting for the stock to begin a more consistent bullish performance before making bolder calls. Investors who wait for that dynamic to fully materialize, however, often end up missing out.\nJust be aware that -- like Recursion -- the risk and volatility Tempus AI stock brings to the table is above average.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Recursion Pharmaceuticals right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Recursion Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Recursion Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

It represents nothing short of a financial lifeline that many would struggle to make do without.\nFor nearly a quarter of a century, national pollster Gallup has been surveying retirees to gauge how important their Social Security income is to their financial well-being. In the latest poll (in April), a combined 86% responded that it was a \"major\" or \"minor\" income source.\nIn other words, its income that was needed, in some capacity, to cover their expenses. Every annual survey from Gallup has shown that 80% to 90% of retirees lean on this income as some form of financial foundation.\nThe problem for Social Security is that its own financial foundation has been weakening for decades. While America's leading social program is in no danger of going bankrupt, becoming insolvent, or halting benefits, sizable and unfavorable changes for beneficiaries await if lawmakers fail to act.\nSocial Security benefit cuts may become a reality eight years from now\nSince the very first retired-worker benefit check was mailed in January 1940, the Social Security Board of Trustees has published an annual report detailing the program's financial inner workings.\nThe Trustees Report allows anyone to see how the program brought in every dollar in income since 1940, as well as track where every dollar in outlays ended up. The overwhelming percentage of outlays are benefits paid to eligible beneficiaries, but that also encompasses the cost to operate and oversee the program.\nWhat's often more valuable with the Trustees Report is its long-term (75-year) financial forecast. This projection takes into account various changes in fiscal and monetary policy changes, as well as ongoing demographic shifts, to project how financially sound the program will be 75 years following the release of a report.\nFor 40 years, the annual Trustees Report has cautioned of a long-term unfunded obligation. In simple terms, projected income to be collected in the 75 years following the release of a report is estimated to be insufficient to cover outlays, including annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs). This unfunded obligation has been growing for decades and now stands at $25.1 trillion, as of the 2025 Report.\nHowever, this long-term unfunded obligation isn't what's causing the biggest stir. Rather, it's the Trustees' estimate that the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund (OASI) will deplete its asset reserves by 2033. The \"asset reserves\" represent the excess income collected since inception that's invested in special-issue interest-bearing government bonds, as required by law.\nTo reiterate, Social Security isn't going bankrupt, halting payments, or disappearing. The program collects the bulk of its income from the 12.4% payroll tax on earnings. If Americans keep working and paying their taxes, there will always be funds to disburse to eligible beneficiaries.\nThe issue is that the current payout schedule, including COLAs, isn't expected to be sustained beyond 2033. If the OASI's asset reserves are exhausted, sweeping benefit cuts of up to 23% may await retired workers and the survivors of deceased workers in eight years.\nHere's the full and truthful story of what's wrong with Social Security\nMost people agree that Social Security is in need of reform, including many of our elected officials in Washington, D.C. However, not everyone agrees on how America's leading retirement program got into this financial mess in the first place.\nWhat can be said with a high degree of confidence is that online message board claims of \"lawmakers stealing/pilfering Social Security's trust funds\" and \"undocumented migrants receiving Social Security benefits\" are not accurate reasons for Social Security's financial struggles.\nEvery cent of Social Security's asset reserves is accounted for and updated monthly by the Social Security Administration. Meanwhile, legal and undocumented migrants positively contribute to the Social Security program, with undocumented migrants unable to receive traditional Social Security income (retired-worker benefits, disability benefits, or survivor benefits).\nWith these pervasive online message-board myths out of the way, let's dive into the real reasons Social Security checks could be slashed in just eight years.\nThe bulk of Social Security's growing long-term funding shortfall and projected OASI asset reserve depletion traces back to a number of ongoing demographic changes. In no particular order:\nBaby boomers have been leaving the workforce in greater numbers, which is going to weigh down the worker-to-beneficiary ratio. There simply aren't enough new workers entering the labor force to counter those retiring.\nLongevity has notably increased since the first retired-worker check was mailed in 1940. Social Security was never designed to provide benefit checks for two decades.\nThe U.S. fertility rate fell to an all-time low in 2024. Couples are waiting longer to marry and have kids, which is expected to further pressure the worker-to-beneficiary ratio in the years to come.\nIncome inequality is climbing. In 2025, all earned income (wages and salary, but not investment income) from $0.01 to $176,100 is subject to the 12.4% payroll tax. However, the wages and salary of high earners has been growing at a faster pace than the maximum taxable earnings cap (the $176,100 figure) on an annual basis. In short, more earned income is escaping the payroll tax over time.\nNet legal migration into the U.S. has dropped off considerably since the late 1990s. Most legal migrants are young, and the Social Security program counts on these younger workers spending decades in the labor force contributing via the payroll tax before one day receiving a retirement benefit of their own. Fewer legal migrants entering the U.S. means not enough payroll tax revenue being collected to cover future payouts.\nBut there's more blame to assign beyond demographic shifts.\nThe Federal Reserve hasn't helped matters by keeping interest rates at or near historic lows for much of the last 15 years. The special-issue interest-bearing bonds that the program's asset reserves are invested in (as required by law) ebb and flow with the central bank's monetary policy. Historically low interest rates pushed yields down and led to minimal interest income being collected.\nLastly, lawmakers do deserve their share of the blame. A lack of action by Congress to reform America's leading social program will only make fixing it costlier when the time comes.\nPut bluntly, these are not going to be easy issues to address. Factors such as birth rates and net legal migration statistics don't meaningfully change overnight. Strengthening Social Security will require tough decisions to be made -- and it's unlikely everyone will be happy when all is said and done.\nThe $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income.\nOne easy trick could pay you as much as $23,760 more... each year!

Adjusted per-share earnings were even worse, at $0.43: a 23% miss, down 49% (yikes!) from the year-ago quarter.\nEven beyond the marquee numbers, the quarter was painful.

The company's backlog of projects also shrank 13% over the past year, from $32.3 billion to $28.2 billion.\nPerhaps the only highlight of Fluor's Q2 earnings report was from its majority stake in nuclear start-up NuScale Power (NYSE: SMR). When Fluor reported earnings, NuScale's shares had skyrocketed more than 150% year to date. That represented $3.2 billion in pre-tax mark-to-market gains on Fluor's NuScale investment, which was included in its equity-method earnings calculation.\nAn even rougher outlook\nAdding insult to injury, Fluor also significantly reduced annual guidance.

Perhaps that’s why it’s somewhat surprising Buffett once refused to help his daughter when she asked for a $41,000 loan to remodel her kitchen. With about 3,000 times that sum in the bank, why say no?\nBuffett's rationale was straightforward: he believes in independence and hard work. Or, put differently, he wants merit, not nepotism, for his own children. That’s why he told his daughter to \"go to the bank like everyone else\", rather than relying on the Bank of Dad to fund any renovations.\nPerhaps it seems harsh. But he's the type of parent who believes in chores, responsibility, and hard work. Whether or not you’re the same, you should ensure your adult children won’t have any inheritance headaches when you eventually pass on your wealth.\nHere’s what we know about Buffett's will — and how to make navigating this touchy subject a little easier for you and your family.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nBuffett’s approach to wealth\nMost of Buffett’s wealth will only be shared with his kids once he passes on. He’s famed for saying you should “give your kids enough so they can do anything, but not so much that they'll do nothing.”\nGiven his children are now all adults, none of whom require his financial support, his will is very specific with regards to how they will spend his money.\nBuffett announced earlier this year that he’ll donate his fortune to a charitable trust managed by his three children when he dies. Prior to this statement, he’d indicated his wealth would be going towards the Gates Foundation.\nAs Buffett puts it, “Society has a use for my money; I don’t”.\nRead more: Do you own rental properties in the US?

MKC has declined 8.2% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 16.1%.

Your 20s give you the one asset money cannot buy, which is years of time, during which you can make steady contributions to your portfolio, which then can become years of potential growth. One of the most important tricks to making the most of your time ahead is picking a small set of assets, then letting discipline do the heavy lifting.\nTwo cryptocurrencies are ideal for long-term holding, specifically Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) and Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH). Both have clear, durable reasons they are likely to rise in value over long horizons, and both reward boring habits like dollar-cost averaging (DCAing), which simply means investing the same amount on a regular schedule. Here's how each are great for wealth-building, especially in a young investor's portfolio.\nScarcity pays off huge over time\nBuying and holding scarce assets that other people think are valuable tends to be a smart move in investing, especially if new supply of the asset can't be readily produced at the same scale as demand.\nAs you've probably heard, Bitcoin's supply is permanently capped at 21 million coins, a simple but powerful idea that creates scarcity you can plan around. Similarly, its new issuance also steps down roughly every four years at the coin's halvings. So its relative scarcity will increase over time, even if demand for it remains static.\nScarcity alone does not guarantee rising prices forever, but it does raise the bar for future sellers to clear before they pull the trigger and ditch their coins, as there is always a credible driver for prices being even higher in the future. That likely encourages many would-be sellers to retain their assets, constraining the float and behaving like a self-fulfilling prophecy to force prices upward.\nIt's also easier for investors to allocate to Bitcoin than ever before. In January 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the listing and trading of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), giving investors Bitcoin access in regular brokerage accounts. And the asset managers issuing the ETFs will need to retain plenty of the coin over the long run to back their fund, increasing the chances that future buyers will need to pay higher prices.\nThe combination of a supply hard cap and access to capital in the traditional financial system makes Bitcoin an unusually clean candidate for long-term accumulation. There is no reason to expect its core value drivers to be any less potent in 20 years than they are today. Across many years in which its issuance keeps tightening and its ownership broadens, the odds tilt toward it becoming more and more valuable, provided you can keep contributing through the dull stretches as well as the scary ones where it drops 60% or more.\nRegarding that last point, young investors also have a lot to learn by holding Bitcoin. Its volatility, while low for a cryptocurrency, is the main psychological test to clear. The only way to study for that test is to create an investment thesis that grants you the conviction to hold the coin through thick and thin.\nGetting exposure to the decentralized finance ecosystem is a good idea too\nWhereas Bitcoin is a scarce asset like gold, Ethereum is the programmable smart contract platform where a lot of useful things are happening.\nFor reference, a smart contract is simply a program that runs on a blockchain like Ethereum and automatically follows the rules its code defines. That capability underpins decentralized finance (DeFi), which is the main pillar of Ethereum's ecosystem and also the main reason why it's worth buying and holding as an investor in your 20s.\nEthereum consistently leads the rankings for total value locked (TVL), with $90.6 billion. Its huge base of users, app developers, and assets is what gives the platform staying power.\nCrucially, the network keeps improving, which keeps users and capital on the chain rather than defecting elsewhere. On May 7, 2025, Ethereum activated the Pectra upgrade, a package of changes that, among other things, advanced capabilities to improve the chain's user experience and its staking mechanics. Incremental upgrades like these do not create instant price moves, but they strengthen the platform's usefulness and reduce friction for the builders who ship the apps that attract the next wave of users, and there are many more planned for the future.\nFor a 20-something investor, the thesis for buying Ethereum is that if more financial activity migrates on-chain over the next decade, as it almost certainly will, the chain that already hosts the deepest app ecosystem, the most stablecoin value, and the most developer mindshare is likely to capture a meaningful share of the value those apps generate. It might even capture more interest from financial institutions, too.\nCompeting smart contract chains will keep pressing it on speed and cost. Even so, competitors won't be able to beat this chain overnight, and the market itself is likely to keep expanding. So start buying some Ethereum if you don't already have it, and be ready to hold on to it forever to let its developers boost the value of your investment slowly and steadily.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

Unity Software\nUnity Software(NYSE: U) is one of the leading software providers for the video game industry, where it dominates the mobile game market. This was a high-growth business until 2024, when the business suffered from poor execution and ill-timed acquisitions that increased debt.\nThe stock is down 81% from its previous peak, but there's a new CEO leading the company now, and the shares have rebounded in 2025 following positive earnings results.\nUnity's second-quarter earnings report still shows mixed performance, with revenue down slightly over the year-ago quarter. The company makes money from subscriptions (Create Solutions) and additional services that help companies monetize their games, such as advertising (Grow Solutions). Unity's Create segment reported double-digit subscription growth last quarter. CEO Matt Bromberg called the quarter \"an inflection point,\" signaling the worst is behind the company.\nUnity is launching new products to drive growth. Its positioning its ad business for more growth with the Vector artificial intelligence engine that can take advantage of valuable data to improve advertising performance.\nIts Unity 6 game engine has been downloaded over 6.6 million times, representing a 50% increase over the previous quarter. The company signed new multiyear deals with two of the leading game companies in the world, Tencent and Nintendo, putting Unity in a solid position to continue serving the development of some of the biggest titles in the industry.\nUnity is also having success expanding beyond the video game industry, reporting its 10th consecutive quarter of sequential growth in non-gaming markets like automotive and healthcare. This shows how Unity's real-time 3D software tools and virtual reality solutions can benefit various fields from medical training to prototyping new product designs.\nWall Street analysts certainly see 2025 as an inflection point year for the company. The consensus analyst estimate calls for adjusted earnings to reach $1.13 by 2027 up from about $0.80 expected this year. If Unity can get its revenue growing along with improving earnings, the stock could offer significant upside over the next five years.\n2. CoreWeave\nAs businesses plow billions into advanced computing infrastructure to take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI), it's benefiting CoreWeave(NASDAQ: CRWV). CoreWeave has a growing footprint of data centers stocked with the latest graphics processing units (GPUs) to run compute-intensive workloads. Enterprises use CoreWeave over a cloud-based platform where they can run data analysis, and build AI tools and applications. The stock just started trading earlier this year but is currently down 48% from its recent highs. The dip is a great buying opportunity.\nCoreWeave generates most of its revenue through long-term contracts with the balance coming from on-demand services. As you would expect given the AI tsunami sweeping across the economy, the company is seeing robust demand. Revenue tripled year over year in Q2 to $1.2 billion. Its revenue backlog hit $30 billion, up 86% year over year.\nOne drawback for CoreWeave is weak profitability. Data center buildouts require substantial upfront costs to get infrastructure up and running to meet customer demand. CoreWeave reported a loss of $290 million in Q2. The business has issued debt to finance its investments, where interest expense is also cutting into the bottom line.\nThe company's total debt burden stood at about $11 billion at the end of the second quarter, which along with losses on the bottom line, is why the stock is volatile. However, that's to the advantage of a long-term investor. The reason to be bullish about the stock's upside is the strong growth in revenues, growing backlog of orders, and importantly, CoreWeave's relationship with AI chip leader Nvidia.\nCoreWeave's relationship with Nvidia gives it a competitive advantage. This has allowed it to gain early access to Nvidia's Blackwell data center chips for its customers, which is one factor fueling demand for its cloud computing services. Nvidia also holds a large stake in CoreWeave stock worth nearly $4 billion at the end of Q2.\nThis stock may not be for everyone due to its volatility, but I believe patient investors could see excellent returns over the next few years. If it meets the consensus Wall Street estimate for adjusted operating income to reach $7.5 billion by 2029, up from an expected $716 million this year, the stock could soar.\nShould you buy stock in Unity Software right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Unity Software, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Unity Software wasn’t one of them.

El-Erian.\nTariff-Related Price Increases Could Be Felt Unevenly Across Economy\nIn a recent analysis, El-Erian argues that the real impact of the tariffs—what some critics have labeled a direct “tax” on Americans—has been delayed, not dismissed, and is poised to be felt unevenly across the economy.\nThe central mystery of the new tariff regime has been the absence of a significant, widespread spike in consumer prices. El-Erian explains that a combination of strategic corporate decisions and inventory management has created a temporary buffer.\nTrending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\nWhy Have Consumers Not Felt The Pressure Yet?\nErian explains that many foreign exporters and U.S. importing companies initially chose to absorb the tariff costs within their profit margins rather than risk losing market share over what they hoped might be a temporary policy. This absorption was the first line of defense for the American consumer’s wallet.\nFurther softening the blow, many businesses stockpiled imported goods before the tariffs took effect. This allowed them to sell products at pre-tariff prices for an extended period, further masking the policy’s inflationary potential.\nTariffs Would Ultimately Raise Taxes On Americans\nErian’s view provides a more nuanced timeline for the argument made by commentators like investor Ross Gerber, who stated on X that tariffs are a consumption-based tax, contrary to their intended use as a trade policy tool for reshoring manufacturing, as they have been promoted.\nSeveral other prominent experts have echoed similar views in recent weeks, with investor Kevin O'Leary calling it a value-added tax on American consumers.\nAccording to El-Erian, the pass-through of these costs will not be uniform. The ultimate burden on consumers will depend heavily on the nature of the goods they buy.\nSee Also: In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage — Get Your Demo\nDemand Elasticity Will Determine What Becomes Expensive\nBusinesses selling products with “inelastic demand”—essential items that consumers will purchase regardless of price changes—are far more likely to pass on the full tariff cost. In contrast, companies serving lower-income consumers or selling goods with “elastic demand” will face a tougher choice, as significant price hikes could destroy demand for their products.", "content_hash": "e0174a661ee6e39de6ed81da99d3204d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Luckily, the generation may be on track to achieve this dream. As reported by The New York Times, young adults are contributing to 401(k)s earlier and more aggressively than their predecessors. The generation understands the basics of compounding interest, and seems anxious to achieve financial freedom.\nBe Aware: Here’s the Minimum Net Worth To Be Considered the Top 1% in Your 50s\nSpending Time with Family and Friends\nGen Z, like most other generations, also hopes to spend more time with family and friends during retirement. Of respondents, 58% in the generation indicated this was important to them. Fidelity recommended that by the time a person is 30, they have 1x their salary saved in retirement. At 35, the investment company recommended having double.\nWhile Gen Z may be eager to hang with loved ones during retirement, they will need to step up the savings to have a fully funded account. The average 401(k) balance for individuals in this generation is $13,500, which is likely below the target amount. The good news is that Gen Z has time to stockpile savings.\nPursuing Hobbies\nAnother dream of Gen Z is to pursue hobbies during retirement. Nearly two-thirds (57%) listed it as a vital part of their golden years. Pursuing hobbies, however, can be expensive, and retirement plans will need to be fully funded to help ensure money is there long after a salary is gone. While Gen Zers started stashing retirement funds away earlier than their predecessors, they have also withdrawn more from their accounts. According to Transamerica, 26% of Generation Z workers have dipped into retirement funds either by withdrawing from a 401(k), IRA or a related account.", "content_hash": "60dcf67ed5a5c705eec38d65a6e58cac", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here are five red flags Hall sees most often and the practical steps to address them before it’s too late.\nAlso see how to build a realistic retirement plan when costs keep rising.\nNot Knowing the Real Cost of Retirement\nMisjudging how much money is needed to retire comfortably is a common red flag in a retirement plan. Many people set vague goals without calculating their current monthly lifestyle costs or projecting how those expenses could increase with healthcare, inflation or family commitments.\n“They throw out numbers like ‘I think a million will do it,'” Hall said. “But they have no clue what their monthly lifestyle costs now, let alone what it’ll look like when healthcare hits, inflation eats their cash flow, or travel, caregiving, or grandkids come into the picture.”\nHall said tracking actual monthly spending and adjusting for 3% to 4% inflation annually can prevent underfunding a retirement plan and help retirees plan with confidence.\nBe Aware: 6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early\nDepending on One Income Source\nDependence on a single type of account or income stream is another red flag in a retirement plan. Hall said this can result in substantial tax hits, limit flexibility and increase the risk of running out of money prematurely.\n“Massive tax hits in retirement happen when you start pulling money from all-taxed accounts with no flexibility,” he said. “That can lead to running out of money early because your plan was based on assumptions, not real numbers.”\nHall said retirees should evaluate their plans using three key benchmarks: a sustainable withdrawal rate of 4% or less, no more than 80% of savings in taxable accounts, and replacing at least 70% to 80% of current take-home income in retirement.\nMeeting these targets, Hall said, can help safeguard income and reduce the need for sudden lifestyle changes later in retirement.\nSaving in the Wrong Buckets\nConcentrating savings in pretax accounts such as 401(k)s is a red flag in a retirement plan. Without other account types, retirees may face large tax bills and reduced flexibility later.", "content_hash": "0f84950ed5fd1980240b36aa47ee554b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Many artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology companies are posting solid growth numbers, while analysts are expecting the AI tailwind to drive growth for several more years.\nHere are three companies with sustainable competitive advantages that are well-positioned to ride the AI wave in the long term.\n1. Alphabet\nTechnology giant Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) boasts strong financials and expanding AI capabilities. The company delivered impressive performance in the second quarter of 2025, with revenue growing 14% year over year to $96.4 billion, while also maintaining healthy operating margins.\nAlphabet's AI offerings are being rapidly adopted worldwide. Alphabet's Gemini chatbot notched over 450 million monthly active users while daily requests on the app also rose over 50% sequentially in the second quarter. Gemini processed over 980 trillion monthly tokens -- the basic unit for processing information as input and output -- in June 2025, which was nearly double that of the previous month.\nThe company also counts more than 2 billion monthly users of its AI Overviews search feature across more than 200 countries. This, in turn, is helping improve search engagement and query volume for the company's search business.\nGoogle Cloud is also becoming a significant growth catalyst, and reported a 32% year-over-year jump in revenue to $13.6 billion in the second quarter. Demand for the company's cloud computing infrastructure is also rising, as more than 85,000 enterprises are now building applications with cloud-native Gemini models. Google Cloud backlog was $106 billion at the end of the second quarter, indicating strong visibility into future revenue.\nAlphabet has been successfully targeting both enterprise and consumer segments with its AI-powered offerings. With capital investment estimated to be $85 billion in 2025 to meet growing demand for servers and data centers, Alphabet has demonstrated a commitment to capturing the growing AI opportunity. All these tailwinds make the company a smart buy in 2025.\n2. Microsoft\nEnterprise software giant Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) delivered a stellar financial performance in fiscal 2025 (ending June 30), with revenue rising 15% year over year to $281.7 billion and operating income increasing 17% to $128.5 billion. The company's cloud computing platform, Azure, saw revenue surge 34% to over $75 billion.\nMicrosoft has built an entire AI ecosystem to support its enterprise clients. The family of Copilot apps (AI-powered virtual assistants integrated in various products and services) had over 100 million monthly active users, both from commercial and consumer segments, at the end of fiscal 2025. Additionally, considering all AI features across its product portfolio, the user base is even larger, at around 800 million active users every month, according to the company.\nGitHub Copilot (AI-powered coding assistant) has been gaining rapid traction, with 90% of Fortune 100 companies using it, according to Microsoft. The number of GitHub Copilot enterprise customers also surged 75% quarter over quarter in the fourth quarter. This highlights the company's deep and rapid penetration in the enterprise markets.\nMicrosoft has also developed extensive infrastructure to support AI workloads. Microsoft Fabric has become the fastest-growing database product in the company's history and it says it is increasingly becoming the preferred data and analytics platform for AI workloads. Azure AI Foundry (a platform-as-a-service offering to handle development, deployment, and management of enterprise AI applications and agents at scale) also handled 500 trillion tokens in fiscal 2025. The company has added over 2 gigawatts of new data center capacity in fiscal 2025, and had over 400 data centers across 70 regions at the end of June.\nMicrosoft already boasts of $368 billion in committed future revenue and a 98% recurring revenue base.\nWith businesses accelerating adoption of AI, Microsoft's combination of AI infrastructure, GitHub's developer tools, and enterprise reach makes it an obvious long-term winner.\n3. ServiceNow\nDigital workflow automation player ServiceNow(NYSE: NOW) has positioned itself as a prominent player in the agentic AI landscape. The company delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter of 2025, with subscription revenue growing 21.5% from the year-ago period to $3.1 billion and remaining performance obligation (RPO), a measure of future contracted revenue, rising 25.5% to $23.9 billion. The company reported a robust 98% renewal rate, highlighting the stickiness of its customer base. ServiceNow also closed 89 deals exceeding $1 million in net new annual contract value (ACV), demonstrating strong enterprise demand.\nTo meet the changing needs of the AI-driven world, ServiceNow offers a complete, integrated, and enterprise-ready AI platform capable of managing, automating, and monitoring AI workflows. The platform includes AI Control Tower (a management solution to enable businesses to oversee, coordinate, and control all AI initiatives from a single hub), AI Agent Fabric (a platform to allow AI agents to work seamlessly with other third-party agents and tools), no-code AI Agent Studio (development tool to build and customize AI agents), and Agentic Workforce Management (enabling employees and AI agents to work collaboratively). By integrating technologies, data sources, and large language models (LLMs) across both on-premise and cloud infrastructure, ServiceNow's platform enables clients to manage cross-functional AI workloads.\nServiceNow's NOW Assist product suite integrates generative AI capabilities with the company's workflow automation platform. Now Assist is also seeing strong demand, as is evident from the rising number of deals and increasing usage of these solutions. The company closed 21 deals involving five or more NOW Assist solutions in the second quarter.\nConsidering the accelerating demand for its agentic AI offerings, high renewal rates, and growing adoption of NOW Assist, ServiceNow is well-positioned to become a mission-critical platform for businesses in the coming years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Success comes down to three core principles\nThe world tends to see Europe as fragmented, bureaucratic, and underfunded — a tough place to build global companies. But those very constraints are why Europe is producing some of the most resilient billion-dollar businesses today. Scarcity forces discipline. Fragmentation gives startups diverse talent. And limited funding pushes founders to act globally from day one.\nIn today’s market, where investors reward efficiency over hype and customers demand solutions that work across borders, Europe’s supposed weaknesses have become its greatest strengths. Our own $1 billion journey proves it.\nProgress beats polish every time\nIn DataSnipper’s early days, our founders didn’t have much capital, brand recognition, and certainly no fancy office. They had a few laptops, a shared workspace that doubled up as the lunchroom, and a product that barely worked. That might sound like a list of disadvantages, but I believe they’re the main reasons why the business moved fast enough to win.\nWhen you don’t have extensive resources, you must turn to being creative, resourceful, and fast. Instead of over-engineering, you test ideas quickly. Instead of waiting for the “perfect” conditions, you take action with what you have.\nFor example, they ruthlessly focused on getting our product into customers’ hands as quickly as possible. Often, far too early. This was intentional. It created a very swift feedback loop to build and improve our offering. They moved fast and iterated rapidly.\nScrappiness changes your psychology. Every obstacle becomes a puzzle to solve, not a reason to pause. They didn’t have the budget for big-ticket marketing campaigns, so they built an army of customer advocates by personally solving their problems. They didn’t have a data science team, so they taught themselves analytics at night to understand the metrics. They didn’t have a dedicated Quality Assurance department, so every single employee diligently tested features, including the founders themselves.\nThat constant bias toward progress over polish allowed us to iterate in weeks what typically took larger companies months to decide on. The lean and scrappy approach they used out of necessity became part of our DNA. Even when we could afford to spend more resources down the line, we strived to operate with the same mindset.\nUse your European location to sell globally\nUnlike U.S. startups that can grow large while staying domestic, European founders operate globally from day one. They have to and it’s an advantage.\nFrom a single HQ, we could sell across Europe’s diverse markets, hire multilingual talent, and reach customers in three continents within 24 hours. A morning call with Asia, a midday demo with Madrid, and an afternoon pitch to New York, all without leaving Amsterdam.", "content_hash": "3bf9381267208b678ac1f91bf6e55c72", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

However, inflation continues to be a worry in the wake of Donald Trump’s tariffs.\nPowell’s language was deliberately cautious. He warned policymakers will be proceeding carefully in the months ahead, and left himself plenty of wriggle room to change course if required.\nBut reading between the lines, analysts are now pretty confident that we’ll see the Fed’s base rate tumble by 25 basis points following their meeting next month — marking the first reduction in the U.S. so far this year.\nDuring his final speech as chairman in Jackson Hole, Powell made it clear that his changing outlook had nothing to do with Donald Trump, who has wanted lower interest rates for months and called for the chairman’s resignation.\nThe president’s response was blunt to say the least, quipping: “We call him ‘Too Late’ for a reason.”\nReaction to Powell’s address was immediate in the crypto markets.

Lucid will supply no fewer than 20,000 Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro's Level 4 self-driving systems to Uber for use in a new upscale robotaxi service.\nProduction of the self-driving Gravity is expected to start by the end of 2026, Lucid said. Those 20,000 vehicles (or more) are to be delivered over the following six years.\nAs part of the deal, Uber agreed to invest $300 million in Lucid. (Uber is also making a significant investment in Nuro, though the specifics haven't been released.)\nLucid's shares soared after the deal was announced. But the rally didn't last long. Where does that leave Lucid investors now?\nThe Uber deal looks great for Lucid\nThe deal looks like a good one for Lucid, for three reasons that I can see.\nFirst, selling 20,000 vehicles isn't nothing. Even though it's over six years -- and even though the clock doesn't start running until the first one ships, likely late next year -- 20,000 vehicles is a nice piece of business for a company that delivered just 10,241 vehicles in 2024.\nSecond, placing the Gravity in Uber's planned luxury robotaxi service could have other benefits.\nLucid's Gravity SUV and Air sedan are excellent electric vehicles, in some ways the best EVs yet built by anyone, with superb batteries and advanced software. The company's challenge has always been getting affluent potential customers to try them. An upscale robotaxi service will give a lot of potential customers their first tastes of Lucid's quality and technology. If it's good, sales are likely to result.\nFinally, that $300 million investment will be a welcome addition to Lucid's cash hoard, which totaled $3.6 billion (plus another roughly $1.3 billion in available credit lines) as of the end of the second quarter.\nIt seems like a good deal for Lucid, no? I certainly can't see anything in this deal to worry about. But Lucid's stock rally didn't last very long.\nWhy not? I think cash is a key part of that discussion.\nThe big concern that is holding back the stock\nThe key investor concern around Lucid always comes down to cash. Like any automaker of any size, Lucid uses a lot of cash -- but it doesn't yet generate enough cash to cover what it spends.\nThat isn't news, but here's why it has become more of a concern.\nLucid is working on a new range of models one size down from the Air and Gravity. Those \"midsize\" models, Lucid says, will be less expensive than current Lucids, making the company's technology available to a wider range of potential customers. Lucid expects to have the first of those new models in production by the end of 2026.\nThe hope is that those new models will sell well enough to carry Lucid to profitability. But developing new models requires cash -- lots of cash. Does Lucid have enough cash to get there?\nThe answer is \"Maybe.\" Lucid's largest investor by far is Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, called the Public Investment Fund, or PIF. PIF owns about 60% of Lucid, and it has very deep pockets -- but no investor, no matter how deep their pockets, will throw good money after bad indefinitely.\nIs Lucid stock a buy now?\nMy theory is that PIF will ensure that Lucid is funded at least until production of the new midsize models has scaled up -- say, by the end of 2027. If that theory holds, then Lucid's stock might be a cautious buy at current levels.\nIf you buy now, the stock is essentially a bet that Lucid's new models will be competitive and that they'll sell well enough to get the company to breakeven. That isn't a terrible bet, but it's far from a sure thing.

But there is a notable omission among recent hedging candidates: buying calls on the Cboe Volatility Index — normally a go-to for investors.\n“Vanilla puts or put spreads on the SPX may be a more reliable hedge given the current market regime,” said Tanvir Sandhu, chief global derivatives strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence. “Furthermore, the SPX skew is steep, which helps improve the cost of put spreads.”\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists pointed out last week that the US deficit and Donald Trump’s pressure on the Fed may start to depress both Treasuries and stocks, suggesting a binary trade betting on the S&P 500 falling more than 5% by year-end and the 10-year yield rising 0.2%. In Europe, digital-style put spreads on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index were relatively cheap, with one-month 5% out-of-the-money put volatility at about the 20th percentile over the past year.\nOne reason for the omission of VIX options is cost. The calls screen as expensive relative to S&P 500 puts, Bank of America Corp. strategists highlighted in a research note last week.\nThis is mostly reflective of the VIX option volatility increasing relative to that for the S&P 500, which has been weighed down by rock-bottom realized moves. The so called “vol-of-vol” looks expensive on a relative basis, which is consistent with other measures of convexity generally being rich.\n“Hedging is a balance of cost, decay, reliability and convexity,” said Sandhu. “Intense buy-the-dip remains a market feature and volatility spikes have reversed at record speed, hence VIX calls can be unreliable and tricky to monetize.”\nMoreover, the steepness in the VIX futures term structure results in higher carry costs. As futures tend to roll down the curve to converge with the spot index — rather than the spot rising to the level of the futures for an extended period — the calls become further out-the-money, losing value.\nWhy the steep curve? A frequently cited reason is the re-emergence of flows into VIX exchange-traded products, which became infamous in the “Volmageddon” episode of 2018, when short VIX ETPs attracted large investments. This caused a short squeeze in VIX futures when volatility increased, ultimately wiping out products such as the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN.\nJPMorgan strategists including Bram Kaplan noted that, conversely, recent flows have been into long funds, with more than $2.5 billion in inflows to long, levered VIX ETPs and outflows exceeding $1 billion from inverse VIX funds since April. The daily re-balance of these products results in selling of shorter-dated VIX futures to buy longer-dated contracts, further steepening the term structure.\nLeveraged VIX ETPs can exacerbate swings as they buy futures when volatility rises and sell when it declines in order to maintain the target leverage. However, VIX call buyers may be more concerned with the possible volume of futures for sale in the next stock slide as fund investors cash in winning trades.\nPotential VIX call buyers will also have the memory that the late-February selloff was characterized by low volatility, where S&P 500 puts outperformed. While those investors who bought VIX calls just before April 2 did better, the outperformance versus simple equity puts may still not be sufficient to justify a big allocation within their hedging books.\nThe biggest event before the Fed meeting in September is Nvidia earnings this week. Options are implying a 5.8% move in shares after the report, in line with the average swing following the last eight quarterly releases. One-month volatility is in the 32nd percentile over the past year, and volume has been trending lower since early 2025.\n“As of yesterday, people were not too focused on Nvidia earnings, at least in the options market,” Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said Friday. “But they should be! It’s the most important stock in the market, both by weight and by psychological impact. If they fail to ratify the AI enthusiasm that underlies so much of the current bull market, that could bring about a big change in sentiment.”", "content_hash": "41525ce1532821c4caed800a42e5b17b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

endorsed “astronomically high” targets based on sophisticated models.\nNovogratz argued he would prefer lower Bitcoin prices in a stable economy over extreme valuations driven by a currency crisis.\nSimilarly, in July, Copper’s head of research, Fadi Aboualfa, suggested Bitcoin appears “primed for another significant leg upward” but cautioned that institutional-driven markets may follow a “more tempered path” compared to previous retail-fueled cycles.\nAboualfa projected Bitcoin could breach $140,000 in September and reach $150,000 by early October.\nHowever, seeing this growing institutionally-driven bull market, Preston Pysh of Ego Death Capital has expressed skepticism about Wall Street’s growing Bitcoin influence, noting early adopters fear institutional derivatives

Shares of D-Wave Quantum are down 19% from Aug. 13 to Aug. 21 amid a broader market pullback. However, the stock has soared nearly 1,500% over the past 12 months as investors have piled into quantum computing and other emerging technologies.\nD-Wave bills itself as the world's first commercial supplier of quantum computers, and the company recently unveiled its next-generation quantum processor. Is the pullback in D-Wave Quantum a good opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this promising technology? Let's take a closer look at D-Wave Quantum and the potential of quantum computing.\nA quantum leap in computing power\nQuantum computers have the potential to process complex calculations exponentially faster than traditional computers. When Alphabet unveiled its latest quantum chip last December, it said the chip performed a benchmark quantum computing task in under five minutes. To complete the same task, one of today's fastest supercomputers would need 10 septillion years -- longer than the age of the universe.\nMany people believe that the advanced processing capabilities of quantum computing could lead to breakthroughs in areas ranging from semiconductor development and supply chain optimization to weather modeling, machine learning, and drug discovery. With public and private investment surging, and innovation progressing faster than expected, McKinsey & Company recently forecasted that the global quantum computing market could soar from $4 billion in 2024 to $72 billion in 2035.\nD-Wave's quantum computing systems use a process called quantum annealing, which leverages principles of quantum physics to efficiently identify the optimal solutions to a problem. An example of a real-world optimization problem might be determining the most efficient route for a driver to complete scheduled deliveries, or deciding whether to ship a package on Truck A or Truck B.\nIn May, D-Wave Quantum introduced its sixth-generation annealing quantum computer, the Advantage2. D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz called it \"an engineering marvel\" that's designed \"to meet industry demands for growing computational processing power while maintaining energy efficiency.\" The Advantage2 is built for real-world use cases such as process optimization, materials simulation, and artificial intelligence. A prototype of the Advantage2 has already been put through its paces by the Jülich Supercomputer Center and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, as well as a Japanese tobacco company that used quantum computing to enhance large language models in the drug-discovery process.\nD-Wave Quantum faces real-world business challenges\nFor its second quarter ending June 30, D-Wave reported revenue of $3.1 million, which was a 42% increase over the year-ago quarter. Bookings -- customer orders expected to generate future revenue -- skyrocketed 92% to $1.3 million.\nOver the past four quarters, D-Wave has had more than 100 revenue-generating customers, according to CFO John Markovich. However, the sharp uptick in bookings has been a double-edged sword. While the average transaction size is trending higher, deals are taking longer to close. This is because many potential customers are requesting proof of concepts rather than simply purchasing quantum computing services. Additionally, dealing with larger organizations can involve navigating multifaceted and often rigid procurement processes and documentation requirements.\nAnother common challenge for a development-stage company like D-Wave Quantum is profitability. D-Wave reported a second-quarter net loss of $167.3 million, compared to a net loss of $17.8 million in the year-ago period. Operating expenses increased 41%, and the company took a $142 million non-cash hit from a recalculation of its warranty liability and realized losses from warrant exercises. Excluding the non-cash charges related to warrants, D-Wave had a second-quarter net loss of $25.3 million, which was $5.3 million larger than the net loss in the year-ago quarter.\nAlthough D-Wave isn't profitable, the balance sheet is in good shape. D-Wave ended the second quarter with $819 million in cash, a record high for the company, and $149.3 million in liabilities. During the quarter, D-Wave raised $400 million by selling at-the-money (ATM) shares, $99.3 million from exercised warrants, and $38 million from an equity line of credit.\nManagement made it clear that the cash will be used to accelerate D-Wave's growth. That likely will involve a merger or acquisition if the right opportunity comes along. D-Wave also plans to ramp up investment in research and development, manufacturing operations, and sales and marketing, which will increase quarterly operating expenditures by an estimated 15%. While D-Wave aspires to be the first independent, publicly held quantum computing company to generate profits consistently, it probably won't be anytime soon.\nIs D-Wave Quantum a buy?\nOn a trailing-12-month basis, D-Wave Quantum stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 173, as of Aug. 20. That's steep compared to the likes of Alphabet and IBM, although it's more in line with other pure-play quantum computing companies. Still, it's trading at a premium valuation.\nThe average analyst estimate for D-Wave's 2025 revenue is $24.6 million, which would be nearly 180% higher than 2024. If D-Wave can sustain that kind of explosive growth, it would help justify its lofty valuation.\nEven so, if you're thinking of buying shares, consider it a speculative investment and expect plenty of volatility in the near term. Until there's a clearer path to profitability and mainstream commercialization, the safer move would be to keep an eye on D-Wave Quantum in a watch list of emerging tech stocks for now.\nShould you buy stock in D-Wave Quantum right now?\nBefore you buy stock in D-Wave Quantum, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and D-Wave Quantum wasn’t one of them.

Higher-than-expected inflation and recent reports from major U.S. retailers suggesting that inflationary pressures could be poised to worsen in the near term have also weighed on the token's valuation.\nWhile XRP is still up 39% across 2025's trading, it's also down 20% from its high.

A decision on the application for the Grayscale XRP trust is now expected to arrive Oct. 18, and one on the 21Shares Core XRP Trust is expected by Oct. 19.\nWhile the SEC's recent decision to postpone how it will respond to applications for these ETFs has seemingly added to uncertainty surrounding whether the cryptocurrency will become part of publicly traded funds listed on major exchanges, there are good reasons to think that the token will receive approval for fund inclusion. Current SEC chairman Paul Atkins' support for the crypto industry and general advocacy for a more lax regulatory approach to the space is one of the key points where he differed from previous chairman Gary Gensler.\nAlong with executive orders on the crypto industry and other moves from the Trump administration to support the adoption of cryptocurrencies, signs of policy shifts at the SEC support the thesis that the regulatory agency will approve XRP's inclusion in ETFs. While higher-than-expected inflation and a slower path to interest rate cuts could introduce bearish pressures for the token, political and regulatory catalysts suggest paths to more gains this year.\nShould you invest $1,000 in XRP right now?\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:", "content_hash": "f7534caee379178c246767eb2a9b1216", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Some decrease their payouts, or suspend them altogether, when they face headwinds. Others have much stronger businesses and continue to raise their dividends even as they face obstacles. Income seekers want to stay away from the former and invest in the latter. One imperfect way to determine which is which is to look at their track records.\nOf course, the past doesn't guarantee anything, but companies with a long history of raising their dividends often have what it takes to continue down that path. Let's consider two dividend stocks that have impeccable credentials in that department and are still worth investing in today: Medtronic(NYSE: MDT) and Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ).\n1. Medtronic\nMedtronic, a leading medical device company, may face headwinds due to the impact of tariffs on its financial results. However, the stock has performed well this year. Its most recent financial results came in ahead of analyst estimates, and the company even increased its earnings guidance for its ongoing fiscal year 2026, which started on April 26.\nAlthough Medtronic has encountered some issues in recent years, the healthcare giant has taken steps to rectify the situation. One of its focuses is improving profitability. Medtronic has explored spinning out some of its divisions before. It finally settled on diabetes care, its only consumer-facing business, and one that generates lower margins than the rest of its operations. The initiative should help the company boost the bottom line somewhat.\nMeanwhile, Medtronic's underlying business remains strong. The company is one of the world's largest medical device manufacturers, with operations spanning multiple therapeutic areas. It continually develops and markets new products, resulting in consistent revenue and earnings growth.\nOne important approval it should soon earn is for its robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) device, the Hugo system; that should have a meaningful impact on its financial results, given the significant white space available in surgical robotics. Furthermore, the sustained higher demand for medical procedures should be a powerful tailwind for the company, as many of its product sales are tied to procedure volume.\nMedtronic has increased its dividends for 48 consecutive years, a streak that points to a company capable of weathering any storm. The stock's current forward yield of 3.1% looks attractive compared to the S&P 500's average of 1.3%. This is a top dividend stock investors can double down on today.\n2. Johnson & Johnson\nJohnson & Johnson is also facing issues, including tariff-related ones, and generic competition for its immunology medicine Stelara. Still, the pharmaceutical giant is performing well. Its second-quarter results were strong, and it also increased its guidance for the fiscal year 2025.\nJ&J's pharmaceutical segment is well-diversified, with products in immunology, oncology, neuroscience, infectious diseases, and more. Thanks to robust research and development (R&D) spending and significant experience in the field, the company consistently launches new products that help mitigate losses from those that fall out of patent protection. It's done the same in recent years, which is why, despite Stelara's recent challenges, the top line continues to move in the right direction. That's a great sign for investors.\nJohnson & Johnson's medical device segment also adds to its diversification. The company is looking to dip its toes in the RAS market with its Ottava system, which is still undergoing clinical trials in the U.S. The Ottava could be a critical addition to the company's arsenal.\nIt's true that J&J has recently faced legal and regulatory challenges, including lawsuits and government-imposed price negotiations. While these are worth monitoring, it's important to remember that Johnson & Johnson is a Dividend King, with 62 consecutive years of dividend increases. The company has been through a great many things over that time frame, including the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, which completely transformed the U.S. healthcare sector.\nJohnson & Johnson has survived -- and thrived -- over the long run despite similar challenges in the past, and the company remains more than capable of fulfilling its financial obligations. That's why it has a higher credit rating than the U.S. government. Despite recent headwinds, Johnson & Johnson remains a top income stock worth investing in for the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Medtronic wasn’t one of them.

The company just spent $200 million to acquire Rail, a stablecoin payment company. So, what will Ripple's new strategy do for XRP itself? Will it finally be what sends the token price above $4, or will it undermine the central use case that drives much of XRP's value in the first place?\nThe main case for XRP\nTraditional banking can be slow and costly, especially when sending and receiving money across borders. Payments can take days or even weeks to clear, and multiple intermediaries are involved, leading to high fees.\nRipple created XRP to solve these inefficiencies and make bank-to-bank transactions -- especially those across borders and into different currencies -- faster, cheaper, and easier. From the beginning, the investment case for XRP has always been that more banks will adopt Ripple's technology. Demand for XRP will rise, and its price will follow.\nThe reality, however, is a bit more complicated, and it's critical for XRP investors to understand.\nAdoption of the technology doesn't necessarily mean adoption of XRP\nRipple offers two main products: RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). RippleNet allows banks to make use of the blockchain without ever needing to deal with XRP itself. For the most part, the adoption of RippleNet doesn't meaningfully affect the price of XRP.\nODL, on the other hand, does require XRP to be used as a \"bridge asset.\" It works something like this: A bank in the U.S. buys XRP, sends it to France, and the XRP is converted into euros on the other end. ODL is great for banks and financial institutions that have liquidity constraints because it replaces the traditional need for a pre-funded account in the destination currency with transparent XRP conversions.\nIn theory, the increased adoption of ODL should be a major tailwind for XRP demand, and to some degree it has been. But here's the thing: Most large banks and payment processors don't have liquidity issues. The complication and risk of holding XRP, even temporarily, outweighs any gains in efficiency or lower capital requirements. Financial institutions don't really love holding an asset that can drop in price by 20% in a day.", "content_hash": "0a53cd2711f9ac3993c7e13f83635076", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) boom gives you a dopamine rush from market darlings like Nvidia and Microsoft. The recent financial results are gorgeous, the AI growth narratives are grand, and the valuation multiples are...aspirational. Microsoft stock trades at 52 times free cash flow, and Nvidia's reading on the same ratio is 58. Their price-to-sales valuations are double-digit figures.\nBut if you want AI exposure that won't have you checking stock futures at 3 a.m., you should consider something deeply unfashionable instead. I'm talking about IBM(NYSE: IBM).\nYes, the Big Blue IBM. The one your grandparents think still sells mainframes and punch cards. Under the hood, it's now a hybrid-cloud-and-software company with an enterprise-AI services segment that gets paid to make other people's AI actually work. Sure, IBM still sells mainframes, but even these heavy-duty data crunchers come with integrated AI systems nowadays.\nIn the long run, for all the romance with shiny new things and high-octane growth stories, the stock market tends to reward cash flow that shows up on time. And in the rapidly evolving AI market, IBM is a cash flow machine.\nThe calmer way to play AI\nLet's run a few more numbers. As of Aug. 22, IBM's beta value stands at 0.70. That means IBM typically moves roughly two-thirds as much as the market, directionally.\nIt's a pretty calm investment. A low beta is not a bug -- it's a feature. You're trading some upside optionality for a smoother ride with fewer sudden price drops.\nValuation is the second sanity check. IBM's shares trade at 18 times free cash flow and 3.5 times trailing sales. In AI land, that's pretty austere. These modest valuation ratios suggest you're paying a fair, not fanciful, price for IBM's proven cash generation.\nMeanwhile, the dividend yield is 2.8%. That's actually on the low side for IBM, whose yield averaged 4.3% over the last five years. At the same time, it's far above the S&P 500 index's average yield of 1.2% and light-years ahead of Microsoft or Nvidia -- their yields stop at 0.7% and 0.02%, respectively.\nNot a rocket ship, but a cash machine\n\"But growth!\" you say. \"IBM's slow-burning cash generation is boring!\"\nRight -- Big Blue isn't a hypergrowth story. Trailing sales are up by 7.3% over the last three years -- in total, not per year. IBM can't keep up with Microsoft's 42% revenue growth over the period, not to mention Nvidia's booming 399% top-line increase.\nThe counterpoint is cash profit. IBM's free cash flow surged 55% higher in this three-year period, driven by a great long-term strategy. Red Hat is the hybrid-cloud foundation on which IBM's cloud-centered AI strategy is constructed. Software subscriptions sit on top of that robust base, and consulting services glue the whole plan together. IBM lives in the boring but profitable pick-and-shovel part of the AI build-out.\nWatsonX adoption is picking up the pace\nIBM's customers have been testing its WatsonX AI services for a couple of years now, preparing to install enterprise-friendly AI services for the long haul. These pre-adoption tests are converting into solid long-term contracts nowadays.\nYou can see this trend in IBM's financial reports, and investors are taking notice. That's why the dividend yield is so low: IBM's stock has gained 22% in the last year, or 25% if you account for dividends with the total-return metric.\nIf you want a near-term trading angle, the ticker tape has actually done you a favor recently. IBM is down by high single digits over the past month and past quarter, nearly 19% below its 52-week high. That's not a full-on retreat, but it is a better entry point than chasing the lofty valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft.\nRisks? Sure. IBM's debt leverage is substantial. And if the market decides that every AI-adjacent stock must be priced like an accelerator chip monopoly, IBM won't excite anybody.\nBut suppose the valuation multiples of highfliers continue to compress, as they have been doing in recent quarters. In that case, investors tend to rediscover IBM-like stocks with strong cash flows, rich dividends, and low beta values. This cash machine makes risk-weary investors feel safe, the way people rediscover umbrellas in the rain.\nIBM belongs in a balanced AI portfolio\nI'm not telling you to sell Nvidia or Microsoft. They are great companies with tremendous business growth, and they might even deserve their trillion-dollar valuations in the long run. I'm just suggesting solid portfolio construction over exciting narratives. Keep your rocket stocks; add a reliable ballast.\nIBM gives you sticky enterprise AI exposure with a lower-volatility profile, a reasonable multiple, and generous cash returns while you wait.\nShould you buy stock in International Business Machines right now?\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and International Business Machines wasn’t one of them.

The company's shares are down 18% over the trailing-12-month period due to a combination of headwinds.\nWhile that's not the best news for current shareholders, it may be great for those considering buying the stock. If the biotech can recover and get back to its market-beating ways, now might be a great time to initiate a position. Let's figure out whether Vertex still has what it takes.\nWhat's gone wrong?\nVertex Pharmaceuticals faced several clinical setbacks over the past year. First, its drug suzetrigine (now marketed under the brand Journavx) disappointed in a phase 2 clinical trial for painful lumbosacral radiculopathy. While Vertex initially said it would explore ways to advance the medicine to phase 3 studies in this indication anyway, it eventually abandoned that project.\nSecond, the company's candidate VX-993 also failed in phase 2 studies as an investigational monotherapy for acute pain.\nThird, Vertex abandoned one of its candidates for type 1 diabetes (T1D), VX-264, after another failure in early-stage trials.\nIn addition to these unfavorable developments from the clinic, financial results in the first quarter were not as strong as expected. This was partly due to illegal knockoffs of some of the company's medicines in Russia, which resulted in a loss of market share. For all these reasons, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has experienced several significant one-day price drops over the trailing-12-month period.\nWhy the stock is still attractive\nDespite all the noise, Vertex's financial results remain strong. In the second quarter, revenue increased by 12% year over year to $2.96 billion. Net income was $1 billion, versus a net loss of $3.6 billion in the second quarter of 2024 (although that loss was a one-off due to expenses related to an acquisition).\nVertex Pharmaceuticals' newest launches include Alyftrek, in its core therapeutic area of cystic fibrosis (CF); Journavx, in the treatment of acute pain; and Casgevy, which treats two rare blood disorders.\nAlyftrek, which earned approval in December, is already making meaningful contributions. It racked up $156.8 million in revenue during the quarter. It should maintain a solid upward trajectory for a long time, as Vertex Pharmaceuticals makes headway within the remainder of its CF addressable market.\nJournavx should also see significant traction in the coming quarters. It became the first oral non-opioid pain signal inhibitor approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the U.S., more than 150 million patients are already covered for reimbursement for the medicine.\nCasgevy is a different story. It's a gene-editing therapy that's complex to administer, so since its approval in 2023, it's generated little in sales for Vertex Pharmaceuticals. However, even this product boasts significant potential, being a one-time cure for diseases for which there are very few safe treatment options.\nRevenue and earnings should continue moving in the right direction in the next five years. But what about Vertex's clinical setbacks? Every biotech company experiences some. It's part of the process.\nDeveloping novel medicines is inherently risky and expensive. But even in that department, Vertex should make progress. It's testing suzetrigine in phase 3 studies for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, while also conducting a phase 2 trial for VX-993 in that indication. And the late-stage pipeline features another medicine for T1D, zimislecel. Based on strong data from ongoing studies, the biotech plans 2026 regulatory submissions.\nIt has other promising compounds in phase 3 studies, including inaxaplin in APOL-1-mediated kidney disease and povetacicept in IgA nephropathy. There's a good chance that in the next five years, Vertex Pharmaceuticals will add two brand-new medicines to its lineup, while gaining an additional indication for Journavx, which could become a blockbuster.\nIn the meantime, early-stage programs for pain, CF, and other diseases should also make progress. In short, with a robust pipeline and its lineup still driving top-line growth, Vertex Pharmaceuticals' shares remain attractive, despite its underperformance over the past year. Now is a great time to buy the stock.\nShould you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

If you want exposure without betting on cyclical chip sales or a moonshot app, two established platforms stand out: Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG).\nBoth are converting AI interest into real revenue and profit across huge, diversified businesses. Their combination of scale, product breadth, and improving economics makes them straightforward buys for long-term investors looking for exposure to AI.\nHere's why investors seeking to own companies benefiting from AI should consider these two technology giants before venturing into riskier upstarts.\nMicrosoft: AI is helping fuel broad-based momentum\nMicrosoft's most recent quarter showed exactly what investors should want to see: broad growth with AI as a key tailwind. The software and cloud computing giant's revenue rose 18% to $76.4 billion, operating income jumped 23% to $34.3 billion, and revenue from Microsoft's cloud-based products and services reached $46.7 billion, up 27% year over year.\nThe company's \"Azure and other cloud services\" segment was a key driver of its momentum in cloud. Revenue grew an exceptional 39%, a clear signal that AI workloads are expanding Azure's addressable market and deepening customer commitments.\nScale matters, and Microsoft has it. Management said Azure surpassed a $75 billion annual revenue run-rate in fiscal 2025, up 34%, reflecting growth across all workloads. That's a powerful base on which the company is layering premium AI services, from model training to Copilot.\nBut there's an important nuance when it comes to the software giant's profitability during this AI growth phase. Cloud margins are digesting the surge in AI infrastructure spending. The gross margin for Microsoft's cloud products and services narrowed by one percentage point year over year to 69% as the company scaled up data centers and networking for AI. Yet management also noted efficiency gains in Azure, which should help margins recover as utilization rises and pricing reflects the value of AI features. In other words, near-term pressure is a rational investment for long-term unit economics.\nEven more important, however, is the fact that the company's overall cloud gross margin remains higher than its corporate gross margin. The segment's rapid growth, therefore, is leading to strong overall profit increases.\nThis is the core Microsoft bull case in AI: a flywheel that starts with Azure infrastructure; pulls in data, security, and developer services, and then monetizes users directly through Microsoft 365 and Copilot. With double-digit top-line growth, discipline on costs, and a balance sheet designed to fund years of capital expenditures (capex), the set-up looks favorable.\nAlphabet: AI is boosting Search, YouTube, and the cloud\nAlphabet's latest results underscore how AI can lift multiple profit centers at once. The Google parent's second-quarter revenue grew 14% to $96.4 billion, with double-digit gains in Search, YouTube ads, and subscriptions, plus 32% growth in Google Cloud to $13.6 billion. Operating margin landed at 32.4%.\nLike Microsoft, growth in the cloud is accompanied by big spending to support opportunities related to AI. Management highlighted that Google Cloud's annual revenue run-rate now exceeds $50 billion, and that capex will be about $85 billion in 2025 to meet AI infrastructure demand. Big numbers, yes. But they're paired with improving cloud profitability and a business mix that throws off substantial cash to fund it.\nAI is also enhancing Alphabet's core products. Google continues to roll out AI Overviews and AI Mode in search, pushing more-helpful, context-rich results while preserving the ad flywheel that funds the ecosystem. Meanwhile, YouTube continues to benefit from better tools for creators and advertisers, aided by AI.\nThe general thesis is the same as Microsoft's: Use scale and distribution to ship AI features quickly, then monetize across a vast installed base.\nWhat about valuation risk? With Microsoft trading at 37 times earnings and Alphabet trading at 21 times earnings, neither stock is cheap. The difference compared to many smaller AI upstarts is durability. These aren't point solutions; they're platforms with multiple ways to win: cloud infrastructure, productivity software, developer tools, search, video, and subscriptions. With revenue and operating income growing by double digits and AI workloads compounding inside already sticky ecosystems, the long-term math still works.\nFor investors who want AI exposure with less risk, these two stocks remain easy buys. You get the training and inferencing demand, the application-layer monetization, and the balance sheets to fund the next wave -- all without needing to predict the winning model or the next breakout app. That's the definition of a no-brainer in an uncertain technology cycle.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Another 19% plan to add AI for conducting interviews this year.\n“The technology has caught on so quickly that many people aren’t ready for it,” Jim Chaffee, an AI expert at the University of Iowa, told Yahoo Finance.\n“Using AI early in the process to screen out candidates is a useful and time-saving tool for employers,” he said, “but chatbots are not properly equipped to get more in-depth with a candidate, at which point human participation is vital.”\nCompanies hiring right now are inundated with job seekers, which has escalated the use of AI interview assistants in recent months, Chaffee said.\nThe number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits rose by the most in roughly three months last week, and unemployment claims have reached the highest level in nearly four years, according to data from the US Department of Labor.\nRead more: What are jobless claims, and why do they matter?\nMoreover, last month, there were 62,075 job cuts, up 29% from June, according to a recent report by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That amps up the 2025 total to 806,383 layoffs, the highest January-to-July figure since the pandemic shutdowns of 2020.\nDig deeper: Jobs, inflation, and the fed: How they're all related\n“The applicant count that we're receiving every day is astronomical,” said Devin Jones, a senior associate at ROCS Grad Staffing in Washington, D.C. “We have hundreds and hundreds of resumes and applications to go through, and for every single interview that we complete, we’re using an AI tool.\nAI-led interviews are especially common with roles that require hard skills or technical requirements — accounting, data entry, and administrative positions, Jones said.\nIn reality, AI has been part of the job hunting process for years now. Nonetheless, job seekers are not happy about it. Only a quarter of job candidates trust AI will fairly evaluate them, according to recent research by Gartner, Inc. More than 6 in 10 candidates said they are more likely to apply to a position if the organization requires in-person interviews.\nIn AI-assisted interviews, applicants log on to a hiring platform like Ribbon AI, where they provide videotaped responses to questions that either pop up on the screen or are verbally asked by an avatar. The sessions are typically under 30 minutes, but can stretch to an hour, Jones said.\nThe AI algorithms scan the video responses, looking for facial expressions, keyword usage and tone of voice. A transcript of the interview is then sent to a hiring manager or recruiter along with the bot's take on the candidate’s performance.\nI talked to several career strategists about the advice they’re giving their clients and have included my own expert tips. Here’s what you need to know:\nYour AI interviewer is looking for the same kinds of things that a human would look for, Chaffee said.\n“Job seekers should approach every interview the same way, whether having a human or an AI conversation,” said Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at career platform Handshake. “This is critical because if you are qualified to move to the next round of interviews, chances are highly likely that a person will be reviewing your responses.”\n“Introduce yourself and smile,” Jones said. “This is your audition tape.”\nCandidates get nervous and clam up when there isn’t a person to talk to, she said. Turn the lights on so your face is brightly shown in soft light and your expressions and nonverbal cues are clear. Speak clearly and let your personality come through.\n“It's 10 times harder to let that shine through when you feel like you're talking to yourself,” Jones added.\nIt really is more like acting than interviewing, so practice. If possible, practice with a friend or family member on the platform you’ll be using or something similar. With Zoom, for example, you can record it to review. This also helps with figuring out how loud to talk and how to position the screen and camera lens.\nWatch and critique your recorded responses to improve your delivery. Keep your shoulders back and your hands quiet.\nWorkplace etiquette applies to all interview experiences, whether online or in-person, Cruzvergara said. “If you’re interviewing via video, keep your attire professional and your interview environment clear of distractions — no pets on the video.\"\nYou’ll need a reliable internet connection, a webcam, and a microphone. Most computers and laptops have these built in.\nPosition your computer screen so you’re in the middle (horizontally) and the top of your head is near the top of the computer screen. You should be looking up slightly at the camera, a position that helps define your chin and subtly conveys a message of strength and confidence.\nChatbots are always on and always looking at you, so focus on speech clarity, facial expressions, body language, and eye contact because it will note these things in its report, Chaffee said. Try your best to look into the camera when talking. This can take discipline when you aren’t talking directly to another person.\nThese explore how you’ve handled work situations in the past. “Having examples ready will keep you from pausing too long, which sometimes triggers an AI to think you’re done answering the question,” Cruzvergara said.\nSome bots are programmed to answer basic questions about the job or the employer, so go ahead and ask if it’s so equipped.\n“Think of an AI interview not as a traditional conversation, but as a chance to do in-depth fact finding,” said Maggie Mistal, a career consultant and executive coach. “Unlike an interview with a person, you won't be building rapport or camaraderie, but you can get solid information about the role, the company, and the skill sets they are searching to hire.”\nSome of Mistal’s suggestions to ask the bot:\n-\nFor people hired at my level, what's their general career path for promotion?\n-\nHow many years do employees typically stay at the firm?\n-\nIs this department a growing part of the company?\n-\nWhich skill sets or experiences are particularly important for success in this job?\n“Be factual in your responses to questions,” Mistal said. “Share specific details and add numbers where you can. For instance, don't say, ‘I worked in sales and had success.’ Rather, say, ‘I closed a million dollars in sales, landed a large new customer, and was recognized for top performance by leadership with a bonus.’\"\nSticky notes on your computer screen can prompt you with talking points to emphasize about your experience, why you’re a good fit for the job, and what questions to ask about the firm.\nHave a question about retirement?

I look forward to hearing from you.” Smile, and continue eyeing the camera until the interview disconnects.\nThen send a thoughtfully worded thank-you note to the hiring manager or recruiter who set it up.\n“We receive the exact notes from thousands of candidates,” Jones said. “They're all identical, carbon copies.

After plunging in May, imports surged to an early peak when the president paused the 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Now, companies appear to be trying to avoid another inventory hangover as questions persist about the health of the consumer. What does this mean for transportation markets for the rest of the year?\nShifts in sourcing\nUpstream, one of the biggest shifts has been the continued pullback from China. Import bookings from China to the U.S. are down 25% year-over-year, while Vietnam is one of the few countries showing annual growth as of last week.\nChina has offset much of the decline, however, as total export bookings remain nearly flat compared to 2024, according to SONAR data. The takeaway is that global trade flows are rapidly adjusting to Trump’s ongoing negotiations, forcing carriers to rebalance trade lanes. This could eventually affect service levels as schedules shift and blank sailings increase.\nLagging impact on domestic markets\nThe slowdown in imports has not yet fully reached the domestic market, since bookings data represents containers still two to four weeks away from arriving at U.S. ports. For example, shipments from China to Los Angeles currently take about 16–17 days, based on published transit times.\nIntermodal demand remains the most directly tied to containerized imports. Shippers have leaned more on rail over the past year as longer lead times and pre-emptive ordering provide extra flexibility. With warehousing costs rising quickly, many shippers are using containers as “moving storage” to offset inventory holding costs.\nLoaded container volumes—both domestic and international—are currently in line with last year, while truckload tender volumes are down about 15%. If import volumes continue to erode, intermodal demand, especially for international containers, could weaken further in the months ahead. The truckload market has been less affected, as shippers have relied more on shorter hauls where rail offers limited cost savings or utility.\nInventory strategies in flux\nSupply chains remain reactive, balancing upstream procurement with uncertain downstream demand. The result has been a hybrid strategy: maintaining a small buffer of inventory while avoiding the kind of glut seen in early 2022.\nThe Logistics Managers’ Index (LMI) shows inventory levels expanding more quickly this year compared to the first seven months of 2024. Some of this growth is defensive ordering, but some likely reflects weaker demand. Import bookings data reinforces the idea that companies are facing softer demand overall.", "content_hash": "6e851c67535674275ecdff2649c20250", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Another electric vehicle (EV) stock, Tesla, has been aggressively ramping up its robotaxi efforts this year. Some experts believe this could eventually be a $10 trillion opportunity. So when Uber and Lucid partnered to launch their own robotaxi businesses, Lucid stock soared by more than 40% on the news.\nWhile autonomous driving is an exciting pillar of growth, there's actually another growth catalyst that will matter even more in the near future. In fact, this catalyst could help Lucid grow sales by more than 400% over the next five years alone.\nTesla has already shown Lucid Group how to grow rapidly\nWhen it comes to scaling a $1 trillion electric vehicle business, Tesla has already shown the way. In fact, CEO Elon Musk detailed his master plan for growth all the way back in 2006 when he wrote up his strategy for the coming years. First, he wanted to build a sports car. That goal was achieved with the Roadster, a powerful but very expensive initial use case. From that, Musk wrote that he would use the money from that car's sales \"to build an affordable car.\" This was achieved with the launch of the Model X and Model S. Those two, however, were still often priced above $100,000.\nThis brings us to Musk's final step in his master plan for growth: Use the money earned from Model X and Model S sales \"to build an even more affordable car.\" This was first achieved in 2016 with the unveiling of the Model 3, and then again in 2019 when the Model Y was revealed. Both models had options that cost under $50,000. Crossing this threshold finally made Teslas affordable to tens of millions of new buyers.\nWhat happened after Tesla launched its two most affordable models? In the years that followed, sales doubled and then tripled. Today, the Model 3 and Model Y alone account for more than 90% of Tesla's car sales. If an EV maker wants to grow rapidly, it must deliver affordable mass-market vehicles. This is exactly what Lucid Group plans to do starting in 2026, when management expects to begin launching three new mass-market vehicles. If Tesla's history is any indication, sales could double and then triple over the next five years. That could create more than 500% in potential sales upside.\nIs it time to load up on LCID stock?\nThere are some very important caveats to this story, even if the growth potential is clearly laid out.\nFirst, there haven't been any significant updates on Lucid's mass market vehicle program since last year when CEO Peter Rawlinson announced a \"new high-volume mid-size electric SUV with a starting price around $48,000,\" during a conference call. But Rawlinson isn't even the CEO anymore. He departed the company earlier this year. And while the Uber deal brought fresh cash and enthusiasm, Lucid is still losing money every quarter, bringing into question the massive capital investment it would take to get new models on the road.\nSecond, these types of projects almost always face delays. Tesla has been notorious for overpromising on delivery timelines. But it's not just because its CEO is too optimistic. Bringing new vehicles to market takes a ton of money and new infrastructure. If Lucid grows sales by 500% over the next five years, it will be because it manages to stay surprisingly on schedule for production and delivery.\nFinally, there is no guarantee that the market will love new Lucid models as much as it loved Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y. At the time, Tesla faced far less competition in the EV space, and it also enjoyed greater name recognition. But with a market cap of just $6.4 billion, the bull case for Lucid remains clear. Sales could grow immensely over the next five years if it can manage to launch and scale its affordable models similar to what Tesla achieved.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lucid Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lucid Group wasn’t one of them.

Even if that may not be enough to retire comfortably in every area of the country, it could give you plenty of options to consider. You could withdraw some of the money or perhaps choose dividend-generating investments that give you some recurring income without having to deplete your nest egg.\nTo get to $1 million, a good strategy is to invest in quality growth stocks, since they can increase the chances that you'll be able to achieve market-beating returns in the long run.\nBelow, I'll show you how much you would need to invest in the Invesco QQQ Trust(NASDAQ: QQQ) today, based on various ages, to be on track to reach at least $1 million by the time you retire. This exchange-traded fund invests in 100 large nonfinancial companies.\nWhy the QQQ ETF is ideal for long-term investors\nIf you're investing for the long haul (e.g., at least 10-plus years), then you'll probably want to consider prioritizing growth stocks for your portfolio. That's because while growth stocks can be volatile in any given year, over a long time frame they generally do well and can outperform the S&P 500, a leading index of how the overall market is doing.\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust can be ideal for this purpose. It doesn't track the S&P 500 but instead mirrors the Nasdaq-100, which is a collection of the top 100 nonfinancial stocks on the Nasdaq Stock Market. It is a more selective and exclusive club than the S&P 500.\nIn the past 10 years, the Invesco QQQ Trust has generated total returns (which include dividends) of 460%, versus 266% for the S&P 500. That means the Invesco Trust has averaged an annual return of nearly 19% over that stretch, while the S&P 500 has grown by close to 14% per year.\nHow much would you need to invest in the Invesco QQQ Trust to help ensure you're on track to retire with $1 million?\nThe market has been red hot in recent years, and the danger for investors is to assume that it will continue to be hot. Realistically, there may be more-tepid growth in upcoming years. Setting expectations too high may lead to disappointment later on.\nA more conservative approach could be to assume that the Invesco fund slows down and perhaps falls in line with the S&P 500 average annual return of around 10%, or perhaps even lower than that. Stock returns are never guaranteed. With tariffs potentially affecting companies and the economy being far from ideal, businesses may experience a slowdown in the near future.\nHowever, assuming annul growth rates of between 8% and 11% -- which, again, are not guaranteed -- here is how much you would need to have invested today, in a fund such as the QQQ ETF, to be on track to retire with $1 million or more (assuming you retire at age 65).\nCalculations by author.\nWhat you can do if you're not on track\nThe above numbers can seem intimidating and it may not be likely for the vast majority of people to have such large sums of money available to invest right now. But the table can help serve as a guide. It also underscores the importance of investing on an ongoing basis, to add to your balance over time, for it to become as large as possible. Knowing whether you're on track can at least allow you to set realistic expectations and possibly adapt, by either trying to save and invest more money, or planning to retire a bit later, to allow for more growth.\nIn the end, a lot is going to depend on the growth rate you end up averaging over the long run. There's no guarantee what it might be, but by targeting growth stocks with the Invesco QQQ Trust and similar types of ETFs, you can make the most of the money you invest in the stock market.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Invesco QQQ Trust right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn’t one of them.

According to reports, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) had the chance to acquire Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) roughly a decade ago -- but the deal never materialized.\nIn the years since, Tesla has cemented itself as a global leader in electric vehicles (EV), while Apple has remained a dominant force in consumer electronics. Yet despite their respective clout, both companies share a surprising weakness: Unlike Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms, neither Apple nor Tesla has built a truly scaled artificial intelligence (AI) business.\nApple's foray into the AI arena has been relatively muted, relying on incremental iPhone upgrades rather than a bold, stand-alone AI platform -- a departure from its decorated history of innovation. Tesla, on the other hand, has ambitious plans for its humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, and its robotaxi network, but these initiatives remain unproven at scale.\nThis is what makes the prospects of a strategic partnership between Apple and Tesla so intriguing right now. Each could help cover the other's blind spots, and in doing so, build the foundation of scaled AI platforms that their rivals already enjoy.\nWhy Apple needs Tesla\nApple's legacy has always been rooted in consumer devices, pioneering category-defining products such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad. For years, the company was seen as the undisputed master of uncovering latent needs and turning them into must-have innovations.\nIn recent years, however, Apple's push into advanced hardware has struggled to live up to the company's historic track record.\nLast year, the company scrapped its car initiative, Project Titan, after years of research and development. The ambitious project ended without a formal product launch -- leaving Apple with no presence in the automotive market despite years of speculation.\nMore recently, Apple unveiled its Vision Pro headset, a foray into augmented and virtual reality. The device has widely been viewed as a disappointment -- a high-end luxury gadget rather than a mass-market breakthrough, limiting its adoption among everyday consumers.\nNow, as rumors swirl around a Siri-powered robot in Apple's pipeline, management faces a critical decision: pursue yet another hardware moonshot from scratch and risk billions in capital expenditures (capex), or align with a partner that's already in production.\nIn my view, Apple doesn't need to reinvent the wheel by sinking more time and money into developing products that may never launch. Instead, Apple could thrive by positioning itself as the software and services layer powering intelligent hardware that already exists in the market.\nBy joining forces with Tesla, Apple could leverage the company's expertise in autonomous driving systems and robotics while integrating its own AI-powered software ecosystem and consumer marketing prowess.\nSuch a collaboration could allow Apple to leapfrog into both consumer and enterprise adoption of smart devices -- staking a claim in the robotics and autonomous era of AI, without repeating costly mistakes of the past.\nWhy Tesla needs Apple\nTesla's robotaxi and Optimus both carry transformative potential. But bringing these projects to life requires massive investments in compute power and AI infrastructure.\nWhile Tesla's balance sheet boasts a healthy cash cushion, it's worth noting that, like Apple, the company has also made some controversial capital allocation decisions in recent years.\nCase in point: Tesla recently scaled back its in-house Dojo AI supercomputer project, opting instead to revert to proven infrastructure from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Similar to Apple's Project Titan, the recent moves around Dojo underscore how costly and uncertain it can be to build proprietary systems at scale.\nThis is where a joint venture with Apple could reshape Tesla's financial trajectory. Apple sits on more than $132 billion in cash, equivalents, and marketable securities, and it commands unmatched global distribution channels. By partnering with Apple, Tesla could accelerate the commercialization of Optimus and robotaxi without overplaying its hand financially.\nMoreover, Apple's unparalleled brand equity could help transform Tesla's AI-driven machines from prototype concepts into mainstream products -- bridging the gap between Musk's futuristic vision and tangible household and enterprise adoption.\nA second chance that no one sees coming\nApple's decision not to acquire Tesla is often portrayed as a missed opportunity. But having spent a decade working in mergers and acquisitions as an investment banking analyst, I can say with confidence that deals rarely unfold as neatly as the financial models suggest. In many cases, strategic partnerships can unlock far greater, more accretive opportunities than an outright acquisition.\nAs the last of big tech to scale an AI business, both Apple and Tesla now sit at a pivotal crossroad. A collaboration between the two would represent a rare second chance for trillion-dollar innovators to join forces and reshape the future of the technology landscape.\nBy combining Apple's ecosystem with Tesla's progress in robotics and autonomous systems, the companies could fast-track the commercialization of next-generation AI applications -- moving them from research labs and into the hands of consumers worldwide.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Few companies have benefited more from that than Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chipmaker's graphics processing units (GPUs) have proven essential hardware for training and running generative AI applications.\nSince ChatGPT's launch, Nvidia's stock price has increased more than tenfold. It's now the most valuable company in the world with a market cap exceeding $4 trillion.\nBut the next three years are bound to look different from the previous three. And one AI stock looks poised to outperform the leading GPU maker through 2028, based on their current valuations and competitive forces.\nCan Nvidia stock keep climbing?\nNvidia's financial results over the past three years have been nothing short of incredible. And as the generative AI boom continues, it continues to put up extremely high revenue and earnings growth.\nThe company reported a 73% year-over-year increase in data center revenue during its fiscal 2026 first quarter, which ended April 27, as big tech companies looked to outfit their data center servers with Nvidia's latest chips. That led to a 33% increase in the company's earnings per share. However, that EPS number included a $4.5 billion writedown on its inventory of H20 GPUs meant for the Chinese market. Without that, its earnings per share would've been up 57%. President Trump has since lifted the U.S. ban on selling to China. As part of that policy shift, Trump is requiring the company to pay 15% of its China sales to Washington -- but it does mean that the writedown can be reversed, as the H20s now have value again.\nAll that said, Nvidia still faces some headwinds to its continued growth. Competitors are starting to make progress in catching up to Nvidia with their own AI accelerator chips. AMD(NASDAQ: AMD) recently unveiled its MI400X, which is competitive with Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra platform. While the MI400X is slower than the Rubin architecture chips that Nvidia expects to launch in the second half of 2026, it sports a significant advantage in memory capacity, which has become a significant bottleneck in AI training. Still, some data center customers will likely bring some of their business to AMD due to its price performance, and also to keep their biggest GPU supplier in check.\nOn top of that, the biggest Nvidia customers are all developing custom AI accelerators. Over the long run, custom silicon could reduce demand for Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs for AI training and inference, at least among the tech giants. That said, smaller businesses will likely rely on cloud providers offering access to Nvidia GPUs for their AI processing needs.\nThese headwinds make it hard to justify Nvidia's forward P/E ratio of 40. While the stock deserves to trade at a premium, investors who expect that it can continue to put up results like it has for the past few years may be overestimating its position in the market. As a result, I expect that its valuation multiple will be compressed over the next few years, which will drag on the stock's gains.\nThe AI stock that's poised to grow faster than Nvidia\nWhile Nvidia has been and will remain a clear winner from the boom in AI spending, not every business that's exposed to the trend has as much clear-cut potential. For some companies, AI is as much a threat as it is an opportunity. One such business is Adobe(NASDAQ: ADBE).\nAdobe's Creative Cloud suite is the leading software for creative professionals. Because generative AI makes it easier for anyone to create and edit photos, images, and graphics, many expect the developing tech to undermine the need for Adobe's tools. On the other hand, Adobe has invested in building its own AI model, Firefly, which it trained on its library of stock images and videos. Firefly is capable of generating images and videos, and helps creatives get the most out of Adobe's powerful tool set.\nRight now, the market overwhelmingly views the threats of AI as outweighing the benefits for Adobe. The stock is down by more than 40% from the all-time high it touched at the start of 2024. But that sell-off may be a huge opportunity for investors.\nCreative professionals who don't use Adobe's software put themselves at a disadvantage. It's an industry standard. Any designer, photographer, or videographer who is looking for work had better have familiarity with how to get the most out of Adobe's Creative Cloud because the entire industry uses it. That means there are extremely high switching costs to moving away from it, which should help Adobe retain its core customer base.\nMoreover, Adobe is building on top of a strong customer base across its Creative, Document, and Digital Experience platforms. The generative AI tools it is embedding in its software are helping it boost revenue per user and are improving retention rates. The Firefly app that it released in June is credited with drawing in many new users to the Adobe franchise, which saw a more than 30% year-over-year increase in first-time subscribers in its last fiscal quarter, which ended May 30.\nOverall, management expects revenue from AI products to more than double this year, although it remains a small portion of the company's total revenue. But when you consider the indirect effect, there's a clear impact. The company reported 12% growth in annual recurring revenue last quarter, and it expects 11% for the fiscal year. Despite its already high margins, growing into its AI investments should result in some margin expansion over time.\nManagement uses the steady free cash flow generated by Adobe's subscription revenues to buy back shares. It bought back 8.6 million shares last quarter. Assisted by its steadily shrinking share count, the company should be able to produce consistent double-digit percentage earnings per share growth over the next three years. But right now, the stock trades at just 17 times earnings. I expect that multiple to expand over time as Adobe continues to produce consistent earnings growth. That should lead the stock to outperform Nvidia through 2028.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The chip stock is up around 1,400% from its 2022 low as its research spearheaded the rapidly growing AI accelerator industry.\nThat product has so fundamentally changed the company that its data center segment made up 89% of the company's revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. This is a dramatic turnabout from three years ago, when the data center segment was not significantly larger than Nvidia's long-established gaming business.\nAlso, Nvidia's profits have risen so dramatically that even with its massive gains, its P/E ratio is only about 56. In comparison, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose stock has experienced much lower returns, trades at 94 times earnings.\nMoreover, there are no meaningful signs of a slowdown. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% for the AI chip market through 2030, and Nvidia has far exceeded that estimate.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, its revenue of $44 billion rose 69% from year-ago levels. Even though a company with a $4.2 trillion market cap is unlikely to sustain that growth rate, the aforementioned CAGR makes it likely to continue reporting robust revenue growth.\nAdditionally, competitive threats have not held it back. DeepSeek's breakthrough on low-cost AI training earlier this year contributed to a temporary pullback of over 40% in the stock price, but Nvidia recovered quickly. Also, while AMD's upcoming MI400 release next year could bring competition to Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform, the company still has time to respond to that threat.\nIndeed, Nvidia's massive stock gains and huge market cap might deter some investors from buying. Nonetheless, with its domination of the AI accelerator market and the company's relatively low P/E ratio, Nvidia stock remains on track for further growth.\nA recent pullback in SoundHound AI stock could present an opportunity for long-term investors\nJake Lerch (SoundHound AI): My choice is SoundHound AI. Here's why.\nFirst, let's put the recent downturn in context. It's no surprise that the artificial intelligence (AI) sector is getting hit hard by the recent volatility in the stock market. Many of the stocks in this sector are young companies that are developing cutting-edge technology. Therefore, when the growth trajectory of the industry is questioned, sell-offs can be steep and sudden. Yet, these big sell-offs present an opportunity for long-term investors.\nTurning to SoundHound AI specifically, let's recall that the company is a leader within the voice AI sector. They have solid penetration within the automotive and restaurant sectors.\nIn addition, one of their primary competitive advantages is their ability to deploy custom voice AI solutions. What this means is that SoundHound works with companies to tailor their specific AI solutions, which are then deployed under the customer's brand name. This gives SoundHound a leg up on some of its big tech competitors by allowing clients to maintain brand management and data privacy.\nLast, let's recall that only a few weeks ago, SoundHound posted a fantastic quarterly report. The company generated an all-time high of $43 million in revenue, which was up an eye-popping 217% from a year earlier. Management highlighted new or expanded business partnerships across the restaurant, automotive, healthcare, finance, and retail sectors. What's more, the company raised full-year guidance.\nAccording to Yahoo Finance, sell-side analysts now expect SoundHound to generate $166 million in revenue in 2025 and $215 million in 2026, representing growth of 96% and 29%, respectively.\nIn short, SoundHound remains a promising long-term investment within the AI sector, thanks to its solid growth trajectory. Growth-oriented investors might therefore want to consider it on this most recent pullback.\nNetflix isn't done delivering for shareholders\nJustin Pope (Netflix): The streaming king has delivered in a big way for shareholders. Shares have risen over 70% over the past year, even after a recent 10% dip. While that's not a very big drop, it's still a dip long-term investors should consider buying.\nOne of the prettiest charts you'll see is that of Netflix's profit margins over time. As more people sign up for Netflix, the company becomes increasingly profitable because it can spread its content costs across more customers. Netflix stopped reporting subscriber numbers at the end of 2024, but paid subscriptions increased by 15.9% year over year in Q4 to 301.63 million, so new customer acquisition still had plenty of momentum at the end of last year.\nAdditionally, Netflix is beginning to pull multiple growth levers. For instance, Netflix has raised its subscription prices over time and launched an ad-supported membership option a few years ago. It surpassed 70 million subscribers last November, and management expects ad revenue to double this year as some subscribers trade a little convenience for cost savings.\nMeanwhile, the future looks bright. Netflix has waded increasingly deeper into live sports, a significant media category that could continue to help drive and sustain subscriptions. Analysts estimate Netflix will grow earnings by an average of almost 23% annually over the next three to five years. I wouldn't say Netflix's stock is a once-in-a-lifetime deal at 46 times 2025 earnings estimates, but the stock seems fairly valued for a business with such a strong growth outlook and increasingly fatter profit margins.\nInvestors who buy and hold Netflix will likely be very happy with their decision a few years from now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $649,657!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,090,993!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,057% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500.

Here's why the fund is one of the simplest ways to get significant exposure to the Ten Titans.\nTen Titan dominance\nOver the long term, the S&P 500 has historically delivered annualized results of 9% to 10%. It has been a simple way to compound wealth over time, especially as fees have come down for S&P 500 products. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF sports an expense ratio of just 0.03% -- or $3 for every $10,000 invested -- making it an ultra-inexpensive way to get exposure to 500 of the top U.S. companies.\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF could be a great choice for folks who aren't looking to research companies or closely follow the market. But it's a mistake to assume that the S&P 500 is well diversified just because it holds hundreds of names. Right now, the S&P 500 is arguably the least diversified it has been since the turn of the millennium.\nMegacap growth companies have gotten even bigger while the rest of the market hasn't done nearly as well. Today, the combined market cap of the Ten Titans is $20.2 trillion. Ten years ago, it was just $2.5 trillion. Nvidia alone went from a blip on the S&P 500's radar at $12.4 billion to over $4 trillion in market cap. And not a single Titan was worth over $1 trillion a decade ago. Today, eight of them are.\nTo put that monster gain into perspective, the S&P 500's market cap was $18.2 trillion a decade ago. Meaning the Ten Titans have contributed a staggering 51.6% of the $34.3 trillion market cap the S&P 500 has added over the last decade. Without the Ten Titans, the S&P 500's gains over the last decade would have looked mediocre at best. With the Ten Titans, the last decade has been exceptional for S&P 500 investors.\nThe Ten Titans have cemented their footprint on the S&P 500\nSince the S&P 500 is so concentrated in the Ten Titans, it has transformed into a growth-focused index, making it an excellent way to double up on the Ten Titans. But the S&P 500 may not be as good a fit for certain investors.\nArguably, the best reason not to buy the S&P 500 is if you're looking to avoid the Ten Titans, either because you already have comfortable positions in these names or you don't want to take on the potential risk and volatility inherent in a top-heavy index.\nThat being said, the S&P 500 has been concentrated before, and its leadership can change, as it did over the last decade. The underperformance by former market leaders, like Intel, has been more than made up for by the rise of Nvidia and Broadcom.\nSo it's not that the Ten Titans have to do well for the S&P 500 to thrive. But if the Titans begin underperforming, their sheer influence on the S&P 500 would require significantly outsized gains from the rest of the index.\nLet the S&P 500 work for you\nWith the S&P 500 yielding just 1.2%, sporting a premium valuation and being heavily dependent on growth stocks, the index isn't the best fit for folks looking to limit their exposure to megacap growth stocks or center their portfolio around dividend-paying value stocks.\nThe beauty of being an individual investor is that you can shape your portfolio in a way that suits your risk tolerance and investment objectives. For example, you use the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF as a way to get exposure to top growth stocks like the Ten Titans and then complement that position with holdings in dividend stocks or higher-yield ETFs.\nIn sum, the dominance of the Ten Titans means it's time to start calling the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF what it has become, which is really more of a growth fund than a balanced way to invest in growth, value, and dividend stocks.\nInvestors with a high risk tolerance and long-term time horizon may cheer the concentrated nature of the index. In contrast, risk-averse investors may want to reorient their portfolios so they aren't accidentally overexposing themselves to more growth than intended.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

Among his notable observations is the cautionary statement, \"A cumulation of small managerial stupidities will produce a major stupidity — not a major triumph.\" This remark highlights the often-overlooked risk that seemingly minor managerial missteps, when accumulated, can result in significant harm, rather than the company achieving success anyway.\nBuffett, chairman and CEO of the investment conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) (BRK.A), originally presented this insight in his 1982 letter to shareholders, during a broader discussion on corporate management decisions, specifically mergers and acquisitions. His focus was the danger posed by executives making seemingly minor but consistently flawed decisions, particularly around capital allocation and strategic acquisitions. In Buffett’s view, minor errors that individually appear inconsequential can collectively lead to substantial damage, effectively undermining long-term company performance.\nMore News from Barchart\nBuffett’s authority on this topic is rooted in his extensive experience overseeing Berkshire Hathaway’s growth from a modest textile firm into a globally recognized holding company with diversified investments. Over several decades, Buffett has developed a reputation for emphasizing disciplined decision-making, careful analysis, and rigorous oversight of management actions. His meticulous approach to selecting investments and managing businesses has allowed Berkshire Hathaway to consistently generate substantial returns and avoid many of the pitfalls that have ensnared other corporations.\nHistorically, Buffett’s observation arose in a climate marked by high-profile mergers and acquisitions, often driven by managerial ambition rather than strategic clarity. During this period, many companies pursued aggressive expansion strategies or deal-making without fully considering the long-term financial and operational consequences. Buffett, recognizing the dangers inherent in this mindset, cautioned that the accumulation over time of even minor managerial mistakes could undermine or even destroy significant shareholder value.", "content_hash": "957c97a59406ae93e574175184787da3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here's Why the No. 3 Pick Could Be Your Best Investment.\nKey Points\n-\nThe world's largest financial stocks cover a lot of ground, but banks make up the bulk of the list.\n-\nThe best investment opportunity on the list may not be in a bank, but in a company that helps banks.\n-\nVisa's payment processing business is growing strongly, and the stock still looks fairly valued.\nThe Motley Fool just updated its report on the largest financial companies in the world. The list is filled with banks, but there are a couple of other names in the mix, including diversified conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), which is the No. 1 name on the list. But your best investment opportunity might actually be No. 3, Visa (NYSE: V). Here's why.\nWhat does Visa do?\nVisa is what's known as a payment processor. You probably think of it as a credit card company. But it really provides the technology that allows credit and debit cards to be safely used for payments. It connects buyers and sellers on behalf of card issuers, which are often the banks that fill up The Motley Fool's top financial stocks list.\nThe interesting thing about Visa is that no single transaction it facilitates is really all that important. That's because it only charges a small fee for the use of its payment network. It's the volume of transactions that flow through its network that's important. In the fiscal third quarter of 2025, payment volume increased 10% year over year, with Visa handling 65.4 billion transactions. On a dollar basis, volume rose 8%.\nThese are gigantic numbers and highlight just how deeply entrenched Visa is in the financial markets. But it is also deeply entrenched on Main Street. You probably have a credit card or debit card (or both) with a Visa logo on it. Most stores you shop at likely trust Visa to act as an intermediary for them. Don't forget online shopping, where most e-commerce sites allow Visa cards to be used as a safe payment option.\nThe world is increasingly moving away from paper money and toward card and digital payments. To be fair, Visa isn't the only company benefiting from this trend. But it is one of a very small number of companies that have an effective oligopoly in the space. That's kind of like a monopoly, but the industry dominance is shared across a small number of companies.\nVisa is doing well, but it's not shockingly overpriced\nAs you might expect, Visa is performing well as a business. In the fiscal third quarter of 2025, revenues rose 14%, and adjusted earnings jumped 23%. Investors are aware of how well Visa is doing today, and the stock isn't cheap.", "content_hash": "37906b3c2789fae9c590cf8b3768e024", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

He was 88.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nIn Trump’s DC Crackdown, the National Park Service Leads Homeless Sweeps\n-\nGermany Revives a Building Style With a Bleak History: Prefab Housing\nHe died on Aug. 22 in Naples, Florida, according to a statement from his family, which didn’t provide a cause.\nIn 1962, with $200,000 borrowed from local businessmen, Mason opened his own brokerage, Mason & Co., in Newport News, Virginia. He was 25 at the time. The firm grew to six offices with 60 brokers by 1970, when it merged with Legg & Co., a Baltimore firm dating to 1899 whose partners were aging.\nWith Mason at the helm, more mergers followed, culminating in a 2005 deal valued at $3.7 billion in which the firm swapped its brokerage for Citigroup Inc.’s $400 billion asset management group.\nMason retired in 2008. In 2020, Franklin Resources Inc. acquired Legg Mason for $4.5 billion in cash plus debt.\nKnown as Chip, Mason took pride in his firm’s reputation for integrity. “We have an ethic that is very strong,” he told MarketWatch in 2004. “If you talk to anybody here, they’ll laughingly refer to my comments about chalk, because I’m always telling them I don’t want them anywhere near the line.”\nMiller’s Management\nThe firm’s flagship fund, Legg Mason Value Trust, beat the S&P 500 Index for 15 years straight until 2006 under star manager Bill Miller, whom Mason hired in 1981.\nMason, a fan of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team, was a civic leader in Baltimore.

He was 7 when his father died, and he moved with his mother to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.\nAfter graduating from William & Mary in 1959, he returned to Lynchburg to work at his uncle’s brokerage firm, Mason & Lee Inc.\n“They could’ve been in advertising and I would’ve gone into advertising,” Mason said, according to a 1998 Institutional Investor story.\nMerger Strategy\nThe firm created by the 1970 merger of Legg and Mason had more than 500 employees and commission volume of about $12 million, according to the Washington Post. Mason served as president. In 1973, it merged with New York-based Wood, Walker & Co. In 1981, it combined with Mason & Lee, his uncle’s old firm.", "content_hash": "c8c67f36a8eb3db490c8c7464a5a8ea5", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

According to data by Multpl, that is the lowest monthly reading since November 2000 when the S&P 500 yielded 1.18% -- before the sell-off in the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) accelerated as the dot-com bubble burst. Many top growth stocks would go on to suffer brutal losses that took years or even over a decade to recover.\nHere's what the S&P 500's current low yield says about the state of the U.S. stock market and what you can do about it.\nThere's a clear explanation for the S&P 500's falling yield\nWith 500 holdings, the S&P 500 seems like a great way to invest in hundreds of top U.S. companies at once. But the index has become less diversified in recent years.\nJust 4% of S&P 500 components make up 48% of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO), an exchange-traded fund that closely tracks the index. Since the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, massive companies can really move the index in a way smaller companies cannot.\nSingle companies are now worth the equivalent of entire stock market sectors, or multiple sectors. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) plus Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) make up more than the combined value of the materials, real estate, utilities, energy, and consumer staples sectors -- illustrating the top-heavy nature of the index.\nThe following table shows the 20 largest S&P 500 components by market cap and their dividend yields as I write on Aug. 18. The \"weighted yield\" column is the dividend yield multiplied by the percentage weighting in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- which shows the impact each stock has on the index's yield.\nData sources: Vanguard, YCharts.\nThe key takeaway is that 48% of the S&P 500 contributes just 0.25% of the index's yield. Meaning that if you took out the 20 largest stocks, the S&P 500 would yield around 2% -- just like it did a decade ago.\nSo it's not that companies have stopped paying dividends, it's just that low- or no-yield megacap growth stocks like the \"Ten Titans\" now make up such a large share of the index that the overall S&P 500 yield is lower.\nA justified rally\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite underwent massive surges heading into the turn of the millennium that made stock prices go up faster than dividends. Similar to today's market, many of the top holdings in these indexes shifted to growth companies that prioritize reinvesting in their underlying businesses rather than distributing a portion of profits to shareholders through dividends.\nThe S&P 500's low yield illustrates the extent to which growth stocks dominate the stock market. But unlike the lead-up to the dot-com bust, this rally is much healthier because it is being driven largely by earnings growth and positive sentiment rather than euphoria.\nNvidia is a good example of a company with both a surging stock price and earnings that have compounded several-fold in just a few years. Investors aren't betting on what Nvidia could do in the future if everything goes right. Rather, they are betting on sustained momentum for what Nvidia is delivering right now.\nAs of Aug. 1, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 was 22.2 -- which is about a 20% premium to its 10-year average. However, the quality of the S&P 500's earnings and growth rate is arguably better today than over that 10-year average. So buying the S&P 500 still makes sense if you agree that the quality is worth paying up for. By this metric, the S&P 500 is pricey, but it's not remotely at nosebleed levels like we saw during the dot-com bubble.\nAchieving a more balanced portfolio\nThe S&P 500 can still be a great tool for building long-term wealth. However, risk-averse investors may be looking for stocks at less expensive valuations and higher dividend yields.\nThe simplest way to counteract the S&P 500's premium valuation and low yield is to allocate other portions of your portfolio to help fulfill value and income objectives. That can be done by investing directly in top dividend-paying value stocks or value-focused ETFs.\nIt's important to understand what makes up the S&P 500 and let the index work for you rather than accidentally investing too much in the index and taking on more exposure to growth stocks than you're comfortable with.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF wasn’t one of them.

After months of tug-of-war diplomacy, the United States imposed a 15% duty on Korean imports effective August 7 – less severe than the 25% levy initially floated but still painful for Asia’s fourth-largest economy. In exchange, Seoul agreed to ramp up investment in US projects and pledged to purchase $100 billion worth of American energy products, a deal that was meant to soften the blow. Seoul has already quantified the potential tariff impact, forecasting just 0.9% growth for 2025 (compared to 1.8% at the beginning of this year). This would mark the weakest pace of growth since the pandemic in 2020, underscoring how vulnerable the country’s export-led model is to tariff shocks.\nThe energy pledge, however, looks harder to fulfil in practice than it is on paper. Washington expects South Korea to substantially increase imports of US crude, but refiners across the country have already been gradually shifting in that direction for years. According to Kpler data, imports of WTI Midland rose from 283,000 b/d in 2020 to 465,000 b/d in 2025, supported by favourable conditions under the bilateral free trade agreement and Korea’s freight rebate system that often makes WTI cheaper than Middle Eastern grades. Yet any incremental moves from here would be constrained. Total Korean crude imports have held steady in the 2.8 to 3 million b/d range for the past five years, and while American volumes have risen, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the UAE remain deeply entrenched in the supply mix. Saudi Arabia alone delivered 956,000 b/d to Korea in 2025 to date, nearly double the volumes from any other supplier, and though Russian flows dropped sharply after the start of Ukraine war, the gap was quickly filled by other Middle Eastern producers.\nWhat keeps these flows in place is not just habit or geopolitics, but the underlying design of Korea’s refining system. WTI is a light crude, while South Korea’s highly complex refineries are configured to process heavier grades, predominantly Middle Eastern ones. Shifting too heavily toward US barrels (and subsequently, toward a lighter product yield) would leave parts of these facilities idle, eroding efficiency and profitability. Korea operates five refineries, and each illustrates why diversification is easier said than done. The largest, Ulsan, fully owned by SK Energy, already blends WTI with heavier grades from Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to run at capacity. Yeosu, half-owned by Chevron, follows a similar pattern, comingling rising volumes of WTI with heavier Iraqi barrels. Onsan and Daesan refineries, partially owned by Saudi Aramco with stakes of 63% and 17% respectively, lean overwhelmingly on Arab Light and Arab Medium, together making up about 80% of their crude slate. With Saudi interests directly embedded in their ownership structure, any push to substitute American crude faces resistance. Meanwhile, Incheon, the smallest refinery, struggles to operate even at 50% capacity and faces operational constraints that leave it in no position to absorb excess light oil.\nEven in refineries that could handle more WTI, the economic rationale has weakened. Light crudes like WTI yield larger amounts of naphtha, a feedstock for the petrochemical industry. But global oversupply, fuelled by relentless Chinese capacity expansion, has created a petrochemical glut. Margins have collapsed, and on August 20 South Korean petrochemical companies announced a collective 25% cut to the country’s naphtha-cracking capacity. For refiners, naphtha cracks have been consistently negative, meaning that buying more light crude would not only strain refinery configurations but also risk churning out products that have no profitable market.\nLayered on top of these operational limits are the contractual obligations that tie Korea to Middle Eastern suppliers. Unlike American producers, who sell mainly on spot terms, Saudi or Iraqi exporters prefer long-term contracts with little flexibility. Failure to lift agreed volumes risks penalty or even termination, a strict policy that reflects the abundance of global demand for their barrels. In practice, this means Korean refiners cannot simply displace Middle Eastern grades without risks to their supply security in order to accommodate Washington’s demands, however strong the diplomatic pressure may be.\nThe tension between politics and market realities became clear in June, when South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy convened an emergency meeting with crude and LNG importers after the Israel–Iran crisis escalated. The government used the moment to urge refiners to diversify away from their deep reliance on Middle Eastern crude, arguing that regional instability underscored the risks of overdependence. Yet even this direct warning failed to alter behaviour: imports continued to flow overwhelmingly from the Middle East, with only incremental increases in US volumes.\nFor now, Seoul is edging toward a middle course, raising US crude imports at the margins while relying on its entrenched heavy grades from the Gulf. But the deal struck under tariff pressure exposes an uncomfortable truth: South Korea cannot satisfy Washington’s demands without undermining the very foundations of its refining system and petrochemical industry. Heavy reliance on Middle Eastern supply is locked in by refinery design, contractual obligations, and ownership stakes.\nSouth Korean Refineries\nRefinery\nOwnership\nCapacity (kb/d)\nUlsan\nSK Energy 100%\n840,000\nYeosu\nGS Caltex (GS Energy 50%, Chevron 50%)\n785,000\nOnsan\nSaudi Aramco 63.7%, South Korean Government 7.3%, Free float 29%\n669,000\nDaesan\nHyundai Heavy Industries 74%, Saudi Aramco 17%, Hyundai Motor 4.4%, Others 4.6%\n520,000\nIncheon\nSK Energy 100%\n275,000\nThat leaves Seoul caught between a rock and a hard place, vowing to please its most important ally by buying barrels it cannot fully use, or preserve the operational logic of its energy system and risk further trade retaliation. In practice, the likeliest outcome is that Korean refiners will marginally increase US purchases, blending those extra WTI barrels with heavier Middle Eastern grades, a compromise that secures refinery balance but falls short of Washington’s ambitions. Either way, the price of accommodation is high. South Korea’s case is a poignant reminder that, as much as politicians seek to force deals, they cannot rewrite the laws and economics of refining.", "content_hash": "0f4a8aaa456e0be3704c8085d6d984a4", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Today it represents the conglomerate that Warren Buffett built. But, before Buffett bought the company, it was a failing clothing business. That clothing business ultimately closed under Buffett's watch, representing one of his most prominent failed investments.\nA long run of good investments has turned that failure into a huge success. However, in one year's time, there's going to be a very big change at Berkshire Hathaway.\nWhat does Berkshire Hathaway do?\nBerkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate. Conglomerates often operate in a few different business lines, sometimes with each business having its own brand identity. Berkshire Hathaway took that model and ran with it. At the end of 2024, Berkshire Hathaway had 189 subsidiary companies!\nBut that's not the whole story. That list of 189 companies includes a couple of large insurance businesses. Insurance companies collect insurance premiums up front and they pay out money to cover losses in the future. The premiums get invested until the cash is needed to fund payouts. This is what's known as \"float\" on Wall Street. Insurance companies can keep whatever they earn on the float.\nBerkshire Hathaway has long invested the float in the stock market, with a large portfolio of stocks augmenting its owned businesses. Some of the company's long-term holdings include Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), American Express(NYSE: AXP), and Chevron(NYSE: CVX). That diversity is replicated in the company's owned investments, in a wide-ranging investment portfolio.\nEssentially, Berkshire Hathaway is something like a mutual fund. When you buy the stock, you are, effectively, investing alongside CEO Warren Buffett. As the chart below highlights, doing so has worked out very well for investors over the long term.\nThings are about to change at Berkshire Hathaway\nSo, from a big-picture perspective, buying Berkshire Hathaway is really buying into Buffett's investment approach. To briefly summarize that approach, Buffett likes to buy well-run companies while they are attractively valued and then hold them for the long term to benefit from the growth of their businesses. Simple to say, hard to do. Yet, clearly, Buffett has executed his investment approach incredibly well over time.\nAt the end of 2025, he is going to retire as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, handing the reins to Greg Abel. Since Abel isn't Buffett, the company will inherently be different one year from now. The question is: How different?\nThe good news on this front is that Buffett isn't cutting and running. He is slated to remain as the chairman of the board of directors. So Abel is, technically, still Buffett's employee. Buffett generally takes a hands-off approach, but if Abel is struggling, it's likely Buffett will step in to help.\nThere's also the fact that Abel has worked for Berkshire for over two decades. So he is steeped in the Oracle of Omaha's approach. Because he is a different person, there will inherently be differences in the way he approaches the CEO role. But given his long association with such a successful CEO, it also seems likely that he will try his best to heavily incorporate Warren Buffett's teachings into whatever he does.\nDifferent, but not that different\nAs an investor, if you're worried that Buffett stepping down will lead to Berkshire Hathaway dramatically changing the way it is run, that's probably not going to happen. Still, the CEO change is material, so investors should keep a regular eye on the business. The company will be different in an important way in a year, with Abel stepping in to fill Buffett's very large shoes. But the basic approach taken at the top of the company probably won't be so different that Berkshire Hathaway will become a completely different company overnight.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

The market rally struggled for much of last week, particularly hitting Nasdaq and growth stocks hard, before Powell's dovish pivot triggered a powerful Friday rebound that lifted indexes and leading stocks from or above key technical levels. The key question facing investors is whether Friday's growth stock resurgence represents a sustainable reassertion of market leadership or merely a one-off relief rally, with defense plays having shown relative strength during the week's volatility but finishing with more muted gains. Wednesday's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and guidance will serve as the ultimate test for both the market rally's sustainability and which sectors will lead going forward. The week also brings Friday's Core PCE Price Index alongside Q2 GDP revisions and a packed earnings calendar featuring cloud computing and AI infrastructure companies.\nHere are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.\nWednesday's Nvidia (NVDA) earnings represent the week's most consequential event, serving as both a litmus test for the AI infrastructure buildout and a catalyst that could determine market leadership going forward. The results will be closely scrutinized for data center revenue growth, gaming segment performance, and crucially, management's guidance about future AI chip demand and pricing trends. Nvidia's commentary on customer inventory levels, competition from custom chips developed by hyperscalers, and the sustainability of current AI investment cycles will be particularly important given recent volatility in technology stocks and Friday's dramatic growth stock rebound. The earnings come at a critical juncture as investors question whether growth stocks can maintain momentum following Powell's dovish Jackson Hole comments or if recent defensive rotations will resume. Nvidia's results could significantly influence not only semiconductor stocks but also cloud computing companies, AI infrastructure plays, and the broader technology sector that has driven much of this year's market gains.\nPowell Pivot Follow-Through and Fed Policy\nFriday's Core PCE Price Index at 8:30am will provide the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, taking on heightened significance following Powell's Jackson Hole speech that opened the door to rate cuts by suggesting conditions \"may warrant\" policy adjustments. Both month-over-month and year-over-year readings will be closely watched for evidence supporting Powell's more dovish stance or potential contradictions that could complicate the Fed's messaging. The data arrives as markets have rapidly repriced rate cut expectations, with September 17 odds around 85% and investors betting on multiple cuts through year-end. Wednesday's FOMC meeting minutes at 2pm will provide additional context for interpreting Powell's Jackson Hole pivot, offering insights into the internal Fed discussions that shaped recent policy thinking. Any significant deviation in inflation data from expectations could either reinforce or undermine Powell's dovish shift, creating substantial volatility in rate-sensitive sectors.\nCloud Computing and Cybersecurity Earnings\nWednesday brings a critical test for cloud infrastructure and cybersecurity sectors with Snowflake (SNOW) and CrowdStrike (CRWD) reporting alongside Nvidia. Snowflake's results will provide insights into data analytics demand and cloud data warehouse adoption amid ongoing enterprise digital transformation trends. CrowdStrike's earnings will offer perspective on cybersecurity spending and enterprise security priorities, particularly important given increasing global cyber threats and regulatory compliance requirements. These results will help determine whether Friday's growth stock rally can sustain momentum or if recent defensive rotations will resume. Both companies represent high-growth technology plays that have been sensitive to interest rate expectations and investor risk appetite, making their results particularly relevant following Powell's dovish comments.\nEconomic Growth and Consumer Fundamentals\nThursday's Q2 GDP revision at 8:30am will provide an updated view of economic growth momentum, while Tuesday's durable goods orders and consumer confidence data offer insights into business investment and household sentiment. The GDP revision comes amid ongoing questions about economic sustainability and provides context for the Fed's policy deliberations following Powell's Jackson Hole speech. Consumer confidence at 10am Tuesday will be particularly important for assessing household optimism about future economic conditions and spending intentions in light of recent labor market changes. Monday's new home sales data will provide additional perspective on housing market trends amid evolving mortgage rate expectations following Powell's dovish pivot. The convergence of growth measurements and forward-looking indicators creates potential for significant market reactions if data collectively suggests accelerating or decelerating economic momentum.\nGlobal Technology and Geopolitical Backdrop\nThe week features several international technology earnings providing global perspective on digital trends and enterprise spending. PDD Holdings (PDD) Monday will offer insights into Chinese e-commerce and consumer behavior, while Alibaba (BABA) Friday provides additional perspective on Asian market dynamics. Dell (DELL) and Marvell (MRVL) Thursday will provide insights into enterprise hardware demand and semiconductor trends. The earnings backdrop unfolds amid ongoing geopolitical developments following Trump's meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy, which could influence international business sentiment and cross-border technology investments. Companies with significant international exposure may face questions about geopolitical risks and supply chain considerations during their earnings calls.\nBest of luck this week and don't forget to check out my daily options article.\nOn the date of publication, Gavin McMaster had a position in: SPY.

I've always followed a Warren Buffett-style of investing, in which I look for strong, profitable companies to hold over the long term.\nHowever, I also recognize that tech stocks are way too important -- and profitable -- to miss out on. Tech stocks represent companies that are at the forefront of innovation and development, leading the world's charge into the future. Without tech companies, we wouldn't have a host of massively significant advances that we take for granted today -- things like personal computers, online banking, 5G wireless service, the internet, smartphones, and GPS technology. Nor would we have the incredible types of tech that companies are still making rapid progress on today -- such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things, generative AI, and autonomous vehicles.\nIncluding strong, profitable tech stocks in your portfolio is one of the best ways to give yourself an opportunity to outperform the market. Consider that the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up nearly 18% in the last 12 months, handily outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500.\nThree tech stocks that I think would be great choices for any retail investor's portfolio are Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META).\n1. Nvidia\nSemiconductor maker Nvidia is the biggest company in the world by market capitalization, so it naturally gets the top position on this list, too. While a recent pullback has driven the market cap from $4.4 trillion down to $4.2 trillion, the tailwinds that have propelled Nvidia's upward over the last few years are still present -- and they won't be going away any time soon.\nNvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) that are used by data centers to provide the computing power required by a host of advanced computing tasks, such as training and running large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Nvidia's GPUs are designed to be deployed in clusters of hundreds or thousands, boosting the parallel processing power they can apply to workloads. In addition, Nvidia's CUDA platform provides libraries and tools for developers who are working on software that will be powered by its GPUs. It's a popular platform with developers, and it's only compatible with Nvidia's chips. That added competitive advantage is one reason why I'm confident that it will continue to control the lion's share of the GPU market for years to come.\nNvidia will release its results for its fiscal 2026 second quarter on Aug. 27, and I think it's going to be another sterling report. I'll also be looking carefully at management's guidance, as the company is expected to resume selling its H20 AI chips to customers in China after being blocked from exporting them to that country earlier this year.\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\nAs the company that fabricates the advanced chips designed by Nvidia (as well as an array of other chip companies), Taiwan Semiconductor benefits from many of the same tailwinds as the GPU leader. But there are some differences between their businesses that make TSMC stock even more appealing.\nAs the world's leading third-party chip foundry, Taiwan Semi manufactured nearly 12,000 products for 522 customers in 2024, employing 288 separate process technologies. It's involved in about 85% of all semiconductor start-up product prototypes. In short, this is an ideal stock to own if you believe that the semiconductor business broadly will continue to grow, but you want to hedge some of your exposure away from Nvidia.\nTaiwan Semi is also moving to limit its exposure to the trade war between Washington and Beijing, and to expand its manufacturing footprint further beyond the island of Taiwan, which China has designs on. The company is in the midst of spending $165 billion to expand its new manufacturing and R&D facility in Arizona and bring some of its most advanced fabrication processes to the U.S.\n3. Meta Platforms\nMeta Platforms, which operates Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, is the unquestioned king of the social media companies. On average, 3.48 billion people use its platforms every day -- and that number is increasing. Its daily active user count was up by 6% in June from a year earlier.\nThe company leverages that massive audience -- and the mountain of information it collects about them -- into an impressive revenue stream. Ad impressions were up 11% in the second quarter from the previous year. Overall, Meta reported $47.5 billion in revenue in the second quarter, up 22% year over year.\nMeta's own artificial intelligence platform, Meta AI, has been driving a lot of its recent success. Meta AI's chatbot can generate content, answer questions, and create images. The company also provides AI-powered tools to advertisers to help them reach the customers they want, making their ads on its social media platforms more effective.\nTech stocks to buy and hold\nCompanies in the tech sector must constantly innovate in their efforts to stay relevant, and their stocks can sometimes be volatile. But Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Meta Platforms aren't merely chasing trends -- they're shaping them. I expect that these companies will remain at the forefront of their industries as we move into the second half of the decade, and I view them as good bets to continue outperforming the market. That's why I like them for any buy-and-hold portfolio.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

If you want to take advantage of these ideas and make extra money, you should act fast.\nGOBankingRates reached out to the experts for their thoughts on which passive income streams you should jump on before it’s too late.\nGet a High-Yield Account\nThere are lots of ways that you can make money using the money that you already have. One of those ways is utilizing high yield accounts that grow your money without any additional work on your part.\n“I would start by checking out local banks and credit unions,” said Joe Camberato, the CEO of National Business Capital. “Many of them are still offering high rates on CDs and money market accounts, because they’re actively trying to bring in more deposits. Online banks are another solid option, but just make sure the account is FDIC-insured and do your homework, especially with newer platforms.”\n“The easiest and most liquid option would be a high-yield savings account,” added Chad Willardson, the president and founder of Pacific Capital. “Ditch the pathetic 0.01% APY bank account and grab the higher interest rates available from an online bank account. If you can leave your money parked for 6 months to a few years, you can lock in the current interest rates in a certificate of deposit (CD).”\nHe suggested laddering your CDs, so some of your money becomes available every year, but you can still lock in the highest rates.\nRead Next: Codie Sanchez: How Much Money Can You Make With a Vending Machine Side Hustle?\nInvest In Real Estate\nAccording to Willardson, “The oldest and most traditional form of creating passive income is investing in real estate. That’s an entirely different conversation than simply depositing money in a bank account.”\nHe continued, “But if you can be patient and disciplined, you may find the passive income from real estate is a great way to earn increasing cash flow as inflation continues to rise. There are also many potential tax advantages to real estate investing.”\nJust note that if you’re going to maximize your profit, this won’t be entirely passive. If you buy a fixer-upper to flip, for example, you can pay someone else to do the work, keeping it passive, or fix it yourself with some labor.", "content_hash": "e85eb7b05c22f3e1dc0b464f80254833", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Followers develop elaborate but legally unsound arguments to support their position, often relying on wishful thinking rather than established legal principles. For example, Mary’s husband believes that all Americans have access to “billions and billions of dollars in an account somewhere, and just our signature can pay off debt.”\nHowever, in the real world, Mary is struggling to sort out their financial mess, after wresting control of their finances from her husband about a year ago.\nHere’s what hosts Ken Coleman and George Kamel advised her to do.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nAdvice for a marriage-ending problem\nDuring the call, Mary tearfully explained that before taking over finances, she wasn’t aware of any of their money troubles. She learned about their mortgage mess when the sheriff showed up with the foreclosure papers, and on a separate occasion, her car was repossessed. She even lost her job as a worship leader at her church because of the liability risk her husband posed.\nKamel and Coleman had a major reality check for her.\n“This is a nightmare, and I’m scared you’re going to go down with this guy,” Kamel said to her. “You’re both going to be in prison if you keep this up.”\nYou are very unsafe,” Coleman said. “And he can say he loves you, but this is not the act of love.”\nWhy money troubles lead couples to divorce\nThough most couples don’t have problems with money as extreme as Mary’s situation, money is a serious cause of strain in relationships. A study from Ramsey Solutions found that money is the number one issue married couples argue about, and the number two predictor of divorce, after infidelity. Debt has a huge strain on marriages, and increased debt meant increased fighting for most of the couples in the survey. Moreover, it seems almost inevitable — the survey found that 86% of couples who got married in the last five years started out with debt.", "content_hash": "276dc0c09e31ca2cc386dc10fc845f40", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Instead of moving into other assets like stocks or bonds, some might step away from investing entirely.\n“Studies show that bitcoin investors (by the way, I don’t like to refer to them as investors — more appropriately, they’re speculators) tend to be younger than investors in stocks and bonds.

That role puts him at the intersection of big tech and game development, where studios connect to Google’s servers and AI models to build, or sustain, their titles.\nAI Agents Are Taking Over Game Development: Google\nHe pointed out that AI is arriving just as developers face mounting financial pressure and shrinking player engagement with new games.\n“Over half of play time is in games more than six years old,” he said. “So if you’re making a new game, you’re competing for less than half of the available play time. And if you’re the creator of one of those older games, you’re struggling to keep it relevant and keep players engaged.”\nFollowing decades of growth, the global games industry dipped post-pandemic, with revenues falling in 2022 before recovering. In 2024, it generated $182.7 billion, up 3.2% from the year before. Revenues are expected to rise to $188.9 billion in 2025, a 3.4% increase.\n“You have a broken business model, and the result is layoffs, game cancellations, and other problems across the games industry in recent years,” Buser said.\nHowever, Buser believes generative AI could be the industry’s way out. A Harris Poll commissioned by Google found that nine out of 10 developers are already using AI tools in some part of the production process.\n“If you go use case by use case in your development pipeline, from concept to quality assurance, and you attack every use case with AI, you can have quite a radical reduction in development time,” he said.\nDevelopers are testing generative tools aimed at changing how games look, feel, and evolve in real time. Buser called this the era of the “living game”—titles that use AI in real time to analyze player behavior and generate new content on the fly. Unlike traditional games, which rely on patches and downloadable content (DLC) drops, these systems could adapt in minutes rather than months.\n'Fortnite' Fixes AI-Powered Darth Vader After It Starts Saying Slurs\n“Take Darth Vader in Fortnite, for example—the player reaction was strong,” Buser said. “We’re just scratching the surface.”", "content_hash": "7c680696fd7736e14460663704295d6d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

In the past five years, the global media pioneer's share price has soared 150% as of this writing. Ongoing subscriber, revenue, and operating profit growth have been the key ingredients for this perennial winner.\nBut where will this top streaming stock be in five years?\nHigher stock price\nNetflix continues to fire on all cylinders. During the second quarter (ended June 30), the company reported 15.9% year-over-year revenue growth. Even better, free cash flow jumped 86.9%. Netflix is an extremely profitable enterprise these days, something many bears believed would never happen due to the company's massive content budget.\nThe business dominates the streaming landscape. According to Nielsen data, 8.8% of all U.S. TV viewing time in July happened on Netflix. The only other streaming platform with a greater share is YouTube, which isn't a an apples-to-apples comparison due to its user-generated content.\nThere's no reason to believe that Netflix's fundamentals will weaken anytime soon. In 2030, revenue and earnings should be higher than they are today. That supports a rising stock price.\nBeating the market\nNetflix shares should be higher five years from now, but more importantly, will the stock be able to beat the market between now and 2030? That's a different story.\nValuation is the main concern I have. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.7. The bulls will argue that Netflix's monster success warrants the premium valuation. However, the company's growth going forward isn't going to resemble the past. There's a good chance the P/E multiple will contract over the next five years as the business continues to mature, offsetting some of the stock's gains in that time.\nNetflix has been a market-beating stock in the past, but looking ahead to 2030, it wouldn't surprise me if the stock lags the S&P 500.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Netflix right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

Microsoft pioneered the personal computing era with its Windows operating system, which became the backbone of the internet age. Berkshire, under Warren Buffett's leadership, compounded capital that consistently outperformed the broader market.\nToday, I think the most compelling opportunity at the intersection of growth and value is none other than semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\nThe reason is simple: Nvidia isn't just riding a single trend. Instead, it has positioned itself as the core power source at the heart of multiple revolutions, each unfolding against the backdrop of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement.\nThe AI infrastructure boom is a multi-year growth arc for Nvidia\nNvidia's rapid rise in recent years comes down to one thing: its graphics processing units (GPUs). These chips have become the gold standard of generative AI development, powering everything from large language models (LLMs) to mission-critical applications across every industry.\nCloud hyperscalers and big tech giants have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into capital expenditures (capex) -- much of which they directed toward chips and networking infrastructure.\nThis spending spree doesn't appear to be slowing down, either. According to management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, AI infrastructure spend could reach $6.7 trillion by next decade -- with chips continuing to capture a good portion of this investment.\nWhat makes the infrastructure narrative even more compelling is that it extends beyond the private sector. The U.S. government is supercharging its AI ambitions through Project Stargate -- a $500 billion initiative to invest in data centers and AI infrastructure over the coming years. Meanwhile, countries in the Middle East are rolling out their own sovereign AI initiatives.\nNvidia sits at the center of this activity. Its GPUs are not exclusive to powering today's data centers -- they are enabling a global race to build the foundation of tomorrow's AI economy.\nAI-powered software applications are coming into focus\nBeyond infrastructure, Nvidia is also quietly shaping the rise of AI-powered software applications. Over the last few years, developers mainly focused on securing GPUs to build next-generation data centers and train LLMs. Now, however, AI investment is swiftly moving downstream and becoming a critical component of consumer and enterprise applications.\nTake Perplexity's unsolicited $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google Chrome. While the deal is unlikely to materialize, it underscores an important point: AI is moving beyond hardware and into the application layer for businesses and consumers. Nvidia enjoys a rare advantage at this intersection because the company profits not just from hardware demand, but also from its software ecosystem.\nNvidia's CUDA software program serves as a foundation for developers, enabling them to build and deploy AI applications efficiently and at scale.\nEmerging market opportunities are a sleeping giant\nWhere things get most exciting for Nvidia is its untapped potential across emerging markets.\nFor years, Nvidia's footprint in China has been constrained by strict export controls and fierce competition from rivals like Huawei.\nThese dynamics have begun to shift. Nvidia recently reach an agreement with the Trump Administration that allows it to remit 15% of its China sales back to the U.S. government in exchange for continued access to the key market -- which Jensen Huang estimates could be worth $50 billion annually.\nBeyond geographic expansion, Nvidia is poised to ride the wave of more advanced AI use cases in areas such as quantum computing, robotics, and autonomous systems.\nA recent example underscores how central Nvidia has become: Elon Musk told investors that Tesla is putting its internally built Dojo supercomputer ambition to the side in favor of a new technology stack, dubbed AI6. At the core of this new stack is none other than Nvidia.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\nAt first glance, the chart below may look contradictory. Nvidia's forward price to earnings (P/E) multiple of 41 is well-above its three-year average. Yet at the same time, the stock trades at a discount to the peak forward earnings levels reached earlier in the AI revolution. What could this mean?\nIn my eyes, it could suggest that investors are struggling to assign a fair value to Nvidia.\nThe premium over its historical average reflects ongoing optimism, while the discount to prior highs implies that some view Nvidia as a maturing business at risk of decelerating growth.\nI think this interpretation could be misguided. Even if Nvidia's growth rates moderate in percentage terms, those percentages will be applied to a significantly larger revenue and profit base -- fueled by data center expansion, AI software applications, and new markets.\nTaken together, this suggests that Nvidia is quietly undervalued. At the very least, the company appears to have significant runway for years to come -- supported by a host of growth levers that are not yet fully priced in.\nFor these reasons, I see Nvidia as an opportunity trading at a reasonable price point relative to the company's potential -- making it a compelling long-term investment to buy and hold.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Since the April 8 low, the Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has appreciated an incredible 40%. And of course, that recovery has taken place amid a decade-long bull market in technology growth stocks.\nIt's easy to understand why. Society is becoming more digital and automated. The last 10 years have seen the emergence of cloud computing, streaming video, digital advertising, the pandemic-era boom in electronic devices and work-from-home, all topped off by the introduction of generative artificial intelligence (AI) marked by the unveiling of ChatGPT in late 2022.\nHowever, after a long tech bull market, technology growth stocks have reached a worrying valuation level relative to other stocks, and today's relative overvaluation mirrors an infamous period in stock market history.\nEchoes of the dot-com era?\nIn several ways, technology stock performance and valuations are currently mirroring the extremes of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Unfortunately, we all know how that period ended, with a terrible \"bust\" that sent the Nasdaq tumbling three years in a row, eventually culminating in a 78% drawdown from the March 10, 2000, peak.\nHow frothy are tech stocks?\nTechnology innovation can be very exciting; however, that excitement often finds itself in the form of high valuations. According to data published on Charlie Bilello's State of the Markets blog, the technology sector's recent outperformance has now exceeded that of the height of the dot-com bubble:\nThe relative outperformance isn't the only mirror to the dot-com era. Back then, tech stocks also became very large, leading to an outperformance of large stocks relative to small stocks. Similarly, tech stocks are often growth stocks with high multiples, reflecting enthusiasm over their future prospects. This is in contrast to value stocks, which trade at low multiples, usually due to their more modest growth prospects.\nAs you can see below, the outperformance of large stocks to small stocks, as well as growth stocks to value stocks, is at highs last seen during the dot-com boom.\nIs it time to worry?\nGiven that higher-valued tech stocks now make up a larger portion of the index, the Schiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which adjusts for cyclicality in earnings over 10 years, while not quite at the levels of 1999, has crept up to the highest level since 1999, roughly matching the level from 2021:\nAs we all know, 2022 was also a terrible year for tech stocks. While it didn't see a multiyear crash akin to the dot-com bust, 2022 saw the Nasdaq decline 33.1% on the year. Of course, at the end of 2022, ChatGPT came out, somewhat saving the tech sector as the AI revolution kicked off.\nCounterpoints to the bubble thesis\nThus, when compared to history, tech stocks are at worrying levels. Given the similarities to the 1999 dot-com bubble and the 2021 pandemic bubble, some may think it's time to panic and sell; however, there are also a few counter-narratives to consider.\nThe first is that, unlike in 1999, today's technology giants are mostly truly diversified, cash-rich behemoths that account for a greater and greater percentage of today's gross domestic product (GDP). While the late 1990s certainly had its leaders -- including Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), the only market leader that is in the same position today as then -- they weren't really anything like today's tech giants, with robust cloud businesses, global scale, diversified income streams, and tremendous amounts of cash.\nWhile market concentration in the top three weightings tends to occur before market downturns, index weighting concentration appears to be somewhat of a long-term trend now, increasing beyond prior highs in 1999 and 2008 since 2019.\nThus, it seems a higher weighting of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks could be a feature of today's economy, rather than an aberration.\nWhile it's true that some of today's large companies are overvalued, given their underlying strength and resilience, it's perhaps not abnormal for them to garner higher-than-normal valuation multiples.\nWhat investors should do now\nIt's important to know that while taking note of market levels is important, it is extremely difficult to time market downturns. Famed investor Peter Lynch once said, \"Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves.\"\nSo, one shouldn't abandon one's long-term investing plan just because overall market levels may be frothy. That being said, if you need a certain amount of cash in the next one to two years, it may be a good idea to keep that money in cash or Treasury bills until then, rather than the stock market.\nFurthermore, if you have a regular, methodical investing plan, stick to it.

For borrowing, their options are often limited to family/friends or predatory lenders with harsh collection practices,” Henry Hendrawan, co-founder of Pintarnya, told TechCrunch. “We digitize job matching with AI to make hiring faster and we provide workers with safer, healthier lending options — designed around what they can reasonably afford, rather than pushing them deeper into debt.”\nAround 59% of Indonesia’s 150 million workforce is employed in the informal sector, highlighting the difficulties these workers encounter in accessing formal financial services because they lack verifiable income and official employment documentation.\nPintarnya tackles this challenge by partnering with asset-backed lenders to offer secured loans, using collateral such as gold, electronics, or vehicles, Hendrawan added.\nSince its seed funding in 2022, the platform currently serves over 10 million job-seeker users and 40,000 employers nationwide. Its revenue has increased almost fivefold year-over-year and expects to reach break-even by the end of the year, Hendrawn noted. Pintarnya primarily serves users aged 21 to 40, most of whom have a high school education or a diploma below university level. The startup aims to focus on this underserved segment, given the large population of blue-collar and informal workers in Indonesia.\n“Through the journey of building employment services, we discovered that our users needed more than just jobs — they needed access to financial services that traditional banks couldn’t provide,” said Hendrawan. “We digitize job matching with AI to make hiring faster and we provide workers with safer, healthier lending options — designed around what they can reasonably afford, rather than pushing them deeper into debt.”\nWhile Indonesia already has job platforms like JobStreet, Kalibrr, and Glints, these primarily cater to white-collar roles, which represent only a small portion of the workforce, according to Hendrawan. Pintarnya’s platform is designed specifically for blue-collar workers, offering tailored experiences such as quick-apply options for walk-in interviews, affordable e-learning on relevant skills, in-app opportunities for supplemental income, and seamless connections to financial services like loans.", "content_hash": "237c551745a3c4f8281f36efcaf61385", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}
