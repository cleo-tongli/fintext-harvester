European stock markets closed in the green with the Stoxx Europe 600 index up by 0.1%.
Regionally, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.1%, Germany's DAX higher by 0.4%. Meanwhile, France's CAC 40 bucking the trend losing 0.1%.
European semiconductor stocks reversed gains from earlier in the trading session to end in the red after President Donald Trump told CNBC he will unveil new tariffs on semiconductors and chips as soon as next week.
BE Semiconductor fell 2.3%, the most in the sector. It makes 18% of its total revenue in the U.S., with sales more than doubling in the country over the past year, according to FactSet.
Chip equipment makers VAT Group and STMicro also declined by 0.9%

Switzerland wanted 1% U.S. tariff in negotiations, says Trump
Switzerland wanted 1% tariff on goods imported into the country, according to U.S. President Donald Trump's account of the negotiations ahead of his threat to hit the Alpine country with 39% tariffs.
Trump told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter ""didn't want to listen"" to his concerns about the U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland.
The U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland stood at $38.3 billion in 2024, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office. Meanwhile, the U.S. exported $35 billion surplus in services.
""I said, we have a $41 billion deficit, and you want to pay 1% tariff?"" exclaimed Trump. ""She wanted 1%. I said, you're not going to pay 1%. We lose because I view deficit [as] lost.""
The Swiss President's office declined to comment.
The threated 39% tariff on Switzerland came as a shock to the nation. Indications in the Swiss press had been that the country was close to negotiating an outline deal similar to those struck by the European Union, the U.K. and Japan, which set baseline tariffs between 10% and 15%. Instead, it has received one of the highest rates of any country.
Switzerland's President Keller-Sutter and Vice President Guy Parmelin on Tuesday announced they were flying to the U.S. to ""facilitate meetings with the U.S. authorities at short notice and hold talks with a view to improving the tariff situation for Switzerland.""
Swiss stocks have reversed all of Monday's 0.15% losses, with the SMI index last 0.5% higher at 3.30 p.m. in London (10.30 a.m. ET).

Trump calls $600 billion investment pledge from EU a 'gift'
U.S. President Donald Trump has described the $600 billion dollar investment pledge from the European Union, which is part of the trade agreement between the partners, a ""gift.""
Trump suggested, in a CNBC interview on Tuesday, some countries had questioned why their tariff rate was higher than the 15% agreed with the EU, ""and I said, because they gave me $600 billion and that's a gift, that's not like a loan.""
""They gave us $600 billion that we can invest in anything we want,"" he said.
In the European Commission's explanation of the U.S.-EU agreement, it says that ""EU companies have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion (ca. €550 billion) in various sectors in the US by 2029.""
It is unclear if the EU can guarantee the investments from the private sector.
Trump on CNBC was also asked what could happen if the investment does not materialize.
""Then they pay tariffs at 35% No, no. They brought down their tariffs, so they paid $600 billion and because of that, I reduced their tariffs from 30% down to 15%,"" he responded.

European pharma firms unrattled by Trump 250% tariff threat
Investors in pharmaceutical firms appeared unrattled after U.S. President Donald Trump told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. could eventually hit 250%, the highest rate he has threatened so far.
In early July, he threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals.
Novartis shares were last 0.9% higher, little changed from earlier in the session. Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk was down 1.3%, while the U.K.'s AstraZeneca rose 0.8%.

Trump joins 'Squawk Box' to discuss chips, pharma and more
President Donald Trump spoke with ""Squawk Box"" in a wide-ranging conversation. Here are some of the highlights:
On semiconductors, Trump said his administration is going to announce new tariffs ""within the next week or so."" ""We're going to be announcing on semiconductors and chips, which is a separate category, because we want them made in the United States,"" he said during the interview.
When it comes to his planned pharmaceutical tariffs, Trump said that the levies could eventually reach up to 250%. That's the highest tariff rate he's threatened to date.
The president also revealed in the interview that he's considering four candidates for future Federal Reserve chair, which does not include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. ""Well, I love Scott, but he wants to stay where he is,"" Trump said.

Swiss stocks rebound as president flies to U.S. for trade talks
Swiss stocks have reversed all of Monday's 0.15% losses, with the SMI index last 0.63% higher at 12:30 p.m. in London at a session high.
While the news of a 39% U.S. tariff rate sparked warnings of a huge economic hit and damage to markets last week, investors appear to be focusing on the potential for negotiators to strike a last-minute deal with the White House, whether before or after the Aug. 7 deadline.
Switzerland's President Karin Keller-Sutter and Vice President Guy Parmelin on Tuesday announced they were flying to the U.S. to ""facilitate meetings with the U.S. authorities at short notice and hold talks with a view to improving the tariff situation for Switzerland.""
The Swiss government on Monday said that it would look to present a more ""attractive offer"" to the U.S. and that it was not currently considering countermeasures.
European markets are broadly higher, with Germany's DAX up 0.78% and the regional Stoxx 600 up 0.46%.

Why investors have welcomed Diageo’s results
Diageo shares have pared gains, last trading around 3% higher as investors digest the drinks maker's earnings report. CNBC's Karen Tso dives into the details.
Infineon up 5% as CFO says tariff impact less severe than thought
Shares of Infineon are up 5% after the German semiconductor beat on adjusted earnings per share in the latest quarter, coming in at 37 cents ($0.43) versus an LSEG estimate of 33 cents.
That was on the back of 3.7 billion euros in revenue, in-line with expectations and virtually unchanged on the year.
Infineon is the latest European firm to flag the impact of a strong euro on its revenue growth, saying the figure would have come in 9% higher on the year if not for euro appreciation, versus the 3% growth it reported.
Infineon CFO Sven Schneider told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" that the indirect impact from tariffs on the business remained difficult to estimate because its customers were not providing full feedback, but that it appeared to be ""less pronounced than we originally thought,"" leading to ""some growth momentum in the current quarter.""

Diageo shares rise on cost-cutting plans despite $200 million anticipated tariff hit
British drinks maker Diageo has forecast flat sales growth in 2026 as its once again raised its anticipated tariff hit to $200 million annually and increased its cost-savings target to to $625 million.
The Guinness and Johnnie Walker maker previously forecast a $150 million annual hit to operating profits as a results of tariffs, but raised the figure on the basis of current 15% levies of imports from the European Union and 10% charges on those from the U.K.
Shares of Diageo rose 6.8% by 8:20 a.m. London time (3:20 a.m. ET).
The company said it now expects sales growth in the fiscal year to June 2026 to be similar to that of 2025, and organic operating profit growth to be mid-single-digit, including the impact of tariffs.
Diageo posted organic sales growth of 1.7% for the full year 2025, in line with analyst expectations, and organic volume growth of 0.9%.
The company said it expects to save around $625 million over the next three years under its ""Accelerate"" cost-cutting program, up from $500 million previously. Interim CEO Nik Jhangiani said the board intends to appoint a new CEO by October following the abrupt departure of CEO Debra Crew last month.

Earnings back in focus
After a relatively quiet day for European earnings, the calendar is packed today. That includes second-quarter reports from oil giant BP and fashion house Hugo Boss.
We've also seen results from staffing firm Adecco Group, which posted better than expected second-quarter operating income that was up 6% to 115 million euros ($132.8 million), and said it expected profitability to improve in the second half.
French satellite operator Eutelsat also beat expectations with revenue growth of 1.6% to 1.24 billion euros, driven by growing interest in its satellite internet services from government and corporate customers, even as operating losses widened to 909 million euros from 310 million euros. Read more about Europe's aspiring challenger to Elon Musk's satellite operator Starlink here.
Germany's Fresenius Medical Care fell short of market estimates with adjusted operating income of 476 million euros, citing higher than expected patient outflows amid ""elevated"" mortality and missed treatments. The firm nonetheless confirmed its full-year guidance after sales and profit both rose.

BP posts profit beat
Britain's BP posted stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit, following a period of heightened volatility for global oil and gas prices.
The struggling energy major reported underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $2.35 billion for the three months through June. That beat analyst expectations of $1.81 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.
The results come as BP continues to try to rebuild investor confidence following a protracted period of underperformance relative to its industry peers.
""Inside the upstream, we've had tremendous performance, along with record operating efficiency [and] along with starting up five new major projects,"" BP CEO Murray Auchincloss told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" following the results.

Hugo Boss second quarter sales beat expectations, despite China weakness
German fashion house Hugo Boss posted a better-than-feared dip in second quarter sales and maintained its full-year guidance, despite flagging weakness in the key Chinese market.
Group revenues dipped 1% year-on-year on a constant currency basis to 1 billion euros ($1.15 billion) over the three month period, slightly ahead of the 996 million euros forecast by analysts in an LSEG poll.
Quarterly operating profit rose 15% to 81 million euros, in line with estimates.
The suit maker pointed to ""subdued"" demand in the once lucrative Chinese market, as Asia Pacific sales fell 5%. But it nevertheless maintained its full-year guidance for reported group sales in line with last year's, at around 4.2 billion to 4.4 billion euros, and for operating profit to grow 5% to 22%.

“How do we approach these challenges in a technological sense, is what many of us are asking,” says David Miljak, research programme director for sensing and sorting, mineral resources at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia’s preeminent national science agency.
For the energy-intensive ore screening and sorting part of the mining process, Miljak and his team, along with other start-ups and academics, are looking to provide the answer to this question.
Rocks are usually sorted particle by particle using methods like X-ray transmission (XRT). However, there is significant scope for improving this process with advanced technologies that offer more informed and faster analysis and, ultimately, better data capture, according to experts like Miljak.
He and his team are advancing radio frequency, X-ray and nuclear sensing instrumentation for high-throughput conveyor belt systems used early in the mining process that can ‘interrogate’ the rocks.
“What we want to know is how much copper, for example, is in the rocks; if we know that accurately and fast enough, we can divert them for processing and reject the rocks that are low in copper and aren't economic to mine,” he explains. “This can have enormous benefits in uplifting the ore grade, the economics and the sustainability of the operation.”
In this way, low-grade rocks do not need to be crushed, meaning the overall process requires less energy and water usage. It also minimises the material entering tailings dams.
Ore screening technology
Miljak, who has almost 30 years’ experience in radio frequency-based technology, was involved in developing, over 15 years, magnetic resonance technology (MRT) that was commercialised through NextOre, a company spun out of CSIRO in 2017.
In March, NextOre announced its first solution for analysing ore transported by underground copper trucks, an adaptation of its conveyor belt application.
MRT is a form of radio frequency spectroscopy that can be used to count the atoms of a target metal in a sample. It works by subjecting ore to pulses of radio waves set to the signature frequency of the target mineral.
The resonating ore produces a radio field burst, known as a 'spin echo', which is quantitatively measured by the sensor. The data generated by the MRT analyser is presented as real-time weight measurements of the target metal which, combined with weightometer readings, provides real-time grade as weight per cent of the material.
The technology can do this for 50 tonnes (t) of material in under a minute, according to NextOre, providing mining operations with real-time data that informs ore routing decisions.
It has been demonstrated at several operations including First Quantum Minerals’ Kansanshi mine in Zambia, Lundin’s Candelaria mine in Chile and Capstone’s Cozamin mine in Mexico, with a trial at Cozamin reporting a 7.5% increase in copper production without additional mining.
This technology is related to magnetic resonance imaging machines used in medicine, but must be adapted to mining conditions that are harsh and dusty.
“These technologies have been around for decades, but what we are trying to do is tweak the physics to make it work in minerals, which is actually a huge undertaking; you have got to re reinvent how you transmit the radio waves onto the targets,"" says Miljak.
Hyperspectral sensing technology
Another spin-out innovating in this space is Hypermine, born from VTT, a Finland-based European research organisation. Its technology combines laser illumination, hyperspectral sensing and proprietary machine-learning algorithms, to sort the valuable minerals at the earliest stage of the mining process.
The company, which in June announced a successful closure of its seed funding round, claims the technology helps cut energy use by 10% and can reduce ore flotation acids and water usage by 15%.
It does this by making stockpiling decisions 100-times more accurate, says CTO Mikhail Mekhrengin. He adds that the company is already detecting alumina contamination in its iron mines and sulphate contamination in copper mines, with four systems implemented in customer operations in Brazil, Chile and South Africa.
“Hypermine enables actionable data for each shovel or truck load, as well as the potential of a 3–10% higher mining profitability due to fewer valuable materials being lost into waste, less gangue in the process and more consistent feed to processing plants,” Mekhrengin says.
Similarly, Germany-based Steinert is providing sensor-based sorting technology to uncover ore’s composition in real time, adopted by Terra Goyana bauxite mining operation in Brazil. Successful trials at the site showed the technology could remove contaminants at an improved rate.
Multiple complementary solutions
These solutions can work in tandem with to X-ray technology, experts say. The difference, Mekhrengin explains, is that X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is based on elemental analysis to provide ore-grade information, whereas laser spectroscopy or hyperspectral sensing are optical technologies that provides molecular content of the material, including mineral content and concentrations, lithologies, rock type and chemistry.
“Why is mineralogy/rock type important? Because metals are never presented in a pure form in nature. They are enclosed in minerals. It is hard to impossible to translate elemental information to mineralogical data. In the perfect case, you need both,” he says, adding: “On top of XRF, mineralogy is crucial to understanding how to process the mined material.”
A spokesperson for NextOre adds that XRT is applied only in rock-by-rock, or ‘particle’ sorting applications, is cost intensive and can become very complex and expensive for higher throughput applications greater than 200 tonnes per hour (tph).
“Conversely, magnetic resonance is particularly well suited for bulk applications, extending currently to 6,500tph and almost certain to go higher.”
Improving processing plants
In addition to sorting, CSIRO and Miljak are applying similar techniques to measure what is in flotation plants during the extraction process.
Technology that can quantify the mineral phases changing in real time could help operators address or mitigate “upsets” in the mineral processing that spoil the entire operation, says Miljak. It could lead to mitigating actions such as changing the feedstock to blend out the bad mineral actor.
“It could be a certain mineral that makes the recovery process go off; it is a disruption. We can pick these up very quickly with the technology we have – this is a unique capability we have developed in the last 5–10 years,” he says.
""If operators are not privy to these big deviations, recoveries can drop, so stopping them earlier could lead to higher yields. Over a long period, increasing recovery by even a few per cent for a big mine can potentially provide thousands of tonnes of more products – a fortune depending on what commodity is being mined.”
CSIRO is working with some companies to pilot its ""robust bits of technology"" but is also looking for additional mining partners.
Innovations in screening
Further down the sorting and crushing process, Weir recently launched the ETX250, which it says is the largest double deck banana screen in the world for separating big and small rocks. The company says the screen, which is run by only two exciters, could reduce energy consumption by 40%, further supporting miners sustainability targets and reducing rising energy costs.
“Having only two exciters [rather than three] reduces the amount of inventory the customer has to keep, as well as maintenance, while giving better fine screening efficiency because we can run the exciter at a higher speed,” explains Corné Kleyn, global product manager at The Weir Group.
The company recently sold 12 to a high profile mining operation in Pakistan.
Incorporating AI into minerals screening and sorting
The next step for data-driven technologies is coupling them with AI and machine learning (ML). While this is not Miljak and his team’s focus, he says there are ""big overlays"".
“There is a beautiful train of data here that can be paired with AI ML, neural nets, and so on, that can be used to improve process based on historical data and to predict problems,” he explains.
“I think part of our problem is people aren't used to having mineral phase data in real time. So, it would be a new research endeavour to try and make the best of the data flows to improve it even further.”
Nicolaas Steenkamp, an independent consultant who is a geologist by training, says AI could be valuable for improving these processes.
“Today, X-ray transmission technologies used in the mining industry do thousands of millions of calculations for each individual grain and that data is just discarded, it doesn’t feed into production, but this could be processed in the cloud to give a much better insight into production,” he says.
“That can inform your processing plant in terms of the type of material it can expect to come through, enabling them to regulate the agents they will need to add to a specific processing cycle.”
However, this is mostly ""blue sky or proof of concept"" technology right now, he adds.
Vision for the future
Steenkamp says the key driver for adopting these technologies is ultimately processing less ore, so a project is using less water, power and leaching agents to get a higher grade, while reducing the tailings.
Wheaton Precious Metals president and CEO Randy Smallwood, a proponent of innovation in the mining industry, agrees these are important drivers for technology adoption.
The company’s Future of Mining Challenge awarded ReThink Milling $1m (C$1.37m) for its innovative milling technologies, which are estimated to reduce the energy use in comminution by more than half.
However, as Steenkamp notes, for the bigger players, investing in cutting-edge technology is not a high priority as most are still operating at margins that mean they don’t need to invest in high-cost equipment. For the small and medium operators, the cost often precludes them from adopting it.
Although some industries, such as the diamond sector, are more used to using different types of technology and will therefore likely have more confidence to adopt, he adds.
“At the end of the day, you have got to have someone that is willing to be a participant and then be willing to share that data into the market, which can then convince your larger players to start adopting it,” he says.
Miljak acknowledges there is general ""inertia"" within the industry when it comes to piloting and adopting new technologies but says there are ""some really good innovation teams and individuals that are really trying to make a difference in the industry"".
“My view is it will be an important lever for the future, if we can get a whole raft of technologies and innovators into this mining space to transform mining into manufacturing-type process, where real-time data can keep people safe and productivity high. That is the longer-term vision of CSIRO,” he concludes.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence, S&P 500 companies are on track to post a 9.1% increase in Q2 profits from a year earlier, well above analysts’ forecast of 2.8%.
On the economic data front, investors will closely monitor the U.S. ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI and S&P Global Services PMI, set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists expect the July ISM services index to be 51.5 and the S&P Global services PMI to be 55.2, compared to the previous values of 50.8 and 52.9, respectively.
U.S. Trade Balance data will also be released today. Economists anticipate the trade deficit will narrow to -$62.60 billion in June from -$71.50 billion in May.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.212%, up +0.05%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.10% this morning, buoyed by a wave of solid corporate earnings reports. Food and beverage stocks gained ground on Tuesday. A survey released on Tuesday showed that business activity in the Eurozone expanded at a slightly quicker pace in July compared to June, though overall growth remained subdued as demand cooled. Meanwhile, an EU official stated on Tuesday that the 15% tariff applied to European Union goods entering the U.S. is all-inclusive. The 15% rate covers all goods, except for steel and aluminium, the official said. Tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors currently stand at zero, but if and when they increase following the U.S. 232 investigations, the rate will also be capped at 15%. Separately, European Commission trade chief Maros Sefcovic said on Tuesday that he was in discussions with U.S. officials Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer to implement the framework trade deal agreed upon in July. “The work continues in a constructive spirit,” said Sefcovic. In corporate news, BP Plc (BP-.LN) rose over +2% after the oil giant reported better-than-expected Q2 profit and announced a share buyback. Also, Diageo Plc (DGE.LN) climbed more than +6% after the world’s biggest spirits maker projected flat sales for 2026 despite the impact from tariffs and raised its cost-savings target. In addition, Infineon Technologies AG (IFX.D.DX) gained over +5% on strong quarterly results.
Eurozone’s Composite PMI, Eurozone’s Services PMI, and Eurozone’s PPI data were released today.
Eurozone’s July Composite PMI came in at 50.9, weaker than expectations of 51.0.
Eurozone’s July Services PMI stood at 51.0, weaker than expectations of 51.2.
Eurozone’s June PPI has been reported at +0.8% m/m and +0.6% y/y, compared to expectations of +0.9% m/m and +0.5% y/y.
Asian stock markets today settled in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.96%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.64%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed higher today as investors digested strong economic data from the country. Bank stocks outperformed on Tuesday. A private sector survey released on Tuesday showed that China’s services activity grew at the quickest pace in 14 months in July, driven by robust demand, including the first expansion in new export business in three months. The reading was more upbeat than a competing official survey. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note that the notable divergence between the official and private surveys suggests “substantial variation across services sub-industries.” Meanwhile, investors are closely watching whether the U.S.-China tariff truce will be extended after officials from both countries wrapped up their latest round of trade talks in Stockholm last week, with U.S. President Donald Trump set to make the final decision. Analysts anticipate some consolidation in Chinese equities over the coming weeks, given ongoing uncertainty over U.S.-China tariff rates and a challenging domestic business environment. Investors now await Chinese trade and inflation data due later this week for further insight into the economy’s health. In corporate news, Lenovo Group rose over +5% in Hong Kong after JPMorgan lifted its profit forecast for the company this year by 3%, citing strength in its core business.
The Chinese July Caixin Services PMI stood at 52.6, stronger than expectations of 50.4.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street. Machinery stocks led the gains on Tuesday. A private sector survey released on Tuesday showed that Japan’s service sector activity expanded at the fastest rate in five months in July, supported by strong domestic demand that offset a steep decline in export orders and softer tourist arrivals. Meanwhile, minutes of the Bank of Japan’s June meeting revealed that some BOJ officials saw scope to resume interest rate hikes once trade tensions stemming from U.S. tariffs subsided, indicating that Tokyo’s recent trade agreement with Washington removed a key hurdle to further tightening. “Given high uncertainties, the BOJ would likely pause rate hikes for the time being. But it also must respond flexibly and nimbly, and return to a rate-hike phase depending on U.S. policy developments,” one member was quoted as saying. Japan’s top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said he planned to travel to Washington starting Tuesday to push the U.S. to have President Donald Trump sign an executive order implementing the agreed 15% tariff rate on automobiles. In other news, an auction of 10-year Japanese government notes on Tuesday attracted weaker demand after disappointing U.S. employment data last week sparked speculation of an early Fed rate cut, weighing on yields. In corporate news, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained more than +5% after Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles announced that the heavy machinery manufacturer would lead Australia’s new $6.5 billion navy frigate program. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -9.63% to 23.66.
The Japanese July au Jibun Bank Services PMI arrived at 53.6, stronger than expectations of 53.5.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.15%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.26%.
Stock indexes are mildly higher today, extending Monday’s rally. Gains in technology stocks are boosting the overall market higher, led by an +8% jump in Palantir Technologies after it reported stronger-than-expected profits and raised its full-year forecasts. Stocks have continued support from speculation that last Friday’s dismal payroll and ISM manufacturing reports will prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 92% from 40% before the reports were released.
The US trade deficit for June was smaller than expected, a positive factor for Q2 GDP. The June US trade deficit shrank to -$60.2 billion from -$71.7 billion in May, better than expectations of -$61.0 billion and the smallest deficit in 1.75 years.
Dovish comments late Monday from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly were supportive for stocks when she said the time is nearing for Fed interest rate cuts, given mounting evidence that the job market is softening and there are no signs of persistent tariff-driven inflation.
In recent tariff news, President Trump said Monday that he would be “substantially raising” the tariff on US imports from India from the current 25% due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
The markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. Later today, the July ISM services index is expected to climb by +0.7 to 51.5. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 221,000. Also on Thursday, Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be +2.0% with unit labor costs rising +1.5%.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 92% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 65% at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Q2 earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +9.1% for the second quarter, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 66% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 82% exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up by +0.51%. China’s Shanghai Composite closed up +0.96%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.64%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are down -6 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield is up +2.9 bp to 4.222%. Sep T-notes today fell from a 3-month high, and the 10-year T-note yield moved up from a 3-month low of 4.183%.
Strength in stocks today has reduced safe-haven demand for government securities and is weighing on T-note prices. Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $125 billion of T-notes and T-bonds in this week’s August quarterly refunding, beginning with today’s $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes.
T-notes found support from dovish comments late Monday from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said the time is nearing for Fed interest rate cuts given labor market weakness and no signs of tariff inflation. T-notes also have positive carryover support from last Friday’s weaker-than-expected payroll and ISM manufacturing reports, which boosted the chance of a Fed rate cut at next month’s FOMC meeting to 92% from 40% before the reports.
European government bond yields today are moving higher. The 10-year German bund yield rebounded from a 1.5-week low of 2.601% and is up +1.0 bp to 2.634%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rebounded from a 1-month low of 4.496% and is up +0.5 bp to 4.514%.
The Eurozone July S&P composite PMI was revised downward by -0.1 to 50.9 from the previously reported 51.0.
The UK July S&P composite PMI was revised upward by +0.5 to 51.5 from the previously reported 51.0.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 13% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

For once, the Trump administration may be giving some drugmakers a reason to celebrate.
The Trump administration is planning to experiment with covering costly weight loss drugs under Medicare and Medicaid, the Washington Post reported on Friday. That plan could expand access to millions of Americans with obesity who can't currently afford Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound, blockbuster GLP-1 drugs that cost around $1,000 per month before insurance.
In a statement to CNBC about the plan, the Department of Health and Human Services said all drug coverages undergo a ""cost-benefit review."" The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ""does not comment on potential models or coverage,"" the department added.
The reported plan – if it ultimately takes effect – would be a huge win for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and many Americans.
Spotty insurance coverage of obesity drugs remains the biggest barrier to access for patients – and it's choking broader uptake and revenue growth for the two pharmaceutical giants. Many health plans, including Medicare, cover GLP-1s for treatment of diabetes, but not obesity. Medicaid coverage of obesity drugs is limited and varies by state, according to health policy research organization KFF.
But it's important to remember that this plan isn't exactly new.
In November, the Biden administration proposed having Medicare and Medicaid cover obesity treatments, which would have extended access to roughly 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries and about 4 million Medicaid recipients. The proposal was controversial at the time, as it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade, a congressional analysis found.
The Trump administration dropped that proposal in April, but said it could reconsider coverage of those drugs in the future.
Let's get into what the newest reported iteration of the plan looks like.
Under the Trump administration's reported pilot plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans would be able to voluntarily choose to cover Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound for patients for ""weight management"" purposes. That's according to several Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services documents obtained by the Post.
The plan is expected to start in April 2026 for Medicaid and January 2027 for Medicare plans, the Post reported.
It's unclear how exactly the plan will play out, Jared Holz, Mizuho health care equity strategist, said in a note to clients on Friday. Holz said he expects the government to put some coverage parameters in place related to factors like age, body weight, body mass index and other comorbidities, or coexisting chronic health conditions.
He also said the pricing of the drugs will be a ""major consideration."" Holz said he expects the government to pay less than the current list prices of drugs. But having that coverage would expand access and could help drive higher sales volumes, he noted.
Another factor to consider is how much the government is willing to crack down on so-called compounding pharmacies, which are allowed in rare cases to sell cheaper, unapproved versions of GLP-1s. The pharmaceutical industry fiercely opposes those knock-off GLP-1s, as their safety and efficacy aren't vetted by regulators and they are, in some cases, illegally sold at scale.
Holz said the industry's complaints to the government about compounded GLP-1s have so far ""not been met with a widespread shut-down.""
But overall, Holz said the Trump administration's reported willingness to consider covering obesity drugs is ""a slight positive as far as industry sentiment.""
It's definitely a breath of fresh air for Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and other drugmakers – including Amgen, Roche, AstraZeneca and Pfizer – that are hoping to bring their own obesity drugs to market.
The last six months have been anything but smooth for the broader industry: The Trump administration has ratcheted up calls for drugmakers to lower U.S. drug prices, overhauled federal health agencies and could impose sweeping tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the country any day now.
We'll keep watching to see whether this plan gets implemented, so stay tuned for our coverage!

Latest in health-care: Earnings season saw Medicare Advantage players switching places
After reporting its second straight earnings miss and guidance cut, UnitedHealth Group completed its executive sweep by replacing CFO John Rex. Executives on the earnings call admitted to mis-execution in Medicare Advantage and pledged to get back to profitability and win back investor trust.
Nearly two years ago it was CVS Health under pressure, after profits in the company's Aetna health insurance division were torpedoed by low Medicare Advantage Star quality ratings.
This week, CVS beat and raised its outlook on the strength of its MA program. CEO David Joyner, now one year into the job, told me he feels good about the turnaround at Aetna and its Medicare business. On top of that, the company saw market share gains in its stores, thanks in part to winning over Rite Aid customers.
Humana, similarly, has seen progress on its turnaround, but CFO Celeste Mellet told me that all insurers are grappling with pricing plans for next year amid high medical costs. One big cost driver right now, Mellet told CNBC, is oncology drugs, as some expensive therapies are now being used in combination.
The next moment of truth for the Medicare Advantage players will come over the next six weeks – when they'll learn the fate of their Star ratings for 2026 plans.

Latest in health-care tech: Dr. Marc Harrison moves to a strategic advisory role at General Catalyst
Long-time health-care executive Dr. Marc Harrison has stepped down as CEO of General Catalyst's Health Assurance Transformation Company, or HATCo, and has moved into a strategic advisor role, CNBC has confirmed.
The venture capital firm brought in Harrison and announced the formation of HATCo in 2023. In a release at the time, General Catalyst said the company would work closely with health system partners, and that it would eventually acquire and operate its own health system.
Months later, HATCo announced its plans to buy Summa Health, a nonprofit integrated health system in northeast Ohio. Under its new structure, Summa would become a for-profit organization, and General Catalyst said it would introduce new tech-enabled solutions that aim to make care more accessible and affordable.
Buying a health system is an unprecedented move in the venture industry, and the deal wasn't well received by some members of the Ohio community. Hundreds signed a petition urging Summa to remain a nonprofit and to halt negotiations with HATCo.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost conditionally approved the deal in June, though he outlined a number of ""enforceable commitments"" as part of the agreement. HATCo will have to notify the Attorney General of transactions that could trigger antitrust concerns for 10 years after the deal closes, for instance.
Harrison went to medical school in the late 1980s and has spent most of his career within health systems, most recently as CEO of Intermountain Healthcare. General Catalyst told CNBC that Harrison will continue to provide the firm's CEO, Hemant Taneja, with clinical insights and will remain connected to its ecosystem in his new role.
""It became increasingly clear to both Marc and to us that Marc's role would best be accomplished as a strategic advisor to Hemant Taneja as we bring that ambition and vision to life,"" a General Catalyst spokesperson said.
Daryl Tol, the head of General Catalyst's Health Assurance Ecosystem, was promoted to president of HATCo, the spokesperson said. He will spearhead the firm's day-to-day- work with Summa Health leadership.
General Catalyst has also appointed Kate Walsh, the former Massachusetts Secretary of Health and Human Services, to HATCo's board. In addition, she will serve as the chair of the board at Summa Health once the transaction closes.
""We are grateful for Marc's leadership and collaboration as co-founder and CEO to help get us to this point in the evolution of HATCo, and we look forward to leveraging his invaluable perspective as we continue to progress,"" the spokesperson said.

(""Silvercorp"" or the ""Company"") (TSX: SVM) (NYSE American: SVM) is pleased to report that the Constitutional Court of Ecuador has delivered a unanimous decision rejecting the final legal challenge in Ecuador against the environmental license for the El Domo mining project, thereby definitively upholding its validity.
The El Domo Project, currently under construction, is the first mining project in Ecuador to have conducted an environmental consultation aligned with standards of the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean, a multilateral treaty adopted on March 4, 2018, in Escazú, Costa Rica. This process has now been validated by multiple levels of the Ecuadorian judiciary, including ordinary courts and the Constitutional Court.
The environmental license for the project was supported by 98% of the population within the project's area of influence. The El Domo Project is expected to bring significant long-term socio-economic benefits to the local community of Las Naves.
Summary of Judicial Proceedings
On June 5, 2024, a group of individuals filed a constitutional protection action against the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Ecological Transition (""MAATE""), seeking to challenge the environmental license and consultation process for the El Domo Project. On July 24, 2024, the local court in Las Naves Canton, Bolívar Province, Ecuador dismissed the action, confirming that MAATE had complied with applicable environmental consultation requirements prior to issuing an environmental license for the project.
The plaintiffs appealed to the provincial court, and the appeal was heard on October 17, 2024, and was dismissed by the provincial court on November 12, 2024, affirming the lower court decision that MAATE correctly discharged its environmental consultation obligations prior to issuing an environmental license of the El Domo Project.
Subsequently, on December 19, 2024, the plaintiffs filed an Extraordinary Protection Action (EPA) before the Constitutional Court of Ecuador. On February 26, 2025, the Constitutional Court issued a decision declining to admit the EPA, stating that it failed to meet constitutional criteria for admission. On March 3, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for clarification. On July 24, 2025, the Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the clarification motion.
Despite anti-mining groups having failed at every level of Ecuador's judiciary—including the Constitutional Court—they continue to engage in unlawful and disruptive activities aimed at obstructing the lawful development of the El Domo Project. These actions have created safety concerns and threaten the rule of law but have not materially impacted project advancement to date. Silvercorp remains steadfast in its commitment to advancing the El Domo Project responsibly and in full compliance with Ecuadorian law.
Silvercorp and its partners are committed to responsible mineral development and to supporting local communities. The Company has consistently conducted its operations in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and in alignment with the highest environmental, social, and governance standards. It looks forward to advancing the El Domo Project into production with the same dedication to ethical and sustainable practices.

https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/chocolate-skincare-timepieces-how-swiss-tariffs-will-hit-prices.html,9cf7f01b00904015149aa907447cf70a,"Chocolate , skincare , timepieces : How 39 % Swiss tariffs will hit prices","Chocolate , skincare , timepieces : How 39 % Swiss tariffs will hit prices",2025-08-05 14:30:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"U.S. buyers of Swiss products, from luxury watches and skincare to artisan chocolates, could soon face sharp price rises if negotiators are unable to strike a deal to avert 39% tariffs due to come into effect on Thursday.
The announcement last week that Switzerland faces one of the highest U.S. tariff rates in the world stunned many politicians, analysts and businesses, who had thought the country was close to negotiating a deal similar to those of the European Union and U.K., which got baseline rates of 15% and 10% respectively.
The U.S. has a hefty trade deficit with Switzerland, totaling $38.3 billion in 2024. The Swiss government points out that the gap is in part because of the latter's status as the world's biggest center of gold refining, with huge quantities of the precious metal passing through the country for processing before it is sent around the world. Both gold and silver were exempted from the White House's ""reciprocal tariff"" policy launched in April.
The U.S. is also a major importer of Swiss pharmaceuticals, an industry that has been mired in confusion over the tariff rates it will face, and medical devices. Pharma products are currently exempt from the 39% levies, though sector-specific tariffs may yet come under the U.S.'s separate Section 232 investigation.
But consumers will mostly be familiar with the Alpine country's high-end products, from Rolex watches to premium skincare and beauty products. Sales could be rocked if the 39% tariffs remain in place for an extended period — something Swiss negotiators are currently scrambling to avoid, as economists warn of a massive hit to growth, jobs and stocks.
Watches
The U.S. was the biggest overseas market for Swiss watches in 2024, with exports totaling 4.37 billion Swiss francs ($5.4 billion), according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.
To qualify as Swiss-made, at least 60% of a watch's production cost must be Swiss-based, while its technical development must be conducted in the country.
""Swiss watches have long been a cornerstone of the U.S. market, and a 39% tariff would be a real shake-up,"" Paul Altieri, founder and CEO of online resale platform Bob's Watches, told CNBC.
""Suddenly, every import would carry a hefty extra cost, and dealers would face tough choices — absorb the tariff, eat into margins, or pass it on to customers. You'd likely see longer lead times as brands and retailers realign logistics, and higher sticker prices across the board."" The retail price of a Rolex Submariner could jump from $10,000 to nearly $14,000, he noted.
For Swiss watch businesses, a 39% tariff would be ""devastating,"" Jean-Philippe Bertschy, head of Swiss equity research at Vontobel, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.
""They increased the prices already in spring by an average of 5 to 10%, I think another hit will be quite difficult for the U.S. consumer for sure, especially for the entry into the mid-segment level."" In a research note, Vontobel flagged Swatch as vulnerable to a tariff hit, with shares falling 2.3% on Monday.
""For the luxury watches, for the brands like Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet, you have some long waiting lists. So I think it's going to be more comfortable for these companies to increase the prices,"" Bertschy continued.
""You have very limited measures to take. You can, of course, increase efficiencies and to try to do some other measures to counter U.S. tariffs, but overall, very challenging for the industry.""
Coffee
Consumer goods giant Nestlé is one of Switzerland's biggest firms. The company says that it faces a minimal direct impact from tariffs because it produces more than 90% of what it sells in the U.S. locally.
That's generally the case for consumer staples such as instant coffee or bottled water which are high-volume, low-ticket items, James Edwardes Jones, managing director of consumer research at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""
Its popular Nespresso coffee brand, known for at-home coffee machines and capsule pods, could, however, be among those goods exposed to higher rates and therefore price hikes.
""In Nestle's case specifically, Nespresso is all manufactured in Switzerland and then exported around the world, so it seems likely that will be caught in a small way,"" Edwardes Jones added.
Nestle did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the impact of Swiss levies. The company does not specify the level of its U.S. sales for Nespresso, but its half-year results showed North America grew at a ""strong double-digit rate.""
Skincare
Switzerland's world-renowned beauty and skincare products could also be subject to price hikes as brands not included in a pharmaceutical tariff exemption look to offset higher import costs.
That could be most notable for companies that pride themselves on Swiss production, such as caviar-based anti-aging skincare brand La Prairie, spa supplier Valmont and nail care business Mavala, none of which responded to CNBC's request for comment.
""While Swiss firms can generally weather a 10-15% tariff without major margin erosion or demand loss, 39% sets the bar much higher,"" Lombard Odier said in a Monday note.
Lausanne-headquartered Galderma, whose products include injectable aesthetics and Cetaphil facewash, meanwhile, said that it does not produce in Switzerland and is currently largely excluded from global tariffs under pharma exemptions.
However, its large production capacity in the European Union, U.K. and Canada could be subject to higher levies, potentially hitting consumer costs.
Luxury
Higher import duties are also seen pushing up the price of luxury goods, including Richemont-owned high-end jewelry brands Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels.
BofA Securities said in a note Tuesday that 7% of Richemont's input costs would be exposed to higher Swiss tariffs, likely adding to higher consumer prices. ""Price increases would be the most obvious way to mitigate the headwind,"" the analysts wrote.
Richemont did not respond to CNBC's request for comment on the 39% rate, however it flagged in its first-quarter earnings that tariffs could lead to ""increased prices,"" which could impact consumer demand.
Lombard Odier noted that a ""small fraction"" of luxury exports could see demand for their products increase with price, but broadly price hikes were set to hurt consumer demand.
Chocolate
Roger Wehrli, director of Swiss chocolatiers' manufacturing association Chocosuisse, said a 39% tariff rate would be passed on via prices and cause a steep loss of U.S. business for many of the group's members. The recent appreciation of the Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar, which causes imports to become more expensive, means the effective price increase would be closer to 55%, he noted.
The main impact will be on small- and medium-sized businesses that are unable to utilize U.S. production sites like big multinationals can, Wehrli said. Industry juggernauts Lindt & Sprüngli and Barry Callebaut already have factories stateside, while smaller Chocosuisse members such as Camille Bloch and Läderach produce exclusively in Switzerland.
""There's another specific problem with producing in the United States,"" Wehrli continued.
""If you want to label your chocolate as Swiss then it has to be produced in Switzerland. That's a quality sign in the international market, so you will more or less lose your customers if it's not Swiss origin anymore,"" Wehrli told CNBC.
These rules of origin forced Toblerone, owned by U.S. group Mondelez International, to change its packaging in 2023 to refer to itself as being ""established in Switzerland"" rather than ""Swiss chocolate"" after it moved some of its production from the Swiss capital Bern to Slovakia. CNBC has contacted Mondelez for comment on the impact of tariffs on Toblerone in the U.S.",884ecead2209a689e1e90b7233fb4910,trafilatura,7817,0

Still, the report and conference call weren't enough for us to warm up to this poorly performing stock. Revenue in the three months ended June 30 totaled $1.97 billion, ahead of the $1.7 billion consensus, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at 48 cents, topping estimates by 3 cents, LSEG data showed. Shares of Coterra are up about 0.5% Tuesday, overcoming earlier losses of roughly 2%. The stock entered the session down 6.3% year to date, trailing both the S & P 500's energy sector and the broader index. It's become a difficult environment for prices of both natural gas and oil, hurting Coterra in the process. The stock's fortunes this year turned around the time of President Donald Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, which sent oil prices tumbling as traders recalibrated their expectations for global economic growth. For its part, Coterra's poor earnings report in early May, marked by operational issues in some of its Texas acreage, sparked another leg lower for the stock and cast another pall over shares ever since. Bottom line As far as the numbers go, Coterra reported a solid quarter driven by higher-than-expected total production. But when you step back and consider the bigger picture — the downbeat market for oil and gas prices alongside the operational hiccup that Coterra is working through — it's hard to get too excited about the stock. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, has slipped around 5% year to date, while natural gas futures are down even more. We trimmed our position on July 8 when shares traded above $25 apiece, and we continue to view Coterra as a stock to trim into any potential strength. There was a short-lived rally in oil prices above $70 a barrel when the Israel-Iran conflict intensified in June. But when tensions simmered and crude retreated, so did Coterra's share price. ""You can't outrun your commodity, not if both commodities you're in are bad,"" Jim Cramer said Tuesday. We're reiterating our 3 rating, meaning sell into strength, and lowering our price target on the stock to $28 a share from $30. Commentary As expected, Coterra provided an update on the excessive water levels afflicting some of the wells it drilled in the Harkey sandstone located in Culberson County, Texas. It's part of the massive Permian Basin, the most prolific oil field in the U.S., spanning West Texas and eastern New Mexico. CEO Tom Jorden said some of the design changes that Coterra implemented are working and the water issue appears localized rather than widespread across its Culberson County land. Indeed, new wells drilled in the Harkey nearby the problematic ones are producing without issue, Jorden said. Nevertheless, the remedied Harkey wells are still not producing meaningful oil volumes, and Jorden said Coterra is being ""very conservative"" in its production forecast for them. ""We are full steam ahead on Harkey and really do look forward to getting this problem behind us,"" the CEO said. Across its entire Permian portfolio, Coterra said it still intends keep nine rigs running this year — in line with its late June update to investors when it walked back plans to drop down to seven. Additionally, Coterra is standing by its previously announced plans to run two rigs in the natural gas-focused Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, as well as one to two rigs in Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin. Coterra's desire to maintain consistent activity levels stands in contrast to national trends, with rig counts across the U.S. trending down, according to weekly data from oilfield services provider Baker Hughes . Jorden defended Coterra's approach on the conference call with investors, emphasizing that is has ""deep inventory of low-cost assets."" He added, ""Our long-term goal ... isn't production. It's generating free cash flow and demonstrating to the market that we have durability there. One of the things that our asset complexion and our mixture gives us the luxury of is having stable cash flow and having the ability to ride through the cycles."" One interesting nugget in Coterra's earnings release: The company struck a natural gas supply agreement with a forthcoming power plant — the CPV Basin Ranch Energy Center — being built in the Permian Basin. The seven-year deal to sell 50 million standard cubic feet (MMcf) worth of natural gas per day is slated to begin in 2028. Coterra said this is its first supply agreement in the Permian. It has two such deals in the Marcellus. Analysts at Mizuho Securities said in note to clients that Coterra's Permian deal could be a ""potentially attractive opportunity"" to increase the amount of money it makes on gas produced in that region. These types of deals usually include an agreed-upon price that is different than the market price, which in this case would the Waha Hub in West Texas. ""We're really thrilled to have it from a pricing standpoint,"" Jorden said, though he noted that it another benefit is Coterra will receive the ability to also buy power from the plant once it's online. ""And availability of power is a growing concern in the Permian Basin, so that really ticks both those boxes."" A side note: Fellow Club name GE Vernova, which makes the gas turbines used to generate electricity, is involved with the development of the Basin Ranch project. GE Vernova has seen a surge in orders for its turbines thanks to the boom in AI-focused data center construction and the related uptick in electricity consumption. The Texas market, in particular, is expected to see ""rapid"" electricity demand growth, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration . 2025 guidance Coterra updated some parts of its full-year guidance. All estimates are from FactSet. Capex of $2.3 billion, which would be at the high end of its new $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion range. Its previous guidance issued in May called for $2 billion to $2.3 billion, or $2.15 billion at the midpoint. Free cash flow of roughly $2.1 billion, down from its prior projection of $2.7 billion. However, the revised figure still came in modestly above Wall Street expectations. Total equivalent production of 755 to 780 Mboe/d. The midpoint of the range is 768 Mboe/d, up 3.8% from previous guidance and ahead of the 752.7 Mboe/d consensus.Mboe/d stands for thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Natural gas production in the range of 2,875 to 2,950 MMcf/d, resulting in a midpoint of 2,913, which is up about 5% from the previous guidance and matches the Street consensus. Oil production in the range of 157 to 163 Mbo/d. The midpoint of 160 is unchanged from its prior forecast and in line with consensus. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CTRA and GEV.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +1.15%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +1.40%.
Stock indexes are moving sharply higher today as they recover from some of last Friday’s steep losses. Strength in the Magnificent Seven technology stocks and semiconductor chip makers is supporting the broader market. Additionally, the expectation that last Friday’s dismal payroll and ISM manufacturing reports will prompt the Fed to lower interest rates is underpinning equity prices. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 90% from 40% before the reports were released.
Today’s US economic news was mixed for stocks. US June factory orders fell -4.8% m/m, right on expectations and the biggest decline in more than 5 years. However, June factory orders ex-transportation rose +0.4% m/m, stronger than the expectations of +0.3% m/m and the largest increase in 7 months.
In the latest tariff news, President Trump last Thursday raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
The markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. On Tuesday, the June trade deficit is expected to narrow to -$61.1 billion from -$71.5 billion in May. Also on Tuesday, the July ISM services index is expected to climb by +0.7 to 51.5. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 221,000. Also on Thursday, Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be +2.0% with unit labor costs rising +1.5%.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 90% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 76% at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Q2 earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +4.5% for the second quarter, better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 66% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 82% exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up sharply by +1.30%. China’s Shanghai Composite rebounded from a 2-week low and closed up +0.66%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 fell to a 1.5-week low and closed down -1.25%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up +1 tick. The 10-year T-note yield is down -0.4 bp to 4.212%. Sep T-notes today recovered from overnight losses and rallied to a 3-month nearest-futures high, and the 10-year T-note yield fell to a 1-month low of 4.196%.
T-notes have positive carryover support from last Friday’s weaker-than-expected payroll and ISM manufacturing reports, which boosted the chance of a Fed rate cut at next month’s FOMC meeting to 90% from 40% before the reports. Also, today’s -1% drop in WTI crude oil prices has reduced inflation expectations, a bullish factor for T-notes. In addition, today’s strength in European government bonds is providing carryover support to T-notes.
Gains in T-notes are limited by a rebound in equity markets, which curbs safe-haven demand for government securities. Also, supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $125 billion of T-notes and T-bonds in this week’s August quarterly refunding, beginning with Tuesday’s $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes.
European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.627% and is down -4.7 bp to 2.632%. The 10-year UK gilt yield dropped to a 1-month low of 4.501% and is down -2.2 bp to 4.506%.
The Eurozone Aug Sentix investor confidence index unexpectedly fell -8.2 to -3.7, weaker than expectations of an increase to 6.9.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 16% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
US Stock Movers
Strength in the Magnificent Seven technology stocks is supporting gains in the broader market. Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT) are up more than +2%.
Also, Tesla (TSLA) and Meta Platforms (META) are up more than +1%.
Chip stocks are moving higher today, a supportive factor for the overall market. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is up more than +3%. Also, Marvell Technology (MRVL), KLA Corp (KLAC), and Broadcom (AVGO) are up more than +2%. In addition, Micron Technology (MU), Lam Research (LRCX), and ASML Holding NV (ASML) are up more than +1%.
Steelcase (SCS) is up more than +59% after being acquired by HNI for $2.2 billion or about $18.30 per share.

By Andrea Shalal and Davide Barbuscia
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Donald Trump's move to fire the head of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has put trust in U.S. data reporting mechanisms on the line just as demand for reliable diagnoses of the health of the world's largest economy is bigger than ever.
Examples from elsewhere show credibility is easily lost and hard to restore. A first test will be the choice to replace Erika McEntarfer, accused without evidence by Trump of manipulating U.S. job numbers after weaker-than-expected growth and large downward revisions were reported last week.
""Imagine if one of your concerns is that there's a lackey in charge of the agency and the numbers are fake,"" said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, of an appointment Trump has said to expect within days.
""That's a whole other level of problems.""
Policymakers, businesses and investors are scrambling to understand how Trump's attempt to up-end the global trade system will affect prices, employment and household wealth. Central banks, which once tried to guide market bets on rate moves months down the line, now say decisions are ""data-dependent.""
The rub is that data collection is proving to be harder. Debt-laden governments have, as McEntarfer experienced, cut resources in their data departments; phone surveys, the go-to method for much macro research, are struggling to produce adequate samples as many households do without fixed lines.
Trump's implicit accusation of partisanship by ""this Biden Political Appointee"" adds the troubling factor of a political dimension usually indicative of countries dogged by wider doubts over their democratic checks and balances.
The key lesson from past examples of loss of data confidence is that it can take years for trust to be restored.
'MAN-MADE' NUMBERS
When Argentina last year reported its first single-digit inflation in months, sceptics questioned the data and recalled the massive underreporting of inflation in the 2000s and 2010s for which it was censured by the International Monetary Fund.
""They manipulated the data for a long time,"" said Aldo Abram of libertarian think tank Liberty and Progress Foundation in Buenos Aires. ""It's logical people remember this and continue having doubts.""
Turkey has changed the head of its TUIK statistics institute four times since 2019, with opposition parties arguing the changes were political. Roger Mark, fixed income analyst at asset manager Ninety One, said the result for investors has been a ""gradual erosion of our trust in the numbers.""
For Greece, whose efforts during the 2000s to conceal mounting public deficits fed that decade's sovereign debt crisis, it has been an equally long haul back to credibility.
It required the overhaul of its ELSTAT statistics agency in 2016 and the creation of an international panel of experts to appoint its chief statistician - steps that have meant its hard-fought efforts to improve its budget are now unquestioned.
It also prompted European governments to grant the Eurostat statistics arm of the European Union powers to check suspect national statistics reported to it.
Longstanding doubts over the accuracy of Chinese statistics - with even former Premier Li Keqiang acknowledging in 2007 the country's output figures were man-made - have obscured genuine efforts to improve data quality, such as a new measure of youth unemployment excluding students that was released early in 2024.
""There were genuine methodological reasons for the change, but because of the history around Chinese data a lot of people, particularly foreign investors, just didn't really trust that,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, an analyst with Capital Economics.
""That underscores to me that once you undermine confidence in the data, it is quite hard to restore that confidence.""
SPOILS SYSTEM
Faced over the years with patchy official data, watchers of emerging economies have long sought to corroborate those numbers with other datasets. Capital Economics' China Activity Proxy is based on 18 indicators from freight traffic to electricity consumption.
Another metric is found in the data and sentiment surveys provided by independent researchers in all the big economies. But they can only sketch in one perspective on the picture.
""An awful lot of it is soft data: 'How do you feel? What do you think's going on?'"" said Erik Weisman, chief economist and portfolio manager at MFS Investment Management in Boston.
""They're not asking for specifics. They're not asking, how many widgets did you produce? How many insurance policies did you produce? How many hours worked?,"" he said, adding that the concerns raised by the sacking of McEntarfer could nonetheless force analysts to turn increasingly to those other sources.
The most urgent question now is whether the breach in credibility which the Trump intervention has opened is now widened further or mended.
Enrico Giovannini, former chief statistician for the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), said there was more scope in the U.S. for political appointments of key statistics roles than in other advanced economies which tended to make long, fixed-term appointments.
""So the incoming government has to wait (to replace them), said Giovannini, who has also served in two Italian governments. ""In the U.S., the spoils system works,"" he said of the practice of party supporters getting rewarded with government jobs.
The International Statistical Institute, a professional organization for data collectors, issued a statement late on Monday that said Trump's move violated U.N. principles aimed at protecting fact-based statistics and called on his government to take steps to restore public confidence in U.S. federal data.
William Wiatrowski, the BLS' deputy commissioner, will serve as acting commissioner until a successor to McEntarfer is named.
Beyond that choice, some fear that further dangers may emerge from a Trump executive order on federal hiring intended to reserve posts for candidates who can prove they are ""dedicated to the furtherance of American ideals, values, and interests.""
Aaron Sojourner, a senior researcher at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, said such a move would, unless blocked by Congress, apply to many jobs in federal economic statistical agencies.
""This proposal would convert many of those jobs into political jobs where people can be fired for any reason if they displease a political leader,"" Sojourner said.

Market moves : Wall Street on Tuesday was having a hard time keeping Monday's rally going. The S & P 500 spent much of the afternoon in the red, one day after making back much of Friday's 1.6% drop. Weak jobs data was the reason for Friday's decline, but also the reason behind the near 90% market odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. During Tuesday morning's CNBC interview, President Donald Trump was asked about the jobs numbers, and he stood by his assertion that the jobs numbers were rigged to make him look bad. Trump also said pharma tariffs could go up to 250% and that semiconductor levies could come as soon as next week . The president also said four people are being considered for Fed chair. He said, ""Both Kevins are very good,"" referring to speculation about former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the current National Economic Council director and a key Trump advisor. ""There are other people that are very good, too,"" Trump said, adding, however, that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent does not want the Fed job. M & A ranking : Goldman Sachs was No. 1 in mergers and acquisitions (M & A) so far in 2025, according to new LSEG data. For the first seven months of the year, the Club holding was the top global M & A financial advisor by both number and value of deals. Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan followed. Combined M & A value for Goldman jumped 54% year to date over the same time frame in 2024. The Wall Street powerhouse grabbed 32% of market share, according to LSEG. There were significant improvements for fellow Club name Wells Fargo , too. The bank jumped to seventh place in this year's M & A rankings, up from 16th last year. The influx of deals for Goldman and Wells is a part of a broader M & A pickup. Global M & A reached $2.36 trillion during the first seven months of the year, a 35% increase from the year prior, according to LSEG. While the overall price tag of the deals went up, the number of actual deals announced over the seven-month period hit a five-year low. So, fewer deals but much bigger swings. There have been five high-profile M & A transactions, worth at least $10 billion or more, announced in July alone. They include last week's announcement of Union Pacific 's proposed merger with rival Norfolk Southern for $85 billion. Wells Fargo is an advisor on the deal. Goldman was tapped to help Baker Hughes buy Chart Industries for $13.6 billion, according to a July 29 company announcement. Overall, the rebound in Wall Street dealmaking is great news for Goldman Sachs because investment banking is a crucial business for the firm. It's also a key reason why the Club first started a position earlier this year. Additionally, Wells Fargo moving up in the M & A ranks is a sign that management's expansion into investment banking is paying off. Although Wells is known as a Main Street lender, we like that the firm is diversifying its revenue streams to not rely so heavily on interest-based income streams. Now that the 2018 Federal Reserve-imposed $1.95 trillion asset cap has been removed, Wells Fargo can grow its nascent IB business and others, even further. Tariff update : Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur told CNBC Tuesday that the impact of the next wave of tariffs remains unknown. But roughly five weeks into the third quarter, Kapur said he has not seen any tariff impact that would change the earnings-per-share (EPS) outlook that the company issued nearly two weeks ago as part of its second quarter financials. Management raised Honeywell's full-year outlook for revenue , organic sales growth, and adjusted EPS during earnings on July 24. Since then, however, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that updated import duties between 10% to 41% for dozens of countries, which are set to go into effect in two days. Kapur said trade policy updates are ""a new factor that's coming in,"" but that ""so far we haven't seen any impact"" beyond the scope mentioned on the post-earnings call. ""That's why we remain confident of the earnings guide that we gave,"" he added. Kapur's remarks come ahead of Honeywell's spinoff into three standalone entities — a process expected to be completed by the end of 2026. Automation will stay with the current Honeywell, and aerospace and advanced materials will be split off. The CEO said the ""spinoffs are progressing on time"" as well. This is reassuring news for investors like us. That's because for over a year, Jim has insisted that Honeywell needs to dramatically reshape its portfolio of far-flung businesses. Not only did Honeywell's organic revenue growth continue to disappoint Wall Street in recent years, but its shares have lagged compared to peers as well. We think this will change once Honeywell's break-up is finished, as the Street starts to see the quality fundamentals in each standalone company. That being said, don't expect many more significant portfolio moves from Honeywell. ""We have majorly completed our portfolio transformation work,"" Kapur said.

We have to deal with a phrase that many market watchers just love to hate. Stocks are mixed this afternoon.
What that means is that the Dow Jones transports are higher; thank lower oil prices for that. So, too, are the S&P Midcap 400 and Small Cap 600 and the Russell 2000 Index.
At the same time, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the Nasdaq Composite and more narrow indexes like the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index are all lower.
And so we have a market that may be better described as ""waiting."" That is, waiting for clarity on economic trends, consumer behavior, the real terms of tariff deals and, yes, lower interest rates.
At 3:55 p.m. EDT, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 0.3% at 6,302. The Nasdaq Composite Index was off 0.6% to 20,931. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 0.1% to 44,111.
The market had opened higher, following Monday's rally, but the Institute of Supply Management stalled the progress with a weak report of the health of the services economy .
Palantir Technologies (PLTR) was up 7.9% to $173.30, but Nvidia NVDA was off 0.9% to $178.39. Tesla (TSLA) was flat at $309.22; European sales were off again. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) added 3.7% to $250.

Only 4 S&P 500 sectors higher today
Stocks continued to struggle after a bearish report on the economy.
The pullback was surprising, given Monday's huge rally. But a look into the sectors of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index offer clues.
Only four of the 11 indexes is higher on Tuesday with Consumer Discretionary stock the top sector.
This group includes Carmax (KMX) , Amazon.com (AMZN) , and then a host of housing-related stocks, including D.R. Horton (DHI) , PulteGroup (PHM) , Lowe's Companies (LOW) , Lennar (LEN) and Home Depot (HD) .
The catalyst moving them: a decline in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.193, down slightly from Monday and down from 4.61% in May.
Technology, Utilities and Energy are the weak links. Energy reflects crude oil, down 73 cents to $65.55 a barrel..

Stock Market Today: Algorithms Are Not Efficient
I began my career not in journalism but on the New York Stock Exchange. Technically, I wasn't on the floor, but I worked 16 stories above it, trading through a network of brokers who were on the floor.
I was there in trading activity, if not in body.
It probably shows in my writing. Back in those days some 1,300 traders plus support staff made up the crowds where stocks were traded and prices were discovered.
It was a loud and active place, where price efficiency ruled.
Today, the NYSE floor is an empty place. Market makers still work there, but price discovery happens largely through computers.
This is what the floor looks like today:
In today's Market Recon piece over on TheStreet Pro, Stephen ""Sarge"" Guilfoyle discusses the trading action from Friday and Monday, and tells us that both Friday and Monday were overshoots from where the market should have traded.
He says:
""On Monday, U.S. equity markets absolutely roared back from a harsh selloff on Friday. On Friday, the algorithms that run price discovery in 2025 sold stocks en masse because of a recessionary looking labor report that was really three consecutive recessionary-looking labor reports at once. On Monday, those same algorithms bought the market hand over fist because now the Fed will likely have to cut short-term interest rates in six weeks.""
He goes on to say that this game of ""Chutes and Ladders"" is occurring because we've removed humans from the art of price discovery and replaced them with algorithms. While the market is much cheaper to run (spreads are down), markets are less efficient. In other words, day-to-day volatility might be lower, but reaction to news is much harsher.
I couldn't agree more.
Sarge also tells us that Wall Street strategists have turned bearish. They see a lethal combination of softening economic data and sky-high valuations. Perhaps ""lethal"" is a strong word. More accurately, they see a dip on the horizon that they feel will be worth buying.
But the reason why I'm quoting Sarge so much today is that he more succinctly than anybody has listed the four reasons that valuations are high and deserve to be.
Lower taxes
Less regulation
Expected lower interest rates
Increased productivity (on a per-employee basis) driven by artificial intelligence.
It all comes down to potential corporate growth and reduced expenses. Demand for workers probably will drop, however, which could be a net negative for economic growth.
How is the stock market looking this morning? Slightly up.
S&P 500 futures are higher by 0.12%, while Nasdaq futures are up 0.27%.
It's still earnings season and several major companies have reported this morning.
After market close, we await reports from AMD, Super Micro Computer, and others, including EV makers Rivian and Lucid.",67f16756f1b556141f47ec8d21b453ed,trafilatura,6377,0

The announcement — following a Supreme Court ruling last Friday — reintroduces significant financial and operational uncertainty for motor finance providers. While the FCA said most drivers would receive no more than £950 each, the total cost to the industry is now estimated at between £9 billion and £18 billion.
Paul Hollick, Chair of the Association of Fleet Professionals (AFP), said: “We’ve gone from a situation on Friday where the Supreme Court verdicts suggested the worst risks for the motor finance sector had been removed, to one on Monday morning where the FCA’s intervention has reintroduced the possibility of quite widespread reparations.”
The FCA’s move relates to discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs), which allowed dealers to set interest rates on car finance agreements and pocket the difference as commission — often without the customer's knowledge. These practices were banned in 2021, but many were in place across millions of loans issued between 2007 and 2021.
FCA Chief Executive Nikhil Rathi said: “It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It’s fair for their customers to be compensated.” He added that the FCA aims to build a scheme that is “fair and easy to participate in,” with no need for consumers to use a lawyer or claims management company (CMC). “If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get,” he warned.
Industry pushback
However, several industry figures questioned the FCA’s legal and practical basis for retrospective compensation — particularly when many firms operated within then-accepted frameworks.
Paul Bennett, a consultant with Madox Square Advisory, was cited on LinkedIn as saying: “This statement leaves me somewhat perplexed because, until discretionary charges were banned in 2021, financiers in concert with their introducers operated within the law. As such, how can firms be penalised in 2025 for what was accepted business practice until 2021?”
Stephen Haddrill, Director General of the Finance & Leasing Association (FLA), expressed concern over the FCA’s intention to look as far back as 2007. “We have concerns about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007 when firms have not been required to hold such dated information, and the evidence base will be patchy at best.”
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: “I just think that is completely impractical. It is not just firms that don’t have the details about contracts back then, customers don’t either.”
Dealers urged to review historical agreements
Jonathan Butler, legal counsel at the Vehicle Remarketing Association (VRA) and partner at Geldards, said: “We shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that this is good news for dealers and lenders” given that the exposure is far less than the £44 billion feared. However, he warned of extensive preparatory work ahead.
“Dealers and lenders are now in a position where they can start to calculate their exposure. They should be tracking down all relevant paperwork dating back to the 2007 cut-off point,” Butler said.
He also flagged potential legal minefields in legacy dealer agreements: “Dealers need to read their old contracts with motor finance providers to check there is no form of indemnity in place that protects the lender in the event of claims of the type now envisaged. These did sometimes exist and, if enforced, may cause issues.”
Butler added that the redress scheme could be hampered by evidentiary complexity: “The Johnson-type threshold is actually a value judgment... These are highly fact sensitive matters and not questions that... could be easily answered using anything other than an arbitrary and automated process. It needs qualified people to make assessments... that is potentially an enormous task.”
CMC industry faces collapse
The FCA’s announcement is also likely to have a profound effect on the claims management sector, which had anticipated a much wider liability ruling from the Supreme Court.
John Perez, Partner and Head of Finance Litigation at DWF, said: “The CMC industry that has emerged in pursuing these claims on mass will likely now collapse.” He explained that under the ruling, “any continuing claims will all be fact dependant on the nature of the individual transactions,” meaning the days of high-volume, generic CMC-driven claims are effectively over.
Perez noted the court’s ruling in Canada Square v Johnson clarified that “no disclosure of commission or partial disclosure of commission will not in itself render the relationship unfair.” Instead, courts must evaluate multiple factors — including the size of the commission relative to the total credit cost (as in the Johnson case, where it was 55%) and whether the dealer made misleading representations.
He suggested the FCA may borrow from the approach taken in the PPI and Plevin redress schemes, potentially setting a commission threshold — such as 50% of the total charge for credit — above which redress would be automatic.
Retail perspective: fairness and stability needed
Sue Robinson, Chief Executive of the National Franchised Dealers Association (NFDA), welcomed the Supreme Court’s judgment and its recognition of the sector’s submissions. “As the consumer facing part of the sector, NFDA want to see the regulator act fairly to ensure that UK consumers receive a satisfactory result. This has been achieved today,” she said.
Robinson emphasised the importance of a stable retail environment, noting that “automotive retail accounts for approximately 78% of the broader automotive workforce.”

While the market has rebounded to new heights and many growth businesses have recovered spectacularly, results have varied by individual stock.
As always, it's important to look beyond a stock's price and see what's happening behind the scenes. A share price may be up or down for a good reason, but you need to understand the factors driving these movements before you hit the buy button.
On that note, here are two top growth stocks to consider if you have cash to invest right now.
1. Intuitive Surgical
Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG) has been known for its pioneering role in robotic-assisted surgery with the da Vinci surgical system since its first platform was approved more than two decades ago. The da Vinci system provides surgeons with enhanced dexterity, precision, and control during minimally invasive procedures including thoracic, gynecologic, and general surgeries.
These systems allow for a wider range of motion than the human hand and wrist, translating surgeon movements into precise instrument actions within a patient's body. This is particularly helpful for complex procedures in confined spaces, but can also improve surgery outcomes, shorten recovery time, and reduce the risk of adverse complications.
Intuitive Surgical's revenue comes from three different sources: system sales, instruments and accessories, and services. What might be surprising is that Intuitive's most significant revenue stream is selling instruments and accessories such as forceps, scissors, scalpels, drapes, and vision products. Once a da Vinci system is installed in a hospital, each surgery performed using that system requires these specialized instruments and accessories, many of which are single-use or need to be replaced after a set number of uses.
Of course, as systems can cost $1 million or more apiece, one-time sales, as well as usage-based or lease-type sales of systems, are a key driver of revenue.
Finally, the services business encompasses the comprehensive support provided to customers, including installation, maintenance, and repair of surgical systems. Intuitive typically includes service contracts with the initial sale of a da Vinci system, providing ongoing revenue through annual fees. These contracts can vary in price depending on the system configuration and the scope of services included.
The company's new da Vinci 5 platform is now broadly available in the U.S., and limited launches are starting in Europe and Japan after receiving the necessary regulatory clearances. The da Vinci 5 system has been well-received so far, with over 100,000 procedures already performed since its initial approval in the U.S. in early 2024.
Intuitive Surgical's revenue growth for the first half of 2025 totaled $4.69 billion, a healthy 20% increase from the $3.9 billion it reported in the first half of 2024. Net income for the first six months of 2025 came to $1.4 billion, up 27% on a year-over-year basis. And the average consensus 12-month price target from analysts suggests a potential upside of approximately 20% from current share prices.
If you're a long-term investor who wants a piece of the action of a top-notch healthcare stock, definitely consider Intuitive Surgical.
2. Cava Group
Cava Group(NYSE: CAVA) is a fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain that offers customizable bowls, salads, and pitas with a focus on fresh, healthy ingredients. The company also produces and sells a line of Mediterranean dips, spreads, and dressings available in grocery stores. Cava has been a standout example of a fast-casual restaurant that's expanding gradually and strategically without sacrificing its financial health.
In fact, Cava's financials keep looking better and better. Revenue reached $329 million in the first quarter of its fiscal 2025, a 28% increase compared to the same period last year. Same-store sales also increased by 10.8% in Q1, while Cava opened 15 new restaurants in the three-month period alone. That rate of expansion brought its restaurant total to 382 locations across 26 states and the District of Columbia.
The company is also building a consistent track record of profitability. Its Q1 net income of nearly $26 million was almost double that of the previous year. And Cava is targeting 1,000 restaurants by 2032, a significant expansion of its current footprint.
Importantly, restaurant-level profit of $82.3 million was up 27.4% in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, and restaurant-level profit margin was 25.1%. These are impressive figures for a fast-casual restaurant that's still in the relatively early stages of its growth story.
Cava has shown resilience in navigating macroeconomic headwinds by focusing on strategic pricing, guest engagement, and operational excellence. The restaurant stock seems to be resonating with consumers, providing a strong value proposition in a sector of the restaurant industry that's highly competitive and fragmented.
If you have the risk appetite to invest in a business operating in a more cyclical consumer-facing space, Cava looks like a quality buy to consider right now.

This past week, the company grabbed headlines with blowout second-quarter earnings, raised full-year guidance, and clear signs that it is chipping away at legacy banks’ market share.
The post-earnings surge was followed by a dip on news of a $1.5 billion public share offering. However, SOFI stock has regained its footing, still above the $21 level seen before the July 29 earnings release.
With strong revenue acceleration, improving profitability, and a capital-light model gaining traction, SoFi’s core engine looks well-tuned. Still, with its high valuation and a few skeptics on Wall Street, investors are left wondering — especially after this wild week — whether it's too late to grab SOFI stock.
About SoFi Stock
Founded in 2011, San Francisco-based SoFi is rewriting the personal finance playbook with sleek technology and bold execution. With more than 11 million members, it spans lending, financial services, and a robust tech platform across the U.S. and beyond. SoFi’s all-in-one digital ecosystem is shaking up legacy banking, proving that fintech is already here. Its market capitalization currently stands at $23.5 billion.
SOFI stock has surged 197% over the past 52 weeks and risen 70% in the last three months, breaking out to a new 52-week high of $25.11 on July 29 following strong Q2 results and raised guidance. That said, the rally paused after a $1.5 billion equity offering triggered dilution concerns.
Technically, volume remains elevated, and RSI has pulled back from overbought levels, signaling a possible consolidation phase within a still-intact bullish trend structure.
SoFi’s overall rally is hard to ignore, but its price tag is not for the faint-hearted. Trading at 71 times forward earnings and 9.3 times sales, it is well above that of the legacy banks. That’s premium pricing, no question. But SoFi is not chasing old-school playbooks — it is scaling fast, stacking users, and rewriting the digital finance script. Sure, it's expensive. But if investors are betting on the future of fintech, the recent dip could be their shot before the next leg higher.
SoFi's Record Q2 Results and Sharper Outlook
On July 29, SoFi delivered a Q2 report that didn’t just beat expectations, but smashed them. The company posted adjusted revenue of $858.2 million, up 44% year-over-year (YOY), while adjusted net income rocketed 459% to $97.3 million. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.08, a sevenfold increase from the $0.01 reported a year ago.
The growth was not limited to the top and bottom lines. SoFi added 850,000 new members, pushing its total to 11.7 million, and also racked up 1.26 million new products, bringing the tally to 17.1 million. Both of these figures rose 34% YOY. Fee-based revenue jumped 72% to $377.5 million, led by SoFi’s Loan Platform Business, which originated $2.4 billion in third-party loans and pulled in $130.6 million in revenue on its own.
Lending was a clear standout. The company funded a record $8.8 billion in loans, including personal loan originations which rose 66% annually, student loans which grew 35%, and home lending which soared 92%. On the tech side, SoFi's Galileo and Apex platforms brought in nearly $110 million, up 15%, while SoFi also stepped back into crypto and teased new AI-driven initiatives aimed at improving operational efficiency and member experience.
Fueled by the blowout quarter, SoFi raised its full-year 2025 outlook. Management now expects adjusted net revenue of $3.375 billion, up from the previous guidance range of $3.235 billion to $3.31 billion. That implies 30% annual growth. Adjusted EBITDA is projected at $960 million as well, up from a prior $875 million to $895 million range, with margins climbing to 28%. Net income is now forecast at $370 million, and full-year EPS is guided to be $0.31, both topping earlier estimates.
Wall Street seems aligned with these expectations. Analysts believe SoFi will post 2025 EPS of $0.32, marking 113% annual growth, with another 75% lift to $0.56 expected in 2026. If SoFi can stay the course, it's setting up for a potential breakout year.
What Do Analysts Expect for SoFi Stock?
Wall Street’s outlook on SoFi after Q2 earnings is a mix of optimism and caution. Jefferies analyst John Hecht remains firmly in the bullish camp, having lifted his price target to $27 with a “Buy” rating. Hecht sees SoFi’s beat-and-raise quarter as reflecting momentum that could carry through to year-end.
Meanwhile, Mizuho has doubled down on SoFi, boosting the price target to $26 from $20 and reaffirming an “Outperform” rating. The firm praised SoFi’s “very strong” Q2 across all key metrics, spotlighting $9.5 billion in annualized lending volume and 90% growth in home lending as major strengths, especially in a weak housing market. Mizuho also bumped its 2025 revenue forecast to $3.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA forecast to $965 million.
Still, others are pumping the brakes. BTIG kept a “Hold"" on SOFI stock, noting that the recent rally might already reflect most of the good news. BTIG acknowledged upside in SoFi’s crypto and investment products, but questioned its ability to scale fast enough to seriously rival players like Robinhood (HOOD).
TD Cowen analyst Moshe Orenbuch echoed that caution, keeping a “Hold” and $22 target. The analyst praised SoFi’s platform momentum and strategic partnerships but warned of slower growth ahead.
Despite SoFi’s Q2 blowout, not everyone on Wall Street is buying the hype. SOFI stock has an overall consensus “Hold” rating. Out of 23 analysts covering the fintech stock, only five advise a “Strong Buy” rating and two recommend a “Moderate Buy.” Meanwhile, 11 analysts play it safe with a “Hold,” two mark SOFI as a “Moderate Sell,” and three recommend a “Strong Sell"" rating.
SoFi is showing no signs of slowing down and has already surged past the average analyst price target of $18.52.

The company announced the new plan in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday, emphasizing its goal to incentivize Musk to focus on Tesla. The new accord, valued at $29.1 billion as of Friday's market close, must be approved by Tesla’s shareholders. It would act as an alternative method to pay Musk in the event that his original pay deal, first reached in 2018, is ultimately struck down in court.
Musk has not been paid under his original deal.
“Today we announce an important first step in compensating Elon Musk for his extraordinary work at Tesla,” the company’s directors Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, who approved the plan, wrote in a letter to shareholders.
“As you know, Elon has not received meaningful compensation for eight years since the 2012 CEO Performance Award was last earned in 2017,” the board members added. “To recognize what Elon has accomplished and the extraordinary value he delivered to Tesla and our shareholders, we believe we must take action to honor the bargain that was struck in 2018.”
Musk's 2018 compensation plan granted him the option to purchase a total of 304 million Tesla shares at $23.34 per share, only on the condition that Tesla met the plan's market capitalization, revenue and profit milestones. In December 2021, Musk reached the last of 12 milestones. At the time, the shares were worth roughly $95 billion but would have cost Musk approximately $7 billion.
Tesla's stock came under pressure on July 24 after the company posted an earnings and revenue miss in the second quarter. Musk hinted at a ""few rough quarters"" amid sagging sales. For the second quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $22.50 billion versus $22.64 billion expected, per Bloomberg consensus. The revenue decrease was 12% lower than Tesla's second quarter last year, when it brought in $25.05 billion.
The new compensation plan grants Musk 96 million Tesla shares of common stock at $23.34 per share so long as he remains in continuous service until Aug. 3, 2027, as CEO or as an executive officer of Tesla responsible for product development or operations. The share grant, which matches the exercise price of his 2018 CEO award, is also subject to a mandatory holding period of five years from the grant date, except to cover tax payments or the purchase price of the shares.
If the Delaware Supreme Court overturns the Delaware Chancery Court’s decision to invalidate the 2018 plan in a non-appealable judgment, any shares granted to Musk under the new plan must be immediately forfeited and returned to Tesla. The case is pending before the court, and there is no set date for a ruling.
Musk’s original pay plan was thrown into question when a Tesla shareholder sued the company in June 2018, alleging that the shareholder vote that approved the plan was invalid.
Delaware Chancery Court judge Kathaleen McCormick agreed with the claim and denied the compensation package once in January 2024 and again for a second time in December, after Tesla shareholders reapproved it.
The ruling raised new concerns about Musk's motivations to give as much time as he has to Tesla.
Even before the 2018 pay package was invalidated by the Delaware court, Musk's attention was divided between his ventures SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), X.com (formerly Twitter), and the Boring Co., among other pursuits. That attention was further divided in January when Musk joined the Trump administration to launch the budget-cutting endeavor DOGE.
The novel question at the heart of the ongoing lawsuit could not only validate or invalidate Musk's original pay deal but could remake the rules of corporate law: Can stockholders ever overrule a judge?
Chancellor McCormick initially voided Musk’s 2018 pay pact because of what she called ""extensive ties"" between Musk and the Tesla board members negotiating the pay package and a lack of public disclosure about Musk’s relationships with those who approved the deal.
She ruled that Musk, a minority owner of Tesla, held enough influence over the electric car company to count as its de facto controlling shareholder, who must be held to a stricter level of legal scrutiny.
When Tesla shareholders approved the pay package a second time in June 2024, Tesla argued that the additional stamp of approval should be enough for McCormick to toss out her initial decision.
A single independent director, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, a former executive at Walgreens Boots Alliance and Kellogg, approved the second package. However, McCormick did not address whether Wilson-Thompson's due diligence fulfilled Delaware's requirements.
One reason Tesla fought to reinstate the original accord rather than fashion a new one is the potential cost to replace it.
In its 2018 proxy statement, Tesla said it took a $2.3 billion accounting charge in connection with the package. Later, in a court filing in the litigation, Tesla said an equivalent deal would require it to take a charge exceeding $25 billion.
That impact on Tesla won't be known until the appeals process plays out.
Denholm and Wilson-Thompson stressed in their letter to Tesla shareholders the importance of retaining and motivating talent in the intensifying war to build AI-powered technology, where nine-figure cash compensation packages for non-founder, individual AI engineers have become a norm.
Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives echoed that message in a note on Monday.
""We believe this grant will now keep Musk as CEO of Tesla at least until 2030 and removes an overhang on the stock,"" Ives said, adding that the Big Tech AI talent wars were fully underway. ""Musk remains Tesla's big asset and this comp issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began.""
This story has been changed to reflect that Tesla's original pay was originally valued at roughly $56 billion and the newly approved plan at $29.1 billion, based on Friday's market close.

The company also reported second-quarter results that topped Wall Street's estimates for the period, as revenue from its Covid products and some other drugs jumped.
Shares of Pfizer rose more than 4% on Tuesday.
Pfizer now expects full-year adjusted profit to come in between $2.90 and $3.10, up from previous guidance of $2.80 to $3 per share. The company maintained its 2025 revenue forecast of $61 billion to $64 billion.
""We raised our full-year 2025 Adjusted diluted EPS guidance, demonstrating confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver strong results for shareholders,"" Pfizer CFO David Denton said in a release.
The full-year outlook includes a one-time charge of $1.35 billion, or 20 cents per share, related to the company's licensing deal with 3SBio, a Chinese drugmaker, to develop and sell its cancer treatment outside of China. That charge will be recorded in the third quarter, Pfizer said.
Without that deal charge, Pfizer would have raised its adjusted profit outlook by 30 cents, Denton said during an earnings call with analysts on Tuesday.
The results also come as Pfizer and other drugmakers grapple with President Donald Trump's calls to lower drug prices in the U.S. and brace for his planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the country.
Pfizer's outlook accounts for Trump's currently imposed tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, as well as potential drug price changes this year based on a letter from the president last week calling on Pfizer to take steps to lower drug prices by Sept. 29. The letter came after Trump in May signed an executive order reviving a controversial plan, the ""most favored nation"" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.
On the call on Tuesday, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to provide more details on the impact of the policy apart from confirming that the company has received the letter and is engaged in ""extremely productive"" conversations with the Trump administration about finding ways to lower U.S. drug prices.
He said the company and the administration are looking for solutions that aim to ""make medicines affordable in the U.S. and, on the other hand, make our industry more competitive compared to China, which is progressing very rapidly to us.""
In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Denton did not disclose specific costs for the impact of the most favored nation plan.
But Denton said the expected costs for existing tariffs in Pfizer's guidance are now less than $100 million. That's due to mitigation efforts such as repositioning inventory in certain locations and advance ordering some medications, he said.
In April, Pfizer executives said the company's 2025 guidance at the time included $150 million in expected costs from Trump's existing tariffs, but not sector-specific levies.
When asked about Trump's threat to eventually impose up to 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals, Denton said the company is looking at all potential ranges when modeling the impact of tariffs.
But he added that ""I think the devil will be in the detail.""
Here's what the company reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:
- Earnings per share: 78 cents adjusted vs. 58 cents expected
- Revenue: $14.65 billion vs. $13.56 billion expected
For the second quarter, Pfizer booked net income of $2.91 billion, or 51 cents per share. That compares with net income of $41 million, or 1 cent per share, during the same period a year ago.
Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 78 cents for the quarter.
Pfizer reported revenue of $14.65 billion for the second quarter, up 10% from the same period a year ago.
The results come after Pfizer in April expanded its cost-cutting efforts, which aim to help the pharmaceutical giant recover from the rapid decline of its Covid business and stock price over the past few years. With the added moves announced in April, Pfizer now expects to deliver around $7.7 billion in savings by the end of 2027 from two separate cost-cutting programs.
Strength from Covid products, other drugs
The company said the increase in sales was primarily driven by higher revenues for several products, including Pfizer's Vyndaqel drugs, which are used to treat a certain type of cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle.
It also includes Pfizer's Covid products. The company's Covid vaccine, Comirnaty, booked $381 million in revenue for the second quarter. That's up 96% from the year-earlier period due to Pfizer's higher market share in the Covid shot market and more contractual deliveries in certain international markets.
Analysts expected the shot to rake in $205.3 million in sales for the quarter, according to StreetAccount estimates.
Pfizer's antiviral Covid pill Paxlovid posted $427 million in sales for the second quarter. That's up 70% from the same period a year ago, primarily due to a higher U.S. net price for the pill, among other factors. That sales increase was offset by lower Covid infections across the U.S. and certain global markets, and lower international government purchases of Paxlovid.
Analysts expected the shot to rake in $259.1 million in sales for the period, StreetAccount estimates said.
Pfizer's bladder cancer drug Padcev and blood thinner Eliquis, which it shares with Bristol Myers Squibb, also contributed to revenue growth. Both topped analysts' estimates for the period.
The company's revenue growth was offset by lower sales from its breast cancer drug Ibrance. The drug had a lower U.S. net price largely due to the impact of higher manufacturer discounts from provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that redesign Medicare Part D benefits, as well as generic competition and the timing of shipments in certain international markets.",9656710019766d71a13ce08eb63c47da,trafilatura,6097,0

Not only have you inherited your parents’ portfolio, you’ve also inherited their long-time advisor. You’ll have to decide for yourself if you should move the money elsewhere or even manage it on your own.
Since the portfolio has strong returns, why fix what ain’t broke? This can be a difficult decision, rife with guilt and obligation, especially if your parents have worked with their advisor for decades.
Understanding your options
Given the size of the portfolio, a financial advisor can assist with portfolio management, investment strategy, performance reporting, and aligning asset allocation with risk tolerance. They can also create a personalized plan to help you meet your retirement goals and adjust the portfolio as needed.
If you’re finding it difficult to make sense of the noise and emotion, now could be the right time to get in touch with a financial advisor through Advisor.com, an online platform that connects people with wealth experts.
Behavioral coaching is one of the most valuable things a financial advisor can offer. A skilled advisor can help ease the negative emotions that arise during financial planning and decision-making.
They do this by “working with you to co-develop a plan with clear, measurable, time-bound goals,” says Kellen Thayer, a financial advisor with Advisor.com.
No matter where you move your money, professional advice isn’t free. Advisors typically charge a percentage of your assets under management (AUM), ranging from 0.50% to 2.00%. A 1.75% fee isn’t out of line for a full-service wealth management firm, meaning that for a $680,000 portfolio, you could pay around $11,900 annually.
With assets under management, the fee serves as an incentive to maximize returns. In other words, growing your assets is in your advisor's best interests. So, if the returns are exceptional, then the higher rate may be worth it.
Alternatively, you might explore other options, such as an annual retainer or flat fee for specific services. A retainer typically costs between $6,000 and $11,000, according to a 2023 Advisory HQ report.
If you prefer to handle some of the money management yourself, you could work with an advisor who charges by the hour or project, with fees ranging from $120 to $300 per hour.
It’s also important you weigh the costs against the long-term benefits. Research demonstrates the significant impact of working with a financial advisor. According to Vanguard's research, people who work with financial advisors see a 3% increase in net returns. This difference can be substantial over time. For instance, starting with a $50,000 portfolio, you could potentially retire with an extra $1.3 million after 30 years of professional guidance.
Robo-advisors charge lower fees, but you (obviously) won’t get the human touch. This is what sets financial advisors apart from robo-advisors. You can’t get the same personal connection and customization with an algorithm as you can with another human.
When you get matched with a financial advisor through Advisor.com, you can schedule a free consultation call with a real person to discuss your financial goals and see if you have a good rapport. This relationship is meant to last over the long haul – years, even decades – with your advisor accompanying you on each phase of your financial journey.
There’s also the possibility of managing the money yourself, but you should be financially literate and feel comfortable enough to invest according to your financial goals.
When tackling investing on your own, it’s easy to miss hidden costs. A good financial advisor can implement a cost-effective portfolio to minimize these costs and maximize overall returns.
“It’s not what you make, it’s what you keep,” Thayer says. “Advisors help you develop a plan, stick to it, and can help you to avoid costly mistakes that may exceed any fees you pay them over the long term.”
A good financial advisor will help you look for investment opportunities that offer low costs and don’t charge hidden fees. Depending on the size of your portfolio, professionals found through Advisor.com charge clients through a flat fee or a percentage of assets under management. Both methods are presented upfront, so you know what to expect.

Finding the right fit
Before deciding to fire your parents' advisor, it’s a good idea to have a detailed conversation to assess if they’re the right fit for your goals.
If you opt to shop around thereafter, you don't have to go it alone. With almost 400,000 financial advisors in the nation, finding one for yourself might be a tall task.
Finding the right advisor for your needs is simple with Advisor.com. Their platform connects you with an experienced and qualified fiduciary advisor in your local area. As they must, by law, put their clients’ interests ahead of their own.
How it works
Get matched with an advisor for free in three easy steps:
Step 1: Answer a few quick questions about yourself and your financial goals
Step 3: Book a free, no-obligation consultation to confirm if your match is right for you
Future needs
If you choose to manage the portfolio yourself, it's important to understand how to build and maintain a diversified portfolio that aligns with your goals. You’ll need to adjust asset allocation as you age and rebalance periodically. In this case, you could also consider paying for hourly or project-based advice when needed.
No matter what you decide, it doesn’t have to be forever.
The key goal is to start building sustainable wealth-building habits, says Thayer. “People often say they will start investing tomorrow, but tomorrow never arrives. A financial advisor can be the accountability partner they need to ensure they don't put off what they know they should be doing until it's too late.”",da4cc8a9ccef7efc5fe256b1c7c320dd,trafilatura,5987,0

If you're looking to invest in real estate without the hassle of managing a property yourself, you're probably deciding between two major options: buying into a REIT (real estate investment trust) or using a platform like Arrived, which lets you invest directly in individual rental homes with as little as $100. On the surface, both offer a way to earn passive income and diversify outside of the stock market. But once you dig into the details, these two options are actually very different—and which one is right for you depends on what kind of investor you are.
REITs are often pitched as the ""set it and forget it"" way to invest in real estate. You buy shares like a stock, and the REIT takes care of owning and managing properties. But you don't get to choose what those properties are, and you typically don't get the same tax benefits or direct ownership perks that come with owning physical real estate. That's where Arrived stands out. It gives you the chance to pick the homes you want to invest in, earn quarterly rental income, and get a share of the appreciation if the home goes up in value—all without ever becoming a landlord.
So which one's better? Let's break it down.
What Is a REIT, and Why Do People Invest in Them?
REITs are publicly traded companies that own and operate income-producing real estate—think office buildings, apartment complexes, shopping centers, and warehouses. When you buy a REIT, you're essentially buying stock in a company that makes its money from collecting rent and managing properties. You don't own any specific property yourself, but you do get paid a portion of the income as dividends, typically on a monthly or quarterly basis.
The upside? Liquidity. You can buy and sell REIT shares just like you would any stock. That makes them easy to trade, easy to diversify, and easy to access through regular brokerage accounts or retirement plans. For many investors, that simplicity is the main draw. You don't need to do much homework or track individual properties—you're trusting the REIT's management team to handle everything behind the scenes.
But here's the tradeoff: when you invest in a REIT, you're buying into a giant pool of assets, and you don't have any say in what those assets are. You're also not treated like a direct owner, which means you miss out on some of the tax benefits—like depreciation and expense write-offs—that come with actual real estate ownership.
Arrived takes a very different approach. Instead of pooling your money into a fund, it lets you invest in individual homes—mostly single-family rentals across the U.S. Each property is owned by an LLC, and you buy shares in that LLC. The minimum investment? Just $100. From there, Arrived takes care of everything: they vet and acquire the home, hire a local property manager, find tenants, collect rent, and handle maintenance. You just collect your portion of the rent as passive income every quarter—and when the property is sold after a 5–7 year hold period, you also get your share of any profits from appreciation.
This structure means you have more control. You pick which homes to invest in. You see full financial projections, including rent estimates, expense breakdowns, and expected returns. You can diversify across cities, types of homes, and even different property strategies (like vacation rentals). And because you're a direct equity holder, you get access to tax benefits that traditional REIT shareholders don't.
The best part? No landlord duties. You don't answer phone calls. You don't fix leaks. You don't even have to think about it. You're earning real estate income from real homes—without the job of owning them.
How They Compare
So which one's better? If you want liquidity and don't care about property-level control, a REIT might make more sense. But if you want to build a real estate portfolio one home at a time, earn rental income with more transparency, and enjoy tax advantages, Arrived gives you far more ownership and far less noise.
The Tax Angle Most Investors Miss
One of the most overlooked differences between REITs and Arrived is how they're treated at tax time. REIT dividends are taxed as ordinary income, and you don't benefit from the property-level deductions or depreciation that traditional landlords enjoy. But with Arrived, because you're technically a member of an LLC that owns a specific property, you can receive a share of the tax benefits.
That includes things like depreciation (which lowers your taxable income on paper), maintenance deductions, and write-offs for capital expenses. Over time, this can add up to meaningful savings—especially if you continue reinvesting your income to grow your portfolio. It’s the kind of benefit you wouldn't think about at first glance, but it’s a real reason why Arrived feels more like property ownership than simply holding a stock.
So, Should You Choose Arrived or a REIT?
There's no universal answer—it depends on what you're optimizing for. If you want real estate exposure with zero commitment, fast liquidity, and the ability to buy and sell with a few clicks, REITs are the easy answer. But if you want deeper ownership, long-term rental income, and more direct control over what you're investing in, Arrived offers something REITs can't: a true stake in actual homes, with real tenants, managed on your behalf for as little as $100.
And while REITs fluctuate with the market just like any stock, Arrived's performance is tied to local rental markets, occupancy rates, and property appreciation—not the S&P 500. That makes it a compelling way to diversify your portfolio and build passive income over time, especially in markets where real estate is holding strong even when stocks don't.",b11ffee3daacae7812fe5db1dd95173d,trafilatura,5826,0
https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/how-an-obscure-sec-proposal-could-boost-listings-on-european-stock-exchanges.html,173db16180f41f6d7413dc67b829a8eb,How an obscure SEC proposal could boost listings on European stock exchanges,How an obscure SEC proposal could boost listings on European stock exchanges,2025-08-05 05:45:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"A little-known regulatory proposal taking shape in the United States could deliver a welcome boost to Europe's stock exchanges, which have been struggling for years to stem an exodus of companies to New York. The Securities and Exchange Commission is in the early stages of a proposal to tighten the rules for foreign companies that trade on U.S. exchanges, a move that could inadvertently prompt dozens of stocks to seek a secondary listing in London or another major financial center. The plan targets the definition of a ""Foreign Private Issuer"" — a status that allows non-U.S. companies like chip stock Arm and media company Spotify — to avoid some of the SEC's most stringent regulatory requirements, such as the exemption from quarterly reporting. One of the key changes being floated would require FPIs to have an active listing on a ""major"" non-U.S. exchange to qualify for these benefits. Legal experts say most companies that are currently listed only in the U.S. but incorporated elsewhere would choose to have a second listing rather than face the full burden of complying with U.S. domestic reporting standards. ""It could inadvertently stimulate the London markets,"" said Robert Newman, co-head of UK capital markets at law firm DLA Piper, which advises listed companies on listing decisions. The potential shift comes as European exchanges are grappling with several high-profile companies that have increasingly opted to list in the U.S., lured by higher valuations and greater liquidity. The regulatory loophole The SEC's proposal stems from what it sees as a growing regulatory loophole. When the FPI framework was created, it was built on the assumption that foreign companies listing in the U.S. were already subject to ""meaningful disclosure and other regulatory requirements in their home country jurisdictions."" But that's changed dramatically over the past two decades, according to the SEC's concept release outlining the proposal. In 2003, the most common homes for these companies were the U.K. and Canada, both with regulatory regimes familiar to the SEC. By 2023, the most common jurisdiction of incorporation was the Cayman Islands, known for its limited corporate governance and disclosure rules. Meanwhile, mainland China has become the most common headquarters location. ""From the SEC's perspective, this universe of foreign private issuers is subject to a lighter touch regime in the U.S., but they're not subject to significant oversight in their home jurisdiction,"" said Mike Bienenfeld, a U.S. lawyer specializing in SEC compliance at law firm Linklaters. Bienenfeld cautioned that it was difficult to predict the results of the early-stage proposal as the SEC could also choose to take no action or arrive at a different decision. What if the proposal becomes a rule? However, should the SEC move forward with a foreign listing requirement, affected companies would face a choice between taking on a new listing overseas or subjecting themselves to the more rigorous oversight regime applicable to U.S. domestic companies. This includes filing detailed quarterly reports, rather than providing updates just twice a year. Companies would have to convert their accounting from International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), a significant undertaking, according to Linklaters' Bienenfeld. They would also become subject to U.S. proxy rules, votes for executive compensation, and stricter insider-trading reporting requirements. ""It's not an insignificant cost, particularly for a lot of these smaller companies,"" said John Stone, a U.S. securities lawyer at DLA Piper, adding that most companies would opt for a secondary listing in a major jurisdiction instead. If the SEC goes ahead, it will kick-start competition among global stock exchanges. The London Stock Exchange, with its deep capital markets and a regulatory framework the SEC knows well, could be a significant beneficiary. ""I think, to the extent the SEC chooses to really enforce the original intention of this rule, that could require companies to list elsewhere,"" said David Schwimmer, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group . ""London would be the natural location for that."" However, it won't be the only contender. Exchanges in the Euronext network—which includes Paris, Amsterdam, and Dublin—as well as those in Canada and Hong Kong, could vie for these secondary listings. Nasdaq operates several exchanges in the Nordics that could compete too. Ultimately, the decision for companies will depend on factors like cost, access to deep capital pools, the efficiency of the listing process, and access to quality research analysts. ""It is certainly something that we talk to potential listers about,"" Schwimmer added. The push back Many foreign companies that are currently listed on a U.S. exchange have expressed their reservation at the SEC's concept release. Nasdaq-listed Virax Biolabs , a U.K.-headquartered healthcare and diagnostics company, said the SEC's proposal would ""impose an unreasonable and material compliance burden"" and ""unintentionally penalise"" them. Virax has no business operations or infrastructure in the U.S. and its Cayman island entity ""serves purely as a legal listing vehicle"", according the company. ""We support thoughtful regulatory oversight and understand the SEC's intent,"" James Foster, chief executive of Virax told CNBC. ""However, applying a rigid ownership threshold without considering operational substance risks creating uncertainty for compliant global issuers — especially those in emerging sectors like biotech."" In a submission to the SEC , Foster added that if Virax becomes a more U.S.-focused business, it ""would voluntarily transition to U.S. domestic filer status"" instead.",89166325c2522d0f30311672928e24fd,trafilatura,5805,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-overlooks-palantir-stock-premium-125911167.html,7e516fa68c6b6116216a498712466713,The Market Overlooks Palantir Stock Premium Price Tag,The Market Overlooks Palantir Stock Premium Price Tag,2025-08-05 14:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR) has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. On Aug. 4, the company’s stock surged to a fresh 52-week high of $161.40 ahead of earnings. Adding to the positives, Palantir delivered solid second-quarter results last night that exceeded expectations, showcasing the solid demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). The market responded positively, sending PLTR shares up more than 6% in early trading today.
This growth adds to what has already been a stellar year for Palantir. PLTR stock has skyrocketed more than 127% year-to-date and an eye-popping 614% over the past year. However, due to this extraordinary rally, Palantir stock trades at ultra-high valuation levels.
PLTR is trading at a price-to-sales ratio of 127.05x and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 432.65x. These multiples are not just above industry averages - they dwarf them, including those of far larger and more established tech giants. For many investors, these figures would typically signal caution. But in Palantir’s case, the market seems content to keep fueling the rally, betting on its growth potential.
So, how is Palantir managing to hold investor interest at these seemingly unsustainable multiples?
The AI Advantage
Much of the bullish sentiment around Palantir centers on its AIP, which continues to gain traction across both commercial and government sectors. Unlike many of its peers in the AI and data analytics space, Palantir offers a proven platform with growing customer demand. This track record, combined with its deep-rooted government relationships, positions the company uniquely in a fast-evolving market.
The company’s second-quarter results support that narrative. Palantir posted quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time, marking a 48% year-over-year increase. While its revenue growth rate accelerated once again, customer count rose to 849, up 43% from the prior year and 10% from the previous quarter. Revenue from its top 20 customers also continued to rise, reaching an average of $75 million per customer, an impressive 30% increase.
Perhaps even more striking is the company's margin profile. Its adjusted operating margin expanded to 46%, indicating that Palantir isn’t just growing - it’s growing efficiently.
Palantir’s U.S. Business: A Powerhouse of Growth
What’s driving Palantir’s growth engine in particular is its performance in the U.S. market, especially within its commercial business. The company’s U.S. commercial revenue grew by a jaw-dropping 93% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. Palantir also booked its highest-ever U.S. commercial Total Contract Value (TCV) at $843 million, up 222% from a year ago.
Over the past year, the company secured $2.8 billion in U.S. commercial TCV bookings, reflecting a 141% jump from the previous 12-month period. Its U.S. commercial customer count rose to 485, up 64% year-over-year, reflecting increasing demand for real-world AI solutions.
The government segment also continues to contribute meaningfully. In Q2, U.S. government revenue increased 53% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. A recent highlight was the 10-year, $10 billion agreement with the U.S. Army. This significant deal consolidates 75 smaller contracts and signals long-term trust in Palantir’s capabilities. Given that the Army is one of Palantir’s oldest clients, the agreement is both a validation of past work and a commitment to future collaboration.
Palantir Delivers Upbeat Guidance
As AIP continues to drive the expansion of its existing customer relationships and helps in the acquisition of new clients in the U.S., this momentum is setting the stage for even stronger future growth, offering meaningful support for Palantir's stock performance.
Reflecting this positive trajectory, Palantir has raised its full-year 2025 revenue forecast. The new midpoint stands at $4.146 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 45%. This is a significant improvement, and is roughly nine percentage points higher than what the company projected just a quarter ago. In parallel, Palantir also revised its U.S. commercial revenue target upward to over $1.302 billion, which now points to at least 85% year-over-year growth, 17 points higher than its earlier guidance.
These upward revisions signal continued strong demand, especially as more companies look to integrate AI into their operations.
Here’s What Analysts Say About PLTR Stock
Despite all of this momentum, Wall Street remains cautious. The consensus rating on the stock is still a “Hold,” mainly due to concerns over its elevated valuation. This indicates that PLTR's current price already bakes in much of the optimistic growth projections, leaving little margin for error.
The Bottom Line on PLTR After Earnings
Palantir’s stock may be super expensive by valuation metrics, but the company’s growth trajectory, robust financials, and unique positioning in both the commercial and government AI sectors have kept the rally going. The premium price tag is hard to ignore, but so is the company’s momentum.
Right now, the market appears comfortable paying that premium, suggesting the rally could have more room to run.
For existing shareholders, holding could be a prudent choice to ride the continued momentum. For new investors, however, waiting for a pullback before buying may offer a more favorable risk-reward balance. While the company’s fundamentals are solid, its premium price tag demands cautious optimism.

The world's largest oil company declared an adjusted net income of 92.04 billion Saudi riyal ($24.5 billion) over the three months to the end of June. The result compares with a forecast of adjusted net income of $23.7 billion, according to an analyst survey estimate supplied by the company.
Second-quarter revenues dropped to 378.83 billion Saudi riyals from 425.71 billion Saudi riyal in the same period of the previous year. The results marked ten quarters in a row of declining profits.
""Market fundamentals remain strong and we anticipate oil demand in the second half of 2025 to be more than two million barrels per day higher than the first half,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said in a Tuesday statement accompanying the results.
Capital expenditure picked up slightly to 46.2 billion Saudi riyal in the June quarter, up from 45.5 billion Saudi riyal in the same period a year prior.
In a call with journalists, Nasser outlined plans for further increased capital expenditure despite the fall in revenues.
""We always look at potential to improve efficiency in our spending building and flexibility and discipline, and this is embedded in our planning and capital discipline,"" the CEO said. ""We will continue to monitor market conditions, but we maintain our guidance for the year 2025, of $52 to $58 billion.""
Some analysts see this guidance as overly optimistic.
""An in-line set of results this morning from Aramco, with sequentially weaker upstream earnings offset by a recovery in refining results,"" RBC analysts said in a note following the results. ""With $25.5bn of capital investments in the first half of 2025, Aramco appears to be running lower than its guidance of $52-58bn for the full year. While spending typically picks up in the second half of the year, we think full year capex could come in towards the lower end of its guided range, subject to acquisitions.""
Crude prices have stayed depressed over the course of the year, barring a brief second-quarter flare-up sparked by Israel-Iran tensions. Futures have been under pressure from an uncertain outlook for demand, exacerbated since April by the rollout of Washington's wide-spanning tariffs. The protectionist trade measures muddy the picture for growth in the world's largest economy and the future of the U.S. dollar, which denominates most commodities — including crude oil.
Aramco CFO Ziad Al-Murshed, also speaking on the press call, stressed the company's efforts to lower costs.
""Across our upstream and across our downstream, we're going through transformations that are not only focused on cost cutting, but cost cutting is the major component of it,"" Al-Murshed said. ""So every asset that we have across our upstream portfolio and every asset that we have across our downstream portfolio has been undergoing for the past couple of years, these transformational initiatives, and a lot of it is focused on cutting costs.""
Aramco's income is set to see a boost from higher output, after Saudi Arabia – and seven other OPEC and non-OPEC partners — complete unwinding 2.2 million barrels per day of voluntary cuts through a last tranche in September. Saudi Arabia most recently produced 9.356 million barrels per day in June, according to independent analyst estimates compiled in OPEC's Monthly Oil Market Report.
Asked about the OPEC+ actions, Nasser said, ""I'm not going to comment on OPEC's policy, but the impact on Saudi Aramco, if you look at up to September, you see 1 million barrels of the growth in our production as a result of that.""
The company is also focusing heavily on its gas production, aiming for a more than 60% increase by 2030 compared to baseline 2021 levels. The development of Saudi Arabia's Jafurah gas field is expected to be a major part of that.
That 60% increase goal ""is on track because it will give us a lot of opportunity to maximize production of our gas resources the kingdom, and we have a lock-in demand here in the kingdom for this additional gas that we are making more upstream, in addition to availing placement for our value to our liquid chemical investment,"" Nasser said. Gas demand is expected to pick up significantly in 2026, according to the International Energy Agency.
""So we are capturing a lot of opportunities, and a lot of opportunities become much better in a down cycle,"" the CEO said.
Aramco has increasingly tapped debt markets, with two issuances totalling $9 billion in the second half of 2024 and a three-part bond sale of $5 billion this year. The company's gearing ratio went up to 6.5% as of June 30, 2025, compared to 5.3% as at March 31, 2025.
Front of mind for investors is the dividend policy at Aramco, which in March slashed investor returns for 2025 to $85.4 billion — down sharply from the $124.2 billion of 2024 — after a first-quarter decline in net profits. Aramco declared a base dividend of $21.1 billion and a performance-linked dividend of $0.2 billion in the third quarter.
The company's dividend yield stood at 5.5% as of Monday, still ahead of U.S. industry peer Exxon Mobil's 3.6% and Chevron's 4.5%, according to FactSet data.
Aramco's payouts ripple sharply into the budget of Saudi Arabia, which has been juggling diversifying its economy away from oil reliance under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's signature Vision 2030 program. Saudi Arabia's gross domestic product expanded by 3.9% in the second quarter, boosted by non-oil activities.",4dd51bd7acbd0b2e0165a1884ef454ac,trafilatura,5593,0

Artificial intelligence (AI) demand remains a massive tailwind for the company, and Nvidia is preparing for the launch of its next-gen GB300 shipments in the latter half of this year.
Against this backdrop, should investors be excited for Nvidia's upcoming second-quarter results, which are set to be released on Aug. 27?
Little needs to be said about the capabilities of this semiconductor industry juggernaut. Nvidia is a global leader in the manufacture of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the cornerstone of the advancing AI field. Nvidia’s powerful hardware is transforming businesses by accelerating AI workloads and data analytics. With a massive market capitalization of $4.2 trillion, this AI darling holds the crown of the most valuable company in the world.
Nvidia has been at the center of the AI race between the U.S. and China. While there were some restrictions in place, President Donald Trump's administration had outright banned the export of H20 chips to China. Recently, however, Nvidia won approval to ship its advanced H20 chips to the country. These chips are expected to be used in AI operations in China, and were explicitly designed to comply with restrictions, allowing them to be marketed in the Chinese market.
Nvidia also stands to benefit from the easing of some non-tariff restrictions. However, China’s cyberspace regulators have summoned Nvidia over concerns about the security of these chips, asking for an explanation for “backdoor safety risks” in its H20 chips. On the other hand, these chips are in high demand in China, prompting the company to expand and not rely solely on its existing stockpile. As a result, Nvidia has reportedly ordered 300,000 H20 chipsets from contract manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).
NVDA stock remains in demand among investors. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has gained 59%. Shares of the chip manufacturer reached a 52-week high of $183.30 on July 31 and are only off about 5% from this mark. NVDA stock is also up 29% so far this year.
Justifiably, Nvidia’s valuation is stretched compared to its peers, with its price sitting at 44 times forward earnings.
Nvidia’s Q1 Results Topped Estimates
On May 28, Nvidia reported solid first-quarter results for fiscal 2026 (the quarter that ended April 27). For the period, revenue increased 69% year-over-year (YOY) to $44.1 billion. This was higher than the $43.28 billion that Wall Street analysts were expecting. Data center revenue was $39.1 billion, up 73% from the year-ago value.
Nvidia’s non-GAAP EPS increased by 33% YOY to $0.81, surpassing the analyst estimate of $0.75.
At the heart of this growth was solid demand for Nvidia’s AI infrastructure. On the other hand, the company recorded a $4.5 billion charge associated with excess inventory of H20 chips and purchase obligations as demand dropped due to export restrictions.
Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Nvidia’s future earnings. The company's EPS is expected to climb by 45% YOY to $0.94 for Q2 fiscal 2026, which is set to be reported on Aug. 27 after the market closes. For the current fiscal year, EPS is projected to surge 37% annually to $4.02, followed by a 33% growth to $5.34 in the next fiscal year.
What Do Analysts Think About Nvidia Stock?
Analysts are exceptionally bullish on NVDA stock now, especially since it is the frontrunner in the highly lucrative AI space. Recently, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore raised the price target on the stock to $200 while maintaining an “Overweight” rating. Moore sees significant potential in Nvidia’s planned expansion of its Blackwell infrastructure later this year, which could drive the next phase of the company's growth.
Analysts at Mizuho also raised the price target on NVDA from $185 to $192, keeping their “Outperform” rating. Mizuho raised the target after the company announced it could restart GPU shipments to China, noting that Chinese customers — such as ByteDance and Tencent (TCEHY) — are already applying for licenses to obtain the H20 chips.
Analysts at Needham cited the same reason for raising their price target on Nvidia from $160 to $200, maintaining a “Buy” rating. Needham stated that the lifting of restrictions gives clarity about the future of Nvidia’s business in China.
Nvidia has been in the spotlight on Wall Street for some time now, with analysts awarding it a consensus “Strong Buy” rating overall. Of the 45 analysts rating the stock, a majority of 39 analysts rate it a “Strong Buy,” two analysts suggest a “Moderate Buy,” three play it safe with a “Hold” rating, and only one analyst gives NVDA a “Strong Sell” rating. The consensus price target of $183.88 represents 6% upside from current levels. However, the Street-high price target of $250 indicates 44% potential upside.
Key Takeaways
Nvidia could unlock a new growth chapter based on the planned expansion of its Blackwell architecture. At the same time, the resumption of its booming business in China should bode well for the company. In this situation, anticipating robust gains from its Q2 results would not be a stretch.

The hospital-focused real estate investment trust (REIT) has faced the bankruptcies of its two largest tenants. Their financial troubles occurred during a period when interest rates surged, making it challenging to refinance debt as it matured.
However, the healthcare REIT has gotten past this rough patch. As a result, it's now finally on the road to recovery, which was evident in its second-quarter results. That puts its roughly 8%-yielding dividend on a much more sustainable foundation, making the REIT an interesting option for those seeking income and upside potential.
New tenants are starting to contribute
Medical Properties Trust spent much of last year dealing with the bankruptcy of its former top tenant, Steward Health Care. The REIT was able to take back control of its real estate from Steward last September as part of the bankruptcy settlement. That allowed the hospital owner to transition the hospital operations to new tenants. It ultimately replaced Steward with five new tenants at 17 properties.
Those new tenants started paying rent this year under leases that steadily escalate rental rates over the next two years. The group collectively paid only $3.4 million in rent during the first quarter. That amount increased to $11 million in the second quarter as rental rates continued to escalate steadily. This represented 96% of the rent it billed to these tenants (it didn't collect $500,000 in rent from two facilities due to some start-up issues). Three of its tenants are already paying the fully ramped-up cash rate.
Rising rental income from these tenants, along with continued stability from most of its existing portfolio, enabled Medical Properties Trust to book a total of $240.4 million of revenue during the quarter. Meanwhile, the REIT reported $0.14 per share of normalized funds from operations (FFO) in the period. That easily supported its dividend payment of $0.08 per share.
The recovery should continue
Medical Properties Trust anticipates that rents from its new tenants will increase to $17 million in the third quarter. This number should continue rising. The REIT expects to reach the fully stabilized rate in October 2026, of around $160 million annualized (approximately $40 million per quarter). That drives its confidence that its annualized cash rent will exceed $1 billion by the end of next year.
""In summary, our transitional portfolio is quickly ramping performance and rent payments as expected, and our other tenants from around the world are delivering consistent performance, driven by healthy volume and cost trends,"" stated Rosa Hooper, senior VP of operations, on the second-quarter call. She continued, ""Put simply, MPT's portfolio is well positioned to continue to generate significant cash flow and create value for shareholders moving forward.""
More potential catalysts ahead
The company has several potential additional catalysts that could enhance its ability to grow shareholder value in the future. One is the final resolution with its other bankrupt tenant (Prospect Medical Holding). In March, the bankruptcy court approved a settlement between the REIT, Prospect, and other parties that will allow the bankrupt healthcare company to sell its hospital operations and the related real estate owned by Medical Properties Trust. As those sales occur, the REIT will receive funds that it can use to repay debt or invest in new income-generating assets.
Medical Properties Trust also continues to explore ways to grow earnings, reduce its cost of capital, and enhance its valuation. For example, it continues to own very valuable hospital real estate that it could monetize, potentially through joint venture transactions. Future moves could help unlock shareholder value by selling stakes in its properties at strong valuations and recycling the capital into new, higher-return investments. These moves could boost its share price and its ability to rebuild its dividend.
Healthy total return potential
Shares of Medical Properties Trust currently sit more than 80% below where they were in early 2022 before interest rates started rising, and its tenant issues began to worsen. That slump is why the company offers such a high dividend yield despite two deep cuts.
With its tenant and balance sheet issues now in the rearview mirror, the REIT's reset dividend is safe and could start rising in the future as its rental income increases. That growth, along with future moves to unlock shareholder value, could help drive a recovery in Medical Properties Trust's stock price. This combination of income and upside potential makes it a potentially very attractive investment opportunity these days.

S . trade with Russia after Trump threatens steeper tariffs,2025-08-05 02:45:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"India said it was being ""targeted"" by the U.S. and the European Union over its imports of Russian oil after U.S. President Donald Trump in an overnight social media post threatened New Delhi with much steeper tariffs.
India began importing oil from Russia only after ""traditional supplies"" were diverted to Europe following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the country's foreign ministry said in a statement late Monday.
The ministry called out the EU and the U.S. saying, ""it is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them].""
The EU's bilateral trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data. Citing those numbers, India said the bloc's trade was ""significantly more"" than India's total trade with Russia.
Data from the Indian embassy in Moscow showed bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025, nearly 5.8 times higher than the pre-pandemic trade of $10.1 billion.
The EU, meanwhile, was Russia's third-biggest trade partner in 2024, accounting for 38.4% of the country's total global trade in goods, sliding from being Moscow's top partner in 2020. EU's goods trade with Russia dropped nearly 74% in 2024 from 257.5 billion euros in 2021.
India's response comes after Trump threatened on Monday that he would be ""substantially raising"" the tariffs on India, although he did not specify the level of the higher tariffs. The U.S. president had threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified ""penalty"" last week.
He also accused India of buying discounted Russian oil and ""selling it on the Open Market for big profits.""
Russia became the leading oil supplier to India since the war in Ukraine began, increasing imports from just under 100,000 barrels per day before the invasion — 2.5% of total imports — to more than 1.8 million barrels per day in 2023 — 39% of overall imports — according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's report earlier this year.

Why an India-U.K. trade deal does not make U.S.-India agreement any easier
""The United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability,"" the country said in its statement.
Eric Garcetti, when he was the U.S. ambassador to India, said last year at a conference that India purchased Russian oil as ""we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil.""
According to the International Energy Agency, 70% of Russian crude was exported to India in 2024. India said oil imports were meant to ensure predictable and affordable energy costs to the Indian consumer.
India has in the past defended its oil purchases from Russia, with Hardeep Singh Puri, the country's energy minister, saying in an interview last month to CNBC that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S. to do so.
""If people or countries had stopped buying at that stage, the price of oil would have gone up to 130 dollars a barrel. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap,"" Puri said.
India also took aim at the U.S., saying the country continues to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for the electric-vehicle industry, as well as fertilizers and chemicals from Russia.
U.S. bilateral trade with Russia in 2024 stood at $5.2 billion, compared with nearly $36 billion in 2021, government data showed. The U.S. has not imposed any ""reciprocal tariffs"" on Russia.
""In this background, the targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable. Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,"" New Delhi said.
Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia,"" Rachel Ziemba, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said that some of India's concerns were justified. ""It was the last U.S. administration that put in place the price cap system, which facilitated the redirection of trade.""
India's former finance secretary, Subash Garg, told CNBC's ""Inside India"" that he doesn't see a trade deal happening with the U.S. ""Our positions are so different that there is very little possibility of a reconciliation.""
Garg said that India should let the threatened 25% tariff take effect. ""If there is an American demand, they will buy and let American consumers and the importers pay the tariff.

Tired of the rising prices, lack of transparency and shortage of generic low-cost prescriptions, the billionaire went to war with big pharma and launched Mark Cuban CostPlus Drug Company with his co-founder Alex Oshmyansky, M.D., Ph.D.
According to Cuban’s mission on Mark Cuban CostPlus Drug Company’s website, he is tackling major issues with big pharma by revealing how much medicine actually costs and offering affordable prescriptions so the price of drugs stops driving up the price of insurance.
“Cuban’s tactics are deceptively simple but genius,” said finance expert Andrew Lokenauth with Be Fluent in Finance. “From my years analyzing business models, the most effective approach is to cut straight through complexity — which is exactly what he’s doing.”
According to Lokenauth, Cuban’s core strategy of transparency is working.
“From my experience working with pricing models, this 15% markup, plus a $5 pharmacy fee, plus a $5 shipping model rips away the veil of secrecy that Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) have profited from for decades and it’s working,” he explained.
But pulling back the curtain on pricing isn’t the only thing Cuban is doing. He’s using a multi-pronged expansion strategy.
“Last time I reviewed their operations, Cost Plus had scaled from 111 medications to over 2,500 drugs,” Lokenauth added. “That’s a massive growth in just two years and now they’re moving into manufacturing and imports — I was blown away when I saw them importing $15 penicillin shots to compete against Pfizer’s $500 version.”
What Makes Cuban’s Disruption Different
Cuban isn’t the first person to acknowledge big pharma’s unethical ways. Many politicians like Senator Bernie Sanders, Representative Jan Schakowsky and Senator Elizabeth Warren have criticized pharmaceutical companies for avoiding federal taxes and price gouging, but Cuban’s approach is different.
Here’s why it’s working, according to Lokenauth:
First, he has complete financial independence — and he’s leveraging it masterfully. With a $6 billion net worth, he can’t be bought out or pressured into submission like previous disruptors. From my observations of the industry, this is absolutely critical when taking on entrenched players.
Second, his company structure as a Public Benefit Corporation is brilliant. I’ve worked with traditional corporations and the constant pressure for quarterly profits kills most reform efforts. But Cost Plus can legally prioritize social impact over pure profit.
The third factor — and this one’s critical from my analysis — is Cuban’s laser focus on transparency as the core weapon. Other disruptors tried complex technological solutions or intricate business models. But Cuban recognized that simply exposing true costs would force the entire industry to change.
Why Cuban Believes Pharmacy Benefits Managers Are the Key Problem To Solve
Pharmacy Benefits Managers act as the middleman between health insurance plans, pharmacies and drug manufacturers. PBMs can influence the price of drugs and have been met with concerns over their market power and conflicts of interest with financial incentives, per the Commonwealth Fund.
At a University of Pennsylvania panel discussion on drug pricing Cuban said he is trying to reduce PBMs’ role.
Lokenauth’s views align with Cuban’s. “The transformation of PBMs from price negotiators into profit-driven monopolies has been catastrophic for healthcare costs,” he said.
Lokenauth gave an example from his personal studies. “A drug with a true cost of $10 gets marked up to $100 through the PBM system. The PBM then ‘negotiates’ it down to $50 and takes credit for ‘saving’ $50 — while still charging five times the actual cost. I’ve seen this pattern repeat countless times,” he said.
Cuban’s transparent model exposes these markups for what they are — pure profit extraction with no value add and that’s why the industry is fighting against him.
“His strategy of publishing complete price lists is absolutely the right way to break their power,” Lokenauth said. “Think about it this way — PBMs thrive on information asymmetry. When Cost Plus shows that a $1,000 drug actually costs $15 to make, that entire system starts to crumble. It’s already forcing changes and from my projections, this pressure will only increase.”
Cuban is focusing on execution over innovation and not doing anything new — he’s just removing the cloud of confusion for Americans, giving them a financial break on medications and cutting out the middlemen. “Simple but revolutionary,” Lokenauth added.",33f9f2a45af6ad51b7d8b3445169a20e,trafilatura,4731,0

S . visas : What we know so far,2025-08-05 04:45:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The United States is launching a pilot program that could require some inbound travelers to pay bonds of up to $15,000 to enter.
The 12-month program is aimed, in part, at visitors from countries with historically high visa overstay rates, according to a temporary final rule posted in the Federal Register on Tuesday.
It's the latest move by the Trump administration to tighten immigration laws in the U.S., following a travel ban on nationals from 12 countries in June and a $250 ""visa integrity fee"" announcement in July.
Here's what we know about the bond program, based on the Federal Register notice:
When does the pilot program start?
The program starts on Aug. 20, 2025 and ends on Aug. 5, 2026.
Who will have to pay?
The program applies to leisure and business travelers who need B-1 or B-2 visas to enter the U.S., and who are coming from countries:
- that have high visa overstay rates,
- where screening and vetting information is deemed insufficient, or
- that offer Citizenship by Investment without a residency requirement.
Which countries are these?
So far, only two countries are on the list — Malawi and Zambia. However, the list may be amended throughout the pilot.
To determine the list, the government is using the Department of Homeland Security's 2023 Entry/Exit Overstay Report.
The report shows that in 2023, of the 1,655 people from Malawi that were expected to exit the U.S, 237 are suspected to have never left the country, while the total overstay rate is estimated at over 14%.
That year, of the nearly 3,500 visitors from Zambia that were to leave the U.S., 388 are estimated to have stayed back, with the suspected in-country overstay rate of 10.45%.
The report shows several countries with even higher suspected overstay rates, including Chad (49%), Laos (34%), Haiti (31%), Republic of Congo, (29%), Sudan (26%), Djibouti (23%), Myanmar (26%), Eritrea (19%), Yemen (19%), Equatorial Guinea (21%), Burundi (15%), Sierra Leone (15%), Democratic Republic of Congo (15%) and Turkmenistan (15%).
With the exception of Haiti, the number of over-stayers from these countries is relatively small, usually in the hundreds.
Countries that have lower rates but far more people who overstayed and never departed the U.S. include Mexico (about 49,000), Brazil (21,000), Colombia (41,000), Haiti (27,000), Venezuela (22,000) and Dominican Republic (20,000), the report shows.
How many people will have to pay?
Not many.
The Department of State said it expects around 2,000 people will post visa bonds during the pilot program, given the number of people who are qualified to obtain U.S. visas and ""uncertainty"" surrounding the number of people who can pay it.
How much are the bonds?
There are three levels of bonds: $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000.
Bond amounts are at the discretion of consular officers, subject to guidelines. The amounts will be based on travelers' ""personal circumstances,"" including their reason for traveling, employment, income, skills and education.
Travelers who are required to pay a visa bond must enter and depart the U.S. through three airports: Boston Logan International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport.
Why a pilot program instead of a blanket rule?
The purpose of the 12-month pilot is at least two-fold, according to the U.S. State Department.
It is primarily aimed at accessing the feasibility of processing and discharging bonds, which the government has previously deemed to be ""cumbersome."" But it will also help ascertain whether bonds compel visitors to comply with their visa terms.
The government's notice, however, also states that the pilot program is a ""tool of diplomacy"" intended to spur foreign governments to reduce overstay rates of their nationals and improve their travel screening and vetting processes.
Notably, the pilot program provides more details than the $250 ""visa integrity fee"" announced in July, including when it will start, how it will be implemented, and processes to post and refund bonds amounts.
How many U.S. visitors overstay their visa terms?
Only 1%-2% of nonimmigrant visitors overstayed their visas each year from 2016 to 2022, according to the U.S. Congressional Research Service.
However, 42% of the estimated 11 million people who live in the U.S. without authorization entered on valid visas, but then never left, data shows.
In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that more than 320,000 people overstayed their visas, though this includes travelers who eventually left the country, according to the State Department's visa bond notice.

The idea that artificial intelligence will create jobs is ""100% crap,"" Gawdat said Monday on the ""Diary of a CEO"" podcast, using his own AI startup, Emma.love, as an example. He and two other software experts built the app with the help of AI, a project that would have required ""350 developers in the past,"" he said.
Gawdat has worked in tech for over 30 years. He was in the C-suite at Google X for almost five years tackling major problems facing humanity, like energy, climate change and internet access.
Even the jobs you may think require humans will be eliminated, including video editors, podcasters and executives, said Gawdat. Bill Gates has predicted that doctors and teachers will also be replaced in the coming years.
Those who have the most promising outlook are professionals who are the best at their jobs, said Gawdat, author of ""Scary Smart: The Future of Artificial Intelligence and How You Can Save Our World."" But even they won't be safe forever.
Artificial general intelligence is ""going to be better than humans at everything, including being a CEO,"" said Gawdat. ""There will be a time where most incompetent CEOs will be replaced.""
A competitive edge in the workforce
Other leaders say AI isn't all doom and gloom. Billionaires Mark Cuban and Jensen Huang, for example, say learning AI skills — in addition to strengthening soft skills — will make you highly desirable in the workplace and give you a competitive edge. After all, somebody has to program, develop and train the chatbots, and teach others to do the same.
Both Cuban, who has a free AI boot camp for kids, and Huang, whose company develops the chips and software powering many of today's generative systems, use artificial intelligence on a daily basis for tasks like writing first drafts, sending emails and getting medical advice.
Though 41% of employers globally plan to downsize their workforce due to AI (48% in the U.S.), 77% of employers are planning to upskill their current workforce to better work alongside AI, according to The World Economic Forum's 2025 Future of Jobs report. Moreover, 47% are looking at transitioning employees from declining roles into other roles in the organization.
Put simply, companies aren't going on a firing spree to replace human workers with robots right now.
An AI-powered future may not be all bad
Though Gawdat says the job market will suffer greatly due to AI, this economic shift may help spark necessary change to our outlook on work, giving people more time to spend with family, cultivate new hobbies, pursue philanthropy and find an identity outside of a job title.
""We were never made to wake up every morning and just occupy 20 hours of our day with work. We're not made for that,"" he said. ""We defined our purpose as work. That's a capitalist lie.""
An AI-powered society would require some kind of universal basic income (UBI), said Gawdat, a social welfare policy that ensures all citizens of a community regularly receive a payment from the government without work requirements.
The other caveat to this ""utopia"" is the potentially dangerous consequences of the ""hunger for power, greed and ego"" as AI bots report to ""stupid leaders,"" said Gawdat, calling for ethical use and regulations around artificial intelligence.
No matter the impact of artificial intelligence, or the approaches different leaders take, one thing remains undisputable: AI is no longer a curiosity, or a plot line in a sci-fi film. It's revolutionizing the way people live and work. And it's here to stay.
""This is real,"" Gawdat said. ""This is not science fiction.""

As the broader S & P 500 retreated on Tuesday, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) touched a fresh record. Utilities are the second-best performing sector in the S & P 500 in 2025, up more than 14% and outperforming tech's roughly 13% advance. The outperformance is greater still including utilities' 2.8% dividend yield. XLU 5D mountain The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) in the past five days.

""Despite significant positive returns so far this year, we continue to believe the power stocks have data center related catalysts across the second half."" In addition, dividend-paying stocks are looking more favorable for investors who are on the prowl for income, anticipating the day when the yield on risk-free Treasurys declines. To that end, CNBC Pro used FactSet data to screen for names within the XLU ETF that have buy or overweight ratings from at least 51% of the analysts covering them, and a dividend yield of at least 1.5%. PPL Corp. turned up on CNBC's screen. Once known as Pennsylvania Power & Light, the utility's shares are up 10% in 2025, and the stock pays a current dividend yield of about 3%.

Jefferies analyst Paul Zimbardo stuck with the stock, reiterating a ""buy"" rating and lifting his price target on Monday by $2, to $42, suggesting 16% upside from Monday's close. ""PPL is one of our top utility ideas, offering under-appreciated regulated generation data center exposure with premium core utilities overall,"" he said. ""PPL has visibility to 8% EPS growth with conservative assumptions while preserving an above-average balance sheet."" The icing on the cake is a recently announced joint venture between PPL and Blackstone Infrastructure to build natural gas generation to power data centers.

""Putin will stop killing people if you get energy down another $10 a barrel. He's going to have no choice because his economy stinks,"" the president told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" on Tuesday.
The comments come after relations between Moscow and Washington, which remained cordial at the start of Trump's second term in office despite the ongoing war, soured in recent weeks.
Trump has appeared to lose patience with Putin given Russia's apparent reluctance to pursue a ceasefire or peace deal with Ukraine. Last Monday, the president said he was cutting from 50 days to less than two weeks his deadline for Putin to reach a peace deal with Ukraine or face big ""secondary tariffs"" on Moscow's trade partners.
That prompted former Russian President and high-ranking Russian official Dmitry Medvedev to respond on social media that each new ultimatum that Trump makes about Russia to force an end to its war on Ukraine ""is a threat and a step towards war.""
""Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country,"" Medvedev wrote on X. Trump said Friday that he had ordered two nuclear submarines ""to be positioned in the appropriate regions"" in response to Medvedev's comments.
Russia, one of the world's top oil exporters, has used revenues from oil exports to largely fund its war machine in Ukraine, which it invaded in 2022. Ukraine's Western partners have used sanctions and restrictions to try to stifle those revenues, but countries like India and China have continued to buy discounted Russian crude.
This has infuriated Trump and he has, in the last few days, threatened India with steep tariffs if it does not stop buying Russian oil. The president threatened a 25% duty on Indian exports, as well as an unspecified ""penalty"" last week, accusing New Delhi of buying discounted Russian oil and ""selling it on the Open Market for big profits.""
On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC that the tariff threshold could be hiked above 25% in the next 24 hours.
""India has not been a good trading partner ... so we settled on 25%, but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil, they're fueling the war machine, and if they're going to do that, I'm not going to be happy,"" Trump said.
Russia earlier Tuesday weighed into the spat, with the Kremlin saying that India was free to choose its own trading partners and that Trump's tariff threats were ""attempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia.""
""We do not consider such statements to be legitimate,"" Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov continued, speaking to reporters Tuesday.
""We believe that sovereign countries should have, and have the right to choose their own trade partners, partners in trade and economic cooperation. And to choose those trade and economic cooperation regimes that are in the interests of a particular country.""
Oil prices declined to around the mid-$65 a barrel mark on Tuesday as traders assessed the announcement by OPEC and its oil-producing allies on Sunday that they would hike output, amid potential weaker global demand.
After Trump's comments on Tuesday, Brent crude futures were down 83 cents, or 1.2%, to $67.92 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slipped 87 cents to $65.41.
Meanwhile, dark clouds certainly appear to be gathering on the horizon when it comes to Russia's war-focused economy. It has labored under the weight of international sanctions as well as homegrown pressures, also largely resulting from war, such as rampant inflation and high food and production costs that even Putin described as ""alarming."" Russia's Economic Development Ministry also predicts that economic growth will slow from 4.3% in 2024 to 2.5% this year.

Russia's Finance Ministry said in April that it expects 24% lower revenues from oil and gas this year, compared with earlier estimates, and lowered its oil price forecast from $69.7 to $56 per barrel.

""Inside the upstream, we've had tremendous performance, along with record operating efficiency [and] along with starting up five new major projects,"" BP's Auchincloss told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"", just after the release of the company's second-quarter results.
He added that he was ""very optimistic"" about the company's latest exploration discovery in the Bumerangue block in Brazil's Santos Basin, just over 400 kilometers (248.5 miles) from Rio de Janeiro. BP is currently carrying out tests to further analyze the block's potential.
The Bumerangue discovery, announced Monday, is the firm's 10th since the start of the year and reflects a potentially significant boost as BP continues to double down on hydrocarbons.
After underperforming its peers in recent years, the firm has shifted gears by way of a fundamental strategic reset that will see BP prioritize fossil fuels and slash renewable spending.
Earlier on Tuesday, the energy major reported underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $2.35 billion for the three months through June — comfortably beating analyst expectations of $1.81 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.
Ramping up investor returns, the company also said its quarterly dividend will increase to 8.32 cents from 8 cents and that it will maintain the pace of its share buyback program at $750 million for the second quarter.
Shares of the company were last seen trading 2.7% higher during morning deals.
Takeover speculation
The downturn of recent years has turned BP into the subject of intense takeover speculation, with some questioning a potential future merger with domestic rival Shell. For its part, Shell in late June said that it had ""no intention"" of making an offer.
UAE oil giant ADNOC, as well as U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron, are among some of the names that have also been touted as possible suitors.
Asked whether the company had been approached by any potential merger partners amid ongoing takeover speculation, Auchincloss said BP is focused on growth.
""That's what is going to drive the share price up for shareholders,"" he added.
Maurizio Carulli, global energy analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said BP's earnings were the company's first positive quarterly results ""in a very long time,"" noting that ""what is perhaps most encouraging"" was the firm's outperformance came despite a period of lower oil prices.
""The management team has clearly started delivering on the strategy reset announced a few months ago. There has been huge speculation of late on the fate of BP and whether or not a rival will look to take them out with a merger,"" Carulli said.
""If positive results like this continue to be delivered, that speculation may just end up being a blip in BP's long and storied history,"" he added.
Asset review
BP, which is under intense pressure to improve profitability from the likes of activist investor Elliott, noted that it would initiate a further cost review of its assets — mere weeks before Albert Manifold joins BP's board from Sept. 1 and as chair from Oct. 1.
Asked for further details of this strategic review, Auchincloss told CNBC: ""If you think back to 2020, we reduced our costs by 25%, and in 2024 we announced another program to reduce our costs by another 20%. That's the $4-5 billion that I referenced earlier.""
""If we can achieve that, that will take us to around top quartile in the sector, but I don't think that is enough,"" Auchincloss said.
BP's net debt came in at $26.04 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from nearly $27 billion compared to the first three months of the year.
""We need to keep driving safely to be the very best in the sector we can be. And that's why we're focused on another review to try to drive us toward best in class inside the sector,"" Auchincloss added.",c61302e5c42f6c746d7f3fc7af746227,trafilatura,4035,0

The unusual stipulation in Miami federal court comes a week after Trump's lawyers sought a deposition from Murdoch within 15 days. Their motion had implied that Murdoch might be either dead or too sick to testify in person by the time the case went to trial.
""Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York,"" Trump's lawyers said in their filing last week.
Murdoch's new agreement to divulge highly personal information about his health to Trump and his lawyers contrasts sharply with the cozy relationship Murdoch's Fox News has had with the president over the years.
Fox News, for more than a decade, has acted as a cheerleader for Trump and his policies. The president is an avid watcher of the conservative network, and several of his key administration officials have worked for Fox. Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, hosts a show on Fox News.
The new deal, outlined in a joint court filing from Trump's and Murdoch's lawyers late Monday night, postpones Murdoch's deposition in the case until after Judge Darrin Gayles rules on his and other defendants' motions to dismiss Trump's lawsuit.
If the judge denies that dismissal motion, Murdoch would have to sit for questioning under oath from Trump's lawyers within 30 days.
The agreement also calls for discovery in the case to be postponed until Gayles rules on the dismissal motion. Discovery is the part of civil court proceedings in which the parties exchange evidence that is relevant to the dispute and where they take depositions from various witnesses.
Gayles approved the deal Tuesday.
Under terms of the deal, Murdoch is now required to give Trump's lawyers ""a sworn declaration describing his current health condition"" within three calendar days, according to the stipulation filed Monday.
""Defendant Murdoch has further agreed to provide regularly scheduled updates to Plaintiff regarding his health, including a mechanism for him to alert the Plaintiff if there is a material change to his health,"" the filing says.
That mechanism is described in a separately signed agreement, which was not publicly filed with the court.
If Murdoch fails to provide the updates as agreed to in the abatement agreement, he will have to sit for an ""expedited"" deposition, the filing says.
A spokesman for Trump referred questions about the filing to the president's statement on Truth Social in July when he filed the lawsuit.
""We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS 'article' in the useless 'rag' that is, The Wall Street Journal,"" Trump said at that time.
""This historic legal action is being brought against the so-called authors of this defamation, the now fully disgraced WSJ, as well as its corporate owners and affiliates, with Rupert Murdoch and Robert Thomson (whatever his role is!) at the top of the list,"" Trump wrote.
Dow Jones & Co., the publisher of the Journal, declined to comment on the new agreement. Dow Jones is owned by Murdoch's News Corp.
Trump's suit alleges he was defamed by a Wall Street Journal article in July that said he had sent Epstein a ""bawdy"" birthday card in 2003 for Epstein's 50th birthday.
Trump, who denies writing the note, sued Murdoch, News Corp and its CEO Robert Thomson, Dow Jones & Co. and the two reporters who wrote the article.
For weeks, the president and the Justice Department have faced criticism for a decision not to release investigative files about Epstein, a former friend of Trump's, who died by suicide in jail in 2019, after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.",4dcb0ac009ff68aaead0134e90da8f71,trafilatura,4015,0

This is especially true in big metropolitan areas, where property prices tend to be on the higher side.
Besides the popular ""30% rule"" which suggests that renters should spend no more than 30% of their before-tax income on housing, another common strategy is the ""3x annual income"" rule — home-buyers should cap their total mortgage at three times their annual household income.

During the apartment hunt, there are a few strategies that prospective renters can use to negotiate the price. One of the best things to do is to arm yourself with research, experts say. For example, you can compare the listing prices of similar units in your neighborhood.
In addition, you can try to negotiate any additional fees or ask for the place to be furnished when you move in. Another strategy that is often forgotten, is that people can still negotiate their monthly rent even if they've already been living in the apartment.
In a CNBC Make It video, author and television host Ramit Sethi suggested that renters can approach their landlords and say:
""Based on the data, it appears that apartments in this neighborhood are trending down by X%... I've been a good tenant, I've been here for X years. I plan to be here for many years more. I never cause unnecessary problems or damage. I'd like to negotiate for a lower rent, here's what I propose.""
While a landlord may still say ""no,"" renters can end up saving thousands a year if they are able to successfully negotiate a new deal, added Sethi.

Most companies have yet to deploy artificial intelligence in production cases, meaning that the overall job market hasn't yet been significantly impacted by AI, said Joseph Briggs, senior global economist of Goldman's research division, in a podcast episode shared first with CNBC.
But there are already signs of a hiring pullback in the technology sector, hitting younger employees there the hardest, Briggs said.
""If you look at the tech sector's employment trends, they've been basically growing as a share of overall employment in a remarkably linear manner for the last 20 years,"" Briggs said on the episode of ""Goldman Sachs Exchanges"" to be aired Tuesday.
""Over the last three years, we've actually seen a pullback in tech hiring that has led it to undershoot its trend,"" he said.
Since its November 2022 release, OpenAI's ChatGPT has fueled the rise of the world's most valuable company, Nvidia, and forced entire industries to contend with its implications. Generative AI models are quickly becoming adept at handling many routine tasks, and some experts say they are already on par with human software engineers, for instance.
That has sparked concerns that while automation will make companies more productive and enrich shareholders, swaths of the job market could be impacted in the coming years.
Technology executives have recently become more candid about the impact of AI on employees. Companies including Alphabet and Microsoft have said AI is producing roughly 30% of the code on some projects, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in June that AI handles as much as 50% of the work at his company.
Young tech workers, whose jobs are the easiest to automate, are the first concrete signs of displacement, according to Briggs.
Unemployment rates among tech workers between 20 and 30 years old jumped by 3 percentage points since the start of this year, he said. Briggs recently co-authored a report titled ""Quantifying the Risks of AI-Related Job Displacement"" that cites labor market data from IPUMS and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.
""This is a much larger increase than we've seen in the tech sector more broadly [and] a larger increase than we've seen for other young workers,"" he said.
'Labor substitution'
The approach from tech CEOs has been to hold off on hiring junior employees as they begin to deploy AI, said George Lee, the former technology banker who co-heads the Goldman Sachs Global Institute.
""How do I begin to streamline my enterprise so I can be more flexible and more adaptive... yet without harming our competitive edge?"" Lee said in the podcast episode. ""Young employees for this period of time are a little bit the casualty of that.""
Over time, roughly 6% to 7% of all workers could lose their jobs because of automation from AI in a baseline scenario, according to Briggs.
The transition could be more painful, both to workers and the U.S. economy, if adoption among companies happens faster than the roughly decade-long period he assumes, Briggs said.
That could either be because of technological advances or an economic slowdown that encourages companies to cut costs, he said.
If AI researchers achieve AGI, or artificial general intelligence, that equals a person's ability to learn and adapt across domains, instead of being narrowly deployed, the impact on workers would be more profound, the Goldman economist said.
""Our analysis doesn't factor in the potential for the emergence of AGI,"" Briggs said. ""It's hard to even start thinking about the impact on the labor market, but I would guess there probably and undoubtedly is more room for labor substitution and a more disruptive impact in that world.""",2acbf5cb5dfe6fa3e6c59bf92182e6db,trafilatura,3828,0

According to preliminary estimates, US Light Vehicle (LV) sales grew by 7.3% YoY in July, to 1.39 million units. July 2025 had one additional selling day as compared to July 2024, meaning that sales were up by 4.1% YoY on a selling day-adjusted basis.
The daily selling rate was measured at 53.6k units/day in July, up from 52.7k units/day in June. The annualized selling rate was estimated at 16.6 million units/year in July, up from 15.2 million units/year in June. Retail sales were estimated at 1.19 million units, up by 10.8% YoY, while fleet sales were thought to total 206k units, down by 4.5% YoY.
OEM Analysis
GM was once again the bestselling OEM in the market, with total sales of 237k units, and a market share of 17.0%. Despite a seemingly impressive monthly volume, GM’s market share has now declined for three straight months. Toyota Group ranked second in July sales, on 218k units, for a 15.6% share, with the group’s sales jumping by 19.9% YoY. Ford Group was in third place, on 182k units, but after a stellar Q2, the OEM’s share fell back to a modest 13.1% in July. At a brand level, Toyota outsold Ford, by 187k units to 176k units. While it has been typical in recent times for Toyota to sell higher volumes than Ford, the reverse had been the case in June. Chevrolet was third, on 153k units.
Model Analysis
Despite a slightly quiet month for Ford overall, the F-150 was the nation’s bestselling model once again in July, on 44.2k units – the F-150 has now held the top spot for four consecutive months. The Toyota RAV4 was in second on 39.8k units, while the Chevrolet Silverado came in third on 35.4k units. The ranking of the top three models was unchanged from June. The Chevrolet Equinox sold 31.8k units in July, its highest volume since March.
Segment Analysis
According to initial estimates, Compact Non-Premium SUV’s market share was 21.5% in July, the segment’s highest share since March. To some extent, however, this performance was upstaged by Midsize Non-Premium SUV, which achieved a market share of 17.2%, up by 2.0 pp on June’s result, and the highest for the segment since May 2022. The segment was boosted by robust volumes from models such as the Toyota 4Runner and Hyundai Palisade. After two stronger months in May and June, the Large Pickup segment saw its market share ease back to 13.8% in July.
David Oakley, Manager, Americas Sales Forecasts, GlobalData, said: “There was little sign of tariffs negatively impacting the market in July. Automakers have made a point of absorbing the higher costs they are seeing, and some have even extended offers that were previously due to expire at the beginning of the July. Therefore, from the consumer’s point-of-view, there was perhaps little to dissuade buyers from making purchases as normal. At the present time, OEMs are still vying for market share, rather than being overly concerned with protecting inventory. We should also bear in mind that for the majority of the month of July, the landscape regarding tariff rates in the longer-term was highly unclear. Automakers have therefore largely tried to maintain a business-as-usual approach, while mostly avoiding knee-jerk reactions in the face of uncertainty. The announcement that the tax credits available for Electric Vehicles (EVs) will be discontinued from September 30th appeared to notably boost sales of some EVs in July, an effect that we would expect to continue as we move through the next two months and the deadline looms larger”.",deff7fdb6ea49fddd41c65bd5b653c0c,trafilatura,3504,0

The text-only models are called gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, and are designed to serve as lower-cost options that developers, researchers and companies can easily run and customize, OpenAI said.
An artificial intelligence model is considered open weight if its parameters, or the elements that improve its outputs and predictions during training, are publicly available. Open-weight models can offer transparency and control, but they are different from open-source models, whose full source code becomes available for people to use and modify.
Several other tech companies, including Meta, Microsoft-backed Mistral AI and the Chinese startup DeepSeek, have also released open-weight models in recent years.
""It's been exciting to see an ecosystem develop, and we are excited to contribute to that and really push the frontier and then see what happens from there,"" OpenAI President Greg Brockman told reporters during a briefing.
The company collaborated with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Cerebras, and Groq to ensure the models will work well on a variety of chips.
""OpenAI showed the world what could be built on Nvidia AI — and now they're advancing innovation in open-source software,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.
The release of OpenAI's open weight models has been highly anticipated, in part because the company repeatedly delayed the launch.
In a post on X in July, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company needed more time to ""run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas."" That came after a separate post weeks earlier, where Altman said the models would not be released in June.
OpenAI said Tuesday that it carried out extensive safety training and testing on its open-weight models.
It filtered out harmful chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear data during pre-training, and it mimicked how bad actors could try to fine-tune the models for malicious purposes. Through this testing, OpenAI said it determined that maliciously fine-tuned models were not able to reach the ""high capability"" threshold in its Preparedness Framework, which is its method for measuring and protecting against harm.
The company also worked with three independent expert groups who provided feedback on its malicious fine-tuning evaluation, OpenAI said.
OpenAI said people can download the weights for gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b on platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub under an Apache 2.0 license. The models will be available to run on PCs through programs such as LM Studio and Ollama. Cloud providers Amazon, Baseten and Microsoft are also making the models available.
Both models can handle advanced reasoning, tool use and chain‑of‑thought processing, and are designed to run anywhere — from consumer hardware to the cloud to on-device applications.
Users can run gpt-oss-20b on a laptop, for instance, and use it as a personal assistant that can search through files and write, OpenAI said.
""We're excited to make this model, the result of billions of dollars of research, available to the world to get AI into the hands of the most people possible,"" Altman said in a statement Tuesday.

Investment banks from Bank of America to Wells Fargo to UBS point to rising demand from both data center expansion and AMD's core graphics and central processing unit business as likely catalysts for the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker to surpass Wall Street estimates. Melius Research also noted that a resumption of shipments to China could serve as an additional tailwind. AMD is slated to report results after the stock market closes on Tuesday. Analysts polled by FactSet forecast earnings per share of 48 cents on revenue of $7.4 billion. Shares have advanced more than 46% so far in 2025, through Monday. Here's what analysts on Wall Street are looking for in AMD's second-quarter results. Bank of America: Buy rating, price target to $200 from $175 Analyst Vivek Arya raised his price target on AMD to $200 per share from $175 per share in a note to clients last week, adding that the company's outlook for PCs in the second half of the year has become ""potentially de-risked"" thanks to consumers trying to get ahead of President Donald Trump's tariffs. Arya's forecast calls for about 13% upside from Monday's $176.78 close. ""Moreover, we note a continued strong cloud capex environment, as well as likely strong pricing for its current-gen MI355X could drive further upside in the current strong-double-digit growth expectation,"" the analyst said. Wells Fargo: Overweight, $185 price target Analyst Aaron Rakers' forecast implies about 5% upside for AMD stock. Rakers raised his profit and revenue estimates in a mid-July note, to 47 cents per share from 44 cents, and to $7.49 billion from $7.395 billion. ""We are positive on AMD's ability to continue gaining share in the server and PC CPU markets, increasing traction in datacenter GPUs, positive/accelerating incremental operating leverage, and ultimately, earnings power in excess of $6/share by 2025,"" the analyst said. UBS: Buy, price target $210 from $150 The bank expects an ""upside bias"" to AMD's second-quarter results this week, driven by strength in both its PC and server business. UBS' $210 per share target price would equal about 19% upside. ""Our model suggests AMD will already by annualizing $10B of DC GPU revenue exiting the year, which we think makes our updated ~$13B estimate for C2026 (up from $11B previously) well within reach considering the strong customer interest we have heard for rack-scale MI400 Helios systems,"" analyst Timothy Arcuri said. Melius Research: Buy, $175 price target Analyst Ben Reitzes' forecast implies roughly 1% downside for AMD stock. ""We estimate China could add $3B to AI revenue on an annualized basis, meaning AI revenue could top $15B next year, well above prior consensus.

Click here to subscribe to Trivector.) Investors with whom we are speaking appear well-aware of the potential negatives for the U.S. equity market. However, this awareness seems to be taking a back seat to FOMO (fear of missing out) on the current uptrend in the market. We share in some of that optimism as we see a path to 10% EPS growth for the S & P 500 , with a low 20x price-to-forward earnings ratio – elevated versus history but justified by structurally higher margins. Why are we more bullish on the long-term and what is the case for 10,000 on the S & P 500 by 2030? We have done extensive analysis looking at the relationship between margins and multiples, showing that expanding margins can lead to multiple expansion. This, combined with our view on AI and the positive impact it can have on margins across sectors, leads us to be bullish on U.S. equities for the next 12-to-18 months. We see the S & P 500 above 7000 before the end of 2026, if not sooner. The top 50 companies are relatively immune from higher inflation, a dynamic that was made crystal clear post-COVID. These companies account for nearly 50% of the gross profit dollars of the S & P 500. Moreover, lower input costs like commodities and oil, tame logistics expenses, and a weakening dollar might all help the earnings outlook for the second half of 2025. AI productivity and revenue synergies likely help 2026 and 2027 earnings. We don't see the market performing poorly with this as the backdrop driving double-digit EPS growth. In the table below, we show going left-to-right a range of per year EPS assumptions for the S & P 500 from 5% to 15%. Up and down we show a range of price-to-forward earnings multiples from 15x to 25x. The case for 10000 by the end of 2030 is one where investors pay 22x earnings on 10% per year earnings growth between now and then. Look at the range of multiples and earnings estimates below, with the cells in black showing the outcomes that support the S & P500 around 10000 by 2030.

Here's what the company reported for the period ended June 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:
- Earnings per share: $1.44 adjusted vs. $1.46 expected
- Revenue: $1.93 billion vs. $1.94 billion expected
Yum reported second-quarter net income of $374 million, or $1.33 per share, up from $367 million, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding refranchising gains and other items, the company earned $1.44 per share.
Net sales climbed 10% to $1.93 billion. Digital transactions, which include mobile app, delivery and kiosk orders, accounted for 57% of the company's system sales.
Yum's same-store sales, which only tracks the metric at restaurants open at least 12 months, rose 2% during the quarter.
""I'm proud that Yum Brands delivered another strong quarter in a tough consumer environment,"" CEO David Gibbs said on his final conference call before his retirement. CFO Chris Turner will succeed him as chief executive on Oct. 1.
For the second quarter, KFC reported same-store sales growth of 2%, lifted by its international restaurants. The fried chicken chain counts China as its biggest market.
But domestically, KFC's struggles continue. Its U.S. same-store sales slid 5%. Last year, the chain dropped from the No. 3 chicken chain in the U.S. by sales to No. 5, falling behind Raising Cane's and Wingstop.
Executives said Tuesday that KFC's value messaging and new menu items haven't resonated with consumers.
Yum has responded by shaking up the chain's leadership; in March, Scott Mezvinsky took the reins as KFC's CEO, and in April, Catherine Tan-Gillespie took over as president of KFC U.S.
Globally, Pizza Hut's same-store sales fell 1%, hurt by weaker demand in its home market. Like KFC, Pizza Hut saw its U.S. same-store sales fall 5% during the quarter. The chain is facing increased competition from its rivals as many consumers dine out less often.
Gibbs said that Pizza Hut's U.S. sales also faltered because of an ""insufficient value message,"" but the chain's leadership is already addressing that with new promotions.
Taco Bell, the jewel of Yum's portfolio, reported same-store sales growth of 4%, helped by the reintroduction of its Crispy Chicken Nuggets and the launch of new Crispy Chicken products.
Taco Bell's chicken sales have climbed 50% over the last two years, according to Gibbs. The chain has also been gaining market share from fast-casual restaurants and fast-food rivals.
""Most people are reporting negative quarters. We haven't even had a negative week for Taco Bell,"" Gibbs said.
Still, Wall Street had higher expectations for Taco Bell. Analysts were projecting that the chain would report global same-store sales growth of 5.2%, based on StreetAccount estimates.
Taco Bell's growing international business reported a same-store sales increase of 4% during the quarter.
Yum's total restaurant count rose 3%, lifted by 871 location openings in the quarter. That growth was driven primarily by international KFC openings.",b9a8653f7049c7a9493571974b56fd1a,trafilatura,3174,0

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' July's jobs report revised previous months' figures down so dramatically that U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday called it ""RIGGED"" and ""CONCOCTED.""
Markets, however, seem to have shrugged off their worries for now — U.S. stocks rebounded Monday from the sell-off on Friday after the report was released. But the move could be more of an instinctive reflex than a reflection of what's really driving markets.
""Today is sort of a bounce-back day,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. ""Stocks tend to pop after a drop, so that's what's happening.""
""We have to wait and see what happens tomorrow, because there could be a possibility that investors think, 'You know what, we really need to take some money off the table to digest some of these gains,'"" he added.
Trump's new tariffs come into force on Aug. 7, so there's a possibility investors could seize this opportunity, when markets have recovered slightly from Friday's losses, to take profit first — and before any further slowdown, as suggested by July's jobs report, is potentially ""rigged"" and strikes the U.S. economy.
What you need to know today
Trump will 'substantially' raise tariffs on India. The South Asian country's oil purchases from Russia is the cause behind Trump's threat. In response, India said it was being ""targeted"" by the U.S. and EU, and criticized them as ""indulging in trade with Russia.""
The EU will suspend its planned U.S. tariffs for six months. The countermeasures, which would have taken effect on Aug. 7, were delayed to allow the bloc to ""further negotiate"" with the U.S. and ""finalise a Joint Statement"" on their trade deal.
U.S. stocks rebound from Friday's losses. Major U.S. indexes rose Monday, with the S&P 500 snapping a four-day losing streak. Asia-Pacific markets traded higher Tuesday, though India's Nifty 50 fell as it began trading for the day.
Palantir's quarterly revenue exceeds $1 billion. Wall Street had expected the software provider to hit that milestone only in the fourth quarter of the year. But a 48% year-over-year jump in second-quarter revenue helped Palantir beat forecasts.
[PRO] The 'Magnificent Seven' are powering earnings growth. Year on year, Mag 7 earnings have increased by 26%. The other S&P 500 companies posted a combined 4% growth — a disparity that could be problematic for investors, according to an analyst.
And finally...
How an obscure SEC proposal could boost listings on European stock exchanges
The Securities and Exchange Commission is in the early stages of a proposal to tighten the rules for foreign companies that trade on U.S. exchanges. It's a move that could inadvertently prompt dozens of stocks to seek a secondary listing in London or another major financial center.
The plan targets the definition of a ""Foreign Private Issuer."" One of the key changes being floated would require FPIs to have an active listing on a ""major"" non-U.S. exchange to qualify for exemptions from some regulatory requirements.

Balances rose by $27 billion in the second quarter to a collective $1.21 trillion — in line with last year's all-time high. The total is up 2.3% from the previous quarter.
At the same time, ""we are still seeing elevated delinquency rates for credit cards,"" the New York Fed researchers found, with 6.93% of balances transitioning to delinquency over the last year.
""This looks to be a little bit of catch up,"" the researchers said on a press call Tuesday, in part due to ""unusual leniency during the pandemic"" and because consumers ""may have overextended themselves"" as inflation spurred higher costs in the years since.
""Those are things we have been keeping an eye on,"" the New York Fed researchers said.
Credit card debt had remained stable for decades. However, in the years since the pandemic, households largely spent down their excess savings while the cost of living jumped, which sparked a sharp rebound in credit card balances.
'A growing K-shaped split'
Separate data from Equifax found that many consumers continue to spend, despite elevated prices and high borrowing costs, while credit card delinquency rates remain relatively flat.
But subprime borrowers show signs of strain, with a rising share of the overall debt, according to Equifax. Subprime generally refers to those with a credit score of 600 or below.
""There's a growing K-shaped split in the consumer landscape, with subprime borrowers falling behind,"" Tom O'Neill, market pulse advisor at Equifax, said in a statement.
Many subprime borrowers are younger cardholders with shorter credit histories. These are also the borrowers more at risk of facing debt repayment challenges now that the Trump administration has restarted collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans.

""I think most people are generally doing OK, but it wouldn't take much for them to not be OK,"" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree. ""So many Americans are a job loss, income reduction or medical emergency away from real financial trouble.""
On the other side of the divide, just over half of cardholders — or 54% — typically pay in full, thereby avoiding interest, according to another report by Bankrate. ""Their card usage is counted among balances but isn't true debt like the other 46% of cardholders are facing,"" said Ted Rossman, Bankrate's senior industry analyst.
By way of example: With annual percentage rates just over 20%, if you made minimum payments toward the average credit card balance ($6,371), it would take you more than 18 years to pay off the debt and cost you $9,259 in interest over that time period, Rossman calculated.
""There's a huge difference between someone who uses credit cards for rewards and convenience versus someone who is carrying pricey debt for years.""",6a5a9bd9982dd6d8db9c06669712e7af,trafilatura,3108,0

Second quarter earnings season is coming to a close, and with nearly all of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.
As of Aug. 29, 98% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts now expect S&P 500 companies to report an 11.9% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.
Companies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.

Here are the latest updates from corporate America.
LIVE 325 updatesSalesforce stock falls in tepid reaction to earnings beat
Salesforce (CRM) stock fell as much as 5% after hours after the company reported results in line or slightly better than estimates that failed to wow investors looking for big AI gains.
For the quarter, Wall Street was looking for Salesforce's artificial intelligence efforts to show broader adoption — and monetization. Year to date, the stock has underperformed with a 23% loss.
Salesforce did beat Wall Street estimates and show steady growth: Revenue climbed 9.7% year over year to $10.24 billion, slightly above analyst expectations for $10.13 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 were also above estimates for earnings of $2.78 per share.
For the 2026 fiscal year, Salesforce initiated revenue guidance of $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion and raised the low end of its full-year revenue guidance, which now stands in a range of $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion. Both of those outlooks represent single-digit growth, which lags in comparison to other large-cap tech and AI players.
“It’s not bad — no one is going to say these are bad numbers,” Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance in reaction to the results. “We’re just playing a relative game, where everyone else on a relative basis is way better.”
The cloud software provider also announced a $20 billion increase to its existing share buyback program, bringing the total to $50 billion.

Contentious July jobs report confirms the U.S. economy is slowing sharply. Here's why
Nonfarm payrolls rose by just 73,000 in July, below even the muted expectations. Heavy downward revisions to the May and June count took the three-month average job gains down to just 35,000, or less than one-third the pace for the same period a year ago.
Traditionally a lagging indicator when it comes to recessions, the weakness in job growth points to an economy that may be slowing even more than some of the traditional metrics are showing.

Similarly, among companies that do not formally belong to these two sectors, we find many that clearly are built to a large extent on technology and base their market positions and competitiveness on it.

Netflix’s double-digit revenue growth is set to continue in the years ahead, according to consensus estimates.
-
Thanks to its massive scale, the business is producing robust free cash flow.

The current valuation reveals the market’s enthusiasm toward Netflix.
Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) continues to operate momentum on its side. Through the first seven months of 2025, shares of this global entertainment giant have climbed 30%, continuing an impressive streak of market-thumping returns.
The top streaming stock is taking a breather, as it's down 13% from its peak (as of July 31). Some investors might be taking profits off the table after the company's incredible run. Are Netflix shares a buy, sell, or hold in 2025?
Netflix's double-digit growth continues
Even though macro uncertainty rules the economic narrative these days, Netflix remains in solid shape. Through the first six months of 2025, the company's revenue totaled $21.6 billion, representing a 14.2% jump from the same period last year. The leadership team raised guidance, as it now sees sales coming in between $44.8 billion and $45.2 billion for the full year.
As of Dec. 31, 2024, Netflix had 302 million subscribers. Management stopped reporting quarterly subscriber numbers this year. However, new customers are still part of the story. ""Year-over-year revenue growth was primarily a function of more members, higher subscription pricing, and increased ad revenue,"" the Q2 2025 shareholder letter reads.
Looking ahead, investors have reasons to be optimistic. ""We still got hundreds of millions of folks to sign up. And from a revenue perspective, we're about 6% of consumer spend and ad revenue in the countries we serve in the areas that we serve,"" co-CEO Greg Peters said during the Q1 2025 earnings call.
Growth will undoubtedly slow, but this commentary is encouraging. And according to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, revenue will increase at a compound annual rate of 13.1% between 2024 and 2027. It wouldn't be surprising to see Netflix keep posting double-digit revenue gains.
Generating robust profits
It has been remarkable watching Netflix's journey to dominating the streaming landscape. The business has certainly proved the skeptics wrong. These naysayers believed that Netflix would never be able to report consistent and growing profits, mainly because of how much money it was required to spend on content every year.
Netflix kept growing, adding subscribers and revenue, and now has reached a massive scale that has bolstered its income statement. The company's operating margin went from 7.3% in 2014 to 26.7% in 2024. This highlights the benefit of having large, fixed costs at a time when sales have expanded rapidly. Netflix can maintain its powerful competitive position because it has so many subscribers who bring in revenue and allow the company to keep spending on content and marketing efforts.",42d52c5f1cd9d96d37e149718d1e2f87,trafilatura,2919,0

""NVIDIA GPUs do not and should not have kill switches and backdoors,"" wrote Nvidia's Chief Security Officer David Reber in a blog post on Tuesday.
The blog post comes after the Cyberspace Administration of China said last week that it needed Nvidia to provide documents about what it called security vulnerabilities in the H20, Nvidia's data center AI chip intended for the Chinese market. The regulator specifically mentioned ""backdoor"" security risks, according to the New York Times.
The statement is an example of how Nvidia is navigating geopolitical conflict as its AI chips remain in high demand by countries and companies around the world. U.S. lawmakers have proposed legislation that would require AI chips under export regulations to be equipped with location-tracking systems.
The U.S. has placed export controls on some Nvidia chips to China because of national security reasons, saying that the country could use the chips to gain an advantage in AI or for military purposes.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has argued that it is better for the U.S. if Nvidia's chips become the global standard for AI computers, especially among Chinese developers.
The H20 generates billions in revenue per quarter for Nvidia in sales, although the company does not typically break out its revenue specifically. The chip was briefly banned from export to China in April.
The company said its guidance would have been about $8 billion higher except for lost sales from a recent export restriction on its China-bound H20 chips.
The Trump administration said in July that it would grant a waiver for the chips to resume sales.
Silicon Valley technologists and security experts generally believe that backdoors — when a device has a hidden function that would allow a government or attacker to secretly take data from a computer or otherwise control it — are untenable in products.
Apple, in particular, has publicly fought off government requests for what it calls ""backdoors"" in the past as well.
Nvidia declined to comment further on its blog post.
Reber argued in the blog post that secret backdoors are dangerous vulnerabilities that could be used by hackers, not just officials, and that they ""violate the fundamental principles of cybersecurity.""
He also said that if a kill switch or backdoor were to be put in products like Nvidia GPUs, that they would harm U.S. national security interests.
""Hardwiring a kill switch into a chip is something entirely different: a permanent flaw beyond user control, and an open invitation for disaster,"" Reber wrote. ""It's like buying a car where the dealership keeps a remote control for the parking brake — just in case they decide you shouldn't be driving.""",c7095da686fd11dd7f137e3372faac4b,trafilatura,2904,0

Denny’s Corp. is testing and training employees on a new loyalty program that is expected to launch in the back half of the year, company executives said Monday.
The Spartanburg, S.C.-based company, which also owns the Keke’s Daytime Cafe brand, said the program will use the brand’s existing database.
“This new program is a best-in-class, one-to-one marketing program that leverages our already strong database of loyal guests to create greater, more compelling reasons for them to engage and spend more,” Kelli Valade said during a second-quarter earnings call. “It will allow us to collect valuable first-party data that enables us to personalize offers based on real guest behavior, drive frequency and margin with the right promotions, and deliver the right message to the right guests at the right time.”
Valade said Denny’s 5.5 million digital guests are valuable, as they visit restaurants more often than average customers.
“On average, these guests visit two times more often than other guests,” she said. “Plus, we're making it easy for everyone to join from anywhere they can access dennys.com, which includes, but isn't limited to just the Denny's app. By launching this new points-based loyalty program, we incentivize engagement every visit, collecting data needed to fuel a personalized CRM [customer relationship management] program to build frequency and delivering between 50 to 100 basis points in traffic over time.”
The economy continues to be “choppy,” she added.
“Household incomes remain under pressure and consumer sentiment continues to be volatile, meaning consumers are pulling back on spending across most categories, and they're being more selective about where to spend,” Valade said.
The company has seen improved traffic among customers in the $50,000 to $70,000 household income range.
Valade said Denny’s top four designated market areas are Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and Phoenix, which represent nearly 30% of the brand’s same-store sales base.
“In Q2, these markets experienced outsized macroeconomic pressures that contributed to a reduction in systemwide same-restaurant sales of approximately 30 basis points,” she said. “This was a shift felt across the industry, and we were not unique, but our concentration in these markets means we may have felt the impact more acutely.”
Valade said Denny’s will be able to target customers with special, individualized offers.
“What we're moving to is truly a one-to-one marketing program,” she said, “And honestly, it will be best-in-class from the team that's worked on this and the expertise we have in this area now. So, we're truly moving to that one-to-one where we'll have journeys or lanes where you might get one offer based on your patterns and your purchase history, and I might get a different one.”",97559c72f69f5798636b3010ac334568,trafilatura,2888,0

According to the Federal Reserve, they hold $17.3 trillion in home equity, roughly 50% of the country’s total equity. This is in large part due to so many of them — 83% of homeowners with a fixed-rate mortgage — having let their property build equity over time.

Unfortunately, many boomers are facing a new problem, and that’s the current U.S. housing market. As of quarter two of 2025, the average home sold for over $512,000. According to a 2022 Redfin report, nearly 30% of all “large homes” (those with at least three bedrooms) belong to empty-nest boomers.
Between high housing prices and a lack of smaller, more accessible homes to downsize to, many boomers are aging in place. For those who might have wanted to move to a more manageable home or somewhere less expensive altogether — a common drive for retirees on fixed incomes — it’s just not feasible.
So, how can boomers manage this new retirement problem? How can this generation find affordable housing, and what should they consider when making the plunge?
Here are a few things boomers should keep in mind when looking for affordable housing.
Finding Affordable Housing Is Tough
It’s no secret that finding affordable housing is a serious problem, and not just for boomers.
“Finding affordable housing is very daunting right now — many real estate markets are still running hot. While inflation has cooled, prices are still high. Property taxes in many states are increasing and the cost of insurance is also on the rise,” said Christine Coley, certified financial planner and wealth advisor at SteelPeak Wealth.
“A lot of people, of all ages, are seeing drastic increases in the mortgage payment due to increases in property tax and the cost of insurance,” Coley continued. “Homes they could comfortably afford are now moving out of reach with these increased costs. In areas where real estate has surged, people who own their home or are still making payments are having trouble keeping up with the increase to taxes and insurance.”
For fixed-income boomers who’ve paid off their mortgage, property taxes and insurance are serious financial concerns. The average cost of property taxes is $1,815, while typical homeowners’ insurance runs about $1,754 a year. Larger, more expensive homes tend to have higher taxes and premiums.

Alcoa of Australia, a unit of US aluminium producer Alcoa, reached a joint development agreement with Japan Australia Gallium Associates (JAGA), a joint venture between Sojitz and JOGMEC.
The companies are evaluating the viability of gallium production at one of Alcoa's alumina refineries in WA.
Gallium, a critical mineral for the technology and defence industries, has seen heightened global demand due to market controls in China.
The collaboration between Alcoa of Australia and JAGA seeks to diversify the global supply of gallium.
This effort comes as both Australia and the US have classified gallium as a critical mineral, with Japan also recognising it as one of the 35 minerals crucial to national security.
Alcoa of Australia president Elsabe Muller said: “This opportunity could deliver additional value from our established operations and further demonstrate how Alcoa's long-standing mineral processing capabilities can be significant in supporting state, national and global objectives in technology and national defence.
“We welcome the opportunity to work with the JAGA partners, including Sojitz, who has considerable connection with midstream gallium refiners and manufacturers and would be an offtake customer in the project.”
Sojitz Metals Resources and Recycling Divisional chief operating officer Osamu Matsuura highlighted the project's significance, saying it “had the potential to introduce supply options for Japanese semiconductor production critical to global downstream processing and manufacturing"".
The partners are working towards a final investment decision by the end of 2025, with production scheduled to begin in 2026.
This is subject to further commercial agreements as well as regulatory clearances.
Alcoa has clarified that this venture is not expected to materially affect the company's financial position or operational results.
Meanwhile, last month, Alcoa paused growth projects in Canada due to the impact of US tariffs, according to a Bloomberg report.
The company is considering seeking support from the Canadian Government to maintain its aluminium operations in Quebec.

(Reuters) -U.S. companies are spending record amounts to keep their executives safe in response to rising threats and the killings of two high-profile corporate officials in separate attacks in Manhattan over the last eight months.
Corporations have doubled the number of plain-clothed security teams outside buildings in New York City since a shooting last week in which four people were killed, said Glen Kucera, president of the enhanced protection services unit at Allied Universal, a security and facilities services firm.
""It's unspeakable. I never knew anyone who was murdered,"" said Rich Friedman, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, who previously worked with one of the victims, Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner. Her death shook Wall Street, even though authorities believe her killing was a random event. Police said the shooter was targeting the headquarters of the National Football League, which is housed in the same building in the Midtown area of Manhattan where LePatner worked. The shooter also killed a New York City police officer, building security guard and employee at real estate company Rudin before turning the gun on himself.
The attack was ""shocking and hits very close to home,"" Citigroup spokesperson Ed Skyler said in a note to employees a day after the July 28 killings in Midtown. ""Understandably, yesterday has also left many of us feeling uneasy,"" he said, assuring employees that the bank has beefed up security at its Manhattan headquarters over the last year.
Threats against executives ""have massively ramped up since 2020,"" said Chris Pierson, the CEO of cybersecurity firm BlackCloak. He noted how the man charged with murdering a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband near Minneapolis in June allegedly kept a target list of mostly other politicians and used online people-search services to find their addresses.
Ben Joelson, head of security risk and resilience for the Chertoff Group, a security advisory firm, said threats against executives are higher than at any time in the decade he has worked in the field, with social media posts magnifying complaints against institutional leaders. Artificial intelligence is compounding the problem, leading to an ""exponential rise"" in realistic phishing attempts, Joelson was cited as saying in a report by research firm Equilar.
When UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot to death in New York in December, it seemed to be a very rare ""black swan event,"" Joelson told Reuters in an interview. But targeted attacks have continued, including the killings in Minnesota and the shooting deaths of two employees of the Israeli embassy in Washington in May. ""It's increasingly acceptable for some bad actors or adversaries to address grievances through violence,"" which has led many companies to put a new focus on security, Joelson said.",c3a85ebaf98a11c95eb27f4beee9f4ba,trafilatura,2868,0

Alta Vera will provide wealth management, capital raising and hedging services, catering to affluent families, founders, and institutions.
The founders aim to expand their business by attracting talent from established banking institutions.
Garcia project’s the business’ assets to grow quickly as a result of “pipeline discussions” with teams at large banks.
The new firm has teamed up with OneSeven, a registered investment adviser, to tap into its offerings in areas such as marketing and compliance.
It is also collaborating with Sextant Capital Solutions for its capital raising endeavours, providing clients with opportunities in private markets.
Trading support, particularly in hedged equity strategies and derivatives, will be provided by Millbank Dartmoor Portsmouth.
Garcia most recently contributed to the growth of wealth firm Azura's business across the Western Hemisphere.
He has 15 years of background with JPMorgan, where he served as managing director and market manager for the private bank in Central and South America.
In an interview to Bloomberg, he said: “I wanted to build a business that wasn’t just another RIA. I was approached too many times where our ultra-high-net-worth clients had business needs and we’d refer that to the investment bank and 99 times out of 100, the investment bank would turn it down. I got tired of saying no to my clients.”
Gatsch will take on the role of president and chief operating officer at Alta Vera, merging his Lakehouse Private Wealth Management firm into the new entity.
His experience includes stints at JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch, and he will maintain his base in Philadelphia.
The firm is also linked to the Merchant Investment Management ecosystem through a 20% stake in OneSeven.
Merchant, overseeing approximately $250bn through its partnerships, will support Alta Vera with the structuring and financing of deals.
Alta Vera is actively engaged in capital raising initiatives, with mandates currently spanning from $50m to $2bn.

Corn, in a number of its various forms, remains my market of choice when it comes to long-term investments.
-
Recently the discussion has turned to if the corn market(s) are undervalued meaning a potential buying opportunity.
More News from Barchart
-
Fundamentally, the National Corn Index has fallen into the lower 20% of its price distribution range, providing us different types of investment information.
As I’ve discussed numerous times, my market of choice when it comes to long-term investments is Corn. Why? The three key reasons are:
-
Based on Peter Lynch’s advice to invest in what you know. Since moving to the US Corn Belt more than 20 years ago, I’ve spent more time analyzing and writing about the corn market than any other.
-
It makes sense. Regardless of what type of analysis we put it through – technical, fundamental, algorithm – the corn market usually makes sense. Yes, I have to say usually because as the Vodka Vacuity tells us, there are no Absolutes in markets. Still, King Corn tends to follow its fundamentals, trends, seasonality, price distribution, etc. as well as any other market I’ve looked at.
-
It isn’t nuts. Again, usually. Just as some traders prefer bonds over equities, I like corn more than soybeans, wheat, cattle, and the rest of the commodity complex. While volatility can and will rise and fall, this provides opportunity rather than ulcers, as is the case in the wheat sub-sector, natural gas, and others.
In my previous piece for Barchart I talked about the long-term position in the Teucrium CORN ETF (CORN). However, if I’m a long-term investor interested in the futures market, I’d have a position in a December corn futures contract-only fund. As July ended, this fund would’ve resembled a contortionist, in a number of theoretical positions, some of them looking uncomfortable. To recap:
-
Short Dec25 (ZCZ25) near $4.80
-
Short Dec25 at $4.60
-
40 cents added through a series of short option positions
-
Before 20 cents were used to buy Dec25 $4.20 calls (July 16) (ZCZ5|420C)
-
-
Long Dec26 (ZCZ26) near $4.60
-
Still based on the bullish technical reversal pattern at the end of August 2024
-
Ending the long-term downtrend that began at the close of May 2022 with Dec22 priced at $7.1150.
-
As we get rolling in August 2025, the corn market remains under pressure. Overnight through early Monday morning (August 4) saw Dec25 dip to a low of $4.0850, 1.0 cent off its new contract low posted in mid-July and still above the August 2024 mark on the continuous monthly chart of $3.8550. Recently, I’ve heard the discussion of the corn market being undervalued meaning it could soon find renewed buying interest from both commercial and noncommercial (fund, speculative, investment, etc.) traders. To add to this debate, let’s look at corn’s intrinsic value – the National Corn Index.",7c3d09f51dd6c42c5f13bb2520f64e63,trafilatura,2842,0

The S&P 500 fell 0.5%, coming off a whipsaw stretch where it went from its worst day since May to its best since May. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 61 points, or 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%.
A weaker-than-expected report on activity for U.S. businesses in services industries like transportation and retail added to worries that President Donald Trump’s tariffs may be hurting the economy. But increased hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, along with a stream of stronger-than-expected profit reports from U.S. companies, helped to keep the losses in check. The S&P 500 remains within 1.4% of its record.
Edgewell Personal Care, the company behind the Schick, Playtex and Banana Boat brands, fell 18.8% after reporting lower profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Rod Little said it was a very weak season for sun care in North America, while tariffs are acting as a drag on profits.
All kinds of companies have been telling investors how much they expect tariffs to shave off their earnings this year, and trade policy was one of the most common topics U.S. services businesses talked about in the latest monthly survey compiled by the Institute for Supply Management about their activity.
“Tariffs are causing additional costs as we continue to purchase equipment and supplies,” one company in the health care and social assistance business said, for example. “Though we need to continue with these purchases, the cost is significant enough that we are postponing other projects to accommodate these cost changes.”
Another business in the real estate, rental and leasing industry told the institute that economic “uncertainty remains the dominant theme. However, the tariff talk has turned out to be much more bluster than actual policy, and businesses have seemed to tune out the noise.”
The threat of tariffs isn’t seeming to slow the juggernaut of investment flowing into artificial-intelligence technology.
Palantir Technologies rose 7.8% after the AI-platform provider reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The AI darling also raised its forecast for revenue over the full year, and its stock climbed further after it had already doubled for the year so far coming into the day.
“We continue to see the astonishing impact of AI leverage,” CEO Alex Karp said.
Axon Enterprise leaped 16.4% after the company, which sells Tasers, body cameras and software to public safety departments, reported a much stronger profit than analysts expected. It also cited growth in its AI offerings, which can save time for transcriptions and other tasks, and raised its forecast for revenue this year.",78f88d4b363603851dedca82b9607170,trafilatura,2825,0

The overall trade gap narrowed 16.0% in June to $60.2 billion, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said on Tuesday. Days after reporting that the goods trade deficit tumbled 10.8% to its lowest since September 2023, the government said the full deficit including services also was its narrowest since then.
Exports of goods and services totaled $277.3 billion, down from more than $278 billion in May, while total imports were $337.5 billion, down from $350.3 billion.
The diminished trade deficit contributed heavily to the rebound in U.S. gross domestic product during the second quarter, reported last week, reversing a drag in the first quarter when imports had surged as consumers and businesses front-loaded purchases to beat the imposition of Trump's tariffs. The economy in the second quarter expanded at a 3.0% annualized rate after contracting at a 0.5% rate in the first three months of the year, but the headline figure masked underlying indications that activity was weakening.
Last week Trump, ahead of a self-imposed deadline of Aug. 1, issued a barrage of notices informing scores of trading partners of higher import taxes set to be imposed on their goods exports to the U.S.
With tariff rates ranging from 10% to 41% on imports to the U.S. set to kick in on August 7, the Budget Lab at Yale now estimates the average overall U.S. tariff rate has shot up to 18.3%, the highest since 1934, from between 2% and 3% before Trump returned to the White House in January.
China trade gap
A centerpiece of Tuesday's report was the latest steep drop in the U.S. trade deficit with China, which tumbled by roughly a third to $9.5 billion in June to its narrowest since February 2004. Over five consecutive months of declines, it has narrowed by $22.2 billion — a 70% reduction.
U.S. and China trade negotiators met last week in Sweden in the latest round of engagement over the trade war that has intensified since Trump's return. The U.S. currently imposes a 30% tariff on most Chinese imports, which has fueled a steep drop off in inbound goods traffic from China. Imports from China dropped to $18.9 billion, the lowest since 2009.
The trade negotiators have recommended that Trump extend an August 12 deadline for the current tariff rate to expire and snap back to more than 100%, where it had briefly been earlier this year after a round of tit-for-tat increases by both sides.
""We're getting very close to a deal,"" Trump said Tuesday in an interview on CNBC. ""We're getting along with China very well.""",aebe4926344da91810ab2de8dd6b7da3,trafilatura,2817,0

The Madri brewer said today (6 August) it now expects its net sales to fall by 3-4% on a constant-currency basis in 2025.
In May, when Molson Coors last lowered its guidance, it forecasts a “low single-digit decline”.
The US giant issued new projections for its underlying income before income taxes and underlying diluted earnings per share.
The Staropramen owner sees its underlying income before income taxes decrease 12-15% this year, once exchange rates are removed from calculations. It had forecast a “low single-digit” fall.
Molson Coors expects its underlying diluted EPS to be 7-10% lower in 2025, again compared to a low single-digit decline it had previously projected.
“As a result of the anticipated ongoing macroeconomic impacts on the industry, our lower-than-expected US share performance, and higher-than-expected indirect tariff impacts on the pricing of aluminum, in particular the Midwest Premium pricing, we have adjusted our 2025 full year top and bottom-line guidance,” president and CEO Gavin Hattersley said.
The new guidance came alongside Molson Coors’ second-quarter results, which included lower net sales, volumes and operating income – although net income grew slightly.
The volumes from Molson Coors’ combined EMEA and APAC division came in below Wall Street expectations, falling 7.8%. The company pointed to “soft market demand and a heightened competitive landscape”.
In the Americas, Molson Coors’ volumes dropped 6.6% in the second quarter amid lower brand volumes in the US and the end of a contract brewing deal. The decline was better than analysts had forecast.
“We continue to view the incremental softness in the industry performance this year as cyclical, and we continue to believe in Molson Coors' ability to achieve its long-term growth objectives,” Hattersley added.
“That said, our second-quarter financial results were impacted by the macroeconomic environment and its broad effects on the beer industry and consumer, our softer US share performance, as well as the resulting impact of volume deleverage.”
Hattersley plans to leave the US beer major by the end the year, the group said in a statement on 14 April. He has headed the Aspall cider brewer since 2019.
“Collectively, we have held most of the share gains over the last three years for our core US power brands – Coors Light, Miller Lite, and Coors Banquet. We remain committed to our premiumisation plans: in EMEA and APAC behind the strength of Madri, in Canada with continued growth in Miller Lite and our flavour portfolio, and in the US with Peroni and our partnership with Fever-Tree as well as continued focus against Blue Moon,” he said.",a8777278895c57786081bc8f51a23f8a,trafilatura,2814,0

Narrowing the focus, MTCH has also underperformed the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund’s (XLC) 27.6% surge over the past year and 11.7% gains in 2025.
Match Group’s stock prices plummeted 9.6% following the release of its lackluster Q1 results on May 8. While the company’s revenue per paying user observed a 1% increase, the paying user count itself dropped by 5% year-over-year to 14.2 million. This led to a 3.4% year-over-year drop in total revenues to $831 million. Meanwhile, its adjusted operating income dipped 1.5% year-over-year to $275.2 million.
Moreover, the company expects its revenues and earnings to face continued pressure during Q2. Match’s guidance suggested its Q2 2025 adjusted operating income may drop by 2% to 4% compared to the year-ago quarter, which unsettled investor confidence.
However, for the full fiscal 2025, Match is expected to report an adjusted EPS of $2.52, up 13% year-over-year. This growth is primarily expected due to share repurchases. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. While it has missed the Street’s bottom-line estimates once over the past four quarters, it has surpassed or met the projections on three other occasions.
The stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 21 analysts covering the stock, opinions include seven “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” and 13 “Holds.”
This configuration has been mostly stable over the past three months.
On Jul. 23, UBS (UBS) analyst Kunal Madhukar maintained a “Neutral” rating on the MTCH stock and raised the price target from $31 to $35.
MTCH’s mean price target of $34.58 suggests a modest 2.1% upside potential. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $46 represents a notable 35.8% premium to current price levels.

BENGALURU (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar will weaken steadily over the coming months on mounting concerns over the Federal Reserve's independence, the credibility of official statistics, ballooning fiscal debt and rising bets on interest rate cuts, a Reuters survey of foreign exchange analysts showed on Tuesday.
Underscoring those concerns, President Donald Trump's dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner last week over unproven claims of data rigging - following record downward revisions to job numbers - prompted a swift reversal of recent dollar gains from Trump's tariff deal with the EU.
While there was a modest pullback from a crowded short-dollar trade, the greenback is still down nearly 9% this year against a basket of major currencies.
Trump's erratic tariff moves, repeated attacks on the U.S. central bank and Fed Chair Jerome Powell and rising debt levels have made investors rethink holding U.S. assets and raised the term premium - compensation demanded for holding long-term debt.
Reflecting that sentiment, foreign exchange strategists, who have maintained a bearish dollar outlook since at least April, forecast in an August 1-5 Reuters poll that the euro would gain around 2% to $1.17 by the end of October and continue to rise to $1.18 in six months.
The euro would then rise to $1.20 in a year - the highest survey median since October 2021.
""We've been trading in this environment of U.S. exceptionalism and the U.S. being far and away the strongest economy in the world. That just isn't the case anymore in my view,"" said Erik Nelson, head of G10 FX strategy at Wells Fargo.
""There are underlying structural concerns - Fed independence, data quality, you name it. When it comes to the economic backdrop, all that is heading in the wrong direction. The temptation for the foreseeable future will be to sell the dollar on rallies.""
An overwhelming majority, 89 of 100 top policy experts in a separate Reuters survey, raised concerns over the accuracy of U.S. government statistics days before Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.
FED INDEPENDENCE
Investor nerves have been further frayed by Trump's repeated attacks on Powell, who has so far resisted the president's demands for steep rate cuts - and Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's early resignation, potentially shaking up an already-fractious succession process for the Fed's leadership. Powell's term as Fed chief expires next May.
""For Trump to place one of his nominees as governor, who could then be elected Chair next year - I believe markets would take it quite poorly.

Dive Brief:
-
A coalition of 26 Republican state finance officials sent letters to the top executives at 25 different U.S.-based asset management firms last week, pushing for the firms to “reaffirm … their commitment to traditional fiduciary duty” by ceasing to frame climate change and other “deterministic future outcomes as long-term risks.”
-
The July 29 letters went to executives at the “Big Three” asset managers — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — along with other high-profile banks, investment firms and asset management arms, including Bank of America, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Goldman Sachs and Invesco.
-
The finance officials, representing 21 states, also urged the asset managers to “abstain” from incorporating net-zero climate commitments, natural capital frameworks and the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive into their “default investment strategies.”
Dive Insight:
The push against the use of ESG factors, such as climate considerations in investment decisions and proxy engagement, follows Wall Street’s exodus from climate alliances earlier this year, spurred by mounting pressure from Republican-led state probes and changes in federal leadership. Such departures and climate commitment walkbacks have led to some states dropping previous state-level probes into the banks, including in Texas and Tennessee.
The finance officials represent states including Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Utah. The letter tells asset management firms “seeking to do business” in those states that they should abandon framing climate change as a long-term risk and incorporating net-zero standards. The missive also asks firms to disclose any coalition or collaborative organizations they have memberships in and align proxy voting guidelines “with shareholder value, not environmental or social goals posed by activists.”
“While some firms have recently taken encouraging steps, such as withdrawing from global climate coalitions and scaling back ESG rhetoric and proxy votes, and some states have permitted incremental reintegration, more work must be done,” the letter said. “The number one issue is a recommitment to the foundational principles of fiduciary duty, loyalty, objectivity, and financial focus.”
The officials alleged that the “potential risks” of climate change “are framed as certain and catastrophic to justify forcing companies to take immediate actions that may not align with their long-term business interests.” Similarly, the letters frame issues like net-zero and CSRD incorporation and alignment as relying on “predetermined political outcomes, not fiduciary judgment.”",939348c2eced7a756ccad16a27292323,trafilatura,2789,0

The practice — which reduces a company's shares outstanding and helps boost earnings per share — hit a record-setting $165.63 billion in July, 88% higher than the previous peak in July 2007, according to new data from Birinyi Associates.
Year-to-date buybacks now stand at $926.1 billion, $108 billion ahead of the previous year-to-date record set in 2022.
""Corporate America continues to be one of the largest buyers of U.S. stocks and from their actions continues to have confidence in their business, despite unsettling tariff headlines,"" the Birinyi team wrote.
The top three sectors of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for buyback activity this year include Financials (XLF), Technology (XLK), and Communication Services (XLC). These three sectors have repurchased $689 billion of their stocks in 2025. Utilities (XLU) has been the most cautious repurchaser with $55 billion.
July saw several large buyback announcements as markets climbed to records, Birinyi noted.
JPMorgan (JPM) took pole position by announcing a $50 billion buyback as regulators have relaxed capital requirements for big banks. Bank of America (BAC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) announced $40 billion and $20 billion buybacks, respectively.
Meanwhile, third quarter standouts include Meta (META) ($10.6 billion), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) ($13.6 billion), and Microsoft (MSFT) ($4.5 billion).
Corporate America's love for share buybacks appears to be coming at the expense of handing out richer dividend checks to shareholders.
Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in fresh research that S&P 500 dividend yields are now within just 20 basis points of their all-time low, last reached during the tech bubble in 2000.
But Reid noted companies may be putting shareholder capital at risk by buying back stock with markets at all-time highs and economic uncertainty elevated.
""Buybacks tend to occur more at market tops than bottoms, meaning companies often buy high, not low,"" Reid said.
Shareholders enjoying the rapid pace of buybacks should keep a few things in mind as well, Reid explained.
One, buybacks are much more discretionary and can vanish overnight in a downturn. Two, buybacks inflate EPS without necessarily improving true profitability. Three, buybacks may reduce investment in the business, especially if used to help meet executive compensation targets or earnings guidance.
""I do care about dividends, and I like to see dividends on the stocks in our portfolios,"" Crossmark chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid. ""And so I think investors should be paying attention to this. It helps provide a little bit of a buffer to the volatility that you see in the marketplace.""",4503ba30987f27641a715312092c8cf0,trafilatura,2784,0

Total revenue dropped to $46.63 billion from $47.30 billion in the same quarter last year, falling short of analyst projections of $48.52 billion. GAAP profit attributable to shareholders was $1.63 billion, reversing a year-ago loss of $129 million.
Underlying replacement cost (RC) profit for the quarter totaled $2.35 billion, compared with $2.76 billion a year ago and $1.38 billion in the previous quarter.

Oil Production & Operations recorded replacement cost profit before interest and tax of $1.9 billion. After adjusting for $300 million in impairments and other items, the segment’s underlying profit rose to $2.3 billion. Results reflected lower realized prices and increased depreciation but were supported by higher production from major project ramp-ups and improved turnaround efficiency.
Gas & Low Carbon Energy generated $1 billion in RC profit before interest and tax. After $400 million in adjustments, underlying profit reached $1.5 billion. Compared with the previous quarter, results improved on higher volumes, though weaker gas prices and increased depreciation and exploration costs weighed on performance.
Customers & Products posted $1 billion in RC profit before interest and tax. On an underlying basis, profit increased to $1.5 billion after adjusting for $600 million. The gain was driven by seasonal demand, strong fuels and refining margins, and a solid oil trading performance. Turnaround activity in refining moderated the growth. Lubricants remained steady, while the convenience and mobility businesses expanded in developing markets.
Operating cash flow was $6.27 billion, up from $2.83 billion in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $3.36 billion, and divestments and other proceeds were $1.36 billion. BP ended the quarter with $26.04 billion in net debt.
Post-tax inventory holding losses reached $407 million, and impairments were estimated between $500 million and $1.5 billion, partially offset by favorable fair value accounting effects.
“This has been another strong quarter for bp operationally and strategically. We are delivering on our plan to grow the upstream and focus the downstream with reliability across both at >96%. So far this year we’ve brought five new oil and gas major projects onstream, sanctioned four more, and made ten exploration discoveries, including the significant discovery in Bumerangue block in Brazil,” commented Murray Auchincloss CEO of BP.",0bd42e684c63ecc9307d941292e0ff2a,trafilatura,2777,0

Speaking to the Financial Times, Rathi directly addressed industry complaints that the Financial Conduct Authority’s plans to compensate customers for car loans dating back as far as 2007 were “completely impractical” due to patchy record-keeping.
“Now is not the time to haggle with us, but to help put things right for consumers,” he said. “We know it is difficult. But you can’t say the law has been broken and it is too difficult to even try to put things right.”
His comments follow the FCA’s announcement of a six-week consultation on an industry-wide compensation scheme, which could result in payouts totalling between £9 billion and £18 billion. The scheme is intended to address cases where customers were unfairly charged higher interest rates due to discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) — a practice banned by the FCA in 2021 but widely used prior to that.
The proposal has prompted concern within the motor finance sector, particularly around how firms will access loan and commission records from as far back as 2007.
Stephen Haddrill, director general of the Finance & Leasing Association (FLA), warned earlier in a statement: “We have concerns about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007, when firms have not been required to hold such dated information, and the evidence base will be patchy at best.”
Legal risk contained, operational risk rises
The FCA's move comes on the heels of a Supreme Court judgment on three test cases — Johnson v FirstRand Bank, Wrench v FirstRand Bank, and Hopcraft v Close Brothers. The ruling narrowed the legal basis for many claims by confirming that car dealers did not owe fiduciary duties to customers. However, it upheld findings of unfair treatment in cases where commission payments significantly inflated interest charges and were poorly disclosed.
The judgment gave the motor finance sector some legal relief, as it removed the risk of a broader wave of litigation. Shares in lenders such as Lloyds, Close Brothers, and Bank of Ireland rose following the ruling. But the court’s backing for the FCA’s interpretation of “unfair relationships” has left the door open to regulatory-led redress, which Rathi is now urging firms to support.

Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (NYSE:VSH) is one of the Best Semiconductor Stocks to Buy Under $20. On July 30, the company introduced a new series of uni/bidirectional 1500 W surface-mount PAR® transient voltage suppressors (TVS) in the SMB (DO-214AA) package. In a bid to cater to the demands of automotive applications, the Vishay General Semiconductor T15BxxA and T15BxxCA series are AEC-Q101 qualified and provide high temperature operation to +185 °C. In comparison to TVS in the SMC (DO-214AB) package, the Automotive Grade devices, which have been released, offer a 58% smaller footprint to save board space and lower system costs.
A close-up of discrete semiconductors in a manufacturing lab.
Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (NYSE:VSH) executed well during Q1 2025 on its strategic levers to fuel faster revenue growth and improve profitability. The company remains well-placed to navigate the evolving tariff policies and any sort of demand uncertainties. Irrespective of the direction global trade actions take, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (NYSE:VSH)’s global manufacturing footprint provides it with flexibility to assure customers of a reliable supply if they decide to shift orders based on country of origin and tariff impact.
With the ongoing execution of strategic levers, Vishay 3.0 remains in a better position to participate in a market upturn and to exploit demand momentum in AI and smart grid infrastructure. Under Vishay 3.0, the company is in close contact with its customers, focusing on minimizing the impacts of macroeconomic uncertainties. Investment management company First Pacific Advisors recently released its Q1 2025 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. (NYSE:VSH) makes passive electronic components and discrete semiconductors (resistors, inductors, capacitors, MOSFETs, diodes, etc). Although the industry is cyclical, competitive dynamics are stable and VSH benefits from incremental growth from electric vehicles and industrial electrification. The industry is currently struggling from a cyclical downturn following the excesses and component hoarding of the Covid era. Additionally, at its April 2024 Investor Day, Vishay announced very aggressive 2028 investment and profitability targets with a plan to strategically change the company’s culture that was notably staid and overly-conservative. We are cautiously optimistic about Vishay’s growth plans and have been adding to the position during this cyclical weakness.”

This initiative aims to facilitate up to €100m in new loans.
At least 30% of the funds from this EIB loan will be allocated to Polish Mid-Cap investments that contribute to climate change mitigation and promote environmental sustainability.
The agreement will focus on supporting projects in Poland’s cohesion regions where per capita income is below the European Union (EU) average.
Mid-Caps, defined as companies employing between 250 and 3,000 people, often face challenges in securing investment financing.
Under this new agreement, these businesses will have access to competitive loans and credit lines for projects capped at €25m.
Eligible investments include solar and biogas installations, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient building upgrades.
EIB vice-president Teresa Czerwińska said: “We are supporting Polish Mid-Caps’ energy transition with steps ranging from developing renewable energy to improving energy efficiency.
“In providing strategic resources to Mid-Caps, we want to encourage more private investors to engage with this important segment of the market.”
Credit Agricole Bank Polska will offer loans with favourable terms, including interest rates at least 25 basis points lower than market rates, backed by the EIB.
The partnership aligns with the objectives of RePowerEU, a programme aimed at reducing the EU's dependence on Russian fossil fuels and underscores the EIB's role as the EU’s climate bank.
Part of the Credit Agricole Group, Credit Agricole Bank Polska has been present in Poland since 2001 and is a key player in supporting the country's energy transformation.
The bank offers a comprehensive range of credit products for financing green investments, including Green Loans with EU subsidies and other environmentally focused financial services.
The EIB and Credit Agricole have a history of supporting business growth and financing projects across France, Italy, and Poland in areas such as the energy transition and digitisation.
Last year, the EIB Group, which includes the European Investment Fund (EIF), signed nearly €89bn in new financing for more than 900 projects, with nearly half directed towards cohesion regions in the EU.
In Poland, the EIB committed €5.7bn to new investments last year, with a significant portion supporting climate and environment projects.
Credit Agricole Bank Polska senior country officer and vice-president Bernard Muselet said: “The partnership between the EIB and Crédit Agricole is a response to the growing needs of entrepreneurs who want to make an energy transition and plan to implement sustainable business practices.",cc35db60d26d17c1f63ddd325a68331c,trafilatura,2755,0

Baron Global Advantage Fund stated the following regarding Loar Holdings Inc. (NYSE:LOAR) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
""We recently initiated a position in Loar Holdings Inc. (NYSE:LOAR), a niche aerospace parts manufacturer founded in 2012. Loar boasts an 85% proprietary product portfolio, with over 50% of its revenue derived from the high-margin aftermarket channel. Proprietary, aftermarket focused products are among the strongest business models in the aerospace and defense industry, as evidenced by the success of TransDigm. This segment is attractive for several reasons. First, the aerospace industry is growing, with passenger miles increasing faster than GDP at roughly 4% per year. Second, Loar benefits from strong pricing power due to the critical nature of its components, the absence of substitute products (owing to high proprietary content), and high barriers to entry. These components are high-risk, low-cost for airlines, which are reluctant to compromise safety for minimal cost savings (most Loar parts cost less than $1,000). Additionally, substitution of existing parts requires a lengthy and costly FAA approval process, which is often uneconomical for competitors to pursue given the high-variability, low-volume nature of aircraft components (millions of components per aircraft, each with low production volumes). These factors should enable Loar to achieve approximately 10% organic revenue growth and 15% adjusted EBITDA growth. Furthermore, beyond these value drivers, Loar is executing a disciplined acquisition strategy, successfully integrating 17 acquisitions over the past 13 years.",909afee53bcc3100eb9ba4aa9904c313,trafilatura,2750,0

This move aligns with the company's strategy to assess gold-bearing structural corridors in the region.
The gold exploration licence application for the Yakassé project, initially filed by Geoservices in February 2021, was later amended to increase the area from 67km² to 74.06km² at Kobo's request in July 2025.
The project is strategically located near other exploration sites including the Nesdave permit and the Kuniboa application, enhancing its potential value.
Situated approximately 100km north-east of Abidjan, the Yakassé project is accessible via established roads and is in a region known for Birimian geological formations, which are often associated with gold deposits.
Under the agreement, Kobo Resources will collaborate with Geoservices on exploration activities, contingent upon Geoservices securing a research permit.
An initial payment of C$20,000 ($14,503.5) has been made by Kobo, with additional payments and share issuances outlined upon further progress and approvals.
To acquire a 90% interest in the Yakassé licence, Kobo Resources is committed to a phased investment totalling approximately C$719,500 over four years.
Each year's investment correlates with an increasing percentage of interest in the permit, culminating in a 90% stake by the fourth year.
Should Kobo decide to pursue an exploitation licence, a joint venture (JV) will be formed with Geoservices and the Government of Côte d’Ivoire, with Kobo holding the majority share.
Additionally, Kobo retains the option to increase its JV share by purchasing an extra 4% from Geoservices for C$2m.
The agreement also includes a 1% net smelter return to Geoservices, with Kobo having the option to buy back half of this royalty. Upon commercial exploitation, Geoservices is set to receive additional company shares, subject to regulatory approval.
Kobo Resources CEO and director Edward Gosselin said: “Our earn-in agreement on the Yakassé Project marks a meaningful step in Kobo’s strategy to expand our exploration portfolio in one of Côte d’Ivoire’s promising gold regions. This project sits within a structurally complex and underexplored area that has already returned high-grade results from past drilling by reputable operators.
“With its expected strong regional potential and well-developed infrastructure, the Yakassé Project aligns with our long-term growth strategy. Subject to the approval of the pending application, we look forward to advancing exploration on this project with Geoservices as we continue unlocking new opportunities alongside the development of our flagship Kossou Project.”",bd4b1865a52aa775c66a164edea4fe40,trafilatura,2742,0

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO Dive newsletter.
Today’s finance chiefs are steadily assuming a rising host of responsibilities outside of finance — an evolution that is also shining a spotlight on the critical, interconnected role of the finance function. For newly-minted Finzly CFO Adam Carson, “finance is not a passive or backseat function at all,” he told CFO Dive, but rather, “a driving partnership with the business.”
The first-ever finance chief for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company, Carson’s appointment earlier this month comes as Finzly seeks to further expand its operations and market reach, according to a July 17 press release announcing the move. Alongside Carson, Finzly also appointed Robert Coakley as head of partnerships, according to the release. The company provides payments infrastructure to financial institutions and supports payment rails including ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT and instant payments.
In his first few months as finance chief, Carson is focusing on ensuring the finance function is well-positioned to help Finzly’s strategic goals of expansion. For any finance chief coming into a new situation — whether the company’s first CFO or otherwise — the focus is on determining if the business is set up effectively for where it needs to go in the future, “and you want to assess that around the people, the technology and the partnerships and processes that you have in place,” he said in an interview.
“What you're looking for is ultimately, alignment on how you get from where you are today to where you think the business strategically needs to be in the future, and how does finance contribute to that growth rate?” Carson said.
A culture of connectivity
A veteran of the software industry, Carson was attracted to the top financial seat at Finzly due to the combination of its previous success — the business’ clients include financial entities such as Arvest, Banc of California, and EverBank — and its future growth potential. His background and the ambitions of Finzly’s founder and CEO, Booshan Rengachari, also “lined up well in terms of where the company was going,” he said of taking the seat.
Carson’s past roles in the software space include stints at Intuit, Barracuda Networks and Cyence, and he most recently served as CFO for private equity-backed software-as-a-service firm Movista, according to his LinkedIn profile. As VP, finance and investor relations for Barracuda, Carson helped to facilitate the cybersecurity provider’s initial public offering in 2013, before the company was sold to Thoma Bravo for $1.6 billion in 2017, according to reports at the time from Reuters and Dark Reading.",2af44900b46912031d817e1b42599490,trafilatura,2739,0

The world's biggest semiconductor manufacturer told CNBC that it has taken ""strict"" disciplinary action against the personnel involved and that it has also launched legal proceedings.
""TSMC maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward any actions that compromise the protection of trade secrets or harm the company's interests,"" the company said.
""Such violations are dealt with strictly and pursued to the fullest extent of the law. We remain committed to safeguarding our core competitiveness and the shared interests of all our employees.""
Semiconductors have grown in strategic importance in recent years as they have become the key pillar in the boom in artificial intelligence models and applications. Rising geopolitical tensions has put the spotlight on the competitive technological advantages of major firms in the chip supply chain like TSMC and other leaders across the board.
TSMC, headquartered in Taiwan, dominates the market for the manufacturing of the world's most advanced chips and counts major tech giants including Apple and Nvidia as clients.
As the case is now under judicial review, TSMC is unable to provide further information, the firm said.
TSMC identified the issue early due to its ""comprehensive and robust monitoring mechanisms,"" the company said, adding that it carried out swift internal investigations.
Nikkei Asia, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter, reported on Tuesday that several former employees of TSMC are suspected of attempting to obtain critical proprietary information on 2-nanometer chip development and production while they were still working at the company.
Production of the 2-nanometer chip is among the leading edge manufacturing processes in the semiconductor industry currently. TSMC said it did not have any additional information to share when asked by CNBC about the Nikkei report.
As the world's leading chipmaker, TSMC has a treasure trove of intellectual property. By its own account, the company has previously said it has more than 200,000 trade secrets recorded in its internal system.
It is not the first time that TSMC has been the target for potential theft. In 2018, a Taiwanese court indicted a former employee for copying trade secretes related to the 28-nanometer fabrication process, with intent to transfer them to a semiconductor company in mainland China.
In 2023, ASML, which makes machines that are required to manufacture the most advanced chips, said that it discovered that a former employee in China had misappropriated data related to its proprietary technology.",9f1f901bc025277fb6cface1fe68d8df,trafilatura,2717,0

But not everyone will be happy.
Big banks, followed by traditional money managers, are on pace to dole out some of the most sizable pay increases, but the bonus pool for some Wall Street and Main Street bankers, as well as those given out by funds managing private assets or alternatives, may still disappoint, according to a report from compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates.
Broadly, the report brings a welcome shift of higher bonuses across most of Wall Street compared to the spring, when dealmaking of all varieties, especially IPOs, hit the brakes as markets plunged. It still projects 2025 bonuses in most areas of finance falling below lofty expectations set at the end of last year.
""It has turned from a disappointing year to one that's maybe OK,"" Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, said. ""But that's a pretty big change for the better; it looked quite disappointing earlier this year,"" Johnson added.
Here are some of Wall Street's bonus winners and losers so far for 2025.
Bonuses for those working at stock trading desks at big banks should see as much as a 30% increase, the biggest jump from last year, according to the report. These workers have thrived on the fees earned from navigating client funds through what’s so far proved a volatile year.
That compares to an increase of as much as 20% in bonuses for stock trading specialists that Johnson Associates initially forecast at the end of last year — and the 25% jump it projected in May.
Next in line for large pay increases are other traders and dealmakers who underwrite bond market offerings. Those two professional groups could see as much as 20% and 15% increases, respectively, so long as interest rate volatility and demand from corporations looking to refinance debt remains strong.
Among other winners are workers in private credit, traditional money management, and wealth management.
Despite a rebound in deals in recent months, M&A and IPO bankers aren't expected to see the impressive pay increases of their debt underwriting colleagues, given how much farther out their fees are officially booked versus when a related deal gets announced, according to Johnson.
Bonuses for M&A bankers are on pace to rise as much as 5% this year, while those for IPO professionals are projected to be flat to down 5% from last year.
While Wall Street’s bonus pool has broadly rebounded since May, workers in some areas of finance have seen more stagnation, such as retail, commercial banking, and a broad swath of others working in private asset fund management (real estate, venture capital, and mid-sized to smaller private equity firms).",a2be52d5d7b1d885f6c4f352b381cf4d,trafilatura,2717,0

And yet, Julie Sweet has not only defied that assumption, she’s redefined what modern CEO readiness looks like in an era when domain expertise is being eclipsed by intellectual agility.
Before she took the helm of Accenture, the $176 billion consulting powerhouse, Sweet was a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the elite Manhattan law firm where partners rarely leave and even more rarely leap into a completely different industry. She had built a career there closing high-stakes M&A deals, not architecting cloud transformations or negotiating AI partnerships.
But in 2010, when Accenture approached her to become its general counsel, Sweet made the jump. Her father had recently died at age 68, a personal loss that left her reflecting on what she wanted her career and life to look like. “It reminded me to make sure I was living life to the fullest,” she told my colleague, Lila MacLellan, in a newly published Fortune magazine feature.
At the time, Accenture was shifting its growth strategy and looking to become more acquisitive. It saw in Sweet a business-savvy legal partner who could help execute on that ambition. Still, she joined with no formal background in technology and admits she didn’t know what the cloud was when she started.
Rather than seeing that gap as a liability, Sweet treated it as a learning opportunity. She enlisted Bhaskar Ghosh, now Accenture’s chief strategy and innovation officer, as a personal tutor. They met every two weeks for 18 months. It was a deliberate, sustained effort to build fluency in an area that would soon become central to Accenture’s future and her own.
Sweet has emphasized that understanding technology isn’t optional for executives; it’s foundational. Leaders today, she says, must understand how tech is changing products, industries, and customer expectations.
In 2019, following the untimely death of CEO Pierre Nanterme, Sweet was named chief executive. Her ability to connect the dots across legal, strategic, and operational domains has proven an asset, especially as the company scales up partnerships with firms like Nvidia and Palantir to embed AI across both commercial and government clients.
In interviews with Fortune, analysts credited her with positioning Accenture for the next wave of enterprise transformation. Clients described her as highly engaged, detail-oriented, and deeply prepared. Former colleagues also highlighted her ability to synthesize complex information and her tendency to keep pressing until she fully understands an issue.",48cbe3c62c0a71a0d3bae4bb7a552029,trafilatura,2698,0

Looking closer, the software maker stock has also outperformed the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLK) return of over 22% over the past 52 weeks and 10.6% gain on a YTD basis.
Shares of Microsoft rose nearly 4% following its Q4 2025 results on Jul. 30 due to stronger-than-expected EPS of $3.65 and revenue of $76.4 billion, driven by a 39% surge in Azure revenue. The company also announced a record $30 billion in expected Q1 capital spending, signaling aggressive investment to meet booming AI demand, including Copilot reaching 100 million monthly active users. Additionally, Azure's annualized sales exceeded $75 billion for the first time, reflecting strong AI-driven growth and helping fuel a broader $500 billion rally in AI stocks.
For the fiscal year, ending in June 2026, analysts expect MSFT's EPS to grow nearly 12% year-over-year to $15.27. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 46 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on 39 “Strong Buys,” five “Moderate Buy” ratings, and two “Holds.”
On Jul. 31, Truist analyst Joel Fishbein raised Microsoft’s price target to $650 while maintaining a “Buy” rating, citing strong Q4 results driven by accelerating Azure growth, AI workload expansion, and increased cloud migrations.
As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $600.80. The Street-high price target of $675 implies a potential upside of 28.8% from the current price levels.

The U.S. dollar index slipped after the data, giving a boost to commodity prices across the board, particularly precious metals.
While silver surged, gold has remained relatively rangebound, with the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF struggling to sustain momentum.
For more than three months, gold has swung back and forth as investors weigh tariff-related uncertainty, shifting inflation expectations and mixed economic data. GLD, which closely tracks the spot price of gold, reflects that choppiness.
What’s the correlation between precious metals and the U.S. dollar, why has silver has emerged as a standout performer and what does the future hold for silver and gold prices, along with the ETFs that track them?
SLV vs. GLD: Why Silver Outshines Gold in 2025
Silver's recent outperformance compared to gold is being driven by a combination of factors that highlight its dual nature as both a monetary metal and an industrial commodity. While gold has been a strong performer, silver's unique market dynamics have given it an edge in recent months.
Here are some key reasons for silver's stronger performance.
Surging Industrial Demand
A significant portion of silver's demand comes from industrial applications, unlike gold, which is primarily a monetary asset. There's been a surge in demand from high-growth sectors, particularly solar energy, where silver is a critical component in photovoltaic cells.
Other applications in electric vehicles, 5G technology and electronics are also contributing to a persistent supply-demand imbalance. This industrial demand acts as a powerful tailwind for silver prices, especially when the global economy shows signs of resilience or recovery.
The Gold-Silver Ratio
The gold-silver ratio measures how many ounces of silver it takes to buy one ounce of gold. Historically, this ratio has fluctuated, but its long-term average is well below where it has been in recent years. Silver analysts often point out that the ratio is still elevated, suggesting that silver remains undervalued relative to gold.
As this ratio narrows (meaning silver's price rises faster than gold's), it attracts investors who see it as a ""catch-up trade.""
Monetary Policy Expectations
Both gold and silver are considered safe-haven assets, but silver's price tends to be more volatile, acting as a ""high-beta"" version of gold. This means it can outperform gold during periods of bullish sentiment in the precious metals market.",81458ff4e88a7740a85e5cb2abe2d073,trafilatura,2695,0

It's nice that Tilray is diversified, but it's also not profitable.

Interested investors may want to wait for a turnaround before investing.
Meet Tilray (NASDAQ: TLRY). In its own words, ""Tilray's mission is to be the most responsible, trusted and market leading cannabis consumer products company in the world with a portfolio of innovative, high-quality, and beloved brands that address the needs of the consumers, customers, and patients we serve. A pioneer in cannabis research, cultivation, and distribution, Tilray's unprecedented production platform supports over 20 brands in over 20 countries, including comprehensive cannabis offerings, hemp-based foods, and craft beverages.""
Sounds great, right? You may be wishing that you had invested in it long ago. But hold on -- because here's how much your investment would be worth today if you'd plunked $1,000 into Tilray five years ago: $78.56. Ouch! (For context, $1,000 invested in the S&P 500 index five years ago would be worth around $2,080.)
That might seem puzzling if you've watched state after state legalize sales of cannabis products and seen stats such as this, from Fortune Business Insights: ""The global cannabis market size was valued at USD 43.72 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow from USD 57.18 billion in 2023 to USD 444.34 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 34.03%."" (CAGR = compound annual growth rate.)
Here's the thing, though: It's still relatively early in the growth of this industry, and it's not yet clear which companies will prosper most. It won't necessarily be the ones with the best technology or the most visionary leaders or even the most money.
Tilray's stock is down for reasons such as overpaying for acquisitions. Its stock might look compelling now, with its recent price-to-sales ratio of 0.63 well below its five-year average of 1.9. But remember that the company isn't profitable at the moment, and it might be best to wait for clearer signs of success.

The company, which also owns CoinDesk, said it plans to sell 20.3 million ordinary shares with an expected price of $28-$31 per share. At the top end of range, the company would be valued at $4.2 billion, according to the number of outstanding shares mentioned in an amended F-1 document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.
The move sees Bullish join a number of crypto firms entering public markets since President Donald Trump took office after a pro-crypto election campaign. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, went public in June, as did Israeli social trading platform eToro. Industry majors including BitGo, Grayscale have filed for IPOs as well, while exchanges Kraken and OKX are also said to be mulling similar moves.
Funds managed by BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have shown interest in buying up to $200 million worth of shares at the IPO price, according to the amended F-1 document. The offerings' underwriters have the option to purchase an additional 3.045 million shares, depending on demand.
The roadshow comes weeks after Cayman Islands-headquartered firm filed its initial F-1 registration with the SEC. The company, which plans to use the ticker ""BLSH,"" aims to use the IPO proceeds for general corporate purposes and potential future acquisitions.
Bullish runs an institutional trading platform providing spot and derivatives trading as well as liquidity services, according to its filing.
The company provided an net income estimate of between $106 million and $109 million for the second quarter. In the first quarter, it posted a $349 million loss after reporting profit of $80 million for all of 2024.
In the filing, Bullish says it holds more than $3 billion in liquid assets, including 24,000 bitcoin, 12,600 ether and over $418 million in cash and stablecoins. That total, the company said, also includes funds supplied to decentralized finance protocols, although the amounts “are not material” to the overall total.
The wave of IPOs comes after the Trump administration provided the industry a long-sought favorable regulatory climate. That includes the GENIUS Act being signed into law last month, and a series of legal actions brought during the previous administration against leading industry participants being dropped.
The improved regulatory climate has helped prices soar. Bitcoin (BTC) is up more than 22% this year to trade around $115,000 while the broader market, measured through the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, has gained 32%.",b8dce43ce8c014a0feb5601d0ff70808,trafilatura,2692,0

(Reuters) -Palantir Technologies shares surged nearly 9% in early trading on Tuesday, after the company lifted its annual revenue forecast for the second time this year, banking on strong demand for its AI-related services from governments and companies.
Investors have been betting big on the data analytics and defense software company's military-grade artificial intelligence tools and services, with Palantir being one of the biggest beneficiaries from increased U.S. defense spending.
That has helped double the company's stock price this year, making it the best performer on the S&P 500 index through last close. The stock has surged more than 600% in the last three years.
""Palantir isn't just a government vendor anymore - it's becoming an indispensable partner for enterprises in the AI revolution,"" said Jacob Falkencrone, Saxo's global head of investment strategy.
Wedbush analysts expect the company to hit trillion dollars in market capitilization in the next few years, fueled by the AI boom. Its market cap was $379.14 billion as of the stock's last close.
Co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2003 and listed in 2020, Palantir has won a slew of U.S. government contracts this year - including a $30 million contract from Immigration and Customs Enforcement in April.
The Trump administration has been bolstering its focus on national security. Last week, the U.S. Army said it might spend up to $10 billion on Palantir's services over the next decade.
""Palantir's staggering growth is showing no signs of slowing ... and (its) ability to grow at scale has been underestimated by a large cohort of the market,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Sales to the U.S. government jumped 53% to $426 million, representing more than 42% of the total second-quarter revenue of about $1 billion.
VALUATION CONCERNS
Some analysts have expressed concerns about the company's lofty valuations.
The stock trades at over 200 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, making it the most overvalued on the S&P 500 index, compared with AI giant Nvidia's 34.81.
""Despite the company having robust competitive advantages...we believe this is turning into a difficult-to-justify valuation story,"" Morningstar analysts said.
Palantir also expects expenses to rise significantly in the third quarter due to seasonal hiring, at a time when big tech firms are rushing to poach top AI talent.
At least eleven brokerages raised their price targets on the stock after the company's results.

On Sunday, Kyren, a popular crypto analyst on X, called last month “a big one for $ONDO,” highlighting the launch of Ondo Catalyst with Pantera Capital, the acquisitions of Strangelove and Oasis Pro, recognition in a White House report, and expanding integrations for USDY, Ondo’s tokenized U.S. Treasury product. The analyst believes these developments are just the beginning, saying he feels “we're gearing up for an EXPLOSION for August.”
Behind that sentiment is a flurry of corporate activity. In early July, Ondo Finance launched Ondo Catalyst, a $250 million strategic investment initiative backed by Pantera, aimed at scaling tokenized real-world asset (RWA) markets. The firm also acquired Strangelove, a blockchain development studio, and Oasis Pro, a U.S. SEC-registered broker-dealer and alternative trading system. These deals give Ondo both the technical infrastructure and legal framework to expand compliant tokenized securities offerings — especially in the U.S. market.
Ondo’s USDY stablecoin is also gaining traction. In July, it was approved for integration with both the Sei Network, a fast DeFi-optimized Layer 1, and Alchemy Pay, a fiat-to-crypto payments gateway. Together, the integrations aim to enhance USDY’s accessibility and adoption.
Beyond corporate partnerships, the White House’s July 2025 Digital Asset Markets Report specifically mentioned Ondo Finance as a leader in compliant tokenized finance, a recognition that analysts say lends institutional credibility. Meanwhile, the firm’s Global Markets Alliance expanded to 25 members, including BNB Chain and Bitget Global, as part of a broader push to standardize tokenized asset infrastructure globally.
This burst of activity has prompted renewed interest in what Ondo Finance actually does. The company operates at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain, offering a suite of tokenized investment products that aim to make institutional-grade financial instruments accessible through decentralized protocols.
Its operations span two core areas: Asset Management, which designs yield-generating tokenized products like USDY and OUSG (tokenized U.S. Treasury and bond products); and Technology Development, which builds the smart contract infrastructure powering these offerings. Key lending platforms like Flux Finance are part of this ecosystem, supporting DeFi-based borrowing and lending with both open crypto and permissioned assets.",cff0716f9204c0f7957a1aeb0f36a6dd,trafilatura,2688,0

There were significant top- and bottom-line improvements in the second quarter.
-
Boeing is ramping up production of the 737 MAX, its most popular commercial jet.
-
Management expects Boeing to have positive free cash flow by the fourth quarter.
Boeing (NYSE: BA) stock is down 4% since the company reported its second-quarter financial results Tuesday. At first glance, this would suggest that investors were disappointed with Boeing's second-quarter performance.
However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index have posted two straight days of modest losses, so the broader market has been under a bit of pressure. Also, it's worth noting that Boeing stock is up 28% this year, as of July 30.
Here are three takeaways from Boeing's second-quarter results.
1. Production is stabilizing
Boeing delivered the most commercial airplanes in the quarter (150) and in the first half of the year (280) since 2018. That's why ""stability"" was a common theme in CEO Kelly Ortberg's comments on the Q2 earnings call -- although he didn't go as far as to say that production has fully stabilized.
The headliner here is the 737 MAX, the next generation of Boeing's best-selling jet. In the second quarter, Boeing hit its target of producing 38 per month, ""and now we're focused on demonstrating stability at that rate,"" Ortberg said. If monthly 737 MAX production stays steady at 38, Boeing plans to seek Federal Aviation Administration approval to ramp up to 42 jets per month.
Another positive development: Production of the 787 Dreamliner has increased from five to seven airplanes per month. The recovery in Boeing's production capabilities correlates with a sharp uptick in sales. Boeing's second-quarter commercial airplane revenue soared 81% to $10.9 billion. The company's overall Q2 revenue increased 35% to $22.7 billion.
2. Boeing's bottom line is getting healthier
The second-quarter numbers suggest Boeing is making progress on its gradual ascent back to profitability.
On a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, Boeing reported a $176 million loss from operations, down from a loss of $1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the first half of 2025, Boeing swung to positive earnings from operations -- $285 million -- which is a dramatic improvement over its $1.2 billion loss in the first half of 2024.
For the second quarter, Boeing had negative free cash flow of $200 million. However, that's down from negative free cash flow of $4.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow is a measure of profitability that excludes noncash items like stock-based compensation, changes in inventory values, and depreciation and amortization.",46cec0061ade16371fb5fef5d94352c1,trafilatura,2687,0

(Reuters) -Companies across the corporate spectrum revealed more pain from the cost of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war, with bellwethers Caterpillar, Marriott and others on Tuesday noting weaker demand and higher prices.
All told, global companies that have reported earnings so far this quarter are looking at a hit of around $15 billion to profits in 2025, Reuters' global tariff tracker shows.
A majority of these come from industrial, manufacturing and automotive sectors, while financial and tech sectors are less affected.
Trump has said the tariffs are necessary to resolve U.S. trade imbalances and declining manufacturing power; he has said the levies on imports will bring jobs and investment to the United States.
""I think we're just getting started,"" said Steve Sosnick, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut. ""The tariffs are still in their infancy, especially with major trading partners like Canada, China and India still in flux.""
Tuesday's round of earnings illustrates the different ways trade policy is affecting companies, from the rising costs of imported materials like metals to the slippage in consumer confidence that has sapped demand.
Caterpillar, for instance, saw a 0.7% hit to revenue, while its cost of goods rose by 6.5%, and CEO Joe Creed told investors that tariffs are ""likely to be a more significant headwind to profitability in the second half of 2025.""
Beer maker Molson Coors said it was expecting costs of between $20 million and $35 million in the second half of the year due to a tariff-driven rise in the price of aluminum delivered to the U.S. Midwest.
Tariffs on aluminum shipped into the United States were doubled to 50% in June from the previous 25% duty imposed in March.
White House Spokesman Kush Desai, in a statement to Reuters, said the president's trade deals ""have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people.""
MARKET RESILIENCE
The markets, however, have remained resilient even as Trump's policies continue to change. He said on Tuesday that he would raise tariffs on goods imported from India from the current 25% as part of an ongoing spat with the country over its purchases of oil from Russia.
U.S. equities rebounded sharply from their April lows following what Trump deemed ""Liberation Day,"" when he unleashed a wave of global tariffs.

The markets, however, have remained resilient even as Trump's policies continue to change. He said on Tuesday that he would raise tariffs on goods imported from India from the current 25% as part of an ongoing spat with the country over its purchases of oil from Russia.
U.S. equities rebounded sharply from their April lows following what Trump deemed ""Liberation Day,"" when he unleashed a wave of global tariffs.

Dive Brief:

WD-40 Company's initiative to decentralize its supply chain and bring sourcing closer to customers is offsetting the impact of tariffs, according to its July earnings call.
-
Since the start of the fiscal year on Sept. 1, the chemical company has strengthened global partnerships with key suppliers, which improved efficiencies, optimized networks and brought cost savings that bolstered gross margins, executives said.
-
""Where there is, particularly with our Americas region, some tariff exposure, particularly around steel cans with the tariffs, we are managing to offset that globally in terms of countermeasures from supply chain initiatives, making it virtually a wash globally for us,"" CFO Sara Hyzer told analysts.
Dive Insight:
WD-40 is one of several brand manufacturers modifying their supply chains to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Others include Clorox tapping alternative sourcing, Colgate-Palmolive shifting production and Procter & Gamble initiating a supply chain reorganization.
WD-40's diversified supply chain will minimize the effect of potential tariffs by sourcing raw materials and manufacturing products close to the company's customers and end users, CEO Steve Brass said during an April earnings call.
""This decentralized nature of our supply chain helps a lot,"" he said. ""We've got a lot of supply chain optimization measures happening this fiscal year.""
In China, the company has avoided retaliatory tariffs by manufacturing locally for Asian markets, using China nationals to operate its business there, Brass said. ""Within China at the moment, we are kind of seen as a local brand in many places we operate around the world.""
In Dubai, the company partnered with a manufacturer to deliver products to customers in the region within five or seven days, much quicker than the one month previously required for maritime shipments, he said in the July call. The change has also meant local partners could reduce their on-hand inventory.
Nevertheless, Brass acknowledged that tariffs could impact the company's markets in the Americas, especially Mexico and Canada. The Americas account for 6% of WD-40's global business, he said in the company’s April earnings call. As a precaution, the company increased inventory in specific markets to reduce the immediate impact of tariffs, he added.
WD-40’s supply chain shifts should help the household products company reach its gross margin goal of 55% to 56% during the current fiscal year, one year earlier than initially planned, Hyzer said.",e965d8dd20ccb0d3509b1a823d344988,trafilatura,2681,0

(Reuters) -Two Chinese nationals in California were arrested and charged with illegally shipping tens of millions of dollars' worth of AI chips to China, including Nvidia H100s, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday.
Chuan Geng, 28, of Pasadena, and Shiwei Yang, 28, of El Monte, exported the advanced Nvidia chips and other technology to China from October 2022 through July 2025 without the required licenses from the U.S. Commerce Department, the Justice Department said, citing an affidavit filed with the complaint.
According to the affidavit, Geng and Yang's El Monte-based company, ALX Solutions, was founded in 2022, shortly after the U.S. imposed sweeping export controls on technology to China to slow Beijing's military modernization and began to require licenses for the chips. China opposed the U.S. move as harming normal trade.
Over 20 shipments from ALX went to shipping and freight forwarding companies in Singapore and Malaysia, which are often used as transshipment points for illegal goods to China, a federal agent, who works for the Commerce Department, said in the affidavit.
ALX received a $1 million payment from a China-based company in January 2024 and other payments from companies in Hong Kong and China, not from the freight forwarding companies, the agent said.
Nvidia H100s are advanced chips that can be used to train large language models and many other applications.
Records show that from at least August 2023 to July 2024, ALX Solutions bought over 200 Nvidia H100 chips from San Jose, California-based server maker Super Micro Computer, declaring that the customers were in Singapore and Japan, the agent said.
On one 2023 invoice valued at $28,453,855, ALX said the customer was in Singapore, but a U.S. export control officer in Singapore could not verify the chips arrived in the country and the company did not exist at the listed location, the document says.
""This case demonstrates that smuggling is a nonstarter,"" a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. ""We primarily sell our products to well-known partners...who help us ensure that all sales comply with U.S. export control rules.""
Diverted products have ""no service, support or updates,"" the statement added.
Super Micro said in a statement it was ""firmly committed to compliance with all U.S. export control regulations."" It said it did not comment on ongoing legal matters, but cooperated with authorities in any such proceedings.
Geng and Yang appeared in federal court in Los Angeles on Monday, the Justice Department said. Geng, a permanent resident, was released on $250,000 bond. Yang, who overstayed her visa, has a detention hearing on August 12.",4a8b78c617ccda764082812ce2b92bef,trafilatura,2681,0

Although still lagging many emerging economies, the US’s crypto product holding rate increased to 23.5% in 2025, while UK holding nearly doubled to 18% from 10% last year, according to the annual Financial Services Consumer Survey by GlobalData, publishers of RBI.
GlobalData’s latest report, “Innovation in Stablecoins 2025”, reveals that while these fixed-value digital assets (stablecoins) will inevitably disrupt the payment space in the future, for now just a third of global crypto holders are paying for goods and services with cryptocurrencies, while only 17% are using them for P2P transfers.
With growing regulation as well as institutional and retail interest, the most pressing challenge for wider adoption today is stablecoins’ interoperability with traditional currencies and payment rails. Retail costs related to on- and off-ramping between fiats and digital currencies are still higher or at par with existing money movement methods, which outweighs stablecoins’ benefits for small-scale transactions, until exiting the DeFi ecosystem (i.e., off-ramping) is required.
Scale: the real utility of stablecoins
Blandina Szalay, Banking & Payments Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The real utility of stablecoins today is in scale. So-called stablecoin sandwiches bring about numerous benefits for large cross-border institutional transfers. Converting a fiat to stablecoin then back to another fiat currency can circumvent the inflated foreign exchange fees of correspondent banking—a key source of TradFi institutions’ income still.”
The other key benefit on the institutional side lies with the virtually limitless real-time movement of funds facilitated by blockchain. Unlocking this instantaneous liquidity largely improves cash flow management, in contrast to the traditional settlement times of 2–5 business days. There is further potential to profit from funds moving freely overnight and weekends, to leverage the highest-yielding money market opportunities.
Local liquidity challenges-especially in emerging markets
Szalay continues: “Beyond these benefits, local liquidity poses challenges too, specifically in emerging markets, where retail demand for stablecoins is also the strongest. Despite all benefits of a stablecoin transfer, off-ramping coins to some local emerging market currencies is challenging, so the tokenisation of non-reserve currencies is expected to fold out soon, to mark a next step in the global stablecoin push.”",a04f159a5cd62d12f41a962eeb640c10,trafilatura,2662,0

Narrowing the focus, LYV has also outperformed the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund’s (XLC) 27.6% surge over the past year and 11.7% gains in 2025.
Live Nation Entertainment’s stock prices gained 1.9% in the trading session following the release of its mixed Q1 results on May 1. While the company experienced a drop in concerts and ticketing sales, it observed a slight improvement in sponsorship and advertising revenues. Overall, its topline declined 11% year-over-year to $3.4 billion, missing Street expectations.
However, Live Nation’s operating cash flows surged 33.6% year-over-year to $1.3 billion. Furthermore, the company reported an operating income of $114.8 million, notably up from $41.4 million operating loss reported in the year-ago quarter.
For the full fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect LYV to report an EPS of $2.35, down 14.2% year-over-year. On the positive note, the company has a solid earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters by notable margins.
The stock has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating overall. Of the 21 analysts covering the stock, opinions include 19 “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” and one “Hold” rating.
This configuration is slightly more bullish than two months ago, when 18 analysts gave “Strong Buy” recommendations.
On Jun. 18, Guggenheim analyst Curry Baker reiterated a “Buy” rating on LYV and maintained the price target of $170.
Live Nation’s mean price target of $168.85 suggests an 11.6% upside potential. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $185 represents a notable 22.3% premium to current price levels.

(Reuters) -Taiwanese authorities have detained three people for allegedly stealing technology trade secrets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the world's largest chip foundry, Taiwanese prosecutors said on Tuesday.
The three were detained late last month after TSMC reported that an internal investigation had shown that former and current employees had illegally obtained information from the company, the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office said in a statement. The prosecutors office said another two people had been released on bail, and one more had been released.
The three who have been detained - two current staff and one former employee - are suspected of violating Taiwan's national security law, it added. It did not disclose their identities apart from saying that the former staffer was surnamed Chen.
Earlier on Tuesday, TSMC said it had launched legal proceedings and taken disciplinary action against employees involved in potential trade secret leaks after detecting unauthorised activities during routine monitoring.
It said its ""comprehensive and robust monitoring mechanisms"" enabled early identification of the issue, leading to internal investigations and measures against the personnel involved.
TSMC said the legal case, which is now under judicial review, prevented it from providing further details.
Nikkei Asia earlier reported that the breach involved several former employees suspected of attempting to obtain critical proprietary information on TSMC's 2-nanometer chip technology.
There were no immediate details on the suspected motives or whether any information had been passed on, and investigations are ongoing to determine the scope of the leak and whether any others were involved, the Nikkei report said.
Taiwanese media outlet United Daily News said prosecutors and investigators had also searched the offices of Tokyo Electron, without citing where they had obtained the information. Tokyo Electron and the prosecutors' office declined to comment.
TSMC's 2-nanometer chip technology is the most advanced technology in the semiconductor industry in terms of both density and energy efficiency, according to the company's website.
The contract manufacturer, which counts AI industry darling Nvidia, iPhone maker Apple, and Qualcomm among its customers, highlighted its zero-tolerance policy for trade secret violations, and said it would pursue offenders to the full extent of the law.

Furthermore, TD Cowen believes that Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) didn’t see any signs of deteriorating consumer demand as backlog and order linearity remained healthy, with the trend potentially extending into the quarter ended September. That being said, the risk remains about the potential demand softness, added the firm. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s strategic initiatives in the IoT market have been gaining traction.
During Q3 2025, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) rolled out numerous new products, such as Wi-Fi 7 solutions, broad markets devices, and next-generation Touch controllers, strengthening its portfolio and positioning it for long-term growth. Investment management company First Pacific Advisors released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) designs and sells a collection of chip designs and technologies around wireless networking, data processing, and video/audio compression. The company is also the leader in chips that facilitate touchscreens in consumer devices and cars. After losing its contract for the iPhone display driver in 2018, SYNA has been re-orienting its business toward internet of things (IoT) – allowing edge and peripheral devices to quickly and efficiently process and send data. SYNA has concurrently been hit by the large cyclical slowdown and de-stocking in the semi-conductor industry that caused June 2024’s fiscal year revenue to fall 29% while EPS fell 72%.

The S & P 500 is on track for earnings growth of 9% in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago, more than double the 4% at the end of June, according to a Friday report from Goldman Sachs. Even so, the response has been middling, at best. Goldman Sachs found that the median stock whose earnings topped expectations has only outperformed the S & P 500 by 0.55 percentage points, below the historical median of 1.01 percentage points. Meanwhile, earnings disappointments have been punished more severely than in the past. The investment bank found that companies that missed earnings expectations underperformed by roughly twice the historical precedent. Shares of Amazon , for example, dropped more than 9% in two days after the online retailer reported second-quarter results that topped expectations but issued lackluster current-quarter operating income guidance. Other examples include On Semiconductor , which dropped more than 15% Monday even after posting solid results. Paltry reward ""The reward for earnings beats has been paltry,"" Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin wrote. There are several potential reasons for the muted response to strong earnings. For one, much of the total index gain comes from the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks , which as a group are responsible for year-over-year earnings growth of 26% in the second quarter. The rest of the S & P 500? Just 4%. Kostin noted that analysts set an ""unrealistically"" low bar coming into the second-quarter earnings season, fearful of the effect tariffs would have on businesses' ability to boost profits and plan for the future. Instead, a review of earnings calls thus far suggest management confidence in its ability to navigate levies, Kostin said. Still, there are those on Wall Street who worry that repeated tariff extensions will continue to weigh on the market and the economic outlook. For her part, Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said a review of second-quarter earnings calls is making her cautious. ""In the Wednesday press conference,"" after last week's Federal Reserve policy meeting, ""the phrase that Chairman Powell used that really resonated with us, is that we have a 'long way to go' in understanding what the impacts of tariffs will be on inflation,"" Calvasina wrote in a note.

The Office of Personnel Management, the federal human resources agency that implemented Musk's push to slash the federal workforce, announced the end of the ""five things"" email via a memo that rescinds guidance instructing workers to comply with the initiative.
""At OPM, we believe that managers are accountable to staying informed about what their team members are working on and have many other existing tools to do so,"" OPM Director Scott Kupor said in a statement, adding the agency told government HR representatives that OPM would no longer manage the process nor use it internally.
While many federal agencies had already phased out compliance with the weekly email, the move signals the Trump administration is turning the page on one of Musk's most unpopular initiatives following a falling out between the two men in early June.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Musk, who spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help Trump win November's presidential election, led the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to slash the budget and cut the federal workforce until his departure in May to refocus on his tech empire.
Musk initially received a warm White House sendoff from Trump, but then incurred the president's wrath by describing Trump's tax cut and spending bill as an abomination.
Trump pulled the nomination of Musk ally and tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to lead NASA and later threatened to cancel billions of dollars worth of federal contracts with Musk's companies after the blowup between the two men.
The ""five things"" email, launched by Musk in February to boost accountability, sparked tensions with department chiefs who were blindsided by the weekend email mandating the move. It also fueled confusion among government workers who received mixed messages about whether and how to comply.
Reuters reported in March that the White House installed two Trump loyalists at OPM to ensure better policy coordination between the White House and the agency.
Scott Kupor, a venture capitalist who took the helm at OPM in July, foreshadowed the end of the initiative last month, describing processing of the weekly response emails as ""very manual"" and ""not efficient.""

“The Freight Rail Customer Alliance (FRCA) has long been opposed to continued consolidation in the rail industry based on past experiences resulting in increased rates, higher fees and unreliable service,” said FRCA President Emily Regis, in a release.
UP (NYSE: UNP) and NS (NYSE: NSC) on July 29 announced the $85 billion stock-and-cash deal to create a transcontinental system with more than 50,000 route-miles of track in 43 states. The carriers said the acquisition would improve service by cutting up to 48 hours from a loaded railcar’s total travel time from departure to arrival, know as dwell, while simplifying paperwork and creating a seamless journey for trains moving from coast to coast.
The FRCA pointed out that since the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 deregulated freight railroads, the industry has shrunk from 40 Class I carriers to six, with four handling 90% of U.S. rail freight.
“This demonstrated market power is a continuing concern as the railroads have lost market share to trucks over the past 20-plus years due to their dismal service and high rates, but the railroads keep increasing their profits and reducing their operating ratios,” said FRCA spokesperson Ann Warner, in the release. “This growth in and exploitation of railroad market power has also included forcing shippers into contracts that not only fall outside the Surface Transportation Board’s (STB) regulatory jurisdiction but also lack protection from poor service and increased fees. Any efficiencies achieved under so-called Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) have NOT been passed through to shippers – only retained by the railroads and their shareholders to Wall Street’s applause.”
The adjudicatory authority of the STB, which will either accept or reject the UP-NS deal, covers published tariff rates and not confidential contracts between railroads and shippers.
As far as service is concerned, unlike shippers who move goods by the carload, the FRCA observed that it is unclear how the STB’s tougher merger rules would benefit its larger shippers who move bulk freight such as coal or grain in trains dedicated to a single commodity, known as unit trains.
Regis stated that “particularly important to FRCA members is that a transcontinental merger provides enhanced competition for those who ship via unit train, typically point-to-point, and can utilize only a single rail carrier.”",edcef8028cace98e9f3a924de330a138,trafilatura,2623,0

That’s according to a team of Citi analysts led by Maximillan Layton, who bumped their near-term price forecast (0 to 3 months) to $3,500 an ounce from $3,300 an ounce. Their expected range for gold over the next three months was lifted to between $3,300 and $3,600 an ounce, from $3,100 to $3,500.

Gold prices GC00 were powering higher on Monday, up $36.80, or 1%, to $3,436.10 an ounce. Part of that driver was rising expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates at its September meeting following last week’s weaker-than-expected jobs data.
Those new Citi targets would mean a fresh record for the precious metal, which has gained nearly 30% this year. Gold briefly set a new intraday record high of $3,500 on April 22, based on a continuous contract basis, and a record settlement price of $3,452.80 was reached on June 13.
Gold’s march to new highs stalled this summer, with some finger-pointing at a slowdown of central bank buying. Still, Citi sees plenty of reasons why that march to new highs can resume.
“U.S. growth and tariff-related inflation concerns are set to remain elevated during 2H’25 [second half of 2025], which alongside a weaker dollar, are set to drive gold moderately higher, to new all-time highs,” said Layton and his colleagues. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY has lost nearly 9% this year. At the end of June, the dollar marked its worst first-half since at least the early 1970s.
They noted that U.S. tariffs on trading partners are coming in higher than expected, with many deals at 15% and some well north of that — Switzerland was hit with a surprising 39% levy last week. While most of that revenue will ultimately be redistributed via tax rebates and the net impact of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, that will take time, possibly not being fully felt until 2025, the Citi analysts said.
“Further, these tariffs will likely be (temporarily) inflationary for the U.S. in the near term. We have also seen weaker labor market data during [the second quarter of 2025], institutional credibility concerns have increased regarding the Fed and U.S. statistics, and geopolitical risks are presently elevated related to Russia/Ukraine,” the analysts said.",f69fa5bf1b64157c4b3333d5fa02aa3f,trafilatura,2623,0

(Reuters) -Miami International Holdings, the parent of bourse operator MIAX, is targeting a valuation of up to $1.67 billion in its New York initial public offering, setting the stage for a rare flotation of a U.S. financial exchange.
The Princeton, New Jersey-based company, backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, is seeking to raise up to $315 million by offering 15 million shares priced between $19 and $21 apiece, it said on Monday.
The listing comes at a time when frequent bouts of market volatility, triggered by geopolitical tensions and tariff turmoil, have boosted trading volumes and profits for exchanges in recent quarters.
Exchange IPOs are rare. Less than half of U.S. bourse operators are public. Cboe Global was the last big one to get listed in 2010.
Miami International, which competes with CME Group, Cboe, Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange, has eyed a stock market listing for some time. It confidentially filed paperwork in 2022.
""There is currently strong appetite for U.S. domiciled specialty IPOs and we expect demand for the MIAX IPO to benefit,"" said IPOX CEO Josef Schuster.
Still, ""the fact that this is not a pure growth deal"" could have an impact on the valuation, Schuster said. Miami International plans on using the proceeds to repay debt and for other purposes.
In the first half of 2025, Miami International's revenue jumped 21.4% to $654.9 million, while adjusted earnings nearly quadrupled to $67.8 million.
RAPID RISE
MIAX was founded in 2007 after a wave of consolidation amongst equity and options exchanges. It is led by Thomas Gallagher, one of its principal founders.
The firm operates nine exchanges across asset classes, including options, equities and futures.
Since launching its first options exchange in 2012, MIAX has steadily grabbed market share from its peers, making it the fourth-largest U.S. options exchange, according to the Options Clearing Corporation.
In June, MIAX acquired the International Stock Exchange, a European listing venue, to bolster its global footprint. It also owns the Bermuda Stock Exchange.
Miami International secured $100 million investment from Warburg Pincus last year and another $40 million in June.
Asset manager Wellington Management has also indicated interest in buying up to $40 million of shares.
J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Piper Sandler are the lead joint bookrunning managers. Miami International will list on the NYSE under the symbol ""MIAX"".

Not only will these added costs on imports hurt Americans’ wallets, they could make earning money in the gig economy harder, too.

Trump announced on Wednesday, July 16 that he would send a letter implementing tariffs on goods from 150 smaller countries. Tariffs with larger trade partners, including Mexico, the European Union and Canada would also go into effect on August 1. Tariffs already in effect include a 25% tariff on vehicle import and auto parts, a 30% tariff on many Chinese imports, and up to 50% on steel and aluminum, according to NewsNation.
These tariffs will affect prices on consumer goods, which, in turn, could hurt small businesses and gig workers. GOBankingRates spoke with Keith Spencer, career expert at Resume Now, to find out which gig workers could be hit hardest by tariffs in 2025.
Rideshare and Delivery Drivers
Drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft could feel the sting of tariffs on oil imports, motor vehicles and car parts, which would increase their business costs. “Fuel, tires and parts, many of which are imported, become more expensive,” Spencer said.
At the same time, demand might decrease. Faced with rising costs, people might forgo little luxuries like ordering DoorDash or having their groceries delivered via InstaCart.
“In a high-tariff economy, side gigs that rely heavily on consumer convenience tend to struggle first,” Spencer said. “When prices rise, people naturally start cutting back on discretionary spending. That often impacts gig workers who depend on steady, high-volume demand.”

Task-Based Gigs and Home Help
People who have been making money doing random tasks around the home through services like TaskRabbit may struggle to find customers. People who assemble furniture, mount TVs or perform small contracting and handyman tasks around the home will likely feel the impact of tariffs. People may choose to complete these tasks on their own rather than hiring someone.
Plus, Spencer said, “If the price of imported goods like furniture or electronics increases, people may delay or avoid those purchases. That naturally reduces demand for anyone offering services to set them up. Even when demand is steady, the cost of tools and materials often rises, which means gig workers are spending more out of pocket just to do their jobs.”",a9145407fc8595927e783afe471748d3,trafilatura,2611,0

Vehicle demand in the country has weakened significantly in recent months, following two years of strong sales growth, despite a pick-up in economic activity in the country. Economic growth in the country continued to accelerate in the second quarter of 2025, reaching 8% year-on-year, up from 5.5% in the first quarter, driven mainly by surging exports. Domestic consumption weakened significantly, however, with sentiment being affected by uncertainty over US import tariffs.
In the first seven months of the year, the vehicle market declined by almost 16% to 234,450 units from 278,181 units in the same period last year, with sales of domestically-produced vehicles falling by 17% to 121,366 units, while import sales dropped by almost 14% to 113,084 units. Sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) amounted to 14,175 units in this period, led by Tesla with 6,022 units, followed by local automaker Luxgen with 2,154 units, BMW 2,148 units, and Mercedes with 1,293 units.
The performances of the individual brands varied significantly year-to-date, with market leader Toyota reporting a 1% decline to 72,369 units; followed by its Lexus division with a 4% decline to 17,814 units; CMC 15,298 (+25%); Mercedes-Benz 14,738 (-12%); Honda 11,551 (-29%); Hyundai 10,877 (-24%); BMW 10,398 (-14%); and Mitsubishi 7,722 (-22%).
Last year, Taiwan reintroduced minimum local content requirements for locally-assembled vehicles – regulations that had been discontinued more than two decades ago. Under the new rules, locally-assembled vehicles are required to have a minimum local content of 15% in their first year of production, rising to 25% in the second year and 35% in the third year. The government claims the new regulation is mainly aimed at ensuring minimum safety standards while also protecting the country’s component supply chain.

Revenue growth, excluding the impact from exiting the German market, was 6% YoY.
The US market contributed significantly to the growth, with revenue up 5.3% to $2.9bn.
International revenue also saw an uptick of 3.1% to $399m, with constant currency growth at 2.1%.
Gross profit reached $984m, representing 30.1% of total net revenue. Net income stood at $15m, with non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at $205m.
The company's diluted earnings per share were $0.11. Operating activities generated a net cash of $273m, and non-GAAP free cash flow was $230m.
Wayfair ended the quarter with $1.4bn in cash and short-term investments, with total liquidity reaching $1.8bn.
Wayfair CEO, co-founder and co-chairman Niraj Shah stated: ""The second quarter was a resounding success, defined by accelerating sales and share gain, in tandem with expanding profitability. As we have discussed over the last few years, we can and will grow profitably, while taking significant share in the market.
“Year-on-year revenue growth of 6% - excluding the impact of Germany - marks the highest growth rate we have seen since early 2021. Our over 6% adjusted EBITDA margin demonstrates the significant leverage in our model, and as previewed in our investor day two years ago, is just the beginning of what we believe we can achieve over time.""
Despite these gains, active customer count decreased 4.5% YoY to 21 million. However, revenue per active customer increased by 5.9% to $572.
Orders per customer slightly rose to 1.86, maintaining orders delivered at 10 million.
Repeat customers accounted for 80.7% of orders - a slight decrease from the previous year's 81.7%.
The average order value increased to $328, up from $313 in the previous year, with orders placed via a mobile device constituting 62.9% of total orders delivered.
Shah added: ""Every dollar we spend solves for the best outcome across our customers, suppliers and Wayfair. Two decades of this approach has taught us that building great things takes time, but when done with thought, care and prudence, can have a payoff well worth the wait.
“You're seeing some of that this quarter - with years of work we've done leading to some of the best growth and profitability flow through our business has seen since the pandemic.

Economic data releases and earnings
Last week, fears over the US economy slowing more than initially thought took center focus as the major indexes experienced the worst single-day drop of the summer.
That was the headline takeaway from the busiest week of data releases slated for the summer of 2025.
But underneath the surface, there are still plenty of reasons to feel confident in the path higher for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), according to Wall Street strategists — a confidence that seemed to roar back on Monday as the S&P 500 jumped 1.5%.
Besides the dour jobs report, investors also learned that the S&P 500 is pacing for year-over-year earnings growth of 10.3%, well above the 5% expected entering the reporting period, per FactSet data.
On top of that, we heard Big Tech giants say they're set to spend another $364 billion in AI investments during 2026, and third quarter earnings estimates for the S&P 500 weren't slashed during the first month of the quarter for the first time in over a year.
In other words, while the US economic growth story is taking hits, the fundamental driver of the AI-driven bull market is absolutely cooking. That made Mike Wilson and the equity strategy team at Morgan Stanley declare ""we’re buyers of pullbacks,"" and that the team is bullish over the next 12 months.
""While there's risk in the near-term, we are gaining confidence in our 12-month bullish view fueled by better earnings/cash flow growth,"" Wilson wrote. ""The drivers include positive operating leverage, AI adoption, dollar weakness, cash tax savings from the [One Big Beautiful Bill], easy growth comparisons, and pent up demand for many sectors in the market.""
BlackRock's Investment Institute, led by Jean Boivin, wrote in a weekly market commentary note that there is a clear ""tug-of-war"" between the economic drag of tariffs and US corporate resilience driven by AI.
They, too, are taking their signal from the latter.
""Questions remain about who will pay for tariffs,"" Boivin's team wrote. ""Early signs indicate a mix of consumers and companies. We think US corporate strength could cushion the blow and stay overweight the AI theme and U.S. stocks.""
In a research note summing up earnings reports seen from more than two-thirds of S&P 500 companies this quarter, Bank of America Securities head of US equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian wrote that the ""AI arms race is alive and well.""",cea5717d10502cdb28bd876041011d44,trafilatura,2600,0

The US stocks have corrected from peaks as a result, driving S&P 500 and Nasdaq down for more than 1% from respective peaks.
The overall macro sentiment shifts towards the tighter than expected monetary policy in September: after strong GDP data for the US, and Jerome Powell’s press-conference, probabilities of interest rate in September shift towards 4.25 – 4.5 (60% of traders bet on this scenario according to FEDwatchtoll), which indicates the ambiguous situation around inflation.
Yields of 30-year bonds in the US stabilize around achieved levels. The overall situation rather provides some pressure for cyclical assets and provokes capital to return to safe havens and rotation from speculative instruments back to the US dollar.
Along with the US dollar, Japanese Yen also gains strength, as yields of 30-year bonds of Japan are kept at highs. Other “safe havens”, such as Swiss Franc, for example – don’t show resilience in today’s markets.
The market entered the last summer month, August. It’s usually considered a month with low volatility, but in case of unexpected geopolitical events, volatility may come earlier than in September.
The US President Trump had announced a deadline for the Russia-Urkaine conflict for Aug 8 (end of next week) and pressured India and China to impose more tariffs in case of buying oil from Russia. This situation adds some uncertainty to the global energy markets, which we observe in the form of rising Crude oil.
Crude Oil
Crude oil climbs higher towards the peak of the Bollinger Bands: the upper border of a technical trading range. Oil is a momentum based instrument, i.e. it can continue the breakout, but given the main declining trend, the breakout probably has a small chance to be sustained.
One may monitor for excessive breakout and spikes to the gray area (potential resistance area): in case the area is rejected, the mean-reversion trade with a price getting back to the range (and hitting $60 later within the year) might be a preferred option.
Gold
Gold is pushed down by the retreating US dollar and tight yields of 30-year treasury bonds, but the overall main trend still might be considered bullish.
To continue climbing higher, however, it needs a trigger or shift in the narrative. The latter is unlikely, but it might find a technical trigger by a spike to the downside, as shown in the chart.
If the responsive buying activity is visible, we might observe Gold getting back to the range.",4dc44eed9ee0a123214d07e0cd847eb9,trafilatura,2599,0

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Trinidad and Tobago's government has agreed to award U.S. oil major ExxonMobil acreage in an ultra-deep area that includes seven blocks to explore for oil and gas, two senior government officials told Reuters.
The parties began negotiations earlier this year for the areas off the east coast of the Caribbean country, which ExxonMobil left more than 20 years ago. The blocks are located northwest of ExxonMobil's prolific Stabroek block in Guyana, where the consortium it leads has confirmed more than 11 billion barrels of recoverable resources.
ExxonMobil and the Trinidadian government could sign the agreement as soon as next week, according to the people with knowledge of the negotiations, who were not authorized to speak publicly.
The area to be awarded to ExxonMobil is an amalgamation of seven blocks, and has been renamed Ultra Deep 1 or UD(1). The area covers water depths of 2,000 to 3,000 meters, the people told Reuters.
""We will not comment on third party sources, but we routinely look at opportunities to optimize our advantaged portfolio,"" an ExxonMobil spokesperson told Reuters.
Trinidad and Tobago Energy Minister Roodal Moonilal did not respond to a request for comment.
""Ultra-deep Trinidad and Tobago could unlock potential similar to ExxonMobil's Stabroek block,"" according to a 2024 study by Houston-based energy data analytics firm TGS.
In Guyana, ExxonMobil and partners Chevron and CNOOC are about to begin production at their fourth floating facility, which will expand its capacity beyond 900,000 barrels per day (bpd), less than six years after beginning oil production in the South American country. The group plans to produce up to 1.7 million bpd by 2030.
During a press briefing last week, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods said exploration is part of a three-pronged approach to ensure that the company continuously replaces the oil and gas it produces.
""We're continuing to have a very consistent and focused effort on finding more resources that will be economically advantaged and competitive in our portfolio."" Woods said.
WORK TO DO
ExxonMobil has agreed to a signing bonus and a three-phase exploration program in Trinidad that includes the acquisition of seismic data and drilling of exploration wells, the two sources said.
If oil or gas is found, the agreement also includes royalty payments and a share of the profits to the government, along with a provision for cost recovery, the sources said.
ExxonMobil first approached the Trinidadian government in November of 2024 with interest in the seven blocks, they added.",02b168f12b9a4b4bdf2d182bad79d22b,trafilatura,2598,0

(Reuters) -Top-rated U.S. companies have financed their acquisitions mostly with equity and cash instead of debt this year, and could continue doing so even as M&A activity and hopes of interest rate cuts rise, bankers and investors said.
High debt costs and worries of credit-rating downgrades for taking on debt made funding acquisitions with cash and stock with sky-high valuations more compelling, they said.
Last week, rail operator Union Pacific announced an $85-billion deal to acquire Norfolk Southern, and analysts expect it to finance the deal mostly with stock, some cash, and $15 billion to $20 billion of debt.
The deal could set a record for the largest buyout in the sector.
Such cash-and-stock deals have become popular due to a narrowing gap between the pre-tax costs of equity and debt, according to Piers Ronan, co-head of debt capital markets at Atlanta-based investment bank Truist Securities.
Some $250 billion, or 11% of total M&A funding this year, was stock funding, while 15.3% of deal volume was funded by a mix of cash and stock, according to LSEG data.
This compares with $441 billion, or 14% of all M&A funding in 2024 that was stock-funded and 7% cash-and-stock funded, the data showed.
""Debt is not really so attractive right now -- because equity is so attractive,"" Ronan said, pointing to its attractive earnings yield.
Many corporations have posted strong earnings and generate healthy free cash flow, which has contributed to ""an uptick in equity financing of M&A transactions and a little less reliance on debt financing,"" said Natalie Trevithick, head of investment grade strategy at Los Angeles-based asset manager Payden & Rygel.
Investment-grade companies have also grown wary of adding debt to avoid downgrades, which could increase their funding costs.
Ratings agencies Moody's, S&P, and Fitch warned their ratings on Union Pacific could be downgraded if the company pushes its leverage higher due to its planned Norfolk Southern acquisition.
“(A ratings downgrade) is going to have a pretty big impact on how your bonds trade in the secondary market,” said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at Madison, Wisconsin-based asset manager Madison Investments.
Sanders pointed to the poor trading performance of media company Warner Bros Discovery's bonds following its announced split into two separate publicly-traded companies and downgrade to junk status in June.
Less reliance on debt by M&A-intent companies could cause end-of-year volumes for investment-grade issuance to fall short of their $1.5-trillion level in 2024, bankers said.",bfc99c0436fd24e66e04f0bca19aa80f,trafilatura,2593,0

-
Berkshire Hathaway increased its already large SiriusXM stake to 37% of the company.
-
SiriusXM has been beaten down as investors seem less than confident in the future.
-
Management is aggressively cutting costs and rolling out new growth initiatives.
We recently learned that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) was yet again a net seller of stocks in the second quarter of 2025. We don't yet have all the details about what the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate bought and sold, but we know that several billion dollars' worth of stocks were disposed of.
This has been an ongoing trend for Berkshire over the past couple of years. Buffett and his team have unloaded significant portions of the massive investments in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and have reduced or completely sold several other major stock positions. We also learned of recent dispositions of some Verisign (NASDAQ: VRSN) and DaVita (NYSE: DVA) shares. Berkshire has even stopped buying back its own shares for the time being, which came as a surprise to many investors after a decline of more than 10% in its share price.
However, this isn't to say that Buffett and his stock pickers aren't buying any stocks. In fact, there's one company whose stock Berkshire has continued to buy, and it recently bought even more.
A stock Warren Buffett can't get enough of
According to recent SEC filings, Berkshire bought another 5 million shares of SiriusXM (NASDAQ: SIRI) for a cost of about $106.5 million.
Of course, an investment of this size isn't exactly massive for Berkshire. In fact, it represents about 0.03% of the company's $344 billion cash stockpile. But it's especially significant because of how much of the satellite radio operator Berkshire owns now. In fact, after this investment -- which is just the latest in a series of additions -- Berkshire now owns 37% of Sirius.
Why has Buffett loaded up on SiriusXM stock?
The short explanation is that Buffett most likely added more shares of SiriusXM because the stock is extremely cheap. As of this writing, SiriusXM trades for just over 7 times forward earnings estimates. The business is highly profitable, with over $1 billion in annual free cash flow, and pays a 5% dividend yield that is well covered by its earnings.

The deal equates to the buyout of STAAR’s outstanding stock at $28 per share and will avail Alcon of STAAR’s EVO Implantable Collamer Lens (ICL) portfolio.
STAAR’s EVO ICLs address vision correction for conditions including myopia with and without astigmatism via a minimally invasive, reversible procedure that does not remove corneal tissue.
Research estimates that 500 million individuals globally are currently considered ‘high myopes’, with 50% of the global population projected to be myopic to some extent by 2050.
Alcon said the addition of STAAR’s EVO ICL will complement its laser vision correction business and positively impact profit margins from year two post-transaction. The deal is expected to close within six to 12 months, pending customary closing conditions.
Alcon CEO David Endicott commented: “With the number of high myopes rising globally, the acquisition of STAAR enhances our ability to offer a leading surgical vision correction solution for those who are not ideal candidates for other refractive surgeries such as LASIK.
“This transaction will allow us to provide treatment options across the full spectrum of myopia – from contact lenses to surgical interventions – reinforcing our commitment to addressing the most significant needs in eye care.”
Alcon’s acquisitive streak and the culmination of STAAR’s market challenges
The STAAR buyout marks the latest deal in what has been an acquisitive year for Alcon. In March, the Swiss-headquartered company acquired Lensar in a deal valued at around $356m, gaining access to Lensar’s ALLY robotic cataract laser treatment system, which Alcon expects to enhance the capabilities of its femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) technology.
Last month, Alcon announced plans to acquire LumiThera in a deal set to give it control of the US-based company’s photobiomodulation device for treating early and intermediate dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
For STAAR, the Alcon acquisition puts a stopper on a challenging period for the company. STAAR’s Q1 2025 financials revealed a 45% decline in sales to $42.6m, down from $77.4m in Q1 2024.
The California-based company chiefly attributed the decline to weakened demand in China and additional headwinds due to Chinese Government initiatives affecting device procurement. To steady the ship, STAAR revealed plans for a $30m share buyback programme in May to account for volatility in the global macroeconomic environment.",d84b1f699d82971af0166a34d8303400,trafilatura,2586,0

(Reuters) -Some companies are favoring ether over bitcoin as an inflation hedge as the cryptocurrency hits a sweet spot between affordability and credibility, while being underpinned by a strong blockchain backbone.
Corporate treasuries held at least 966,304 ether tokens on their balance sheets at the end of July, worth nearly $3.5 billion, according to a Reuters analysis of regulatory filings and disclosures. That compares with just under 116,000 at the end of 2024.
The second-largest cryptocurrency has become the token of choice for those looking for more active returns. Unlike bitcoin, which solely relies on price appreciation, ether can be used in staking, a practice where holders lock up their tokens to support the ethereum network in exchange for rewards.
Staking can offer yields of about 3% to 4%.
""Ether balances growth potential with the legitimacy of a blue-chip asset. It is large enough to be institutional-grade, yet early enough in adoption to benefit from future upside,"" said Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, which has ether on its balance sheet.
The cryptocurrency also powers the ethereum blockchain, which supports a wide range of applications including lending platforms, trading protocols and stablecoins, making it a core component of the crypto financial system.
""Holding ether is more like owning oil, whereas bitcoin is more one-dimensional, like gold. Ether is the foundation of decentralized finance, not just a pure store of value,"" said Anthony Georgiades, general partner at VC firm Innovating Capital.
Still, challenges such as regulatory uncertainty and price volatility, which affect the assets' fair value, continue to hinder adoption.
CAUTION AMID HYPE
After disclosing plans to accumulate ether earlier this year, shares of Peter Thiel-backed BitMine and gaming media network GameSquare jumped as much as 3,679% and 123%, respectively, underscoring how eager investors are to chase crypto-linked momentum.
But analysts have cautioned against unfettered optimism.
""The share price response has the hallmarks of the meme craze,"" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.
The inherent volatility of crypto tokens also makes it a poor fit for boards with a low risk appetite, which could curb ether's appeal beyond core industry players.
""Most CFOs would not swap liquid cash for ether. It remains a niche tool best left to 'tech-forward' treasuries that can tolerate swings and complexity,"" said Anuj Karnik, founder and managing director at Straitsberg, a Singapore-based treasury advisory firm.",618a85bccf15204f535276d586a67b1d,trafilatura,2581,0

COIN is trading modestly higher on Monday at $316 following last week's earnings-related 18% plunge.
“While we remain constructive on the current crypto cycle, we expect a choppy 3Q alongside weak August/September seasonality and waning retail interest in crypto treasury stocks,” analysts wrote. “We also expect increasing stablecoin competition to weigh on both COIN and CRCL's valuations in 2H25.”
Coinbase missed expectations for second-quarter results, and early third-quarter trends aren’t looking much better. Subscription and services revenue, a metric investors see as a reliable income stream, came in 8% below Wall Street estimates in Q2. The midpoint of the company’s Q3 forecast is also 5% below consensus.
“‘Other S&S revenue’ was a key contributor to COIN's 2Q/3Q miss,” Compass Point wrote, pointing to a sharp quarter-over-quarter decline in Coinbase One and other tech-related fees — segments many investors had hoped would drive long-term growth.
Compass Point’s downgrade comes as the crypto market loses momentum despite broader stock markets recovering after last week’s dip. Bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH) have struggled to gain ground, and retail investors appear to be pulling back from “TreasuryCo” stocks — companies holding large amounts of BTC or other cryptos on their balance sheets. This includes Coinbase and Strategy (MSTR), the latter of which recently slowed its bitcoin buying pace and shifted toward raising funds through preferred equity rather than stock offerings.
The analysts flagged that elevated leverage in crypto markets poses a further risk. July’s rally was fueled by aggressive trading, but with open interest rebounding after a short dip in liquidations, a deeper sell-off could trigger another round of forced selling.
Valuation is also a concern. Despite the weak Q2 results, COIN shares rallied 56% from May to July. Compass Point warns that “COIN is still trading at 44x annualized 3Q25E Street EBITDA forecast,” which it believes is too high given headwinds in retail trading, competition from ETFs and DeFi, and limited near-term regulatory breakthroughs.
Compass Point was also doubtful the CLARITY Act — a bill seen as key to regulatory reform — would pass this year. “We’re more skeptical towards a market structure bill passing this year,” the firm said, projecting movement in early 2026 instead.",eca3d2fc57ab23605d2b64d054ffcb4c,trafilatura,2581,0

Gerresheimer has announced plans to separate its moulded glass business following a comprehensive strategic review aimed at assessing growth opportunities and competitive positioning.
The company, which serves the pharmaceutical, biotech, and cosmetic sectors, plans to initiate a sales process for this business unit.
The moulded glass division, strengthened by the acquisition of Bormioli Pharma, operates eight production facilities across the Americas, Europe, and Asia.
In 2024, this unit generated approximately €735m ($850.4m) in revenues, with an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation margin of around 20%.
As part of the integration of Bormioli Pharma, Gerresheimer is establishing the moulded glass business as a standalone entity.
Further updates on this transition will be shared during the upcoming capital markets day scheduled for 15 October 2025.
The combined operations provide a diverse range of glass packaging solutions, including bottles, jars, and containers, for the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food and beverage sectors.
In addition, the acquisition has allowed Gerresheimer to expand its offerings, including primary packaging and dosing systems for pharmaceuticals while enhancing opportunities for integrating high-value plastic solutions within the industry.
Gerresheimer CEO Dietmar Siemssen said: “We see the best growth opportunities for our newly formed Moulded Glass Powerhouse outside the Gerresheimer Group.
“As part of our strategic transformation, Gerresheimer will focus even stronger on the portfolio of systems and solutions for the pharma and biotech industry.”
The company has invested around €100m in upgrading its facility in Lohr am Main, Germany, by installing an energy-efficient oxy-hybrid furnace over the past two years.
In December 2024, Gerresheimer announced the addition of a new syringe production hall at its site in Skopje, North Macedonia, with an investment of more than €100m.

As per the analyst, Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UCTT) posted strong Q2 2025 results, with revenue beating the Street’s estimate, mainly because of upside from its China business.

For Q3 2025, it expects revenue of between $480 million – $530 million.
Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UCTT) remains confident in its ability to surpass the broader semiconductor industry growth, thanks to its capability to navigate evolving conditions, expand its addressable market, gain share, and deliver innovative products and services which advance the multi-year growth strategy.
Frontier Capital Management, an investment management company, released its Q1 2025 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Another underperformer was Ultra Clean Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UCTT), a manufacturer of critical subsystems and services for semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semi fabs. While Ultra Clean’s December quarter results exceeded consensus expectations, its outlook for the March quarter disappointed due to product qualification delays at a top Chinese customer and weakening semiconductor equipment demand in China. Management expects the qualification delays to be resolved soon and still anticipates overall company sales to outpace semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) industry spending in 2025. Longer term, Ultra Clean is well positioned to gain market share through new design wins at top-tier semi cap equipment manufacturers.”

US-based private equity company ACON Investments has signed an agreement for the sale of its controlling stake in Amfora Packaging to sustainable cosmetic packaging company Albéa Group.
The financial details of the transaction have not been made public.
Amfora, established in 2015 through the merger of Colombia-based Intecplast and Peru-based Pieriplast, offers beauty and personal care packaging products.
Under ACON's management, Amfora is said to have experienced growth, making it an attractive acquisition opportunity for Albéa, which aims to expand its portfolio in the sector.
ACON partner Alberto Hernandez said: “We are very proud of how Amfora's team transformed and grew two independently managed, diverse family businesses into an institutionalised, export-oriented company serving top-tier clients across Latin America, North America and Europe.
“As a result, we believe the company is well-positioned for its next chapter of growth under Albéa's stewardship.
“Our investment in Amfora illustrates ACON's strategy of successfully identifying and managing high-potential companies and supporting them through complex business cycles to unlock long-term value.”
Brigard Urrutia, Hogan Lovells, and Grant Thornton provided advisory services to ACON during this deal.
This sale follows ACON's exit from another investment, Vitalis S.A.C.I., earlier in the year.
In 2024, Clarins, a French beauty product company, launched a new sustainable flip-top closure system, the EcoLittle Top, developed in collaboration with Albéa Tubes.
This solution, part of the EcoTop range, aims to tackle weight and recyclability challenges in the industry.
In 2023, French cosmetics brand L’Occitane collaborated with Albéa Tubes to redesign the packaging for its 30ml hand cream collection.
The updated packaging included an all-plastic laminate and a Greenleaf tube certified by the Association of Plastic Recyclers, featuring a multilayer sleeve made of high-density polyethylene.

The company's quarterly revenues reached $14.7bn, up 10% from the same period in 2024. The company also reported adjusted earnings of $0.78 per share, easily surpassing $0.58 per share forecast by FactSet-polled analysts.
While the drugmaker reaffirmed its 2025 revenue guidance of $61bn to $64bn, it raised its full-year 2025 profit outlook. Pfizer now expects to earn $2.90 to $3.10 per share, compared with its previous expectations of $2.80 to $3.00 for the year.
Shares in Pfizer rose 3% to a price of $24.27 at market open on 8 August compared to the previous day’s market close. The company has a market cap of $138.9bn.
It marks a strong turnaround for CEO Dr Albert Bourla, who was at risk of losing his leadership position nine months ago amid pressure from activist investor Starboard.
Bourla said: “Pfizer had another strong quarter of focused execution, and we’re pleased with our progress in advancing our R&D pipeline, driving our commercial performance and expanding our margins. We continue to strengthen our company for the future, and we’re confident in our ability to create further value for patients and our shareholders.”
The updated forecast for 2025 also considers a one-time $1.35bn charge related to a licensing agreement with 3SBio, courtesy of a partnership inked in May 2025. The charge will be recorded in Q3 2025 with a negative impact of approximately $0.20 per share.
The strong Q2 results were fuelled by a diverse group of drugs in Pfizer’s portfolio, representing the robustness of the company’s commercial offerings. Vyndaqel sales were up 21% to net global sales of $1.6bn, while blood thinner Eliquis generated sales around the $2bn mark for the quarter.
Pfizer contested falling Covid-19 demand by reporting sales growth for two products related to the virus. Sales for the Comirnaty vaccine surged 95% while antiviral medication Paxlovid grew 71%. Together, they brought in a combined $808m for the company.
In addition to Covid-19, Pfizer has a long list of vaccines on the market for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pneumococcal disease, and Lyme disease, amongst others. Together, vaccine sales comprise around 20% of Pfizer’s revenues. A close eye has been on the Q2 results of companies with vaccine specialism amid changes to the US regulatory environment under health secretary RFK Jr.",4a49b67ecea9224b5d69f62de607bff9,trafilatura,2558,0

This initiative is in response to deteriorating market conditions and the need to enhance profitability by increasing the use of recycled materials.
The company has highlighted a significant downturn in the external environment for its copper smelting business, mainly in relation to treatment charges and refining charges (TC/RC) for copper concentrates.
It now has an “uncertain” outlook for the smelting business, projecting a “decline” in profitability.
The scale down strategy involves partly halting production facilities after scheduled maintenance between October and November this year, with the goal to shift towards raw materials less impacted by TC/RC fluctuations.
While the processing of copper concentrate is set to decrease, the treatment volume for electronic scrap (E-Scrap), such as discarded electronic circuit boards, will remain constant. This move is intended to raise the proportion of recycled materials used and, consequently, improve profitability.
At the Naoshima Smelter & Refinery in Naoshima Town, Kagawa Prefecture, the company has revised its 2024 investment plan.
The policy aims to limit the increase in copper concentrate processing capacity while boosting the capacity for E-Scrap processing. In the meantime, the renewal and expansion of certain production facilities are still progressing steadily.
Additionally, preparations are under way for the integration of the Sakai and Sambo plants in Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture, with the goal of optimising production systems and accelerating growth in the Copper & Copper Alloy business. This integration is scheduled for 1 April 2026.
The Sakai and Sambo Plants have been closely linked within the Copper & Copper Alloy business value chain, with the Sakai Plant casting billets and cakes for further processing at the Sambo Plant.
Despite each site developing its own operating systems, their proximity has facilitated collaboration.
The upcoming integration is set to advance this cooperation further, aiming to enhance business agility and flexibility.
By strengthening the integrated production system from casting to processing, Mitsubishi Materials seeks to enhance manufacturing efficiency and reduce production lead times.

The coffee giant is facing cost pressure from the 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee imports, which takes effect on Aug. 6. Brazil is the largest coffee exporter to the US.
Tariffs will increase Starbucks' cost of goods, particularly for its ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages and packaged beans division. Annual costs in the division could increase by 3.5%, resulting in a $0.02 earnings per share impact, according to a note by TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles.
The company's margins are already under pressure. In its latest quarter, operating margin fell sharply to 13.3% from 21% a year ago. Its US same-store sales declined for the sixth consecutive quarter.
Revenue in the quarter climbed 4% year over year to $9.5 billion, beating Wall Street's forecast of $9.3 billion. However, adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 fell far short of the expected $0.65.
Its stock has traded slightly lower since its earnings report last week. Year to date, Starbucks shares are down 1%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 8% advance.
Starbucks has said it will keep prices steady at least through fiscal 2025. But CEO Brian Niccol has not ruled out the possibility of raising prices.
""We'll be smart about how we go about increasing any of those prices,"" Niccol said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid after the earnings report.
Food giants like Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) and J.M. Smucker (SJM) have already begun issuing higher prices to offset rising coffee expenses. As costs climb, it may become increasingly difficult for Starbucks to hold out.

Raising prices comes with its own risks. Michael Gunther, head of research at Consumer Edge, told Yahoo Finance that Starbucks has been losing market share among 18-to-34-year-olds, a demographic especially sensitive to price hikes. The company needs to remain competitive with fast-growing rivals like Luckin Coffee, he noted.
To mitigate the impact, Starbucks is expanding its supply chain and investing more in Central American coffee farms, which it began doing late last year. A Starbucks spokesperson confirmed to Yahoo Finance that the company sources its arabica coffee from 30 countries globally. TD Cowen estimates Brazilian beans make up 22% of Starbucks' coffee costs in North America.
Tariffs are expected to affect the wider US coffee sector, fueling 15% to 20% price hikes in ground coffee at a retail level, according to Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo.",5b22614ae01da01674ea6dccccf14e42,trafilatura,2554,0

Doughlicious confirmed to Just Food the funds will be used to set up production in the US. Currently, products are made at the company's facility in London in the UK.

Doughlicious is a business centred on cookie dough, marketing what the UK company says is a better-for-you version of the baked treat.
Set up in 2017, the company’s product range also takes in “bites” made from cookie dough and dairy-free gelato.
Doughlicious's products are available in the US, the UK, continental Europe and the Middle East.
In the US, the company has secured distribution in multiple retailers, including Target, Whole Foods, and Wegmans.
Dinsh Guzdar, managing partner of Rich Products Ventures, added: “We are excited to help Doughlicious expand its footprint throughout the US and shake up the freezer section with a new concept in permissible indulgence.”
Rich Products operates in categories such as pizzas, icing and sweet starters, drinks, desserts and bakery products.
Through the VC arm, the privately owned business has invested in companies including China-based alternative-chicken manufacturer Haofood and US cell-based seafood business BlueNalu.
Speaking to Just Food in October, Bricken said: “The US will be our first priority, along with the UK. The UK will always be our mothership. We do sell into other regions.

(NYSE:CMI) stock is trading higher on Tuesday after it reported second-quarter 2025 results that beat Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue. Strength in its Power Systems and Distribution segments offset declines in other markets.
The company posted diluted earnings per share of $6.43, surpassing the $5.10 analyst estimate. Revenue for the quarter was $8.60 billion, beating the $8.43 billion consensus.
Sales fell 2% year-over-year as North America declined 6%, while international sales rose 5% on higher demand in Europe and China.
Net income attributable to Cummins was $890 million, or 10.3% of sales, up from $726 million, or $5.26 per share, in the prior-year period.

Power Systems led segment performance with sales rising 19% to $1.9 billion. North American revenue grew 23%, while international sales rose 16%, driven by demand in data center and mission-critical markets.
Distribution revenue increased 7% to $3.0 billion, as North America rose 9% and international sales climbed 4%, largely due to increased demand for power generation products in the U.S.
The Engine segment reported $2.9 billion in sales, down 8% year-over-year. North American revenue declined 8%, and international revenue fell 7% due to lower on-highway demand in the U.S. and Mexico.
Components revenue declined 9% to $2.7 billion, with North America down 15% and flat international sales.
Accelera, Cummins’ zero-emissions segment, saw sales fall 5% to $105 million due to reduced electrolyzer installations. The company reaffirmed its commitment to long-term investments under its Destination Zero strategy.

Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach expects the open banking trend to keep gaining ground, and seems to prefer that over banks charging for consumer data.
The card network chief gave his view on the recent controversial practice of banks charging for consumer data Thursday after an analyst asked about it during the company’s second-quarter earnings call.
It has emerged as an issue after JPMorgan Chase said last month it would begin charging fintechs that seek to aggregate and use consumer data that JPMorgan Chase has collected. Other banks could follow suit as fintechs seek to amass data from many financial institutions.
The decision by JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, followed a pullback by the Trump administration on open banking, also known as open finance, which allows consumers to more easily shift their data between companies.
The administration reversed course by saying in May that it would scrap the open banking rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration. The rule was aimed at giving consumers more control over their data and a smoother path for switching from one financial services provider to another.
Last week, the administration softened its position on open banking rule, telling a federal judge overseeing litigation related to the opening banking rule that the agency would seek to revise the regulation.
In touching on the U.S. developments, Miebach noted open banking has taken hold in Europe and Australia, calling it an “important topic.”
“Our fundamental belief [is that] consumer consented data and their ability to share that is very important, and that will be a winning proposition over time,” he said
He also showed that he believes open banking is generally a positive phenomenon. “This whole idea that a consumer can use their data footprint to avail [themselves] of better services in the finance space…I think it’s a good notion and it generally resonates and will not go away,” Miebach said.
In 2020, Mastercard acquired data-sharing startup Finicity for $825 million to advance its ability to provide services related to the use of consumer data by fintechs, banks and other lenders. That’s particularly an advantage in an open banking environment that has given rise to fintechs competing to offer services, often via new customer apps. Banks have been keen to fend off competition from those nascent firms.",de3328e0fd103b35b253ee4dfe4b645e,trafilatura,2541,0

He will also serve as chief investment officer for Anemoy, Centrifuge’s affiliated on-chain asset management firm.
The appointment comes as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is drawing new attention from the traditional finance world. Global banks, asset managers are increasingly explore using blockchain rails for moving and recording ownership of assets like bonds, funds and equities. They do so pursuing operational efficiencies, broader distribution and around-the-clock, programmable transactions.
It's potentially a huge opportunity. The tokenized RWA market, now standing at $25 billion and more than doubling in a year, is projected to grow to multiple trillions of dollars over the next decade, according to reports by McKinsey, 21Shares, Ripple and BCG.
Centrifuge is building regulated structures for these products, positioning itself as a bridge between blockchain rails and financial institutions seeking exposure to digital versions of familiar investment products. It has over $760 million of total value locked on the platform, DefiLlama data shows, including the $400 million tokenized U.S. Treasury fund issued with Anemoy. The protocol recently expanded products to Avalanche (AVAX) and Solana (SOL), created an on-chain version of the S&P 500 Index and launched a tokenized fund of collateralized loan obligations with asset manager Janus Henderson.
Before joining Centrifuge, Blumberg spent over two decades in traditional capital markets at Goldman Sachs, Invesco and BlackRock, helping develop the ETF market into a major part of global asset management. In an interview with CoinDesk, he draw parallels between tokenization and the early days of ETFs and how it disrupted the mutual funds market.
""There's a big part of the world which was never really the focus of traditional finance: the Global South, for example, or all those countries which have problems with high inflation, or with currencies which are not really easy to use in other jurisdictions,"" Blumberg explained. ""Now suddenly they get a whole new ecosystem in the DeFi [decentralized finance] world, which lets all of them participate [and] give them the same quality of products as anybody else.""

-
Owning Berkshire Hathaway means owning a wide variety of businesses.
-
Many of those businesses are recession-resistant, too.
-
For long-term investors, the stock price is reasonable at recent levels.
When you survey the thousands of companies in the stock market, looking for an investment that might build your wealth over the long term, give some consideration to Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B).
It has an amazing track record, as Buffett, in concert with his late business partner Charlie Munger, increased the value of the company by 5,500,000% (nearly 20% annually) over 60 years. In contrast, the S&P 500 index of 500 of America's biggest companies gained about 39,000% (10.4% annually, on average) -- which is still a solid performance.
Why invest in Berkshire now? Well, it's reasonably valued. Its recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.6 is a bit above its five-year average of 21.0, and its price-to-sales ratio, recently 2.5, is a bit above the five-year average of 2.2. This suggests that Berkshire isn't a screaming buy right now, but the price is within reason for long-term investors.
If you invest in Berkshire, you'll get a lot for your money. You'll become a part-owner of scores of businesses owned by Berkshire, such as GEICO, Benjamin Moore, See's Candies, and the entire BNSF railroad. You'll have a stake in Berkshire's stock portfolio, too, with major positions in companies such as Apple, American Express, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America.
The company is simply built to last, with much of its value in resilient industries such as energy, insurance, and transportation. It's worth noting that Buffett, at age 95, will be stepping down from the CEO post at the end of the year, though he'll remain involved. He has long planned for this transition and has named longtime Berkshire executive Greg Abel to take the reins. He has two capable investing lieutenants as well.
Berkshire's future may be different from its past, but it still looks promising. If at some point Abel sees Berkshire with much more cash than it can use effectively, a dividend might even appear.
Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?

The Boursin owner saw its share of consolidated net profit fell by 5.4% on a reported basis to €45.8m ($53m).
Bel said its recurring operating income was €125m in the first half of the year, down 19.3% on the corresponding period of 2024.
The company behind cheese brands The Laughing Cow and Babybel said it had seen ""persistent inflation in raw materials in several markets”.
Bel reported consolidated net sales of €1.86bn, marking a 3.2% organic increase, and 2% on a reported basis. The company said the growth was ""driven by higher volumes and price increases"".
According to Bel Group CEO Cécile Béliot, the period was marked by an “unstable geopolitical environment”.
However, she added: “Our resilient sales volumes reflect the strong value our brands deliver to consumers worldwide.
“The growth we have achieved across our geographies and categories, combined with our ongoing digital transformation, is reinforcing both our agility and operational efficiency going forward.""
Bel's volumes were impacted by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and increased consumer sensitivity to price pressures, the group added.
The company's “core brands” put in a ""robust performance"", Bel said. Kiri saw first-half sales rise 8.2%, Mini Babybel by 6.1% and Boursin by 7.3%.
In terms of geography, Bel's business in North America recorded an increase of nearly 6%. In Europe, the company maintained a positive trajectory with a 2.3% rise despite a “slight dip” in volumes.
The North Africa and Middle East region, affected by “macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties”, posted a 0.2% rise in sales.
In June, Bel Group said it would discontinue its plant-based cheese brand Nurishh due to difficulties in making the dairy alternative profitable.
As part of the move, the group announced the closure of its production site in Saint-Nazaire.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended lower on Tuesday as investors weighed the impact of tariffs after Yum Brands and other companies cited trade duties in their results or outlooks.
The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in June on a sharp drop in consumer goods imports, and the trade gap with China shrank to its lowest in more than 21 years.
In addition, a measure of activity in the U.S. services sector hit stall-speed in July, with businesses saying new import taxes are pushing costs higher.
Shares of KFC parent Yum Brands fell 5.1% after the company missed estimates for the second quarter, as steep trade duties restricted consumer spending.
Caterpillar warned U.S. tariffs would pose significant challenges in the second half of the year and cost it up to $1.5 billion in 2025, but its shares ended up 0.1%.
The comments come at the tail end of the U.S. second-quarter earnings season, in which about 80% of reports from S&P 500 companies are beating analyst profit expectations.
""If you look at results, they are trending above low-bar expectations,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
""The impact of tariffs remains a work in progress. We're not seeing any meaningful impact on company profitability with tariffs. We do know, however, that they loom.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 61.90 points, or 0.14%, to 44,111.74, the S&P 500 lost 30.75 points, or 0.49%, to 6,299.19 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 137.03 points, or 0.65%, to 20,916.55.
Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. could impose a ""small tariff"" on pharmaceutical imports before increasing the rate subsequently. He also signaled an announcement on tariffs on semiconductors and chips in the ""next week or so.""
""Today's market action reflects investors that are merely in pause mode,"" Sandven said, noting that the backdrop for equities remains constructive for the year.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit a string of record highs recently, and the S&P 500 remains up 7.1% for the year so far.
In other results-related news, Marriott International cut its full-year forecast for revenue growth and profit and signaled slowing travel demand and economic uncertainties. Its stock closed up 0.2%.
While the earnings period is winding down, investors look forward to more key results on Wednesday, with both Walt Disney and McDonald's due to report.

""The growth rate of our business has accelerated radically,"" Palantir CEO Alex Karp said. ""Yet we see no reason to pause, to relent, here.""
In its second quarter, Palantir posted earnings per share of $0.16, beating consensus estimates of $0.14 and up 77% from the same quarter last year. Revenue came in at $1.004 billion, Palantir's first quarter surpassing the billion-dollar mark on a quarterly basis. The company's top line also beat analyst forecasts for $939.25 million and was up 48% year over year.

US commercial revenue came in at $306 million, growing 93% year over year, while US government revenue for the quarter was $426 million, up 53% from the same quarter last year. Analysts had estimated that sales for the two sectors would come in at $273 million and $391 million, respectively.
In May, shares of Palantir fell 12% the day after its first quarter results as investors scrutinized the company's valuation and declining sales in its international commercial business, which sells software to businesses abroad, even as its first quarter revenue blew past Wall Street's forecasts.
On Monday, Palantir raised its 2025 full-year revenue guidance to $4.14-$4.15 billion, above Wall Street's estimate of $3.91 billion. The company also noted in its report that it closed $2.27 billion of total contract value in the quarter, up 140% from the same quarter last year.
Karp attributed much of the company's success to Palantir's integration of AI technology into its offerings.
""It has been a steep and upward climb — an ascent that is a reflection of the remarkable confluence of the arrival of language models, the chips necessary to power them, and our software infrastructure,"" Karp said in a letter to shareholders, ""one that allows organizations to tether the power of artificial intelligence to objects and relationships in the real world.""
""For a startup, even one only a thousandth of our size, this growth rate would be striking, the talk of the town,"" Karp said. ""For a business of our scale, however, it is, we continue to believe, nearly without precedent or comparison.""
""This was a phenomenal quarter ... We are guiding to the highest sequential quarterly revenue growth in our company's history,"" Karp said.",a5bb3d8894aeabeb57c2749733111543,trafilatura,2523,0

Sales of the company’s companion animal products increased 9%, driven primarily by Simparica Trio, the company’s flea, tick, and heartworm combination product, as well as its key dermatology portfolio, including Apoquel, Apoquel Chewable, and Cytopoint.
Broad-based growth across the remainder of the companion animal portfolio, including vaccines and diagnostics, was partially offset by a decline in the company’s monoclonal antibody (mAb) products for osteoarthritis (OA) pain, Librela for dogs, and Solensia for cats.
Sales of livestock products declined 21% in the quarter, largely due to the divestiture of the medicated feed additive product portfolio and related assets.
On an organic operational basis, sales of livestock products decreased 2% in the quarter due to the timing of supply of ceftiofur products and competition for Draxxin, partially offset by growth across the livestock portfolio, primarily in vaccines.
Guidance
Zoetis raised its fiscal 2025 revenues guidance from $9.425 billion–$9.575 billion to $9.45 billion-$9.6 billion, compared to the consensus of $9.49 billion.
The animal health company also raised the 2025 adjusted earnings per share from $6.20-$6.30 to $6.30-$6.40, compared to the consensus of $6.23.
The company expects adjusted net income of $2.825 billion-$2.875 billion compared to the prior guidance of $2.775 billion-$2.825 billion.
The company says the guidance reflects foreign exchange rates and the impact of enacted tariffs.
With an eye on future growth, William Blair noted that sentiment around Librela, a key product in Zoetis’s portfolio, remains subdued. However, they argue that the product’s decline in the U.S. market may not significantly impact overall performance, particularly given the robust performance in the U.S. companion animal segment, which saw strong growth.

LONDON (Reuters) -A U.S. decision last week to exempt refined copper metal from import duties is in contrast to an earlier move to levy steep duties on aluminium, and highlights the central importance of electricity costs and the lobbying dynamics shaping U.S. policy.
The United States stunned the copper market with its decision to only tax imports of semi-finished products such as wire, tube and sheet. Copper prices on Comex are down more than 20% since the announcement on Wednesday.
Since June, aluminium metal shipped to the U.S., where smelters face higher electricity bills than copper producers, has attracted 50% tariffs.
Taxes on metal production are part of a broader U.S. effort to revive domestic smelting capacity and cut reliance on imports.
U.S. aluminium producer Century Aluminum has been vocal in its support of tariffs that it says are essential to protect what remains of the U.S. aluminium smelting industry.
""Century Aluminum Company applauds President Trump’s unwavering defence of the nation’s domestic production of critical metals by increasing aluminum tariffs to 50%,"" the company said in a June release.
The waiver for refined copper reflects its importance to U.S. manufacturing and the influence of the industry, including major producer Freeport-McMoRan, which earlier this year said a global trade war would undermine U.S. copper production.
""A global trade war could result in slower economic growth,"" Freeport said in a submission to a U.S. government request for comment on its investigation into copper import tariffs.
""Slower growth in the U.S. or globally would negatively impact copper prices, which could threaten the viability of the domestic copper industry due to its elevated cost structure.""
The case for tariffs on U.S. aluminium imports includes the energy proportion of smelting costs in the United States. Macquarie's ballpark estimate for energy costs for producing primary aluminium and copper is 50% and 30% respectively.
""There is no economic case for building any greenfield aluminium smelting capacity without substantial intervention. Even then, intervention may not be sufficient,"" said Macquarie analyst Marcus Garvey.
Analysts say one major difficulty for potential investors in U.S. aluminium smelting capacity is getting long-term power purchase agreements at competitive prices, when power costs are higher in the U.S. compared with other producing countries such as United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and the world's biggest producer China.",0b201740b19e735e2684b8333debc931,trafilatura,2520,0

Pfizer's stock is down over 60% from its December 2021 peak (as of Aug. 1).
-
A drop in COVID-19 vaccines and treatment has caused a drop in Pfizer's revenue.
-
Pfizer's stock appears to be in bargain territory for long-term investors.
Five years ago, the world was in the thick of the COVID-19 global pandemic, bringing Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) into the spotlight because of the role it played in developing the COVID-19 vaccine with its partner BioNTech. It was able to get U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its COVID-19 vaccine on Dec. 11, 2020, and it was released on Dec. 14, 2020.
From mid-2020 to late 2021, Pfizer's stock skyrocketed, but since hitting its peak, it has reversed course. Had you invested $1,000 into Pfizer's stock on Aug. 1, 2020, your investment would only be worth around $638 as of Aug. 1, 2025. Pfizer's dividend would've cushioned some of the blow, but an investment then would still be less than your initial investment, at $828.
Why has Pfizer's stock struggled the past few years?
Much of Pfizer's stock price troubles since hitting its Dec. 21 peak come down to a decline in demand for its COVID-19 vaccine and treatments, anticipated patent expirations on drugs like Ibrance (breast cancer) and Eliquis (blood clots), and an underwhelming pipeline. All isn't lost with Pfizer's stock, however.
At its current levels -- trading at 7.7 times forward earnings -- Pfizer seems to be flirting with bargain territory. I don't expect a quick turnaround, but this low valuation gives it more long-term upside than downside. It also helps that the stock's dividend yield sits above 7.3%, more than 5.5 times the S&P 500 average.
Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?
Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:

Outlook

Brand volumes decreased 5.1%, including a 4.0% decrease in the Americas as well as a 7.8% decrease in EMEA & APAC.

Net sales in Americas fell 2.8% year over year to $2.504 billion, EMEA & APAC gained 3% to $703.9 million.
The company said its second-quarter results were weighed down by weak macroeconomic conditions in the beer market and softer U.S. market share, which hurt volume leverage, and by expected headwinds from ending its Americas contract brewing agreements at the end of 2024.
Underlying (Non-GAAP) EBITDA in the quarter under review increased to $763.9 million, compared with $750.1 million a year ago.
“We continue to view the incremental softness in the industry performance this year as cyclical, and we continue to believe in Molson Coors’ ability to achieve its long-term growth objectives,” said CEO Gavin Hattersley.
Total debt as of June 30 was $6,319.3 million, and cash and equivalents totaled $613.8 million.
Outlook
Molson Coors Beverage projects fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS of $5.36–$5.54, below the $5.96 consensus, and anticipates sales of $11.162–$11.278 billion versus $11.386 billion expected.
“As a result of the anticipated ongoing macroeconomic impacts on the industry, our lower-than-expected U.S. share performance, and higher-than-expected indirect tariff impacts on the pricing of aluminum, in particular the Midwest Premium pricing, we have adjusted our 2025 full-year top and bottom-line guidance. However, we are reaffirming our annual underlying free cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion plus or minus 10% due to expected higher cash tax benefits and favorable working capital,” Hattersley added.

He said he will initially impose a ""small tariff"" on pharmaceuticals, but then in a year to a year and a half ""maximum,"" he will raise that rate to 150% and then 250%.
The president has repeatedly threatened and then changed course on tariff proposals, so there's no guarantee he will eventually set pharmaceutical tariffs at the 250% rate. In early July, Trump had threatened 200% tariffs on pharmaceuticals.
The Trump administration in April initiated a so-called Section 232 investigation on pharmaceutical products. That's a legal authority that allows the secretary of Commerce to investigate the impact of imports on national security.
The tariffs are the president's bid to incentivize drug companies to move manufacturing operations to the U.S. at a time when domestic drug production has shrunk dramatically over the last few decades. Over the last six months, companies like Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson have announced fresh U.S. investments to build goodwill with the president.
""We want pharmaceuticals made in our country,"" Trump told CNBC.
The planned levies would deal a blow to the pharmaceutical industry, which has warned that the tariffs could drive up costs, deter investments in the U.S. and disrupt the drug supply chain, putting patients at risk. Drugmakers are already navigating the fallout from Trump's drug pricing policies, which they argue threaten both their bottom lines and their capacity to invest in research and development.
That includes Trump's executive order in May that revives a controversial plan, the ""most favored nation"" policy, that aims to slash drug costs by tying the prices of some medicines in the U.S. to the significantly lower ones abroad.
On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC that he ""invoked"" the ""most favored nations"" policy and that it will have a ""tremendous impact on the price of medicine."" But Trump has not officially implemented any changes from the executive order.
Trump last week sent letters to 17 drugmakers calling on them to commit to steps to lower U.S. drug prices by Sept. 29. That includes agreeing to provide their full portfolio of existing medicines at the lowest price offered in other developed nations to every single Medicaid patient, among other steps.
Some pharmaceutical companies have said they are reviewing the letters.",5b054f5a9534b77517e0d09ca9ca6296,trafilatura,2502,0

With the use of exotic materials in semiconductor manufacturing expanding rapidly, the demand for advanced materials analysis continues to grow significantly. Furthermore, the acquisition aligns with Onto Innovation Inc. (NYSE:ONTO)’s strategy to excel in high-growth, high-margin segments of the semiconductor value chain, mainly areas where device complexity has been accelerating, like the production of chips needed for AI applications. The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to both gross and operating margins and to improve non-GAAP EPS by over 10% in the first year following close, adding more than $130 million to Onto Innovation Inc. (NYSE:ONTO)’s annual revenue.
Invesco Distributors, Inc., an investment management firm, released Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Onto Innovation Inc. (NYSE:ONTO): The company is a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer that provides process control solutions for microelectronics manufacturing, including defect inspection, metrology systems and software to enhance yield and reduce costs. The company has benefited from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, but weakness during the quarter provided an attractive entry point for the fund.”

Goldman Sachs apparently did — and its two fastest growing exchange-traded funds are evidence of that. In the first half of the year, the Wall Street firm’s Nasdaq 100 Premium Income (GPIQ) and S&P 500 Premium Income (GPIX) ETFs have more than doubled in size, with each attracting more than $700 million in sales. The funds are relatively young, at about two years old, and at $1.2 billion each are small compared with the likes of the $70 billion Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). But demand for the category is vast, and it is likely to grow.
“This is just really a representation of the search for diversified sources of income from US investors,” said Alyson Shupe, head of the global product strategy group for Goldman Sachs Asset Management, adding that the two ETFs “have really been able to differentiate themselves within the market to tap into that continued investor interest.”

Appreciate It
It’s helped that the Goldman ETFs offer returns in addition to income, even if they provide “lower highs and higher lows” than the market, said Sirion Skulpone, managing director in quantitative equity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “The derivatives income ETFs offer something that traditional fixed income doesn’t, which is high potential for capital appreciation,” she said. “A lot of investors want to maintain equity exposure but are maybe looking for that smoother ride.” Using a “dynamic options writing strategy,” the ETFs have captured 85% of the market upside while providing monthly distributions of about 8.5% (GPIX) and 10.5% (GPIQ), she said.
It follows that demand is increasing as more people approach retirement, she said.
Figures from Morningstar Direct show that in the first six months of 2025:
-
Flows into all US derivative income ETFs were over $32 billion.
-
Net assets in the category hit nearly $128 billion.
Don’t Expect the World: As investors have shown more interest in derivative income, Goldman has increasingly focused on helping them understand how the products work, Skulpone said. “In a really strong market, we expect them to underperform.”

(NYSE:CAT) reported second-quarter 2025 revenue of $16.569 billion, down 1 percent from $16.689 billion a year earlier, beating the analyst consensus of $16.17 billion.
The adjusted earnings per share of $4.72 missed the $4.90 estimate. GAAP earnings per share were $4.62, compared with $5.48 in the prior-year period.
GAAP operating profit was $2.860 billion, representing a 17.3% margin, a decrease of $622 million, or 18% YoY, compared with $3.482 billion. This was primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing costs, which the company repeatedly said ""largely reflected the impact of higher tariffs."". Adjusted operating profit was $2.916 billion, with a 17.6% margin, down from 22.4% a year ago.
Enterprise operating cash flow was $3.1 billion for the quarter. Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) free cash flow was $1.5 billion. The company ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in enterprise cash. During the period, Caterpillar repurchased $800 million of common stock and paid $700 million in dividends.
Construction Industries posted sales of $6.190 billion, down 7% from $6.683 billion a year ago. Segment profit declined 29% to $1.244 billion, and the segment margin fell to 20.1% from 26.1%.
Management attributed the margin pressure to unfavorable price realization and ""unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected the impact of higher tariffs.""
Resource Industries reported sales of $3.087 billion, a 4% decrease year-over-year. Segment profit fell 25% to $537 million. The company again cited ""unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected the impact of higher tariffs"" as a key driver of the profit decline.
Energy & Transportation generated $7.836 billion in sales, up 7% from $7.337 billion in the prior-year quarter. Segment profit rose 4% to $1.585 billion, though the margin declined slightly to 20.2%. Higher manufacturing costs due to tariffs contributed to the margin compression.
Financial Products revenue rose 4% to $1.042 billion. Segment profit increased 9% to $248 million, driven by higher average earning assets and gains on equity securities, partially offset by increased provision for credit losses.
Geographically, North America sales declined about 2 percent to approximately $8.9 billion, while Latin America revenue fell 4 percent. In contrast, EAME (Europe, Africa, Middle East) posted a 6 percent increase in regional sales, and Asia Pacific posted flat or unchanged revenue versus the prior-year quarter.",baac35a1fe167da08eacf0d072bc4058,trafilatura,2476,0

The boards of the three companies recently signed an agreement for SK On to “absorb” the operations of SK Enmove, with the new combined company to be officially launched on 1st November – along with a major “capital expansion initiative.”
SK On is one of South Korea’s top 3 EV battery manufacturers, but has been struggling with slower-than-expected growth in global battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales. SK Enmove produces lubricants, immersion cooling solutions and air conditioning refrigerants for EVs and other applications.
The merger is expected to enhance the competitiveness and accelerate growth in SK Innovation’s electrification business, which is seen as a key driver of future growth. It is expected to generate additional revenues through the development of synergies between the two companies’ customers and businesses, and facilitate entry into new markets.
SK Innovation confirmed the boards of SK Innovation and SK On have “approved a resolution for a large-scale capital increase through third-party allotment, marking a proactive step in capital financing.” The company said it aims to raise a total of KRW 8 trillion (US$ 5.7 billion) in new capital this year.
SK Innovation said the merger and financial restructuring are part of its strategy “to become a leading total energy company with top-tier competitiveness in the future era of electrification,” as it targets KRW 20 trillion in EBITDA by 2030.
Lee Seok-hee, CEO of SK On, said in a statement: “With the expected synergies from the merger, including the integration of both companies’ technological and business capabilities, we anticipate showcasing a higher level of competitiveness in the global market.”

Dive Brief:
-
PG&E has lined up 10 GW of data center projects — with about 1.3 GW added in the second quarter — and expects that load growth to begin reducing customer rates as soon as 2027, company executives said Thursday during a second quarter earnings call.
-
With more than 50 projects in its queue, PG&E continues to attract mostly smaller data centers, CEO Patti Poppe said. But the company is also pursuing contracts with larger customers, including a 90-MW deal with Microsoft.
-
The company does not plan to issue additional equity to fund its five-year, $63 billion capital plan, regardless of pending state legislation on wildfire mitigation and bill affordability, Poppe said.
Dive Insight:
PG&E finds itself in a “Goldilocks” zone of growth — it’s on track for enough steady growth that customers should benefit within the next few years, Poppe said Thursday.
“This is because our demand is differentiated by having a diverse set of projects, ensuring that our development pipeline remains robust and not reliant on a single location, counterparty or approval,” she said, later adding that customers would likely begin to see rate benefits in 2027.
Poppe estimated, as she has in the past, that every 1 GW of additional load growth brought to the PG&E area will decrease customer bills by 1% to 2%.
But Poppe said PG&E has found other potential areas of cost savings as well. Currently, the average customer pays $20 a month for vegetation management, she said, but just $1 per month for undergrounding power lines.
“Undergrounding is the right permanent solution in our highest-risk areas. Not everywhere, but our highest-risk areas,” she said. “So we're going to continue to advocate for undergrounding as a key part of the wildfire mitigation solutions here in California.”
The company has been piloting new installation equipment that it believes will reduce the cost per mile of undergrounding, according to Carolyn Burke, executive vice president and CFO for PG&E Corp. The company plans to file a new 10-year undergrounding plan by the end of the year, she said.
PG&E has identified several strategies that would allow it to continue to pursue its $63 billion, five-year capital plan without issuing additional equity, regardless of the outcome of proposals currently before California lawmakers, Burke said.",233cae802ea6c1447e0fce6abd08388c,trafilatura,2472,0

Freeman Spogli has a long history of partnering with consumer brands since its inception in 1983, having previously invested in Boot Barn, El Pollo Loco, First Watch, Floor & Decor and Popeyes Chicken.
Freeman Spogli partner Brad Brutocao stated: “Philz is a beloved brand with a passionate customer base, distinctive, handcrafted coffee offerings and significant room for expansion.

ASML has monopolized a crucial technology for semiconductor production.
-
It will continue to grow as it rolls out newer EUV systems for even smaller chips.
-
Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to its growth potential.
ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML), which is based in the Netherlands, is one of the world's most important semiconductor equipment suppliers. It's the top producer of lithography systems, which optically etch patterns onto silicon wafers, and it serves all of the largest chip foundries -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Samsung and Intel.
ASML's deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems are used to produce older and larger chips. It's also the only producer of high-end extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are used to produce the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips in the world.
ASML's monopolization of that technology makes it a linchpin of the semiconductor market. From 2014 to 2024, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 17%, its gross margin expanded from 44.3% to 51.3%, and its EPS rose at a CAGR of 22%. Over the past 10 years, its stock has rallied 610% and delivered a total return of 684% with its dividends.
ASML still seems like a sound long-term investment, but it's pulled back more than 30% from its record closing price of $1,085.93 per share last July. Let's see why its stock cooled off -- and if that pullback represents a compelling buying opportunity for patient investors.
What happened to ASML over the past year?
ASML's net sales rose 14% in 2022 and 30% in 2023. That acceleration was driven by its rising shipments of DUV and EUV systems, the explosive growth of the AI market, stable service and upgrade revenue, and the gradual rollout of its newest high-NA EUV systems -- which are required to mass produce even smaller and denser chips (below the 2nm node) than its current low-NA EUV systems. ASML is barred from shipping its EUV systems to China, but it's still selling plenty of older DUV systems to Chinese chipmakers.
But in 2024, ASML's net sales only rose 3%, its gross margin stayed flat, and its EPS dipped 3%. Its growth cooled off as it lapped the AI market's initial growth spurt, its non-AI markets grew at a slower clip, and it was restricted from shipping some of its higher-end DUV systems to China. Its top customers also reined in their system upgrades.

On July 31, Benchmark analyst Cody Acree reiterated a “Buy” rating on the stock with a $200.00 price target.
The firm noted how Qualcomm’s recent quarterly performance was “very clean,” with the company reporting growth across all major business categories. However, there have been major concerns about the financial impact of losing Apple’s business.
The company has, however, communicated the said issue effectively, and there has been sufficient opportunity for them to factor this in their models and valuations, the firm noted.
A leading semiconductor chip on a computer robot arm, reflecting the technology advances of the company.
Qualcomm shares were weak after its earnings report as investors were disappointed that it’s earnings per share (EPS) guidance mid-point only matched Street estimates instead of exceeding them.
“Automotive grew 21% annually IoT grew 24%, and even Handsets managed to grow 7%, driven by demand for Snapdragon 8 Elite platform in premium-tier handsets. While a big part of the company’s current and recent weakness is the result of lingering investor fears regarding the long-term financial impact of the loss of Apple’s business. We believe the company has been communicating this issue well with the Street for quite some time and analysts and investors have had ample opportunity to factor the event into models and estimates, and ultimately investors have factored this into Qualcomm depressed valuation.""
The firm noted how Qualcomm has been aggressively pursuing areas of diversification.
""During this same time, Qualcomm has been aggressively pursuing areas of diversification, with Autos now at $1 billion of quarterly contribution and IoT at almost $1.7 billion.”
QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) develops wireless technologies, supplies chips for mobile, automotive, and IoT, licenses patents, and invests in emerging tech.

Under this contract, the company will deliver completions and downhole monitoring services.
The equipment necessary for the CCS project will be primarily manufactured at Halliburton's UK completion manufacturing facility in Arbroath, Scotland.
This facility has been instrumental in backing North Sea operations for more than five decades, offering manufacturing capabilities and on-site product development and testing resources.
Halliburton Europe, Eurasia and sub-Saharan Africa senior vice-president Jean-Marc Lopez said: “Halliburton is pleased to develop and deliver innovative well completions and monitoring solutions for this groundbreaking carbon storage project.
“This project allows expansion of our completions activity and showcases Halliburton’s leadership in CCS projects. We look forward to the opportunity to deliver our services to support the NEP project.”
The NEP infrastructure is engineered to oversee a CO₂ collection network, onshore compression facilities, a 145-km offshore pipeline, and subsea injection and monitoring systems for the Endurance saline aquifer. It is situated roughly 1,000m beneath the sea floor.
The system aims to transport and permanently store up to an initial four million tonnes per annum of CO₂.
NEP, established in 2020 as the ECC's CO₂ transportation and storage provider, is a joint venture (JV) comprising Equinor, bp and TotalEnergies.
The JV will manage the transport and storage of CO₂ emissions from the industrial clusters of Teesside and Humber.
Earlier in the year, Halliburton also secured a five-year contract with Repsol Resources UK to improve the full well life cycle at Repsol’s platform assets in the UK North Sea.

In a Monday note, analysts at the Paris-based bank said that while the S&P 500 SPX is within striking distance of its previous 6,400 target, and acknowledging the possibility of a pause for breath following the meteoric spring and summer rally, SocGen does not anticipate a recession. The bank reckons any dips will be shallow and targets 6,900 on the index by year-end, roughly 10% above where it is now.
Crucially, SocGen strategists led by Manish Kabra and Charles de Boissezon estimate that there is a risk of overshooting, with the Federal Reserve’s monetary-policy path and the direction of the dollar DXY likely key to determining returns. For the team, 7,500 on the S&P would represent a bubble risk.

The note came out in the immediate aftermath of Friday’s weak U.S. jobs data and unsurprisingly, SocGen is expecting Fed easing to follow, with interest rates falling to 3.25-3.5% from the current range of 4.25-4.50. Kabra and de Boissezon noted that inflation surprises are at 10-year lows and that the real Fed rate (the policy rate minus inflation) therefore provides scope for cuts.
Significantly, SocGen noted that if leverage in the private sector is low when the Fed cuts, then equities rerate higher. This precedent, combined with the higher nominal profits SocGen is modeling for the S&P 500, will drive stocks higher. Its proprietary Turning Point Cycle Indicator is showing signs of reacceleration.
A major building block in the SocGen bullish investment case is its bearish stance on the dollar, which benefits those U.S. stocks with overseas operations and foreign-currency earnings. SocGen envisions that the dollar’s weakness will persist until the Fed finishes its rate cycle. It also expects valuations to become more of an issue.
So how best to exploit this bullish stance? SocGen makes the interesting observation that “themes may offer more returns than sectors” and it recommends investors “own the Power cycle, by being overweight industrials and utilities, overweight financials on deregulation and overweight software on the peak USD backdrop.”",afa864b7bf7f610ab3736706bd1dad50,trafilatura,2421,0

This Blue-Chip Dividend Stock Is Stuck in the Tariff Crosshairs. Can Cost Cuts Save the Day?
It’s 2021 vibes all over again, as we’re seeing massive options flow into stocks like Opendoor (OPEN) — even outpacing names like Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN). That doesn’t happen in a rational market.
And the data backs it up.
Signs of a Speculative Surge
Meme stocks are leading the volume charts, as Opendoor, Kohl’s (KSS), and more companies with weak fundamentals are seeing massive inflows.
Options activity is exploding, especially short-dated calls, a hallmark of retail speculation.
Margin debt is spiking at a pace not seen since 1998 — often a late-cycle indicator.
The Barclays Euphoria meter just hit a yearly high. And Citi’s Levkovich Index is also sitting in “euphoria” territory.
Watch the clip for a look at the indicators John & Tom are tracking now:
Why That’s a Problem
Historically, this kind of extreme in investor sentiment tends to mark tops, not bottoms. We saw the same pattern:
-
Late 2021: Meme stocks exploded before a sharp market correction.
-
2007: Real estate stocks soared as debt-fueled speculation peaked.
-
1999-2000: Dot-com mania drove euphoria until the bubble burst.
Today’s market isn’t just strong; it’s downright frothy. And with August and September historically two of the worst-performing months for the S&P, it might be time for traders to take a breath and reassess risk.

This option strategy is an advanced strategy because it utilizes options over different expiration periods and different strike prices.
The strategy involves selling an out-of-the-money put for a near term expiry and then buying a put for around the same price using a later expiry.
The idea with the trade is that the stock might fall a little bit more, but should stay above the short strike price.
Let’s look at an example using Trade Desk.
Trade Desk Diagonal Put Spread Example
The trade I’m looking at is selling a August 15th put with a strike price of $75 and buying an August 22nd put with a strike price of $74.
As of yesterday’s close, the August 15th put could be sold for around $1.45 and the August 22nd put could be bought for $1.40.
The net premium received for the trade would be $5 and that is the worst case scenario on the upside – a $5 gain.
The risk on the trade is on the downside with a potential maximum loss of $95. This is calculated by taking the difference in the spread (1) multiplied by 100 and subtracting the option premium (5).
The maximum potential gain is around $425 which would occur if TTD closes right at $75 on August 15th.
The trade has a nice profit zone in between $65 and $100.
Aiming for a return of around 10-15% makes sense and I would set a similar stop loss.
The worst-case scenario is a sharp drop in TTD stock early in the trade. For this reason, if the stock drops below $75 in the next few days, I would also consider closing the trade early to minimize losses.
The initial trade set up has a delta of 1 meaning the position is roughly equivalent to owning 1 shares of TTD stock. Note that this delta number can change significantly as the stock starts to move.
Below is the payoff graph with the blue line representing the profit or loss at expiration and the purple line being the trade as of today.
This is how the trade could look the day before earnings.",c43cacd79d8ec08d51e72498b1a64d77,trafilatura,2403,0

Today, meanwhile, SPOT stock is on the rebound, up 6% intraday after announcing plans to hike prices in select global markets starting in September. Plus, Phillips Capital upgraded Spotify to “Neutral” from “Reduce” in the wake of its post-earnings retreat. Is now the time to consider adding Spotify shares? Here's a closer look.
About Spotify Stock
Spotify Technology (SPOT) is the world’s leading audio streaming company based in Stockholm, Sweden. It covers music, podcasting, as well as audiobooks, with paid subscription and advertisement-driven streaming as sources of earned revenues. The market capitalization of Spotify is $128.38 billion.
SPOT shares have surged 100.7% in the past 52-week span, handily outgaining the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) ~18% gain in that same period. The shares have, however, retraced by about 15% off their June highs at $785.
Even following the pullback, one of the primary points of contention for the stock is its valuation. SPOT is valued at roughly 98 times forward adjusted earnings with a 6.46 price-sales ratio, much higher than most of its peers. Even if those multiples may be a vote of confidence on Spotify’s long-term growth and scale narrative, they don’t do much to alleviate fears of whether the company is already priced for perfection after the year of frenzied run-up.
Spotify is a growth stock that pays no dividend currently. The company’s strategy remains on reinvestment for future development and not capital return.",2ffc067f79a13a62a1c089de96d375bb,trafilatura,2400,0

Additionally, it employs AI-based insights to customise user experiences.
These initiatives are in line with broader economic goals, promoting entrepreneurship, and lowering barriers to credit access.

International Paper’s stock prices plummeted 12.9% in a single trading session following the release of its mixed Q2 results on Jul. 31. Although the company’s sales in Europe remain soft, its commercial efforts helped drive growth in North America, further it also experienced higher volumes and stable demand in North America. This led to its overall net sales surging 42.9% year-over-year to $6.8 billion, exceeding the Street's expectations.
However, International Paper experienced a significant contraction in margins due to continued cost headwinds and high depreciation and amortization. Its adjusted operating earnings dropped 45.6% year-over-year to $105 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.20 fell short of the consensus estimates by a staggering 47.4%.

Just Food has contacted PepsiCo for verification on these figures. In a statement, the US giant said: “We recently told our teams that we will be consulting on proposed changes to our operational structure, affecting a proportion of employees at our snacks manufacturing sites in the UK.
PepsiCo is proposing the changes at its four largest sites in the UK – Leicester, Coventry, Lincoln and Skelmersdale – which together employ 4,500 people, LeicestershireLive reported.
The PepsiCo spokesperson said: “No decisions will be made without first consulting affected employees and their representatives. Our priority is providing support for our people throughout this process.”

On July 31, Benchmark analyst Cody Acree reiterated a Hold rating on the stock without a price target.
Bechmark noted that Arm has delivered “a very respectable quarter”, delivering robust growth across major metrics. Even though the report and outlook aligned with Street expectations, it failed to offer upside that investors had grown accustomed to since the company’s debut.
“Although Arm turned in a very respectable quarter, its second best ever, with solid growth across most its major metrics, the report and outlook were just in-line with Street expectations and its EPS guidance was light by $0.02, at the midpoint, on higher expected R&D spending. With the stock down about 8% after hours, the lack of upside to estimates looks to have disappointed investors, who had become used to Arm delivering strong beat and raise reports every quarter since the company came public in 2023, except for now the past two quarters where their outlook was softer than anticipated.”
An executive presenting share and portfolio performance of the investment management company to a boardroom full of investors.
The in-line results are a consequence of a softer smartphone market and a slight 1% annual decline in licensing revenue after a strong previous quarter.
“While there were many positives in this quarter, we believe investors will once again need time to fully consider the details of this report, with the company’s shares likely lacking a material positive catalyst for at least the short-term.”
The firm reiterated its hold rating, looking for improving market trends and a possibly more attractive valuation.

For the full fiscal 2026, ending in May 2026, analysts expect NKE to deliver an EPS of $1.69, down 21.8% year-over-year. However, the company has a solid earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line projections in each of the past four quarters by large margins.

Narrowing the focus, the tobacco giant stock has also outpaced the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLP) 1.6% rise over the past 52 weeks.
Despite reporting a better-than-expected Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.91, shares of Philip Morris tumbled 8.4% on Jul. 22. Total sales rose 7.1% to $10.1 billion and ZYN shipments came in at 190 million cans, both missing analysts’ estimates.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect PM’s adjusted EPS to grow 14.3% year-over-year to $7.51. The company’s earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 14 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on nine “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” and three “Holds.”
On Jul. 14, UBS maintained its “Neutral” rating on Philip Morris but raised its price target to $181, citing strong smoke-free margin growth driven by IQOS and ZYN, with robust U.S. volume projections and revised earnings estimates through 2027.
As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $193.38. The Street-high price target of $220 implies a potential upside of nearly 35% from the current price.

Over the last year, Strategy has raised nearly $25 billion selling common stock via its at-the-market (ATM) offerings. MicroStrategy announced a $21 billion common stock ATM back in October 2024 as part of its $42 billion capital plan. It exhausted the entire common ATM within the first half of 2025. The company rebranded to Strategy and announced another $21 billion ATM in May 2025. As of August 4, $17 billion of the second $21 billion common ATM remains, indicating that Strategy has raised $25 billion since October 2024 selling its common stock.
In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management expressed their belief that MSTR was heavily undervalued, and it laid out a plan for common stock ATM issuance. Strategy’s key metric of interest is mNAV, which represents the multiple of the company’s enterprise value over its bitcoin holdings. An mNAV of 2x means that the enterprise value of the company is 2x the value of the company’s bitcoin treasury. According to the Strategy dashboard, the company’s current mNAV is 1.68x (see image below).
Management stated that Strategy would only issue MSTR at below 2.5x mNAV to fund dividend payments on preferred shares. Since January 2025, Strategy has launched four different perpetual preferred shares offerings: STRK, STRF, STRD, and STRC, each of which pay dividends between 8-10%. Strategy’s team said the company will issue MSTR when the mNAV is between 2.5-4x, and it will issue it more aggressively when mNAV is above 4x.
With these new parameters for the common equity, Strategy aims to create more confidence in MSTR and lean more into its preferred offerings as a capital raising vehicle. All four preferred offerings have their own multi-billion dollar ATM offerings.

(NASDAQ:PANW) is one of the AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. On July 31, KeyBanc analyst Eric Heath downgraded the stock from Overweight to “Sector Weight”.
The rating downgrade follows news that Palo Alto is acquiring CyberArk in an estimated $25 billion deal. In particular, the firm has talked about platformization strategy concerns with CyberArk.
Heath talked about four key strategic concerns.
“We are downgrading shares of PANW to Sector Weight given four key strategic concerns following the announced acquisition of CyberArk. First, we don’t think there are meaningful synergies between identity and a broad platform vendor focused on network and SecOps. Second, we think customers will prefer to use an independent vendor solely focused on identity. Third, unlike prior instances when Palo expanded into new markets, we don’t see this benefiting from either a replacement cycle, a first mover advantage into a new market, or as a natural extension to an existing product. Fourth, we’ve had some increasing concerns recently following some customer and partner checks suggesting more aggressive behavior on pricing increases.”

Heath further noted that the firm would get more constructive on the shares if:
-
There is substantial demand for the existing NGS offerings to drive meaningful subscription revenue acceleration.
-

-

Commscope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) is one of the companies that stood stronger last week.
Commscope soared to a new all-time high on Monday, almost doubling its share price in the previous trading day, as investors gobbled up shares following announcements that it would sell its connectivity and cable solutions (CCS) business for $10.5 billion.
During the session, Commscope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) touched a new all-time high of $15.15, marking a 94.5-percent jump from the $7.79 close on Friday, before slight profit-taking persisted to end the day just up by 86.26 percent at $14.51.
In a statement, Commscope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM) said that it entered into a definitive agreement with Amphenol Corporation (NYSE: APH) for an all-cash sale of its CCS segment.
Subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals and other closing conditions, the sale is expected to close within the first half of 2026.
According to Commscope Holding Company Inc. (NASDAQ:COMM), the sale would allow the company to hold a significant excess cash, part of which will be shared with its shareholders in the form of dividends within 60 to 90 days upon closing of the transaction. The exact amount and timing of the dividend will be determined by the Company after closing and after taking into account all relevant factors.

On July 31, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss raised the price target on the stock to $582.00 (from $530.00) while maintaining an “Overweight” rating.
The rating affirmation by Morgan Stanley is backed by durable margins at Microsoft, with the company ending FY25 with operating margins at 45.6%.
The firm also noted how capital expenditures have been aggressive, and cloud revenue contribution has been growing. However, analysis at Morgan Stanley reveals that gross margins are currently 100 basis points higher than FY20 levels.
“There are multiple components of this improving margin equation including: 1) while mixing down with lower-margin business like Azure, the margins within these businesses are improving as Microsoft finds ways to run them more efficiently (see the 90% token growth comment above); 2) extending the useful life of the infrastructure given an expansive portfolio of solutions with varying resource needs; and 3) optimizing lower-growth areas to fund the higher-growth portions of the portfolio – More Personal Computing revenues grew 9% YoY, while operating income grew 33% YoY.""
Is it Still a Wise Move to Buy Microsoft (MSFT) Shares?
""With headcount roughly flat exiting FY25 and management guiding to flat operating margins in FY26, this trend looks poised to continue. With Productivity and Business Processes growing 14% cc and Intelligent Cloud growing 25% cc, we are likely far from seeing a ‘fully optimized’ Microsoft.”

The expansion is the result of renewed agreements with a consortium of eight funding partners, providing the company with additional financial leeway exceeding £95m.
The company aims to extend its reach across the UK, aligning with its strategic plan that spans the next three years, concluding in May 2028.
Time Finance CFO James Roberts said: ""I am delighted that the group has put in place substantial funding facilities as we embark on our new three-year growth plan. The previous plan, from June 2021 to May 2025, saw invoice finance lending increase by 170% and hard asset lending by 249%.
“Strong demand for both product sets has continued to be experienced in the first months of the new financial year, which began on 1 June 2025.
""As such, the significant headroom provided by these larger and more flexible facilities across all lending divisions position the Group well as it looks to further support UK business requiring funding for business-critical equipment through asset finance or working capital solutions through invoice finance.""

(Reuters) -Lab equipment maker Waters raised the lower end of its annual profit forecast on Monday after reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results on strong demand from biotech clients for its tools used in drug development and research.
Adjusted profit per share is now expected to be in the range of $12.95 to $13.05, up from its previous forecast of $12.75 to $13.05, partly due to strong commercial growth initiatives, rapid uptake of new products, and incremental growth drivers like GLP-1s, PFAS, generics.
The company left its tariff impact outlook for the second half of 2025 unchanged, but acknowledged that the current trade policy environment had improved versus prior assumption.
In fact, CEO Udit Batra said ""if tariff rates were to remain only at current levels, there is about 6 cents of upside to adjusted EPS guidance.""
Shares of Waters, however, fell 3% in morning trading, with analysts noting investor concerns over the high cost and potential integration challenges of the Becton Dickinson deal.
Last month, Waters agreed to buy a bioscience and diagnostics unit spun off from medtech provider Becton Dickinson, expanding its scale in clinical and diagnostic applications.
""(It) is a high-priced deal of a weaker business from a moat-perspective, in our opinion, that could be complicated integration-wise,"" said Morningstar analyst Julie Utterback.
Academic and government sales declined by 3% in the second quarter, as the Trump administration proposed deep cuts to scientific research funding, including $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health.
""NIH funding impact was not as significant as we assumed, but we are still quite conservative for the back half of the year,"" CEO Batra said.
Still, Waters expects 2025 revenue growth in the range of 5.5% to 7.5%, up from previous projection of 5% to 7%.
The company reported second-quarter adjusted profit per share of $2.95, compared with analysts' estimates of $2.94.
Its quarterly revenue rose 9% to $771.3 million, above estimates of $748.7 million.

(Reuters) -Industrial materials maker DuPont on Tuesday forecast current-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates, benefiting from strength in its electronics and healthcare segments, sending its shares up 5% in morning trading.
The company also said it beat second-quarter profit estimates, which blunted the impact of tariffs.
Demand for semiconductors has been rapidly increasing due to the proliferation of artificial intelligence-based technology, benefiting companies such as DuPont, which supports advanced chip manufacturing, packaging and assembly processes.
For the third quarter, DuPont expects adjusted profit of $1.15 per share, slightly above expectations of $1.14, according to data compiled by LSEG. The company forecast revenue of about $3.32 billion, also above analysts' average estimate of $3.30 billion.
""Our third-quarter guidance assumes about 3% organic growth year-over-year with continued strength expected in healthcare, water and electronics end-markets, partially muted by continued weakness in construction end-markets,"" DuPont CEO Antonella Franzen said.
DuPont projected a $20 million tariff-related hit, or $0.04 per share, in the second half of 2025, down from $60 million, or $0.10 per share, anticipated in the prior quarter, as companies continue to navigate fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping trade policies.
Net sales at the electronics segment, which includes semiconductor technologies and interconnect solutions, rose to $1.17 billion during the April-June quarter from $1.10 billion a year earlier.
""DuPont is benefitting from strong demand in electronics and healthcare at a time when many of its chemicals peers are seeing weak end-market demand,"" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein.
Net sales at the industrials segment, which will remain with DuPont after the spinoff, rose marginally in the quarter to $2.09 billion.
On an adjusted basis, DuPont posted a profit of $1.12 per share for the three months ended June 30, compared with analysts' estimates of $1.06.

""Oracle is in the early days of a massive Cloud transition, with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) on track to become the 4th largest global hyperscaler and growth accelerating,"" the analyst wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.

The company expects its fiscal 2029 revenue to be above the $104 billion target the company set in September, the company said in its June financial report. Oracle also recently closed a multiyear contract with OpenAI that it thinks will generate more than $30 billion in cloud revenue beginning fiscal 2028. Given these targets, Moerdler expects Oracle's revenue and operating margins to increase significantly over the next five to 10 years and driven the stock valuation higher. ""We expect Oracle's growth to accelerate for the next few years; revenue and operating profit growth will accelerate and once growth slows FCF margins will rebound and the value created for investors will be substantial. Looking 5-10 years out Oracle could be many times larger on most factors,"" Moerdler said. Moerdler acknowledged, however, that Oracle's shift to cloud will likely hurt margins in the near term. But ""to understand both Oracle's ability to offset in part or in whole the lower gross margins, one needs to recognize the potential impact of operating leverage. We saw this at Microsoft, and we expect to see this at Oracle.

What Happened: Pseudonymous analyst Virtual Bacon stated that a Q4 rally hinges on whether August's uncertainty clears by September.
He highlights Bitcoin dominance as a critical factor for altcoin strength, which could drop going into Q4.
Bacon warned that even a slight rise in Bitcoin dominance could hurt low-cap altcoins, while larger caps like ETH or Binance Coin (CRYPTO: BNB) remain resilient.
-
Bitcoin: Bull market support sits at $91,500. Bacon expects possible weakness in August, targeting the 20-week SMA near $103,000 — aligning with weekly candle closes from December 2024. ""This is a buying opportunity, not a bearish signal,"" he added.
-
Ethereum: Support lies at the 50-week SMA near $2,700. The ETH/BTC pair is crucial — Ethereum must avoid underperforming BTC to preserve its uptrend. ""We don't want Ethereum to drop faster than Bitcoin,"" the analyst noted.
Bacon prefers large-cap altcoins over speculative plays.
He specifically pointed to BNB as undervalued, citing regulatory clarity and strategic partnerships like Binance x World Liberty as long-term positives. ""BNB is still massively undervalued compared to Bitcoin,"" he said.
He projects a 40–60% move in Bitcoin once consolidation resolves, targeting $140,000 to $150,000 by year-end.

""Increasing pressure on Russia and Iran sanctioned oil supply poses an upside risk to our price forecast, especially given the faster-than-expected normalization in spare capacity,"" the investment bank said in an August 3 note.
However, Goldman flagged a downside risk to its 800,000 barrels per day average annual demand growth forecast in 2025-2026 due to the increase in U.S. tariff rates, threats of additional secondary tariffs and weak U.S. economic activity data.
The weaker data ""suggests that the U.S. economy is now growing at a below-potential pace"", which the bank's economists' feel has increased the chance of a recession in the next 12 months, the note said.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies such as Russia, known as OPEC+, agreed on Sunday to raise oil production by 547,000 barrels per day for September, the latest in a series of accelerated output hikes to regain market share.
""While OPEC+ policy remains flexible, we assume OPEC+ will keep its production quota unchanged after September as we expect the pace of builds in OECD commercial stocks to accelerate and seasonal demand tailwinds to fade away,"" Goldman said.
Brent crude futures were trading at $69.27 a barrel at 0115 GMT while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was at $66.96 a barrel. [O/R]
""We continue to see limited risk of large disruptions in Russia supply given the large volumes of Russian imports, the possibility for deepening price discounts to maintain demand, and continuing reported eagerness of the key buyers - China and India,"" analysts at Goldman Sachs said.
Indian state refiners have stopped buying Russian oil in the past week as discounts narrowed this month and U.S. President Donald Trump warned countries not to purchase oil from Moscow, industry sources said.

Most workers with side hustles aren’t leaving their full-time jobs to become business owners — instead, they’re using their side gigs as insurance policies for financial stability, according to a July 29 report from Glassdoor.
Although the percentage of workers with multiple jobs has increased during the first half of 2025, the applications for new businesses has remained flat. Glassdoor calls these workers “employee+” professionals who are diversifying their income without leaving their primary job.
These workers “view their side hustles as insurance policies rather than stepping stones to full entrepreneurship,” Glassdoor researchers wrote. “While they want the financial security of a steady paycheck, they also want to explore ways to boost income through side hustle opportunities.”
In a survey of more than 800 Glassdoor Community members, 67% said their main motivation for engaging in a side hustle was to boost income, followed by a career pivot, passion project or skill building.
In another Glassdoor Community poll, 27% of respondents said they have a side hustle, primarily to make extra money and have a backup plan as a safety net. Workers noted the “hybrid” benefits of security and opportunity, including advantages such as reduced financial risk, skill development, networking and career flexibility.
Nearly half of workers say they polywork, or hold multiple jobs or roles at one time rather than depend on one primary employer for income, according to a Monster report. Workers said they need the extra money for living expenses, debt, financial independence, a safety net and flexibility.
As more employees take on multiple jobs or work remotely, some companies may question what workers do with their time. However, to enable employee flexibility and autonomy, employees should simply set productivity goals and make sure workers meet them, recruiters told HR Dive.

(Reuters) -Hotel operator Marriott International cut its full-year forecast for revenue growth and profit on Tuesday, signaling challenges from slow travel demand in the U.S. amid looming economic uncertainties.
American consumers have been cutting back on discretionary expenses, including travel, after U.S. President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policies and the resulting trade war sparked fears of a recession.
Marriott's total room revenue in the U.S. and Canada was flat during the second quarter compared with the year earlier, as the impact of the travel slowdown on its budget and select-service segments was offset by strength in its upscale properties in the region.
The company's upscale segment, which includes brands such as the Ritz-Carlton and Sheraton, caters to more economically resilient customers.
Room revenue in its U.S. and Canada luxury segment grew 4.1%, while that in select-service decreased 1.5%.
The select-service segment, which includes legacy brands such as the Courtyard and Fairfield, also took a hit from a 16% drop in government revenue during the quarter.
""Two thirds of (all) government revenues are in the select-service segment,"" CEO Anthony Capuano said, adding that the hotel operator also saw weak demand from small business customers across segments.
The Bethesda, Maryland-based company expects 2025 room revenue growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, compared with its previous forecast of a 1.5% to 3.5% increase.
It expects 2025 adjusted profit to be between $9.85 and $10.08 per share, with the midpoint below its earlier projection of $9.82 to $10.19 per share.
""The trim off the top end of guidance is expected and, we believe, reflected in the shares,"" said David Katz, analyst at Jefferies. He expects the stock reaction to be neutral.
Excluding items, Marriott's per-share profit for the quarter came in at $2.65, while analysts estimated $2.62, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Trump Media & Technology Group lost $20 million in the second quarter. The parent company of Trump’s Truth Social saw share prices rise, however, in large part because of its broad Bitcoin holdings. Trump’s holding in the company is currently worth $2 billion.
Typically, if a publicly traded company announced sales of less than $1 million and a quarterly loss of $20 million, that might spook investors. At Trump Media & Technology Group, it’s giving the stock a slight boost.
The parent company of Trump’s Truth Social, in its quarterly earnings, reported $883,300 in net sales for the second quarter. That’s 5.5% higher than a year ago. The $19.7 million net loss compared to a $16.4 million loss in the second quarter of 2024.
Despite that, the stock was up 1.5% in mid-morning trading on Monday.
What gives? Despite the lackluster sales and notable loss, Trump Media is still a cash-rich company thanks to its significant Bitcoin holdings. The 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission lists financial assets of roughly $3.1 billion, an 800% year-over-year increase. Of that amount, $2.4 billion is in Bitcoin, which it bought in July.
“Among other benefits, the Bitcoin treasury strategy allows Trump Media to give its investors indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies, creates investment income, helps position the Company for expansion, and solidifies the Company’s financial freedom, including enhancing security against debanking and other acts of political discrimination,” TMTG said.
Trump owns 114.75 million of the company’s outstanding shares through a revocable trust. That works out to 52% of the company’s total outstanding shares, according to the company’s 2025 proxy statement.
As of Monday morning, that holding was worth $2 billion. That’s considerably less than the $4 billion it was worth on Jan. 1. Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group are down 50% year to date.

One reason markets are stabilizing is anticipation of cheaper money. One of the Federal Reserve’s governors, Adriana Kugler, resigned on Friday rather than serve until her term expired in January. That opens the door for President Trump to appoint someone more inclined to cut interest rates, though it’ll take some time for the process to play out.

Following Friday’s lousy jobs data, the likelihood of a 25-basis point rate cut in September shot up. Rate futures markets are now pricing in about an 83% chance of a cut, versus 63% a week ago, according to CME FedWatch. The probabilities of one or more cuts in October and/or December have climbed, too.

Still, Data Center segment revenue topped out at just $3.2 billion, in line with Wall Street's expectations.

The company did, however, provide better-than-anticipated Q3 guidance of between $8.4 billion and $9 billion. Wall Street was expecting $8.3 billion.
For Q2, AMD saw adjusted EPS of $0.48 on revenue of $7.6 billion. Wall Street was expecting EPS of $0.49 on revenue of $7.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.
AMD said it saw an $800 million impact from the Trump administration's ban on the sale of the company's MI308 AI chips to China. That resulted in an operating loss of $155 million in the quarter.
Nvidia (NVDA) took a $4.5 billion write-down from the ban in Q1 and said it expects an $8 billion hit in its second fiscal quarter.
Trump reversed course on the ban last month, which should help make up for some of those losses in the coming quarters.
AMD should also benefit from the launch of its MI350 line of AI chips, designed to go toe-to-toe with Nvidia's Blackwell-powered chips. According to AMD, the MI350 line, which includes the MI350X and MI355X, offers four times the AI compute performance and a 35x increase in inferencing capabilities versus its predecessors.
Beyond the Data Center segment, AMD's Client business, which includes sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, generated $3.6 billion in revenue versus an anticipated $2.5 billion.

As part of the agreement, TAFE repurchased AGCO’s 20.7% stake in the company for $260 million.
In return, TAFE secured exclusive rights to the Massey Ferguson brand in India, Nepal, and Bhutan, untangling a complex web of joint ownership and brand licensing issues that had fueled tension between the two companies.
The deal also wiped the slate clean on all existing contracts and lawsuits between the parties. Both companies agreed to unwind their previous arrangements and step away from each other’s boards, effectively ending their governance entanglement.

The agreement includes non-disparagement terms, sealing the truce.

Despite trimming the target, Peterson expressed confidence in the trajectory: raised full-year guidance, strong recurring revenue, and a major upcoming merger with Becton Dickinson’s diagnostics arm all point to scale, synergies, and a wider moat.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street stock and bond traders can expect their bonuses to jump 10% to 30% this year as they cashed in on turbulent markets, according to a quarterly report by compensation consultancy Johnson Associates.
""All the uncertainty around the tariffs and the continuous upheaval favors volatility and traders,"" said the consultancy's founder, Alan Johnson.
Other financial employees will not fare as well, with compensation expected to be flat or slightly higher, according to the report.
Wealth management and hedge fund executives are estimated to see bonus increases of up to 5% for 2025, while asset managers will likely get bumps of 2% to 7.5%, helped by recovering markets and inflows of client funds.
""Some of the worst effects of the unpredictable U.S. government policies have faded as markets rebounded,"" Johnson said. He characterized 2025 as a ""regular"" year for compensation, improving from the bad outlook when the new U.S. import tariff policy was announced.
Payouts for investment bankers will likely remain muted, even though initial public offerings and M&A deals may rebound in the second half of the year, Johnson said.
Because investment banking fees are paid when deals close, which can take months, the compensation for advisory bankers is expected to remain flat or rise a modest 5% for this year. If the deal activity remains elevated, compensation could improve for 2026, Johnson said.
Executives involved with secondary offerings within private equity funds have seen more activity, which could boost their compensation by 10%.
Private credit is another area in which payouts could climb 7.5% as asset managers expand their lending activities.

Citing a draft of the order, the Journal said regulators would be instructed to investigate whether any financial institutions breach the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws or consumer financial protection laws.
The order, which could be signed as early as this week, would authorize monetary penalties, consent decrees or other disciplinary measures against violators, the Journal reported.
It also calls on regulators to strike policies they have that might have contributed to banks dropping certain customers and requires the Small Business Administration to review the practices of banks that guarantee the agency's loans, according to the report.
The White House declined to comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.
U.S. President Donald Trump in January said the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America did not provide banking services to conservatives. The two banks denied making banking decisions based on politics.
The criticism of Wall Street banks followed accusations from congressional Republicans and Republican-led states, who claimed the institutions were engaging in ""woke capitalism"" and unfairly cutting ties with gun manufacturers, fossil fuel companies, and other businesses perceived to be aligned with the political right.
The Trump administration is pursuing a broad reform agenda aimed at modifying rules governing financial institutions, including capital requirements, arguing that such action will boost economic growth and unleash innovation.

-
Harley-Davidson named Topgolf Callaway executive Artie Starrs as its new CEO, replacing Jochen Zeitz.
-
The struggling motorcycle maker is in the last year of its turnaround plan called ""The Hardwire.""
-
Last week, Harley-Davidson announced it was selling a 10% stake in its financing unit to raise $1.25 billion in cash.
The shakeup of Harley-Davidson (HOG) continued Monday as the struggling motorcycle maker named a new CEO.
The company said that Artie Starrs would be taking over Oct. 1 from Jochen Zeitz, who announced his intention to resign this year after five years on the job. Zeitz will stay on through February 2026 as an advisor to help facilitate the transition.
Starrs formerly served as CEO of Topgolf International, a subsidiary of golf products maker Topgolf Callaway Brands (MODG). Presiding Director Troy Alstead explained that Starrs' ""track record of delivering top and bottom-line growth, combined with his experience in franchise driven industries, are both huge assets for Harley-Davidson at this time in the Company's history.""
Starrs moves into the position as Harley-Davidson finishes up its five-year turnaround plan called ""The Hardwire,"" which it noted was aimed at ""targeting long-term profitable growth and shareholder value, and aiming to enhance its position as the most desirable motorcycle brand in the world.""
The hiring came days after the company agreed to sell a 10% stake in its financing division, which is expected to raise $1.25 billion. It plans to use that cash to reduce debt, invest in operations, and return money to shareholders.
Shares of Harley-Davidson were little changed in recent trading. They've lost more than 20% of their value this year.

In a speech that Bernstein analysts called “the boldest and most transformative crypto vision ever laid out by a sitting SEC chair,” U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins unveiled 'Project Crypto', a sweeping initiative to modernize the country’s outdated securities rules for the digital age.
The initiative aims to overhaul U.S. securities laws to accommodate digital assets, continuing a broader push to make the U.S. a global hub for crypto innovation.
Central to the plan is “reshoring”, Bernstein noted, bringing crypto businesses back to the U.S. after years of regulatory uncertainty pushed them offshore.
The Commission intends to use its interpretative and exemptive powers to modernize outdated rules, ensuring they don’t stifle entrepreneurship or competition, the report said.
In a sharp reversal from past SEC messaging, Atkins said most crypto assets are not securities.
He blamed confusion around the Howey Test for stalling capital formation and pledged to introduce clearer standards for categorizing digital assets, including commodities, stablecoins, collectibles, and security-like tokens with governance and distribution rights.
Bernstein said the plan also lays the groundwork for domestic tokenization of traditional assets like stocks and bonds.
With Wall Street giants and tech unicorns already lined up, the SEC wants to build the world’s largest tokenized securities market, on American soil, the report added.

President Donald Trump will join CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday around 8 a.m. ET for a wide-ranging conversation on the economy and the state of the U.S.
Trump's interview comes as the administration juggles a slew of tariff negotiations as well as new U.S. jobs data that prompted the president to dismiss the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Trump on Monday threatened even higher tariffs on Indian imports to the U.S., citing the country's purchases of Russian oil.
""India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits. They don't care how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine. Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post.
India responded by saying it's being ""targeted"" by the U.S. and European Union over those crude imports, with the country's foreign ministry saying: ""it is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia. Unlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them].""
Trump's comments also come after a July jobs report that not only missed expectations, but also included heavy downward revisions to June and May figures. The data led Trump to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer just hours after the Friday release.
""We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified,"" Trump said in a separate post.",6b58083998422053662f4a6d47eb1b08,trafilatura,1700,0

By Rayk Riechmann
A soft second quarter for our Twin Hospitality Group Inc. (Nasdaq: TWNP) is a short-term setback against a much more enticing view for the remainder of the year.
TWNP shares have trended lower since last week’s announcement of a 4.1% drop in revenue, largely due to legacy Smokey Bones locations that haven’t yet been converted to Twin Peaks. However, we believe that the market’s response creates a great entry point for two big reasons.
One is the arrival of new CEO Kim Boerema, who took the helm at TWNP on May 15th and will lead the execution of the company’s transformation. Mr. Boerema brings over three decades of restaurant industry experience across corporate and franchise business models to the table. With his proven ability to scale full-service brands and improve operational efficiency, the company has just what it needs and we are excited to see measurable results in the back half of the year.
Second, a stronger sports calendar including the football season is a powerful catalyst for guest engagement and foot traffic which should boost top line results. TWNP has a clear strategy to leverage the fall sports calendar and increase check sizes through weekly watch parties, gear promotions, live DJs and more.
When comparing LTM P/Sales ratios TWNP trades at a clear discount at 0.6x compared to peers at an average of 1.0x. As the company’s profitability profile improves, we expect this gap to narrow.

""We're going to be announcing on semiconductors and chips, which is a separate category, because we want them made in the United States,"" Trump said during a lengthy interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
Trump said that announcement will come ""within the next week or so."" He did not provide other details about the plan.
Global demand for semiconductors and microchips has skyrocketed as the technology has become integrated in virtually all sectors of the economy, including the booming artificial intelligence industry.
The vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan, home of major chipmaker TSMC, whose customers include Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm and AMD.
Trump revealed the tariff timeline days after he signed an executive order to impose new U.S. duties on a slew of countries' imports, with some trading partners facing steep hikes. Taiwanese goods are set to face an updated tariff of 20% starting this week, though that is down from the 32% duty Trump had previously threatened as part of his April 2 ""liberation day"" levies.
Trump's remarks on CNBC on Tuesday morning emphasized that his tariff plans are far from finished.
He said in the same appearance that tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could eventually reach up to 250%. He had previously said that those tariffs would top out at 200%.

Shares were last down more than 6%. The decline occurred as investors adopted a risk-off stance on Tuesday and the three major averages declined.
Coinbase is now off more than 30% from its all-time high of $444.65, reached on July 18. Shares popped in mid-July as legislators voted on a series of crypto-related bills, ending with President Donald Trump signing the GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation — the nation's first-ever crypto law. Shares have been collapsing since then.
Shares of the crypto-trading platform have been running hot since May. That month, the cryptocurrency market started to lead the way back from the market's April 8 low, and Coinbase joined the benchmark S&P 500. While investors remain optimistic on the crypto services company's long-term opportunity prospects, some on Wall Street have warned it could be time to take some money off the table as the stock's momentum starts to wane.
Last week, Citi hiked its price target to $505 from $270. The analyst said Coinbase stands to gain from legislative momentum as well as stronger bitcoin prices and improved custodial fee revenue.
An explosion in demand for crypto beyond bitcoin — particularly coins and companies in the Ethereum universe — are also widely viewed as a boon to Coinbase.
Coinbase reported disappointing second-quarter revenue last week, causing investors to sell their shares despite a stronger start to the third quarter. Coinbase is still up 20% year to date.

(Reuters) -AI startup Clay's valuation more than doubled in about three months to $3.1 billion in its latest funding round, as investors continue to pour money into artificial intelligence companies.
Clay operates an AI-centered platform to automate sales and marketing operations, and counts Google and Reddit as customers.
The startup raised $100 million in the round, led by Google-parent Alphabet's independent growth fund, CapitalG. About three months ago, the company was valued at $1.5 billion in an employee tender offer.
Dealmaking activity for the first seven months of the year hit the highest since the 2021 pandemic-era peak, as investors have poured billions in AI and its applications, betting on the technology to enhance productivity and reduce costs.
Last week, when most Big Tech companies reported their earnings, AI turned out to be a bigger driving factor behind demand across internet search, digital advertising and cloud.
The funding will be used to accelerate its product development, the company said.
Clay plans to launch tools that allow clients to scan data such as sales tickets and video calls with potential customers, co-founder Kareem Amin told Reuters in an interview.
The company is also working on a ""signals"" offering that will provide sales representatives insights on when to message potential leads, Amin added.
Existing investors who also participated in the round included Sequoia, Meritech Capital, and First Round Capital.

In addition to the TH Wharton project, NRG has two additional projects at its Cedar Bayou and Greens Bayou sites that are progressing through the TEF due diligence process.

The flows appear to be profit-taking following the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) decision to keep rates steady.
The week began with robust inflows, but sentiment shifted sharply after the FOMC meeting. The sentiment culminated in over $1 billion in outflows on Friday alone. Despite softer payrolls data at week’s end—which might have been dovish for the Fed—broader risk-off pressures prevailed, likely prompting managers and investors to lock in gains after a sustained run.
Bitcoin led the retreat, with $404 million pulled from investment products over the week, although it nonetheless maintains strong year-to-date inflows of $20 billion.
Although the 15-week streak of total weekly inflows has been broken, there was notable resiliency from altcoin products. Ethereum sustained its streak of positive flows for the 15th consecutive week, attracting $133 million in new capital, while XRP, Solana, and SEI saw inflows of $31.2 million, $8.8 million, and $5.8 million, respectively.

“We saw more evidence of strong iPhone demand in 2Q25, as key US telcos reported ~22% growth in equipment sales in 2Q driven by pull-in, the highest in the last 6 Qs.

S . tariffs,2025-08-05 09:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Mazda Motor (7261.T, MZDAY) said on Tuesday it expects a 145.2 billion yen ($987.02 million) hit to its operating profit this business year due to U.S. import tariffs, as the Japanese automaker rolled out measures to cushion the impact.
To soften the blow of the tariffs, the company said it is taking measures including changing shipping routes, increasing output at its plant in the U.S. state of Alabama and adjusting production volumes.
The impact of the higher U.S. duties on results this year remained ""quite significant,"" assuming that exports from Japan would face a 15% tariff and those from Mexico 25%, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Guyton said.
Without its countermeasures, the company would be at risk of a 233.5-billion-yen operating profit hit for the year ending March 2026, Guyton told reporters during a briefing.
Mazda has been trying to boost sales of its CX-50 crossover sport utility vehicle. The company has a major plant in the Mexican state of Guanajuato from where it exports vehicles to the U.S.
It said last week it sold about 210,000 vehicles in the United States over the first half, up 4% from a year earlier.
Mazda has forecast a full-year operating profit of ¥50 billion for the year ending March 2026, down sharply from the previous financial year.
It had previously withheld guidance due to uncertainty surrounding the U.S. tariffs.

Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) provides audio streaming services through subscription and ad-supported models, providing access to a vast catalog of music and podcasts. Cramer suggested buying the stock during a June episode:
“My confidence in subscription model extends to Spotify. This incredible company dominates the podcast business and the music business, and of course, the new high list. It’s roaring right now, but it does have periodic moments of underperformance, and that’s when you gotta snap it up [buy, buy, buy].”

The firm acknowledged FMC delivered a modest Q2 beat and stuck to its full‑year guidance, yet investors may have hoped for stronger near‑term outlook from management.
Viswanathan flagged caution around the Q3 guidance, noting it lacked clear evidence of earnings acceleration, and pointed out that most of FMC’s free cash flow in 2025 is expected to arrive in Q4, limiting upside for the near term.
Despite this cautious stance, RBC didn’t downgrade the stock, which signals continued belief in FMC’s longer-term positioning in crop protection and its global footprint.

(Reuters) -Shale driller Diamondback Energy said on Tuesday it should remain the Permian Basin's ""consolidator of choice"" as shale activity slows and the company focuses on shareholder returns following its $26 billion merger with Endeavor Energy.
""We should naturally be the consolidator of choice as we execute a lower-cost and better overall development strategy,"" a key company executive said in a post-earnings call.
""Until someone else can prove they can do it better than us, we should be the consolidator of choice.""
Diamondback's shares fell 3.6% to $142.67 in morning trade after it posted second-quarter profit below analysts' estimates, hit by a 20% year-on-year drop in Brent crude prices amid weak global growth, OPEC+ supply increases and geopolitical tensions.
The Midland, Texas-based company said it remains focused on reducing debt and share count in 2025, and may lean more into buybacks if market conditions weaken.
The company said it was hard to be bullish on oil, adding that shale producers were increasingly running scenarios based on $50–$60 oil, versus $60–$80 in recent years.
Diamondback dropped four rigs in the second quarter, reducing its activity to 13 rigs and lowered its 2025 capital budget around 3% at midpoint to $3.4–$3.6 billion.
