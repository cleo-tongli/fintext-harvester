The summit, which was initially arranged to discuss a ceasefire to Moscow's war in Ukraine, was on Tuesday reframed by White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt as a \"listening exercise\" that allowed Trump to get a \"better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end.\"\nPrior to the summit, analysts were already casting doubt on the talks advancing any real ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\"Let's be clear, Putin does not take Trump seriously,\" Tina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC.\nAnd the fact that the summit was scheduled — and Putin invited to Alaska, the first time he stepped on U.S. soil in about a decade — was already a \"big win\" for the Kremlin leader, according to a comment by Richard Portes, head of the economics faculty at the London Business School, before the meeting took place.\nWhile no agreement was reached, Trump on Friday described the meeting as \"very productive\" — and announced the next day that he would be pursuing a \"peace agreement\" rather than a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.\nBut peace means very different things to the Ukraine, Russia and America. To one, it could be the complete halt of armed warfare and the retreat of foreign troops from its soil. To another, it might seem like acquiring annexed territory. And for some, it might look like a shiny golden coin engraved with the profile of Alfred Nobel, regardless of the prerequisites.\nWhat you need to know today\nTrump-Putin summit yields no ceasefire agreement. On Saturday, Trump said he would be pursuing a \"peace agreement\" between Ukraine and Russia. Putin has agreed that the U.S. and European nations could give Ukraine \"Article 5-like\" security guarantees, the White House said Sunday.\nOpenAI in share sales talk that would value it at $500 billion.

No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE,\" Trump added in the post, mirroring demands by the Kremlin for recognition of its annexation of Crimea and for Ukraine to be excluded from the NATO alliance.\nRussia seized Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, a move that was widely condemned by the international community. Moscow then launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nTrump's comments come ahead of an Aug. 18 meeting in Washington with Zelenskyy and a number of European leaders.\nThe gathering follows Trump's Aug. 15 talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which lasted three hours but did not yield a ceasefire agreement, though the U.S. President described the talks as \"productive.\"\nTrump reportedly told Zelenskyy after the meeting with Putin that Moscow had offered to freeze most of the front lines in Ukraine in exchange for Kyiv withdrawing from the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.\nZelenskyy had rejected the proposal ahead of the summit, saying this would deprive Ukraine of key defensive positions and allow Moscow to launch further offensives into Ukraine. Kyiv currently holds about one quarter of Donetsk, including its so-called \"fortress belt\" of cities, which has been its main fortified defensive line since 2014.\nIn an Aug. 12 report, Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said \"Putin's reported proposal reportedly demands that Ukraine concede this critical defensive position, which Russian forces currently have no means of rapidly enveloping or penetrating, apparently in exchange for nothing.\"\nIn a Fox News interview after the meeting with Putin, Trump urged Zelenskyy to strike a deal to end the war in Ukraine. \"Look, Russia is a very big power, and [Ukraine is] not. They're great soldiers,\" he said.\nIn 2024, then-U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said to the United Nations: \"If Russia stops fighting, the war ends. If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.\"\nISW also highlighted in a separate report on Aug. 17 that Russia's demands to address the \"root causes\" of the war are massive NATO concessions that would jeopardize the alliance's integrity, as well as the security of Europe and the U.S.\nMoscow has said any peace agreement must eliminate the \"root causes\" of the war, a term that includes NATO's eastward expansion, and the alleged discrimination against Russian speakers in Ukraine.", "content_hash": "86fcdb7054f7dc2e5d60ef65cce24a02", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Antoni, Chief Economist of the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, to serve as the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This move comes shortly after Trump criticized the unfavorable U.S. employment data as being manipulated and subsequently dismissed the previous commissioner. The market has been closely watching who would take over the position and whether this change would impact the statistical reporting of U.S. economic data.\nAntoni's appointment still requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate before he can officially assume the role. He has long been a critic of the BLS, advocating for a comprehensive, top-to-bottom review of the bureau.\nPrior to Trump's public criticism and the dismissal of the previous commissioner, the BLS had been a relatively low-profile agency, rarely entering the public eye. It operates under the U.S. Department of Labor but maintains a degree of independence. The BLS is responsible for collecting crucial data on employment, inflation, and wages, which serve as vital references for business and policy decisions, emphasizing the importance of being free from political interference.\nIn addition to the change in leadership, the BLS is also facing challenges and controversies due to budget cuts. Some analysts have noted that due to insufficient staffing, the BLS has ceased collecting inflation data in certain cities, relying more on estimation methods.\nRecently, concerns about the credibility of the BLS economic data have also begun to emerge on Wall Street. This raises questions about the potential impact of these changes on the accuracy and reliability of the data that businesses and policymakers depend on.\nProminent figures, including Jeffrey Gundlach, known as the \"Bond King,\" and Michael Gapen, an economist at Morgan Stanley, have expressed concerns that U.S. economic data has become unreliable. They argue that this could lead to skepticism about the quality of data released by U.S. government agencies.\nCurrently, the market is closely watching the upcoming release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July, scheduled for Tuesday local time. This inflation report is expected to provide critical insights into the state of the economy.\nAnalysts point out that concerns over inflation data performance led to a decline in the three major U.S. stock indices overnight.\nMarket forecasts suggest that the July CPI will show a monthly increase of 0.2% and a yearly increase of 2.8%. When excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI is expected to rise 0.3% monthly and 3.1% yearly.\nThe market is also hoping to glean signals from the latest inflation data regarding the Federal Reserve's potential rate-cut path. However, Wall Street remains divided on the timing of rate cuts.\nOne camp believes the Fed will cut rates as early as September, arguing that such a move is overdue. This divergence in expectations highlights the uncertainty surrounding monetary policy and its impact on the economy.\nDan Greenhaus\nStrategist at Solus Alternative Asset\n“I think the rate right now is modestly restrictive...not because rates are lower, therefore stocks must go higher, but the damage that perhaps modestly restrictive rates are doing to the economy and eventually corporate profits would be reduced.\"\nHowever, another camp believes that the Federal Reserve will continue to wait and see, monitoring the impact of tariffs on inflation before making any decisions.\nGareth Nicholson\nCIO, Nomura International Wealth Management\n\"We don't think it'd be September, so the Fed will take this time. Powell, if he doesn't have too much pressure, will continue at his path, which we believe is the case, and we'll likely see the Fed act in December and then aggressively act next year. \"\nMorgan Stanley and Bank of America both predict that the Federal Reserve will not cut rates this year, while JP Morgan Chase anticipates three rate cuts in 2025.", "content_hash": "7ce5fd046dece7fec1760e9c160aea77", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Chinese video games are generating billions in revenue. Even Chinese makeup, or \"c-beauty,\" companies are expanding into global markets.\nBut the most surprising factor boosting China's cultural rise isn't a flying car, an AI model, or a bestselling game — it's a toy.\nLabubus are everywhere: Pop Mart's ugly-cute $30 keychain has been spotted on the bags of Rihanna and K-pop band Blackpink's Lisa, with the plushie attracting hundreds of thousands of fans worldwide. Just a few weeks ago, Pop Mart opened its first store in Germany — the latest addition to its more than 500 stores across the globe.\nPop Mart's viral blind boxes — items sealed in mystery packages — have become the hallmark of one of China's most aggressive international growth stories. The company has forecast a 350% year-on-year jump in profit in the first half of the year. Goldman Sachs estimates that over the long term, Pop Mart's sales could reach $11.3 billion globally, the same level as Lego sales.\nThe company is even taking on Japanese legacy brands such as Sanrio and Bandai. In 2024, Pop Mart sales rose 107%, while Sanrio, home to Hello Kitty, reported a 45% jump.\nPop Mart's success isn't a fluke. It's part of a deliberate strategy that's been capturing consumers' hearts. With several proprietary offerings and the addictive appeal of the blind box, the brand has tapped into the sweet spot of emotional spending at a time of geopolitical and economic uncertainty.\n\"One of the key themes is IP, or chasing small pleasures,\" said Michelle Cheng, co-Lead of the Asia consumer research team at Goldman Sachs. \"It's something the young generation loves — not just in China or Asia, but globally.\"\nPop Mart isn't alone in boosting China's soft power. Video games, once tightly regulated by China's government, are now exploding in popularity. Black Myth Wukong, based on the Chinese folk story \"Journey to the West,\" sold 20 million units in its first month globally, making it one of the fastest-selling titles of all time.\nGenshin Impact, a \"gacha\" game, where players spend in-game currency or real-world money to obtain virtual goods (named after Japanese \"gachapon\"), made $2 billion in its first year on the market, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. It now generates more revenue outside China than at home, with players in Japan and the U.S. leading the charge, according to data by Statista.\nHome-grown innovators are transforming China's image. Consultancy Brand Finance ranked the country second in its global soft power index this year, up a spot from 2024, overtaking the UK for the first time and sitting just behind the U.S.\nBrand Finance attributed the jump to China's strategic efforts at enhancing its global image, focus on sustainable development, stronger brands, as well as the country reopening to visitors after the pandemic.\n\"Finally, China has become visible, and young people are no longer attaching negative brand perceptions to China,\" said Yaling Jiang, a consumer analyst. \"The best outcome of these consumer products is that people can see through the negative filter of them being Chinese and see them for what they are.\"\nWhile the perceptions about the country are changing fast, it remains to be seen if a state that has historically taken a top-down approach to reshaping its image can allow its brands to speak for themselves.", "content_hash": "4fe748ede32ba7cf897cde5c4e70e815", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The summit, which was initially arranged to discuss a ceasefire to Moscow's war in Ukraine, was on Tuesday reframed by White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt as a \"listening exercise\" that allowed Trump to get a \"better understanding of how we can hopefully bring this war to an end.\"\nPrior to the summit, analysts were already casting doubt on the talks advancing any real ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\"Let's be clear, Putin does not take Trump seriously,\" Tina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC.\nAnd the fact that the summit was scheduled — and Putin invited to Alaska, the first time he stepped on U.S. soil in about a decade — was already a \"big win\" for the Kremlin leader, according to a comment by Richard Portes, head of the economics faculty at the London Business School, before the meeting took place.\nWhile no agreement was reached, Trump on Friday described the meeting as \"very productive\" — and announced the next day that he would be pursuing a \"peace agreement\" rather than a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine.\nBut peace means very different things to the Ukraine, Russia and America. To one, it could be the complete halt of armed warfare and the retreat of foreign troops from its soil. To another, it might seem like acquiring annexed territory.

Chinese video games are generating billions in revenue. Even Chinese makeup, or \"c-beauty,\" companies are expanding into global markets.\nBut the most surprising factor boosting China's cultural rise isn't a flying car, an AI model, or a bestselling game — it's a toy.\nLabubus are everywhere: Pop Mart's ugly-cute $30 keychain has been spotted on the bags of Rihanna and K-pop band Blackpink's Lisa, with the plushie attracting hundreds of thousands of fans worldwide. Just a few weeks ago, Pop Mart opened its first store in Germany — the latest addition to its more than 500 stores across the globe.\nPop Mart's viral blind boxes — items sealed in mystery packages — have become the hallmark of one of China's most aggressive international growth stories. The company has forecast a 350% year-on-year jump in profit in the first half of the year. Goldman Sachs estimates that over the long term, Pop Mart's sales could reach $11.3 billion globally, the same level as Lego sales.\nThe company is even taking on Japanese legacy brands such as Sanrio and Bandai. In 2024, Pop Mart sales rose 107%, while Sanrio, home to Hello Kitty, reported a 45% jump.\nPop Mart's success isn't a fluke. It's part of a deliberate strategy that's been capturing consumers' hearts. With several proprietary offerings and the addictive appeal of the blind box, the brand has tapped into the sweet spot of emotional spending at a time of geopolitical and economic uncertainty.\n\"One of the key themes is IP, or chasing small pleasures,\" said Michelle Cheng, co-Lead of the Asia consumer research team at Goldman Sachs. \"It's something the young generation loves — not just in China or Asia, but globally.\"\nPop Mart isn't alone in boosting China's soft power. Video games, once tightly regulated by China's government, are now exploding in popularity. Black Myth Wukong, based on the Chinese folk story \"Journey to the West,\" sold 20 million units in its first month globally, making it one of the fastest-selling titles of all time.\nGenshin Impact, a \"gacha\" game, where players spend in-game currency or real-world money to obtain virtual goods (named after Japanese \"gachapon\"), made $2 billion in its first year on the market, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. It now generates more revenue outside China than at home, with players in Japan and the U.S. leading the charge, according to data by Statista.\nHome-grown innovators are transforming China's image. Consultancy Brand Finance ranked the country second in its global soft power index this year, up a spot from 2024, overtaking the UK for the first time and sitting just behind the U.S.\nBrand Finance attributed the jump to China's strategic efforts at enhancing its global image, focus on sustainable development, stronger brands, as well as the country reopening to visitors after the pandemic.\n\"Finally, China has become visible, and young people are no longer attaching negative brand perceptions to China,\" said Yaling Jiang, a consumer analyst. \"The best outcome of these consumer products is that people can see through the negative filter of them being Chinese and see them for what they are.\"\nWhile the perceptions about the country are changing fast, it remains to be seen if a state that has historically taken a top-down approach to reshaping its image can allow its brands to speak for themselves.", "content_hash": "4fe748ede32ba7cf897cde5c4e70e815", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

He noted that Air Canada's profit margins were already thin, and with revenue falling and its reputation damaged, the company will likely return to the negotiating table soon.\nDriven by these pressures, Air Canada's share price has fallen nearly 6% in the past month.\nThe strike comes at the peak of the summer travel season, when Canada had hoped tourism could help boost its economy. Analysts warn that the walkout could hurt the tourism industry.\nCanada's major destinations—including Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver—rely heavily on Air Canada's domestic and international flights. Flight cancellations are expected to ripple through related sectors such as hotels, restaurants, and transportation.\nAccording to travel industry platform Travel and Tour World, Air Canada is expected to cancel about 5,000 flights during the strike, affecting more than one million passengers worldwide. Impacted routes include major international hubs such as London Heathrow, Paris Charles de Gaulle, and Tokyo Haneda. The platform also predicts that many travelers planning trips to Canada may be forced to change plans at the last minute and head to other destinations.\nThe strike could also disrupt global cargo supply chains. Air Canada's cargo unit operates in 50 countries and has overseas hubs in London and Frankfurt. Canada's minister of labor has warned that the walkout could threaten the transport of medicines and organ donations.\nCanada's air travel market is dominated by two airlines—Air Canada and WestJet—which together control between half and three-quarters of the market. When either carrier suffers an operational shutdown, the entire Canadian aviation sector feels the shock. A report by the Fraser Institute argues that the strike highlights the lack of competition in the country's airline industry.\nThe report points out that Canada's federal rules allow foreign airlines to land at Canadian airports but bar them from operating purely domestic routes. Analysts say this policy limits options for travelers and reduces competition, urging the government to loosen restrictions.", "content_hash": "91760c92ca91482a3444d38e94391440", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Nearly half of the 2,000 adults surveyed said they're afraid they won't have enough money to retire.\nSome people have gone beyond considering the strategy. \"Two in 10 workers adjusted their target retirement age in 2024,\" according to a recent report from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, \"with most of them now planning to retire later.\"\nBut experts say that plan to work longer may not be as reliable as workers hope.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nInvestors shouldn’t try to be a ‘hero’ in this economy: analyst\nFewer young adults reach key life, money milestones\nSocial Security marks its 90th anniversary: What may happen to benefits\nAbout 58% of workers retire earlier than they intended, according to 2024 research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies in collaboration with the Transamerica Institute. Of those who did, 46% did so for health-related reasons, while 43% cited employment issues and 20%, family reasons.\nOnly 21% said they retired early because they are financially stable.\n\"The 2008 recession kind of knocked all those assumptions about being able to work longer with enough money out of reality,\" said Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics and policy analysis at The New School for Social Research. \"We had 50-year-olds, 55-year-olds, being really pushed out of the labor market or lose their career jobs, and having to come back and having to spend their savings while they were still in their 50s and 60s because of the hardship of that recession.\"\n\"So you can't [always] work longer because of age discrimination, and because the labor market may not want the skills that you've acquired over 40 years, because the labor market and the skills required have moved forward,\" she added.\nA system built for a different generation\nThe instinct to delay retirement is understandable, experts say.\nLife expectancy across developed countries has climbed significantly over the last several decades, according to World Bank data analyzed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. At the same time, the burden of investing for retirement has shifted to workers.\nFor much of the 20th century, the American retirement system relied on what economists call the three-legged stool: Social Security, employer pensions and personal savings.\nBut one of those legs, Social Security, has a looming funding shortfall that has left some workers concerned about what kind of retirement benefits they may receive.\nAnother leg, pensions, has rapidly declined for private sector workers. In 1989, 63% of full-time workers at companies with more than 100 employees had pensions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of early 2023, only about 15% of private industry workers did.\nWorkers now largely depend on 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans, which rely on them to determine how much to contribute and how to invest those funds.\nSome younger workers are rising to the challenge. Younger workers today often have more money in retirement accounts by age 30 than boomers did, according to Federal Reserve research.\n\"Millennials are saving at a higher rate at this age than Gen Xers or Boomers,\" said Christine Mahoney, global pensions leader at the pension consulting firm Mercer. \"So I guess I would say if they're nervous and it's making them save, that's not necessarily a bad thing.\"\nBut personal savings may not be enough. Unexpected medical bills, market downturns or job losses can quickly derail even disciplined savers, leading to what experts call 401(k) \"leakage.\" Add in the growing weight of student loan debt, and retirement becomes even harder to afford for some workers.\nIs working longer the solution?\nSome policymakers and economists say extended careers could help Americans close their retirement gaps.\n\"We have more options for extended work lives today than we've ever had before, and Americans are taking advantage of them,\" said Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\nThe number of employed Americans age 65 and older grew 33.2% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of BLS data.\nBiggs also emphasized that older workers continue to bring value to the labor force. \"There's great demand for older workers,\" he said. \"They still have a lot of skills, a lot left to give, and so they can be valuable to employers.\"\nBut others say that perspective doesn't align with how the labor market actually works.\n\"The labor market doesn't always want you when you want the labor market,\" said Ghilarducci. \"Employers have the biggest role in the decision about whether or not you work and what the quality of your work is.\"\nWatch the video above to learn more about why Americans may end up working longer than their parents and whether planning to work longer will actually help people in retirement.", "content_hash": "a2ecc0d17e72129b15135043bcd40273", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Outside of the initial days of the Covid-19 pandemic, levels haven't been that consistently low since early 2016.\nThe quits rate is a barometer of workers' perceptions of the broader labor market, said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. In this case, they may be nervous about getting another job or aren't enthusiastic about their ability to find one, she said.\nThe current clinging is a stark contrast from the historic rate of job-hopping that workers exhibited in 2021 and 2022, but experts say it makes sense given current labor market trends.\nThe share of jobseekers who are \"not confident at all\" that there are \"plenty of jobs\" available has increased steadily, to 38% in the second quarter from about 26% three years earlier, according to a quarterly poll by ZipRecruiter.\n\"There is this stagnation in the labor market, where the hires, quits and layoff rates are low,\" said Ullrich. \"There's just not a lot of movement at all.\"\n'Uncertainty in the world'\n\"There's quite a bit of uncertainty in the world — economic, political, global — and I think uncertainty causes people to naturally\" remain in a holding pattern, said Matt Bohn, an executive search consultant at Korn Ferry.\nHe equated the dynamic to skittish investors who sometimes sit on the sidelines, waiting for an investment opportunity.\nThe job market has also gradually cooled amid a regime of higher interest rates, which makes it more costly for businesses to borrow money and expand their operations.\nThe hiring rate over the past year or so has plunged to its lowest pace in more than a decade (excluding the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic) — meaning those who want to look for a new job may have a relatively tough time finding one.\nJob growth in recent months has also slowed sharply, which economists point to as evidence of a broader economic slowdown. The ratio of job openings per unemployed worker has fallen by about half since peaking at about 2:1 in March 2022; it was roughly 1:1 in June 2025, the latest month of available federal data.\nMore CEOs reported plans to shrink their workforce over the next 12 months than expand it — the first time that's occurred since 2020, according to a Conference Board quarterly poll published earlier this month. The shares were 34% to 27%, respectively.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nMortgage rates have made a 'substantial improvement'\nWhy investors shouldn't try to be a 'hero' in this economy\nWhy school lunch prices are up\nWhile it's not inherently bad to stay in a job for a long time, job \"hugging\" can pose some risks for the unwary, experts said.\nFor one, they may be sacrificing some earnings growth, since job switchers generally command higher wage growth than those who remain in their current roles, Ullrich said.\nFor example, workers who get too comfortable in their current role may stagnate rather than take on additional responsibility or learn new skills, which may impact marketability and career growth when the labor market improves, Bohn said. Employers may also decide such workers are no longer meeting their performance standards, he added.\nAdditionally, a lack of movement in the job market may make it harder for new entrants like recent graduates to find work, Ullrich said.\nCorrection: This article has been updated to correct the timing of the Korn Ferry and Conference Board reports.", "content_hash": "d0a3229c9d97c0edb8f7fde0015bbc6d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That figure includes about $124 million in long bitcoin liquidations and $184 million in long ether liquidations. This happens when traders are forced to sell their assets at market price to settle their debts, pushing prices lower.\nAdding to investor disappointment were comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who clarified Thursday that the strategic bitcoin reserve President Donald Trump established back in March will be confined to bitcoin forfeited to the federal government, as it explores \"budget-neutral pathways to acquire more bitcoin.\"\nThe top cryptocurrencies by market cap fell with the blue-chip coins, with the CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the broader crypto market, down 1.2%.

Although ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin and ether posted net outflows on Friday, they logged net inflows of $547 million and $2.9 billion, respectively, for the week.

That would more than double the installed capacity in the U.S., though it is well below President Donald Trump's goal of adding an additional 300 gigawatts. \"The nuclear renaissance has already made significant progress,\" Morgan Stanley analysts told clients on Aug. 12. \"Over the past year, global policy support – especially in the United States – has strengthened significantly. Hyperscalers are increasingly focused on securing clean, reliable 24/7 energy, highlighting the strategic importance of nuclear power.\" Morgan Stanley recommends playing the trend in the U.S. through the independent power producers Talen Energy and Vistra Corp. , reactor designer GE Vernova , and the utility Public Service Enterprise Group . The U.S. trails China when it comes to building new nuclear plants, but momentum is growing as Alphabet , Amazon , Meta and Microsoft have announced investments in nuclear power over the past year. China has about 37 gigawatts of nuclear power under construction while the U.S. is not building any plants right now, according to Morgan Stanley. Trump has sought to jump start nuclear construction through a series of executive orders in May that aim to slash regulation and accelerate approvals. The federal tax credits for nuclear power also remain in place after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Vistra is expected to strike a data center deal at its Comanche Peak nuclear plant in Texas, while Public Service Enterprise Group will likely announce a deal at one of its New Jersey plants, according to Morgan Stanley. Talen Energy has contracted out all its nuclear capacity to Amazon already, but the company could announced data center deals with its gas assets, according to the bank. The U.S. has a large pipeline of 17 small modular reactors under development, though these plants are not expected to come online until the 2030s at the earliest if at all, according to the bank.

Investors are questioning the catalysts for a correction in risk assets, when the Fed is 'coming to the rescue' and the outlook in 2026 looks rosier,\" Bassi wrote in a note titled \"Estote Parati: Calm Markets Can Precede Volatility.\" \"Estote parati\" is a Latin phrase that translates to \"be prepared.\" \"However, investors should not be complacent,\" he wrote. \"Bad macro news so far has been perceived as good news for risk assets given shallow and temporary weakness cushioned by the 'Fed put'; however, bad news could turn truly detrimental if macro weakness appears large or persistent.\" Bassi said he does not hold a recession in his base case, but he nevertheless worries that downside risk has grown, especially after the market's major runup this year. Many market observers point out that the S & P 500, which is currently trading at a 12-month forward multiple of 22, is priced for perfection and could be due for a pullback. Bassi expects a 5% to 10% pullback is in the cards, which would knock the S & P 500 back down to about 5,800 or 6,000, from around 6,450 where it was last. \"In the short term, we expect growth risks to come to the forefront for investors, as the impact of tariffs gets reflected in prices and consumer spending, amid a retracement for the large frontloading of the first half of the year,\" Bassi wrote. Still, the sell-off could come just in time to prove a buying opportunity for a year-end rally, Bassi said. He expects that any weakening in the macroeconomic data will be limited in scope, especially if the Federal Reserve does indeed step in to provide relief. Until then, he expects investors should remain hedged. Among other moves, the firm is sticking to an overweight on utilities and staples, two defensive sectors.", "content_hash": "ff13f54ca2ffb75ed913f56722392cd7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Amid a broad push to diversify portfolios away from the U.S., some traders see an \"unmatched advantage\" and \"really good investment opportunities\" in particular area of Europe. Earlier this year, volatility arising from U.S. President Donald Trump's unpredictable trade policies sparked widespread demand for assets outside of the United States . One of the beneficiaries of this movement was Europe , where investors saw a stable but undervalued market. But according to Frédérique Carrier, head of investment strategy for RBC Wealth Management in the British Isles and Asia, one pocket of the European market remains overlooked by international investors. \"Most of our wealth clients who enquire about Europe have France and Germany in mind, and perhaps Italy and Spain, but few think of the Nordics where macroeconomic trends are encouraging,\" she said. Economic resilience The Nordics, nestled in the far north of Europe, have had a mixed bag this year when it comes to the performance of their publicly traded companies. Benchmark indexes in Norway and Finland, for example, have outperformed all three major Wall Street indexes, while those in Iceland and Denmark have recorded deep year-to-date losses. Much of the underperformance in Denmark is tied to the make-up of its benchmark OMX Copenhagen index. Pharmaceutical giants Novo Nordisk and Zealand Pharma have each shed around 48% so far this year, amid threats from Trump to slap tariffs of up to 250% on pharmaceutical goods. Disappointing clinical trial results , leadership changes and profit guidance cuts also weighed on Novo's share price. However, the Danish economy is renowned for its resilience, even if its biggest companies are under pressure, and that could benefit the country's equity market, Carrier told CNBC. \"Denmark is widely seen as a resilient economy, thanks to its low level of indebtedness at the national level (debt to GDP a mere 28% while it enjoys a fiscal surplus of close to 4% of GDP), even as its pharmaceutical sector — which has largely driven growth in the past — is currently in the cross hairs of President Trump's new tariffs strategy,\" she said in an email. Sweden, she added, was benefiting from a \"mild economic upswing,\" while Norway's central bank could soon start cutting interest rates to stimulate the country's economy. Markets are widely expecting Norges Bank to cut rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting in September, according to LSEG data. \"Finland is the outlier, with a more subdued macroeconomic outlook than its peers,\" Carrier added. She noted that equity investors looking to allocate to European stocks should take \"a highly selective approach to investment.\" \"Our focus would be on high quality companies with a strong business model, a broad international revenue base and robust cash flow generation, an area where the Nordics are particularly well represented,\" she said. \"Such quality does not necessarily come cheap and investors might want to wait for an opportunistic price correction before building positions.\" 'Unmatched advantage' The Nordic region is rich with opportunities in emerging industries, according to Tor Langøy, founder of London-based investment advisory BD Globe Capital Partners and Viking Digital Campus, a hydro-powered digital corporate campus on Norway's west coast. \"The Nordic region is rapidly emerging as a strategic hub for AI and hyperscale data center investment, attracting unprecedented global capital,\" he told CNBC. Various high-profile companies have recently unveiled large-scale investments in the Nordics this year, many of which are for tech infrastructure. Brookfield Asset Management, which manages assets worth more than $1 trillion, announced in June it would allocate up to 95 billion Swedish krona ($10 billion) to support the development of AI infrastructure. Meanwhile, OpenAI announced at the end of July that it would spearhead a multibillion-dollar data center project in Norway that would deliver 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units by the end of 2026. Langøy said that Norway in particular had an \"unmatched advantage\" when it comes to investment opportunities. \"Norway offers a rare combination of attributes that few — if any — markets can match,\" he said. \"[It boasts the] lowest electricity costs in Europe, powered by 100% renewable hydropower, accelerated grid connection timelines, enabling faster go-to-market, [and] supportive, pro–data center government policies that welcome strategic infrastructure investment.\" He argued that Norway will \"continue to lead\" thanks to its energy security, connectivity resilience and geopolitical stability. In the second quarter of this year, Swedish investment firm Investor AB saw a 6% return on its listed company holdings. Among those holdings are various Nordic firms, including telecom giant Ericsson, defense contractor Saab and home appliance manufacturer Electrolux. During the reporting period, AB Investor invested 1.2 billion Swedish kronor to increase its stake in Ericsson to 9.7%. \"As the world leader in mobile network technology, Ericsson is well positioned to capitalize on its strong market positions and find new growth avenues over time,\" AB Investor's President and CEO Christian Cederholm, said in the firm's second-quarter earnings report. \"While we operate in an unpredictable world, I remain confident in Investor's and our companies' ability to generate attractive long-term total returns.\" Cederholm later told CNBC that there were also opportunities in the Nordic region's private markets. \"For the private assets we are looking for, i.e. high-quality companies with long track records of good, profitable growth, really there are very seldom times when you can make a bargain,\" he said. \"So we're not bargain hunters, we're in this for the long term … on the positive side, I would say that between our focus markets, which are the Nordics and North America, there are a really good investment opportunities.\" — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.", "content_hash": "ca800d21803a3a135e78cdd952393821", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Josh — One of the primary purposes of keeping this Best Stocks in the Market List is to help us keep our biases in check. For example, my attitude toward the biotechnology segment of the stock market these days can be described as \"extreme apathy.\" I simply do not have time for the names in this group. The industry isn't working, hasn't been working, and has represented a massive opportunity cost versus the major averages over the last few years. But that's just my bias talking. It's informed (I have the data), but it's a bias nonetheless. In the meantime, there is a small number of biotechs on our list, two of which we've written about for CNBC Pro already and one that we should have written up much earlier. You may recall our column from June in which we talked about Gilead Sciences and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals . Both are still included in the Best Stocks list. ALNY has become an incredible winner, up 50% since the day of our write-up. GILD is more of a work in progress, up 5% since in a very tough tape for anything health care. The one we neglected to mention, Insmed (INSM) , is the biggest winner of the three. Sometimes it just works out that way. Sean and I can only cover so many names for you each week. We're trying! In today's update, we'll do an overview of the list and then hit these lonesome three biotech names that have transcended all other stocks in their sector to be among the very best in the U.S. stock market this year. Sector leaderboard As of Aug. 18, there are 182 names on The Best Stocks in the Market list Top sector ranking Top industries Top 5 best stocks by relative strength Sector spotlight Sean — We wrote up a piece on GILD and ALNY in early June. Both stocks are still on the list, and we got another entrant in INSM, rounding out our biotech exposure. Below is the most well-known biotech ETF, which happens to have all 3 of our stocks in its top five holdings: You can see this group of biotechs has ripped off its \"liberation day\" lows. They just bounced off their 50-day moving average and broke right through their 200-day moving average. The sector is gearing up for a golden cross, assuming we continue trending higher. Biotech stocks have historically shown resilience and even outperformance during Federal Reserve rate-cutting cycles, benefiting from a valuation boost and improved funding conditions (as most capital-intensive businesses do). Because many biotechs generate most of their cash flows in the future, lower interest rates reduce discount rates and increase the present value of those expected earnings. While biotechs generally like rate cuts, the three stocks on our list are in slightly different breakout phases. We were late on Insmed (INSM) You can see this stock is ripping, up 95% over the past three months and up 16% the past week. On Aug. 12, Insmed announced the Food and Drug Administration approved Brensocatib, the first and only treatment specifically for non–cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, a chronic lung condition. This approval sparked immediate investor enthusiasm, driving the stock higher. Alnylam (ALNY) was a home run We wrote this one up on June 9; the stock is up 48% from that day. Alnylam delivered stellar second-quarter results, far exceeding expectations. Revenues were up 64% year-over-year. The company received regulatory approvals in the European Union, Brazil, UK, Germany and Japan for their cardiomyopathy treatment. We noted the FDA approval in the U.S. as a tailwind for the stock. It's still early for Gilead (GILD) The stock has been trending nicely, up a reasonable 5% since we wrote them up in June. They reported earnings in early August, beating on both lines and raising guidance for the full year. Gross margin improved from 78.7% to 87% and they authorized a new $6 billion share repurchase program along with a 79 cent per share dividend. Risk management Josh — Gilead is the world leader in treating HIV, and its newest approved drug, Yeztugo, got a special shoutout during the earnings call on Aug. 7. Yeztugo is a twice-a-year injection used to prevent HIV, and CEO Daniel O'Day said the first prescription was written within hours of launch — and the first dose was delivered within days. The company is expecting 75% U.S. insurer coverage within six months, and 90% coverage within one year. This, along with other positive developments in the company's pipeline as well as the affirmation of full-year guidance, should support the current rally. GILD found overhead resistance at $120 — precisely where you would have expected it to — as some of those who bought at these levels back in March lighten up just in case the stock fails again. I'm willing to give GILD the benefit of the doubt. I think it trades through $120 and can stay there. Especially if the biotech's long and miserable downtrend is finally being snapped as Sean has shown above. GILD won't give you the maximum bang for your buck in a biotech bull market, but it's been a sector leader and should hold its own. This name has been above its 200-day at all times over the last 12 months (see above). Traders can use $110 for risk management, investors can trail it with a 200-day simple moving average, currently around $102 - I'd keep updating that stop at the end of each week. So long as the sector is in comeback mode and GILD hangs near highs, I'd want to be long.

But the word \"incompetence\" often put people on the defensive. I kept getting rehearsed answers when I wanted honest ones.\nOver time, I found a better way to get similar insights. Today, I ask: \"What gives you energy, and what takes it away?\"\nThis framing shows I'm on their side. I'm not trying to trip them up. I'm trying to protect them from a role they might hate. This gives people permission to answer more candidly, and their responses are revealing.\nDON'T MISS: How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work\nThe question gets to job fit faster than any resume review or personality test. Skills and experience matter, but they miss a critical variable: energy. Even top talent burns out when they spend their days on tasks they find draining. When their work aligns with what energizes them, on the other hand, they can sustain high performance after the new-job excitement fades.\nIn my experience, nine times out of 10, the energy profile from the interview matches what managers say in performance reviews months later. I've never gotten that level of accuracy from expensive hiring software.\nIt's a simple question, but if you listen closely to the answer, it can change the trajectory of your team and your business.\nSpot red flags early\nSometimes, a candidate's answer makes it clear they'd be unhappy in the role.\nOne candidate I interviewed for an account manager position, for example, said something like: \"I love helping clients, but I can't stand going back and forth when they push back on ideas.\"\nClient feedback — including pushback — is part of daily life in that role.\nI knew they'd be drained by the very work the job required. I thanked them for their honesty and explained why the fit wasn't right. We both avoided a bad situation down the road.\nIdentify top performers who will thrive\nOther times, the answer maps directly to the job and makes it clear someone will thrive.\nFor a customer success role, for instance, one candidate said something like: \"I get energy from diving deep with clients, understanding their goals, and making sure we deliver exactly what they need. What takes my energy is busywork that keeps me away from them.\"\nSix months after they were hired, their performance review echoed that conversation almost word for word. They excelled in client-facing work and became a top performer.\nHow to ask this question\nIf you want to use this question in your own hiring process, here's what I recommend:\n- Ask it early. Don't wait until the end of the interview. You'll get a clearer, more relaxed answer when the conversation is still fresh.\n- Listen beyond the words. Pay attention to tone, pauses, and cadence. Hesitation can be just as telling as enthusiasm.\n- Make sure you can deliver. If they say they thrive in high-energy, collaborative environments, make sure you can actually offer that. Otherwise, you're setting them up to fail.\n- Don't \"sell\" them into a mismatch. It's tempting to convince a great candidate to take the job anyway, but that almost always leads to short tenures and rehiring costs.\nHow to answer this question\nThis question is a litmus test for job seekers, too. My advice for candidates:\n- Reflect in advance. Think about your current and past roles. Which tasks left you feeling energized at the end of the day? Which ones left you depleted?\n- Use it to assess fit. If the role's day-to-day responsibilities don't line up with what you said gives you energy, that can be a sign that it's not the right opportunity.\n- Be honest. Hiding the truth will only land you in a role that feels like a grind. The more candid you are, the more likely you are to find a role where you can thrive and avoid jobs that will drain you.\nEli Rubel is a life-long entrepreneur and currently serves as the CEO of Profit Labs, a strategic finance, bookkeeping, and accounting firm for agencies, and SurveyGate, a SaaS tool that helps business owners automatically capture objective client feedback.

As the next quarterly earnings release approaches, many of the points we made then remain true now, so I encourage a review of that prior article, but because we provided a trade example then, it makes sense to review: how it performed some trade maintenance \"best practices\" what to do now If you do not review the prior article, this was the trade structure we laid out three months ago: Buy 1 Sept 19 110 call ($5.73 premium) Sell 1 June 27 115 call ($1.51 premium) Sell 1 June 27 84 put ($1.49 premium) That entire structure required an outlay of ~$2.73 in premium. While Target shares have risen about 4.5% since then, the following chart illustrates how the options trade performed. One notices that the calendar spread, which was long the Sep 110 calls and short a nearer-dated June 27 expiration strangle, saw its value increase within the first couple of weeks. The structure appreciated to more than $4 by June 10, when the short strangle still had 16 days to expiration. At that point, the stock had only appreciated by just over 2.8% from around $98 to $100.77. In fact, if we examine the prices of the individual options in the structure, we would realize that all of the returns generated by the options trade came from the decay of the short strangle. The short strangle was worth $3.04 as of the first closing day of the trade and was worth only 47 cents by June 10. It had lost about 85% of its value. Readers who put that trade on likely recognized that most of the potential money in the short strangle had already been made, and possibly rolled the short position further out. Consider that the most a trader could expect to make over the 16 days remaining in the short strangle was just 47 cents, or less than half of 1% of the stock price. As it happens, the strangle did indeed expire worthless, and the only remaining component of the trade, the long September calls are still worth more than the initial structure cost making the trade profitable even if one did nothing. However, one would have done far better by actively managing the trade by rolling the short options, to a longer-dated 16 delta (sometimes abbreviated 16^) strangle such as the July 25 expiration 90/115. That trade had roughly 45 days to expiration and would have collected about $2.43, net of the 47 cents one would have to pay to cover the prior short strangle that would have brought in $1.98 in additional premium. And guess what? Within the next 18 days, the new short July 25 90/115 strangle would be worth only 46 cents, also having decayed by more than 80% of the value when the trade was initiated, at which point a trader could have rolled the short strangle yet again. Using the same guidelines, targeting roughly six-to-seven weeks until expiration and 16^ calls and puts, one would have sold the Aug. 22 90/120 strangle (the 85s delta was approximately 13.5 at the time and the 90s was about 19.5. Considering the underlying thesis was modestly bullish, and generally favoring deltas between 16 and 20, without other strikes available — the 90s would be the most obvious choice). This trade would have collected $3.62 in premium on the new short strangle, net of buying back the old one for 46 cents, the trader would have collected $3.16. As of this week, that new short strangle would, once again, have lost most of its value, which would soon promote yet another roll. The chart below illustrates the difference in the P & L of buying the spread with a \"set and forget,\" versus managing the trade by rolling the short strangles once they have lost more than 80% of their value. The initial trade would have made about $100 per spread through Friday. An actively rolled spread would instead have made nearly $500 per spread. That's not a little bit better, it's a lot better. So what are the takeaways? Options premium decay (aka \"theta\") can be a powerful source of returns over time. Short options positions need to be managed even if they are winning . It's not enough to know that a short option has a high probability of profit, but that the returns it offers remain compelling. Even simple \"rule of thumb\" approaches can make a big difference. In this example, I simply suggest that if you sell a 16 delta (16^) strangle, you roll it once it has decayed by 80%, identifying a new short option of ~16^ with 6-7 weeks until expiration to replace it. (Important note: Keep an eye on catalysts.) Multiple factors may impact when an option should be rolled that cannot be known ex ante. We do not know exactly what a stock will do or when it will do it. We do not know precisely how implied volatility will change from day to day, although we do know that it tends to rise going into catalysts and tends to fall sharply after they have passed. So, sticking with Target as the underlying stock, what would the trade look like today? Buy the November 110 calls pay $6.15 Sell the Sept. 26 weekly 120 calls at $1.32 Sell the Sept. 26 weekly 90 puts at $1.38 If the short strangle loses 80% or more of its value, roll the options out to expirations of six weeks or so, selecting strikes of 16-20^. A trader can adjust the tenor or moneyness as they see fit, provided they are receiving a reasonable rate of return in options decay. For me, the rule of thumb is 12% annualized, or 1% a month or more, particularly if the underlying stock is highly volatile, is in a volatile industry, or has a lot of debt. DISCLOSURES: None.

His track record is substantial: He's backed more than 4,000 startups through Y Combinator since 2005, including Airbnb, Reddit and Twitch.\n\"I haven't met all the startups in the current [Y Combinator] batch yet, but the two most impressive companies that I've seen so far are not working on AI,\" wrote Graham. \"The lesson to take from this is not that AI is unimportant (it's very important), but that the founders matter more than the idea. The founders are the best predictor of how a company will do, not the industry it's in.\"\nHe added: \"If you want to start a startup to work on a non-AI idea, go ahead. If you're good, good investors will see it, and those are the only ones you want to convince anyway.\"\nAI-focused startups raised $104.3 billion from venture firms in the first half of 2025, matching the full-year total from 2024, according to PitchBook. Nearly half of the 140-plus companies in Y Combinator's current batch of startups are focused on AI, Pitchbook noted.\nEven Bill Gates would launch an \"AI-centric\" startup if he were to try and build a new company that could recreate Microsoft's success, he told CNBC Make It in September 2024: \"Today, somebody could raise billions of dollars for a new AI company [that's just] a few sketch ideas.\"\nBut entrepreneurs shouldn't feel like focusing on AI is the only way to attract investors who can help give their new companies a financial path to success, Graham wrote. He's preached a similar message for decades, long before the current AI boom — writing in a March 2009 blog post that a startup founder's entrepreneurial skill is their company's most reliable success indicator.\n\"Bad founders\" lack long-term, unshakeable passion and drive, while \"good founders\" are relentlessly resourceful, scrappy problem-solvers who'll always respond to a setback by refocusing on their next steps forward, Graham wrote in his blog post.\n\"Good founders make things happen the way they want,\" wrote Graham. \"Which is not to say they force things to happen in a predefined way. Good founders have a healthy respect for reality. But they are relentlessly resourceful. That's the closest I can get to the opposite of hapless.\"\nHelp us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals\nSome other investors agree: Josh Browder, who founded the $210 million online legal services company DoNotPay and has invested in over 100 startups, bases his investment decisions primarily on whether a startup's founder has a \"deep connection\" to the problem they're trying to solve, he said on June 30.\n\"A lot of being an entrepreneur is like eating glass,\" said Browder, adding: \"If they don't have a true connection to the problem, they're going to give up. So I look for signals that they really care about what they're building.\"\nThe same ethos can apply — perhaps even more strongly — to non-tech startups and small businesses.\nReal estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, a judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" regularly invests in entrepreneurs she believes in, regardless of their industry or whether their business is turning a profit, for example. Billionaire entrepreneur and startup investor Mark Cuban, a longtime co-star of Corcoran's on the TV show, has lauded her for having \"the best people skills\" to identify which founders are worth investing in.\n\"Her ability to recognize the good and bad in somebody, what they'll be like as an entrepreneur, what they'll be like as a person – Barbara picks up on that stuff in a minute,\" Cuban said on Corcoran's podcast \"888-Barbara\" in November 2019.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The bank's Investment Institute raised its year-end S & P 500 target range to 6,300-6,500 — putting the midpoint at 6,400. Strategist Darrell Cronk previously expected the benchmark to end 2025 between 5,900 and 6,100. \"We believe delayed tariff increases will mitigate this year's U.S. economic growth slowdown and extend the soft patch into early 2026. This should dilute positive impacts from frontloaded tax cuts and deregulation during the first part of next year. We think the protracted tariff implementation will mute and defer the brunt of tariff-related price pressures until later this year and into early 2026,\" Wells said in a note to clients Friday. President Donald Trump in April unveiled steep charges on imported goods but soon pushed back the implementation of those duties. That helped the S & P 500 recover from a sharp sell-off that nearly tipped the benchmark into a bear market.

Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel who, at 5,600, has the lowest S & P target in CNBC's Market Strategist Survey , said he thinks the benchmark could pull back by anywhere from 7% to 15% from current levels. He said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech Friday at the Jackson Hole symposium could send the market lower if investors leave with less confidence toward central bank rate cuts. \"Powell on 8/22 is likely to indirectly signal a 25bp rate cut on 9/17/25 – stressing 50bp is not an option absent Labor market deterioration, and Oct and/or Dec cuts will be 'data dependent.' For a market that was eager to embrace '50 in Sept,' a balanced view could catalyze a near term -7% to -15% pullback into October, within the context of the Structural AI Driven Bull Market,\" Emanuel said in his weekly note to clients. UBS' wealth management arm also sees potential for \"near-term volatility\" with the market at current price levels. \"Equity valuations are now elevated after a substantial rally in recent months,\" head of U.S. equities David Lefkowitz wrote. \"The economic impact of U.S. tariffs is currently feeding through, with the labor market weakening and inflation rising. Uncertainty remains—regarding the scale, distribution and second-order effects.\" Still, Lefkowitz expects stocks to be higher a year from now.", "content_hash": "2fc22d158dafc6973efd6fdb10987ba3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here's a recap of Monday's key moments. 1. Wall Street is having a slow start to the new week of trading. It's not a total surprise given we're coming off back-to-back winning weeks and many of the biggest events this week — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech and earnings from retail bellwether Walmart — aren't for a few days. With Powell's speech on Friday morning, Director of Portfolio Analysis Jeff Marks noted that the big debate is whether Powell will tee up a September interest rate cut or focus instead on providing a longer-term monetary policy framework. \"Should be market-moving,\" Jeff said. In addition to Walmart on Thursday, we'll hear from Club retailers Home Depot on Tuesday and TJX Companies on Wednesday. 2. We're not sweating Evercore ISI issuing a short-term negative call on CrowdStrike , one of our two pure-play cybersecurity stocks, ahead of its earnings report next week. \"I'm always wary of these tactical calls in either direction,\" Jeff said. Evercore is concerned that its \"subdued\" channel checks combined with CrowdStrike's premium valuation could lead to a post-earnings pullback. That wouldn't be out of the ordinary, Jeff said, with shares averaging a 5.5% decline in response to its past three earnings reports. We've viewed those as buying opportunities, though. \"If you want to hold off on buying it before earnings given the history I just said, I think that's reasonable as well,\" Jeff said. 3. Before we hear from CrowdStrike, we get results from cyber peer Palo Alto Networks after Monday's close. \"It hasn't been a great earnings season for some cybersecurity names. We'll hope to see Palo Alto buck that trend this evening,\" Jeff said. In particular, we're looking for confirmation that Palo Alto's blockbuster CyberArk acquisition was not executed because its core business is slowing down — that's been a key prong of the bear case against the deal. We haven't bought into it, though, and accordingly added to our position a week ago at nearly $170 a share. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long HD, TJX, PANW and CRWD.

Markets: Stocks aren't moving much Monday as Wall Street waits on retail earnings and a speech from Fed Chair Jay Powell later in the week. Monday's session lacks clear themes, but Meta Platforms stands out as a laggard after a report from The Information said the longtime Club holding is planning the fourth restructuring of its AI team in six months. The story is raising questions in light of Meta's significant investment in recruiting AI talent from other tech companies. Novo price cut : Shares of Club name Eli Lilly are relatively unchanged despite chief rival Novo Nordisk lowering prices for its popular GLP-1 medication. Novo Nordisk announced on Monday that it has cut the price of Ozempic, its popular GLP-1 for Type 2 diabetes, to $499 per month for cash-paying patients that use its NovoCare direct-to-patient program. Novo also announced that it has partnered with GoodRx to offer the same price for Ozempic and the weight-loss drug Wegovy at U.S. pharmacies. While the news may spark concerns that a price war is heating up in a battle for market share, we don't see this specific Ozempic development advancing that narrative. The main reason why is that the cash-pay market for GLP-1s to treat Type 2 diabetes is not as important as it is for their obesity counterparts. It all comes down to insurance coverage, which is much higher for these medications for diabetes than weight loss. Indeed, Lilly does not offer Type 2 diabetes treatment Mounjaro on its LillyDirect platform, while sister drug Zepbound for obesity is on there. Lilly executives were asked about this on the company's August earnings call, and the president of Lilly USA, Ilya Yuffa, had this to say: \"With Mounjaro, we have significant coverage. So, over 90% coverage in both commercial as well as [Medicare] Part D. And so, we're not sure if [adding Mounjaro to LillyDirect] necessarily provides additional avenue. With Zepbound, we see significant growth because we do have coverage gaps in commercial. And obviously, we also have coverage gaps without having the ability to cover anti-obesity medications in Part D. So, we see this as an opportunity for us to meet that need. For what it's worth, we still like where Lilly sits in the obesity side of the GLP-1 market. Back in February, Eli Lilly announced that self-pay patients could get Zepbound single dose vials for $499 per month through its LillyDirect platform. That's on par with the price for Wegovy on NovoCare. Since head-to-head studies have found Lilly's Zepbound to be superior to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy on weight loss, patients should continue to prefer Lilly's GLP-1s. We initially downgraded our rating on Eli Lilly after its earnings a few weeks ago, partly due to concerns about a potential price war. However, we reversed course and upgraded the stock back to a buy-equivalent 1 following signs of confidence driven by significant insider buying activity. Nuclear win : Alphabet's Google and the nuclear energy company Kairos Power announced on Monday the deployment of an advanced nuclear plant to the grid. Per the agreement, a reactor operated by Kairos Power will deliver up to 50 megawatts of reliable, 24/7 energy to the Tennessee Valley Authority electric grid that powers Google data centers in Tennessee and Alabama. The electricity will come from Kairos' Hermes 2 plant, which is scheduled to begin operations in 2030. The collaboration underscores how hyperscalers are creating new partnerships with nuclear energy providers to secure, around-the-clock power supply toward the end of the decade. Unlike gas-fired electricity, nuclear power offers tech giants like Alphabet a way to run their data centers on clean energy while advancing their decarbonization goals. While Club name GE Vernova is probably best known for its heavy-duty gas turbines , the power generation company also makes small modular reactors that have gained in popularity, so nuclear developments are important to follow closely. Up next: Palo Alto Networks reports after the closing bell , the first of three Club stocks with earnings this week. Before the opening bell on Tuesday, we'll see earnings from Club name Home Depot , Medtronic , and Viking Holdings . On the data side, we'll see July housing starts and building permits, but we'll take are cue on the housing sector from what Home Depot management says on the earnings call.

See today's video update from Mike above.) Stocks are idling to start a new week, holding just below record highs as Wall Street awaits some potentially consequential updates on the consumer and Federal Reserve policy. The S & P 500 was nearly flat, sitting in its narrowest daily range of the year, holding tight to its closing level both from Friday and last Tuesday, the day that a mostly benign Consumer Price Index report for July solidified expectations for a Fed rate cut next month. Here's the index with last Tuesday's closing level highlighted … Below the surface, a firmer bid was evident. A modest majority of stocks were up on the day Monday, the equal-weighted S & P 500 barely was in the green, with the longtime laggard Russell 2000 small-cap gauge lifting by about 0.3%. Cyclicals hung tough, with equal-weight consumer discretionary and industrials both outperforming the broad market . In the absence of material macroeconomic news or a strong impetus to move the top-heavy indexes, the market rotated around, lifting some of the weakest 2025 performers. The bottom ten S & P 500 stocks in terms of year-to-date return were all up on the day, with an average gain of more than 2%. They included busted growth stocks such as Trade Desk , Deckers Outdoor and Fiserv , along with some beleaguered healthcare names. Meantime, some marquee AI plays came under pressure as investors took in a few conflicting signals on the sustainability and ultimate return on all the AI capex. Meta Platforms was by far the biggest drag on the S & P 500, down 2.2%, apparently on a report in The Information detailing another restructuring of its AI efforts, perhaps exacerbated by OpenAI founder Sam Altman granting that some AI investing activity is looking a bit bubbly. Much commentary about the strength of corporate earnings as the core support for the market's summer advance. Goldman Sachs documents how extreme the magnitude of profit beats relative to forecasts was in the second quarter. True enough, though this is largely a measure of how much estimates were chopped down in the first third of the year. S & P 500 aggregate earnings for Q2 started the year at $67, fell to about $62.50 and after this blockbuster reporting season migrated back up to $66.50. Ahead of the Fed's Jackson Hole symposium late this week, the Street is getting itself wound pretty tight over how Chair Jay Powell might characterize the chances of a September cut. On the one hand, circumstances are plausibly converging around one idea: In June, FOMC officials anticipated two more rate cuts by year end and there are only three more meetings. And since that June outlook, we got a truly weak July jobs report. On the other hand, Powell probably has little incentive to commit firmly given high lame-duck status and the fact that more employment and inflation numbers will hit before the September meeting. With stock indexes near records, equity valuations full, credit spreads tight, volatility down and the economic-surprise indexes hanging tough in positive territory, shouldn't investors be able to handle a somewhat longer wait for another rate cut, if it comes to that? Or are markets this strong across the board based on cuts resuming soon?", "content_hash": "ecb7e50edf6212413067f4ded2f15897", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Investors should be ready to snap up the stock if it sees some pressure following the results, he said. Landsberg joined CNBC's \" Power Check \" Monday to offer his insights on Palo Alto and a couple other trending stock stories. Here is what he had to say. Palo Alto Networks Shares of the cybersecurity company have seen meaningful weakness in recent months, pulling back more than 15% over the past six. Landsberg said that any further weakness after its quarterly results would provide an opportunity for investors. \"Cybersecurity is one of those businesses that continues to keep moving forward,\" he said. \"The smarter [artificial intelligence] gets, the smarter AI cybersecurity has to get.\" \"The stock should I think hopefully trade off a bit for people that don't own it,\" the CIO also said, adding that investors \"should be a buyer\" of the name if it reports 16% year-over-year earnings per share growth. Landsberg disclosed that he's held the stock for 10 years and predicts holding it for another five to seven years, seeing that \"it's been a real winner.\" Viking Holdings Landsberg is also taking a bullish approach to cruise name Viking Holdings ahead of its earnings results on Tuesday before the bell. He said thinks that the company will report earnings growth of 32% year over year and believes this trend will continue. \"Viking has done a really good job of marketing themselves to higher-end consumers,\" he said. \"They go to every continent in the world, and it's a smaller boat. It's a smaller bespoke experience, so you're not competing with thousands and thousands of people on these boats. I think people like that. They want to have that high-end experience.\" Landsberg said that while he doesn't own shares of the company right now, he'll want to own it in the future. This comes as the stock has soared more than 37% year to date, outperforming the S & P 500's rise of almost 10% in the period. \"I own the entire space,\" he added. \"We think it's a good name.\" Estee Lauder While shares of Estee Lauder have also seen gains recently, surging more than 39% in the past three months, Landsberg was more cautious when it came to the cosmetics giant, saying that the name is \"tricky.\" \"There's a lot of cosmetics companies in the world,\" he said. \"Estee Lauder hasn't grown their earnings or their revenue in probably four-plus years. Lots of competition, and my fear is just there's so much, there's so many choices out there. It's really tough.\" The company is due to post its quarterly results before market open on Wednesday, and Landsberg thinks the results could mark a bottom for earnings if they're down 85% year over year. \"Maybe this is the bottom that you could be a buyer down the road,\" he also said. \"We don't own it. We're not going to own it, but I'm hoping at some point. They've got good quality brands.\" \"The stock's been kind of one of those things that earnings wise, it just doesn't make the money that excites us to be able to step in,\" Landsberg added.", "content_hash": "81790a05b3c7fec098f8394ed214eb19", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

According to a May report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), there are now over 2 million monetized content creators influencing more than $350 billion in consumer spending in the country.\nDirect revenue from the creator ecosystem is also projected to grow from about $20 billion to $25 billion in the 2024 fiscal year to more than $100 billion by the end of the decade, according to the report.\nCreators today aren't just entertainers — they're also shaping consumer preferences and purchase decisions. The ecosystem is projected to drive more than $1 trillion in \"creator-influenced\" consumption by 2030, according to the BCG report.\nAuthenticity is currency\nSarkar says she started creating YouTube videos in 2018 about skincare, fashion and more. She's based in Kolkata and most of her content is in Bengali.\n\"At that time in our ... town, [YouTube] was not so famous, and people did not know what content creation actually is and what potential it holds,\" Sarkar told CNBC Make It.\nHer original filming setup was very simple. It consisted of a bucket, which she flipped upside down and used as a tripod for her phone. \"Every day for eight to 10 hours, I just sat down and edited the videos. So it was a very long, tiring process that I did for five years, and there was no success,\" Sarkar said.\n\"But one day, I just decided: 'What if I just take my mask down and I just show people who I actually am?' ... So I just started making videos without makeup, without any filter, just kept my phone in my hand and started talking, and that became my brand. My identity is very authentic,\" she added.\n\"People connect to me because they see themselves in me. I am that clumsy girl ... So I would say that my personal brand is all about being genuine, and whatever flaws I have, I just show it to the world,\" she said.\nIt's that very strategy of showing up authentically online that Sarkar and many other influencers have credited for attracting their loyal followings.\nToday, Sarkar is using a similar strategy to market her clothing brand, Preetizen. Instead of hiring professional models for her marketing campaign, Sarkar decided to launch a social media campaign in February asking her followers to apply to become models for her clothing line.\n\"We made [it] a community driven brand ... I told them: 'If you want to become a model, I do not care about your height, skin tone, or however you look ... I just want you to write [that you are] interested on this post, and I will select 10 people to become the face of my brand,\" she said.\n\"And you won't believe [it.] There were 60,000 plus comments ... I was getting calls. It was crazy, and we went through most of them, and we selected 10 people,\" said Sarkar, adding that the marketing campaign was a big turning point for her company.\nSimilarly, influencers have become an integral part of many marketing campaigns in India. That's largely because content creators have audiences that trust them and their recommendations — which is crucial for sales, Swarup said.\nInfluencers in India are creating personalized content that can appeal to specific regions and hyper-local preferences. That can be very difficult for traditional media to do, so content creators are bridging that gap, Swarup added.\n\"I think ... brands have also realized that authentic and transparent influencer engagement [can] benefit the brands significantly,\" he added.\nIt has long been common to see creators in the U.S. leverage their audiences to create income streams, but the trend is relatively nascent in India.\nIt's come by way of natural progression, Swarup said. In recent years, smartphones and data have become more accessible and affordable in India. \"In 2008, there were 346 million registered mobile SIM cards in India. Between 2008 and 2024, this number more than tripled,\" according to Data for India.\nData usage in India has grown from about 12 gigabytes a month in the 2020 fiscal year to about 27 gigabytes a month in the 2024 fiscal year, according to BCG.\n\"It's all about demand and supply ... Data consumption has really skyrocketed thanks to low [cost data] packages which consumers are [using],\" Swarup said.\n\"So influencers have grown subsequently, and as their paychecks increase, their wallet size increases, right? They are obviously looking [into] other avenues of monetization, beyond just the content on YouTube or Instagram,\" he added.\nNotably, the Covid-19 pandemic also gave a big boost to the industry, Swarup said.\n\"We are at an inflection point where the influencer marketing [industry] has really grown during the Covid and the post-Covid time, because [many people] went digital, and that was the only form of engagement, interaction, or ... communication that was happening,\" he said.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The shares rose about 6% in extended trading to $25.\nThe investment, equal to about 2% of Intel, makes SoftBank the fifth-biggest shareholder, according to FactSet. It's a vote of support for Intel, which hasn't been able to take advantage of the artificial intelligence boom in advanced semiconductors and has spent heavily to stand up a manufacturing business that's yet to secure a significant customer.\n\"Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,\" Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement, referring to SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son.\nIntel shares lost 60% of their value last year, their worst performance in the company's more than half-century on the public market. The stock is up 18% in 2025 as of Monday's close.\nTan took over as Intel CEO in March after his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger, was ousted in December.\nIntel has been a major topic of discussion in Washington of late, due to the company's role as the only American company capable of manufacturing the most advanced chips.\nHowever, Intel's foundry business, which is designed to manufacture chips for other companies, has yet to secure a major customer, a critical step towards stabilization and expansion. Last month, Intel said it would wait to secure orders before committing to certain future investment in its foundry.\nTan met with President Donald Trump last week after the president had called for the CEO's resignation. The U.S. government is considering taking an equity stake in Intel, according to reports.\nSoftBank, meanwhile, has become an increasingly large player in the global chip and AI markets.\nIn 2016, SoftBank acquired chip designer Arm in a deal worth about $32 billion at the time. Today the company is worth almost $150 billion. Arm-based chips are part of Nvidia's systems that go into data centers.\nAnd in March of this year, SoftBank announced plans to acquire another chip designer, Ampere Computing, for $6.5 billion.\nSoftBank was also part of President Trump's Stargate announcement in January, along with OpenAI and Oracle.\nThe three companies committed to invest an initial $100 billion and up to $500 billion over the next four years in the AI infrastructure project. Two months later, SoftBank led a $40 billion investment into OpenAI, the largest private tech deal on record.\n\"This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role,\" Son said in a statement.", "content_hash": "c31e6e2ceba3c20d22dcc2a4baa0423d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Following such a loss, insurers send checks typically made out jointly to both the homeowner and the mortgage lender or servicer. The lender will then deposit the funds into an escrow account, where it earns interest that the lender could keep.\nCalifornia Assemblymember John Harabedian, D-Pasadena, the author of the bill, said he is fighting to change that after hearing from his constituents about their struggles getting insurance payouts released from their lenders.\n\"If the homeowners are not given their money right away, the interest on that money, which the banks and the mortgage lenders are holding onto and earning [interest on], should be paid to the homeowner, not the banks,\" Harabedian told CNBC. \"The more we looked into this, the more we realized that this was a huge problem across the board.\"\nThe bill will now head to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk to be signed into law.\nAfter a disaster, insurance settlement checks can often be held in an escrow account by the mortgage servicing company until rebuilding is complete, which can take months or even years. During this time, the funds can accrue significant interest that the servicing company could keep.\nNow, the homeowner will be guaranteed at least 2% interest on those funds.\nThe bill will apply to both existing insurance payouts that are still being held in escrow accounts and to any new escrow accounts that are opened following a catastrophic event. For any funds already in an escrow account, interest at 2% simple per annum will begin accruing on the bill's effective date.\nNewsom, who sponsored the state legislation, said homeowners rebuilding after a disaster need all the support they can get.\n\"This is a commonsense solution that ensures that [homeowners] receive every resource available to help them recover and rebuild,\" Newsom said in a statement in February when the bill was first introduced.\nCalifornia law had already required lenders to pay homeowners interest on escrowed funds for property taxes and insurance, but it didn't explicitly include insurance payments. The bill aims to close that loophole.\n\"It's sad that we have to introduce a bill to make the banks and the mortgage lenders do the right thing, but this is about homeowners getting all the financial help that they can throughout this difficult period,\" Harabedian said.", "content_hash": "7410ff4b312ec2ca9fca56eef4699ed8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Tuesday's earnings report before the opening bell, however, will spotlight the retailer's actual business performance and may determine where shares go from here. They have gained nearly 7.5% so far in August. \"Home Depot, the company, is not doing well. Home Depot, the stock is on fire,\" Jim Cramer said during our August Monthly Meeting last week. \"It's a stock that needs lower rates,\" Jim added, to bring down rates on mortgages and home equity loans. HD YTD mountain Home Depot YTD And, lower rates are, indeed, what the market expects from the Fed, with a more than 80% chance of a September cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool , and at least one more by year-end. Mortgage rates, which have followed the 10-year Treasury yield south since late May, hit their lowest levels since late October 2024. As of last Thursday, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.58%, according to Freddie Mac , the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Below 6.5% for a 30-year has historically been seen as a level that spurs housing activity, which Home Depot needs as a supplier to homebuilders, contractors, and homeowners doing their own renovation projects. \"We've seen the last couple of weeks, as rate cut odds improve, what could happen,\" said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. The real estate market has been stalled due to those high home prices and elevated mortgage rates. The latter is especially punitive because so many people secured super-low rates during Covid, which are keeping them put. During sluggish activity from do-it-yourself customers, Home Depot has been taking steps to bolster its business aimed at professionals. Last year, Home Depot acquired SRS Distribution, a leading supplier of roofing and building materials, in an $18.25 billion deal. The home improvement giant then doubled down this year, with a successful $4.3 billion bid to acquire GMS back in June. \"We believe the SRS platform has established a firm foundation for capitalizing on Complex Pro that is performing well,\" wrote Stifel analysts in a note to clients Sunday. The complex pro segment in the home improvement industry refers to large-scale projects handled by contractors. Analysts added, \"We view the potential GMS acquisition positively with modest synergy potential with HD leveraging its financial strength to invest behind favorable long-term construction trends amid difficult industry conditions.\" In addition to listening for any further details on the GMS transaction and the SRS integration, investors on Tuesday will get a look at Home Depot's spring and early summer sales — a period that Jim has called Home Depot's Christmas . As my colleague Kevin Stankiewicz wrote in an earnings preview over the weekend, \"The market is looking for a companywide same-store sales increase of 1.3% in the July quarter, according to FactSet. That would mark a significant acceleration from the 0.3% drop seen in the February-to-April period. Investors also will be looking for any tariff-related hit to margins after executives said in May they expected to 'generally maintain' current prices.\" Bottom line While encouraged by Home Depot's price action lately, the stock is coming into Tuesday's earnings print hot, which Jim has often said makes him cautious. \"It's such a hard stock to own because we're playing rates. We're not playing the business,\" he added. We may get a hint on rates before the Fed's meeting next month.

The company's products underpin a wide swath of tech infrastructure, and the paradigm shift that is artificial intelligence (AI) has taken it to the next level.\nMuch to the delight of its shareholders, Broadcom continues to capitalize on this opportunity, which is driving its revenue and profits higher despite its position as a larger, slower-growth company. That essential ability has fueled its stock price, which has surged 468% over the past three years (as of this writing) and 109% over the past 12 months.\nThe company faces a key hurdle when Broadcom reports its fiscal 2025 third-quarter results after the market close on Sept. 4. Given the stock's blistering returns over the past year, should investors lay out their hard-earned money to jump on the bandwagon or wait until after this crucial financial report? Let's dig in to see what the evidence suggests.\nLet the chips fall where they may\nBroadcom offers a wide range of technology solutions that permeate every corner of technology. The company offers a diverse range of software, semiconductor, and security products that cater to the broadband, mobile, cable, and data center industries. In fact, its products are so far-reaching that Broadcom notes that \"99% of all internet traffic crosses through some type of Broadcom technology.\"\nThe advent of generative AI in late 2022 represented a sparkling new opportunity, and management wasted no time entering the fray. Broadcom designs custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to accelerate the processing of AI workloads. Furthermore, these power-miserly chips consume less energy, making them an attractive choice for cloud providers and data center operators. The company also offers an impressive array of networking solutions that help transport data around the ether.\nThis strategy has proven extremely profitable for Broadcom. In the second quarter (ended May 4), the company generated revenue of $15 billion, up 20% year over year, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.58 jumped 44%. Management noted that the surging growth was the result of strong demand for AI, as revenue related to the technology grew 46% to $4.4 billion, marking its ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. While sales of its AI chips grew by double digits, AI networking solutions soared 70%.\nManagement expects the company's growth streak to continue. For the third quarter, Broadcom is guiding for revenue of $15.8 billion, which would represent growth of 21%, resulting in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of roughly $10.43 billion, an increase of 27%.\nIt's also worth mentioning that Broadcom pays a modest dividend of $0.59 per quarter, with a current yield of about 0.8%. While that might seem like a pittance, that's the result of the surging stock price. Furthermore, with a payout ratio of 63% and increasing profitability, Broadcom has room to continue its 15-year streak of dividend increases.\nGiven the company's growing revenue and expanding profitability, the dividend is merely icing on the cake.\nShould you buy Broadcom stock now or wait until after earnings?\nFor investors looking to capitalize on the secular tailwinds resulting from AI, the future looks bright for the tech giant. This begs the question: Is it better to buy Broadcom stock now, or wait until after the company reports earnings?\nWhile it's tempting to try to invest just before a catalyst like an earnings report, long-term investors would be better served by buying the stock and disregarding the daily machinations of the stock market. There's no way to know for sure whether Broadcom will meet Wall Street's rather arbitrary revenue and EPS targets or how investors will react on a particular day.\nThe quintessential investing question is whether Broadcom stock is a buy, and as the recent results show, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic. Furthermore, Wall Street is extremely bullish, with 43 of the 47 analysts who offered an opinion in August rating the stock a buy or strong buy, and none recommending selling.\nManagement is equally optimistic and estimates the company's addressable market for AI revenue (from its three current hyperscale customers) is between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal 2027. Furthermore, the company announced in December that it is onboarding two new customers -- but management is keeping information about them close to the vest. It will likely take some time to bring those new clients up to speed, but Broadcom's future results will almost surely get a boost.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention the stock's valuation, as Broadcom is currently selling for 37 times next year's expected earnings (as of this writing). While that might seem a bit on the high side, I'd suggest it's a fair price to pay given the preponderance of evidence.\nMost experts concur that it's still early days for AI, but the size of the opportunity continues to increase. Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimates AI's contribution to the global economy at $15.7 trillion between now and 2030. While the opportunity is vast, the truth is that no one can say how large it is, at least not with any certainty.\nGiven the company's previous track record of success, expanding revenue and profits, and growing opportunity, the evidence suggests Broadcom stock is a buy.\nShould you buy stock in Broadcom right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

This is money that people could use toward more purposeful money goals, like paying down debt or funding their first emergency fund.\nUp Next: The 5 Car Brands Named the Least Reliable of 2025\nFor You: I’m a Financial Advisor: My Wealthiest Clients All Do These 3 Things\nHere are several things people waste money on, according to Kamel. While it’s not an exhaustive list, cutting out several of these items could help people build towards more meaningful money goals this year.\nUnnecessary Subscriptions\nIf people have several subscriptions, there might be a way for them to save money. They likely don’t need multiple delivery apps or streaming services. Consumers can do an inventory of the services they use the most and see which ones they can cut out.\nFood delivery apps typically have a significant markup and if people are trying to reach a financial goal, like paying down debt, eating at home can help them save significantly over the course of a year.\nConsider This: 8 Frugal Habits Americans Are Ridiculed for — and Why You Shouldn’t Care\nDining Out and Fast Food\nPrepping food takes time, but it can help consumers save serious money. An article from the University of Illinois showed that just over 53% of people are frustrated with fast food prices. That’s likely because prices at restaurants that used to be considered affordable have now increased with inflation.\nPaying Credit Card Interest\nIf people have credit card debt, the interest they pay can make it hard to escape the debt cycle. Whether they have to cut expenses or temporarily pick up a side hustle, consumers should do whatever they can to pay off their debt quickly and avoid spending more on interest costs.\nCell Phone Plans\nIn another article posted to the Ramsey website, Kamel wrote about the cheapest cell phone plans. He explained the average cell phone bill in America is $141 per month, which adds up to over a thousand dollars annually. Kamel also explained it pays to research alternate cell phone plans, especially from smaller carriers.\nGambling\nGambling could become a serious addiction. Kamel advised against small gambling purchases, too, like lottery tickets. He explained they aren’t a good use of people’s hard-earned money. Instead, he recommended that people invest the money they would have spent on lottery tickets.\nBuying New Cars\nKamel explained that actual millionaires buy used, reliable cars. Plus, Kelley Blue Book reported that most new vehicles lose 20% in value during the first year of ownership. That’s why it’s smart to purchase a used car, preferably in cash. Getting locked into an expensive monthly car payment can reduce cash flow that people could use for other financial goals.", "content_hash": "5cafe0f7e24e8a371d26cc1e72f950d9", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Developers continue to create new applications for the technology, which is being leveraged to produce original content, streamline business processes, and enhance productivity. Despite making headlines for more than two years, it's still early days for the adoption of AI, and the evidence suggests spending continues to ramp up.\nIn fact, the four horsemen of technology -- namely Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- are poised to collectively spend more than $400 billion for the capital expenditures required to support their AI ambitions this year, and these outlays show no signs of slowing.\nWith data center spending at the top of the shopping list, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is positioned to reap the rewards of much of that spending. The company pioneered the graphics processing units (GPUs) that perform the mathematical calculations required to enable AI, and I predict it will parlay the unrelenting demand for those chips into charter membership in the $6 trillion club.\nA GPU primer\nNvidia pioneered the first GPU back in 1999 to render lifelike images in video games. The groundbreaking development that made that possible was parallel processing, which breaks up massive computing jobs into smaller, more manageable chunks. This enabled the simultaneous processing of a multitude of mathematical computations, making Nvidia's chips a game-changer.\nThis was just the beginning of the journey for the humble GPU, which proved adept at enabling or accelerating other applications, including those in the cloud or data centers, where the majority of AI processing takes place. Nvidia has become the gold standard for data center GPUs, controlling an eye-watering 92% of the market, according to business intelligence firm IoT Analytics.\nThe feverish demand for these specialty chips has driven Nvidia's financial results and its stock price into the stratosphere.\nShow me the money\nIn its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), Nvidia generated record revenue of $44 billion, which surged 69% year over year and 12% sequentially. This fueled adjusted earnings per share (EPS) that jumped 27% to $0.76. The headliner was the data center business, which includes processors used for cloud computing, data centers, and AI. Revenue for the segment surged 73% to $39 billion, driven by relentless demand for AI.\nThis could be just the beginning. Big Four accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) estimates the AI market could be worth $15.7 trillion by 2030, with Nvidia being a major beneficiary by supplying the cutting-edge chips that underpin the technology.\nThe path to $6 trillion\nNvidia currently boasts the world's highest market cap for a publicly traded company, at roughly $4.44 trillion (as of this writing). This means its stock price would need to rise 35% to drive its value to $6 trillion. According to Wall Street, Nvidia is poised to generate revenue of more than $201 billion in fiscal 2026 (which began in January), giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 22. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Nvidia would need to increase its revenue to roughly $272 billion annually to support a $6 trillion market cap.\nWall Street forecasts estimate that Nvidia will grow its revenue by 53% this year and 25% next year. If the company can attain those benchmarks, it could reach a $6 trillion market cap as early as 2027.\nBut don't take my word for it. Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah has just issued a Street-high price target of $250 on Nvidia stock, suggesting it could reach a market cap of $6.1 trillion over the next 12 to 18 months. The analyst cited supply chain checks and concluded that hyperscale adoption of generative AI and AI factories could generate spending of $2 trillion by 2028, with Nvidia as a major beneficiary. Given the widespread adoption of AI, I believe Baruah's call is prescient.\nIt's important to remember that these gains won't come in a straight line. A review of Nvidia's charts reveals that the stock price has fallen 25% or more from its peak on at least five separate occasions, and in one case, it plunged 66%.\nOn the other hand, it would be difficult to overstate the company's success. Despite the aforementioned volatility, over the past decade, Nvidia's revenue has grown by 3,735%, while its net income has surged 13,911%. Furthermore, the company's relentless innovation and improving financial performance have fueled a blistering increase in its stock price, which has soared 30,870%.\nNvidia is currently selling for 31 times next year's earnings, which is certainly a premium. However, given its impressive track record, consistent execution, and the significant opportunity represented by AI, I'd argue it's a small price to pay for such a high-quality company.\nDo the experts think Nvidia is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

It's had some impact on demand as people just try and understand what the implications are before they make commitments or bets on inventory.\"\nBlueScope has said it considers itself a net beneficiary of the tariffs because it ships a small amount of steel from Australia to the U.S. relative to what it produces in the United States.\nBut on Monday, Vassella said the coatings business also sources some raw product from Australia and New Zealand, incurring tariffs.\n\"What we're now doing is thinking about alternatives for substrate supply,\" he said, using the term for base material.\nBlueScope's North America division, its biggest earner, posted underlying earnings of A$514.4 million for the year, down 45%, mostly due to lower selling prices.\n\"With impairment of US coated products business (there is) a recognition that there's no quick fix here,\" Citi analysts wrote in a client note.\nNoting that its main U.S. business is starting to see an improvement in profit margins as a result of tariffs driving prices up, the company forecast underlying operating earnings for the first half of 2026 between A$550 million and A$620 million, above last year's A$309 million.\nThe midpoint of the range, however, fell short of a Visible Alpha consensus of A$618 million.\nBlueScope declared a final dividend of 30 Australian cents per share, in line with last year.\n($1 = 1.5352 Australian dollars)\n(Reporting by John Biju in Bengaluru and Byron Kaye in Sydney; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Edwina Gibbs)", "content_hash": "5342fda728ea7c7957fee21ea98b237e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The S&P 500's yield is around 1.2%, near its lowest level in over two decades.\nHowever, several stocks still offer attractive dividend yields. Here are five high-quality dividend stocks with yields well over 5%.\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners\nBrookfield Infrastructure Partners(NYSE: BIP) currently yields around 5.8%, which is higher than the yield of its economically equivalent corporate twin, Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation(NYSE: BIPC), at 4.4%. While both entities provide investors with access to Brookfield's global infrastructure assets, BIP offers a higher payout due to its partnership structure and because it sends investors a Schedule K-1 federal tax form, which can complicate tax returns. BIPC, in contrast, delivers a lower yield but issues a 1099-DIV, a simpler tax report for investors.\nThe global infrastructure operator generates stable cash flow. About 85% of its funds from operations (FFO) comes from long-term contracts or regulated frameworks. Meanwhile, Brookfield pays out a conservative portion of its stable cash flow in dividends (60%-70%). It also has a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\nThose features give it the flexibility to continue investing in growing its business. Brookfield expects to deliver FFO per share growth of 10% or more, fueled by inflation-driven rate increases, expansion projects, and acquisitions. This easily supports its plan to provide annual dividend increases of 5% to 9% over the long term, further extending its 16-year growth streak.\nEPR Properties\nEPR Properties(NYSE: EPR) currently yields 6.7%. The real estate investment trust (REIT) pays its dividends monthly, making it highly attractive for those seeking a lucrative passive income stream.\nThe REIT focuses on investing in experiential real estate such as movie theaters, eat & play venues, attractions, and fitness and wellness properties. It leases these properties back to operating tenants under long-term, primarily triple net agreements (NNN). Those leases provide it with predictable rental income to cover its high-yielding dividend.\nEPR Properties utilizes a combination of excess cash flow generated after paying dividends, noncore property sales, and balance sheet capacity to invest in additional experiential properties. It aims to invest between $200 million and $300 million annually in acquisitions, development projects, and redevelopments. This investment rate should grow its income per share by 3% to 4% annually, supporting a similar dividend growth rate.\nMain Street Capital\nMain Street Capital(NYSE: MAIN) is a business development company (BDC) with a rather unique dividend policy. It pays a monthly dividend set at a sustainable level, allowing investors to receive a recurring income stream they can count on. It has never decreased or suspended this payment. Instead, it has raised it by a cumulative 132% since going public in late 2007. Additionally, Main Street periodically pays a supplemental quarterly dividend. The company's most recent payments gave it a 6.6% yield.\nThe BDC supports its dividend payments with a portfolio of debt and equity investments that generate interest and dividend income. The company sets its monthly dividend below its expected income to enhance durability. It also maintains an investment-grade credit rating. Main Street Capital uses its financial flexibility to make more income-generating investments, enabling it to steadily increase its monthly dividend and provide higher supplemental payments.\nMPLX\nMPLX(NYSE: MPLX) is a master limited partnership (MLP), similar in structure to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners. Like Brookfield, MPLX also sends a Schedule K-1 tax form to its investors, which affects tax reporting. The energy midstream company yields more than 7.5%.\nThe MLP generates stable cash flow backed by long-term contracts and regulated rate structures. MPLX currently produces enough cash to cover its lucrative distribution by 1.5 times. That allows it to retain cash to fund expansion projects while maintaining its strong financial profile. It currently has a 3.1 times leverage ratio, well below the 4.0x range its stable cash flows can support.\nMPLX recently agreed to acquire Northwind Midstream in a $2.4 billion deal and has multiple organic projects slated to start commercial service through the end of the decade. These growth investments should support continued distribution increases, building on its history of annual payout raises since 2012 and a compound annual distribution growth rate above 10% since 2021.\nRealty Income\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) currently yields more than 5.5%. The REIT owns a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate (retail, industrial, gaming, and other properties such as data centers) net leased to many of the world's leading companies. That lease structure provides it with very stable rental income because tenants cover all property operating expenses. The company pays out a conservative portion of its stable income in dividends (around 75% of its adjusted FFO).\nRealty Income has increased its dividend 131 times since its public market listing in 1994 (including the last 111 quarters in a row). That steady growth should continue as the REIT acquires more income-producing real estate. With one of the strongest financial profiles in the industry and $14 trillion of real estate suitable for net leases, Realty Income has plenty of room to continue expanding.\nGreat high-yielding dividend stocks to buy for income\nThese five companies have excellent dividend-paying track records. That's due in part to their stable and growing cash flows, as well as their strong financial profiles. With these strengths, they should be able to continue growing their high-yielding payouts well into the future. If you're looking to boost your income and build a solid foundation for your portfolio, these dividend stocks are great ones to consider buying and holding for the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

This may seem counterintuitive given the 1.2% dividend yield of the S&P 500 and the fact that companies have the right to suspend dividend payments at any time.\nNonetheless, the market offers some safe stocks that yield far more than 1.2%, and often, the condition of some stocks can make cutting dividends a costly move, reducing the likelihood of such an occurrence.\nKnowing those facts, investors tend to seek safe, growing dividends and possibly, some potential for stock price appreciation. While nobody knows what will happen over the next five years, these stocks stand a chance of beating the market while providing significant income.\nTarget\nTarget(NYSE: TGT) operates nearly 2,000 stores across all 50 U.S. states, and over 75% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target store. However, Target has faced struggles with supply chains, tariffs, and alienating customers over its changing position on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). That caused the stock to crater, taking its P/E ratio to 11, far below the S&P 500 average of 30.\nStill, its annual dividend of $4.56 per share gives it a yield of 4.3%. Target's dividend has risen for 54 straight years, making it a Dividend King. Abandoning that streak could harm Target's reputation, so continued payout hikes are likely. That is good news for shareholders since the low valuation and rising dividend are likely to result in market-beating returns over the next five years.\nRealty Income\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) owns over 15,600 single-tenant net leased properties, renting space to many of the best-known consumer-oriented businesses. Also, since tenants pay for maintenance, insurance, and taxes, it tends to produce a steady revenue stream.\nRealty Income bills itself as \"The Monthly Dividend Company,\" offering shareholders a payout every month since it launched its IPO in 1994. That dividend has also risen at least once per year since that time.\nHigh interest rates have weighed on the stock price, but with an annual payout of almost $3.23 per share, it offers a cash return of 5.5%. As interest rates fall, profits should rise, setting the stock up for a likely recovery.\nIBM\nAfter years of stagnation, a hard pivot into artificial intelligence and the cloud seems to have fostered a comeback in International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) stock. Over the last five years, its stock price has nearly doubled.\nEven after struggles in the prior decade, it has maintained a 30-year streak of payout hikes. Its yearly payout of $6.72 amounts to a yield of 2.8%, making it one of the few AI stocks to offer a high-yielding dividend.\nAdmittedly, revenue growth is mired in the single digits, and investors may sour on the stock with its 38 P/E ratio. But with its technology and growth rates improving, the stock could still be a boon for income investors.\nPepsiCo\nIn addition to its flagship cola, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) owns drink brands such as Mountain Dew and Gatorade and food products like Quaker and Frito-Lay. Still, competition and a stronger consumer focus on nutrition and freshness have weighed on the company, and more emphasis on healthy ingredients could raise costs.\nFortunately, PepsiCo has risen 17% from its lows earlier in the summer. Price increases may have also kept its financials from cratering.\nThat may also help preserve the dividend. Its annual payout of $5.69 per share offers a yield of about 3.7%. And a 53-year history of increasing payouts gives PepsiCo Dividend King status, making it likely the payout will continue rising.\nAT&T\nAt first glance, AT&T (NYSE: T) may not look like an excellent income stock. It abandoned a 35-year streak of payout hikes in 2022 as it reeled from costly failed investments in DIRECTV and the former Time Warner.\nHowever, after slashing its payout, it has used the dividend cut and asset sales to pare its debt and refocus on its core wireless and fiber businesses. It benefits from a strong brand, and it faces only two competitors in its core business, bolstering its competitive moat.\nThe 5G stock has more than doubled from its 2023 low, meaning it has moved far past its post-dividend sell-off. Its annual payout has remained at $1.11 per share since the dividend cut, and with improving prospects and a cash return of 3.9%, AT&T is again becoming an attractive choice for dividend-focused investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Target right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Target, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Target wasn’t one of them.

Among the most significant are patent cliffs -- when therapies lose patent exclusivity, inviting cheaper generic or biosimilar competition that erodes their market share. Although these sometimes threaten drugmakers, some can effectively handle the challenge and perform relatively well.\nWith that as a backdrop, let's discuss two pharmaceutical leaders that have faced (or will face) patent expiration for some of their most important products, but should be able to overcome the threat: Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ) and Novartis(NYSE: NVS).\n1. Johnson & Johnson\nIn July 2024, Johnson & Johnson began facing biosimilar competition for Stelara, an immunology medicine and one of its best-selling products, in Europe. The same thing occurred in the U.S. in February of this year. The result is that Stelara's sales are dropping off a cliff. In the second quarter, the medicine generated revenue of $1.7 billion -- a 42.7% decrease from the same period last year.\nStill, Johnson & Johnson continues to post solid financial results. Its top line in the period grew by 5.8% year over year to $23.7 billion. J&J even raised both top- and bottom-line guidance for the year. In other words, the company is performing relatively well, despite the drop in sales for Stelara.\nJ&J has an incredibly diversified business with a long list of medicines in its pharmaceutical segment. Some of its top growth drivers include cancer medicines Darzalex and Erleada, as well as Remicade, which treats several immunology conditions. The company also has newer products in its arsenal: Imaavy for myasthenia gravis (a condition that causes muscle weakness) was approved earlier this year, and it's awaiting word from regulators for TAR-200, a highly promising investigational medicine for bladder cancer.\nFurthermore, Johnson & Johnson is a leading player in the medical device industry. One long-term growth driver for the company could be its robotic-assisted surgery system, the Ottava, which is still undergoing clinical trials in the U.S.\nJ&J can overcome patent cliffs -- and, for that matter, drug-price negotiations that also threaten its business -- through innovation. That's what the company is doing with Stelara, and it can do so in the future.\nFinally, Johnson & Johnson is a terrific dividend stock; it's raised its payouts for 62 consecutive years, making it a Dividend King. The company can handle all the challenges it faces and still deliver solid returns over the long run.\n2. Novartis\nNovartis is gearing up for generic competition for Entresto, a medication for heart failure, later this year in the U.S. Through the first half of the year, this drug generated $4.6 billion in sales, almost 52% of which came from the U.S.\nWith cheaper generics in its single most important market for its best-selling medicine, Novartis might be in trouble -- except it isn't. The drugmaker continues to expect high-single-digit revenue growth for the year, a strong performance for a pharmaceutical giant.\nEven if Entresto's patent cliff has a greater impact on financial results next year, the company should be fine. Novartis has a vast and diversified portfolio of medicines across various therapeutic areas. Many of its products are blockbusters; seven had already generated more than $1 billion in revenue each through the first six months of 2025.\nNovartis also has several newer products that will help drive top-line growth for a long time. For instance, in April the company earned U.S. approval for Vanrafia, a medicine indicated to treat proteinuria (excess protein in urine) in patients with a rare kidney disease called IgA nephropathy. Some analysts estimate that Vanrafia could hit peak sales of $1.5 billion. Novartis' extensive lineup, combined with its continued launches of new products, should help it move beyond Entresto's patent cliff.\nAdditionally, the company is engaged in patent litigation over the legitimacy of generic versions of Entresto. If it ends up winning these battles, it might be owed money from companies that would have launched those generics on the market.\nEven if that doesn't happen, the drugmaker should continue delivering consistent revenue and earnings over the long run, as well as annual dividend increases. The company has raised its payouts for 28 consecutive years. Despite the patent-cliff threat it faces, Novartis remains a top pick for those seeking blue chip dividend stocks.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them.

Each fund may contain dozens or even hundreds of stocks, giving you exposure to entire industries with just one investment.\nWith countless funds to choose from, though, it can be challenging to find the right fit. While everyone's situation is different, there's one investment that famed investor Warren Buffett says is the best choice for most people -- and it could help you build a portfolio worth $1 million or more.\nBuffett's best recommendation\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in 2020, Warren Buffett discussed his outlook on the stock market and why investors shouldn't be afraid to buy. As for where investors should buy, he noted that \"for most people, the best thing to do is to own the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index fund.\"\nAn S&P 500 index fund or ETF is an investment that tracks the S&P 500 itself. Each fund contains stocks from 500 of the largest companies in the U.S., and by owning any S&P 500 fund, you'll instantly own a stake in all 500 of those businesses.\nThis isn't the first time Buffett has recommended an S&P 500-tracking fund, though. In 2008, he made a $1 million bet that an S&P 500 index fund could outperform a selection of five actively managed hedge funds. The S&P 500 fund earned total returns of close to 126% over the following 10 years, while the five hedge funds averaged a return of just 36% in that time.\nNot only can an S&P 500 fund outperform many other investments, but it's also safer in several ways:\n-\nPlenty of diversification limits risk: Investing in a variety of stocks across multiple market sectors can help mitigate risk during a market downturn. Because each S&P 500 index fund contains stocks from 500 companies across all industries, you can achieve loads of diversification with just one investment.\n-\nThe S&P 500 has a flawless track record: While nobody can predict what the market will do in the future, the S&P 500 has recovered from every crash, recession, and bear market it has ever faced. In fact, analysis from Crestmont Research found that every single rolling 20-year period throughout the S&P 500's history has ended in positive total returns. This means that if you'd invested in an S&P 500-tracking fund at any point and held it for 20 years, you'd have made money, regardless of how volatile the market was in that time.\n-\nIt requires minimal effort on your part: ETFs and index funds are passive investments, so you never need to worry about choosing individual stocks. They also perform best when left alone for decades. All you have to do is invest consistently, then let your investment do the rest.", "content_hash": "2a55a57510a60290bda59c55f43be7ff", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

MRVL’s trailing and forward P/E were 22.15 and 27.40, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nCopyright: ralwel / 123RF Stock Photo\nMarvell is currently facing significant setbacks with its high-speed SerDes technology, a critical component in its networking and custom AI chip initiatives, leading to strained relationships with major customers like Microsoft and Amazon. Recent reports from Edgewater Securities and Semianalysis reveal that both Marvell and its competitors have struggled with SerDes performance issues, causing delays such as a second tape-out for the Trn3 ASIC and pushing mass production to the second half of 2026.\nMicrosoft is reportedly reconsidering Marvell as a silicon partner due to underwhelming networking performance, while Amazon is shifting its Trainum 4 AI chip production away from Marvell to alternative suppliers like Alchip and Astera Labs, which use more reliable IP from Synopsys and Cadence.\nMarvell’s internal attempts to hype its XPU and AI socket initiatives have been met with skepticism, as industry insiders claim Marvell is not involved in key emerging AI projects. Despite boasting of numerous ISSCC publications and advanced 5nm SerDes demos, real-world performance has been disappointing—demos have shown high error rates even with aggressive cooling, and comparisons favor competitors like Broadcom, whose SerDes deliver better error correction and reliability. Marvell’s sales and demo tactics, including selective performance metrics and controlled testing environments, have been criticized as misleading.\nWhile some technological advances like dense SRAM and novel power delivery (PIVR) are praised, the overall narrative suggests Marvell is struggling to deliver the promised value in its cutting-edge chip segments. The combination of delayed products, technical flaws, and customer defections casts a shadow over Marvell’s growth prospects and raises questions about its ability to compete against rivals with superior IP and execution.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Marvell Technology, Inc. by Simple Investing in January 2025, which highlighted Marvell’s strong data center growth, custom silicon deals, and positive financial outlook.

It dominates the market, serving 21 of Forbes’ 25 most valuable companies, eight of the Fortune 500’s top ten, and all 15 of the world’s largest banks. Even Apple itself uses JAMF to manage its own devices, underscoring its critical role in the ecosystem. Despite a modest market capitalization of $941 million, JAMF’s tangible assets and cash exceed its liabilities by approximately $969 million, indicating the company is trading below its intrinsic value.\nThis undervaluation is notable given its robust fundamentals and growth prospects.

The company boasts a strong gross margin of 79%, which is expected to improve further following a planned 6.4% workforce reduction aimed at cost-cutting and profit enhancement. Management’s confidence is evident, having pre-announced that Q2 2025 results will surpass the highest end of guidance, a rare and optimistic signal ahead of earnings. With Apple’s increasing enterprise presence expanding JAMF’s addressable market, the company is positioned for sustained growth.\nAlthough past profitability has been limited due to upfront software development and marketing expenses, JAMF’s improving financial discipline and market leadership present a compelling risk/reward opportunity.

BAK’s trailing and forward P/E were 8.44 and 9.78, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nPressmaster/Shutterstock.com\nBraskem presents a compelling “cycle + overhang” investment opportunity at fire-sale levels, offering significant upside if polyolefin spreads mean-revert or if there is binding environmental clarity or credible strategic interest. The company’s mid-cycle EBITDA is estimated at $1.9–$2.0 billion, supported by normalized polyolefin spreads and utilization rates, implying an enterprise value of roughly $11.4–$12.0 billion at a 6x multiple.\nWith adjusted net debt around $8.7 billion, this translates into an equity value of $2.7–$3.3 billion, or approximately $6.7–$8.2 per ADR, compared to current prices near $3. Braskem’s earnings are highly sensitive to polyolefin spread changes, with every $50/ton increase potentially adding $450–$500 million in EBITDA, translating to a material EV and share price uplift. Two main catalysts could unlock value: binding environmental resolution that limits cash outflows related to the Alagoas disaster, and a strategic sale or stake transaction that could reset earnings expectations and valuation multiples.\nWhile Brazil’s import tariff increases on chemicals provide some tailwind, the thesis does not rely on this. The downside scenario assumes prolonged weak spreads and higher-than-expected environmental liabilities, potentially pushing equity values toward $2.0–$2.5 per ADR, whereas a bull case with faster normalization and a binding cap could push values above $11 per ADR, though governance and country risk temper this upside.\nKey triggers include sustained spread and utilization improvements, environmental settlement clarity, and M&A developments. Risks include prolonged commodity weakness, environmental cost overruns, and liquidity stress. Overall, Braskem is a through-cycle cash generator priced as if recovery is impossible, presenting an attractive risk/reward for disciplined investors prepared to act on validated catalysts.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc.

However, the veteran executive was ousted from National World this year after being defeated in a power struggle with Malcolm Denmark, the Irish newspaper tycoon and racehorse owner. Mr Denmark, who was National World’s largest shareholder, has now taken it private.\nAlongside that row, Mr Montgomery mounted an unsuccessful bid for The Telegraph. He was in discussions with Todd Boehly, the chairman of Chelsea Football Club, over a complex transaction that would have used National World as a vehicle for the deal.\nMr Boehly has experience as an entertainment industry publisher via his shareholding in the company behind The Hollywood Reporter and Rolling Stone.\nMr Montgomery’s presentation claims the backers of his Telegraph bid are ready to help bankroll a takeover of Reach with £250m of equity, alongside £150m of debt. Eldridge Industries, Mr Boehly’s investment firm, was contacted for comment.\nMr Montgomery may also seek to use his own cash following the £65m buyout of National World, which owns The Scotsman and The Yorkshire Post. He held a stake of 7pc, putting him in line for around £4.5m.\nHis latest comeback bid comes at a torrid time for Reach, which has been left chasing dwindling advertising revenues amid a sluggish transition to the digital age.\nThe company last month said it would begin trialling a paywall across its titles amid fears new Google AI tools will dent reader numbers.\nReach has slashed hundreds of jobs in recent years in successive rounds of job cuts that have bruised staff morale. It has also faced criticism for its “clickbait” stories and the deluge of adverts flooding its websites.\nThe company’s share price has declined by more than a third this year, leaving its market value at around £220m – a fraction of its £5bn peak in 2005.\nIn the documents, Mr Montgomery criticises Reach’s “underperforming business”, saying the circulation of its print newspapers – which still account for more than half of overall revenues – was dropping at a faster rate than those of rivals such as the Daily Mail.\nHe also takes aim at Reach bosses, saying the company’s “pattern of decline has not been met with a tactical or creative response” and that acquisitions and pension top-ups worth more than £1bn over the last decade have “all been squandered by lack of any organic plan”.\nJim Mullen, the former gambling executive who oversaw more than 800 job cuts during his tenure, stepped down as chief executive of Reach earlier this year. He was replaced by Piers North, a former journalist who joined the company in 2014.\nMr Montgomery claims his programme of heavy cost-cutting would save £65m per year and help increase profits by 50pc. He outlined plans to boost revenue by transforming Reach into a new digital marketing services giant – a move that he says would generate £200m in new revenues in four years.\nThe strategy also includes a plan to expand Reach’s events offering, based on the Pride of Britain brand, and generate half a million subscribers paying £5.99 a month by the end of 2027.\nMr Montgomery began his career as a journalist and rose to become the editor of the News of the World before leading Mirror Group Newspapers.\nHe established a foothold in UK regional newspapers in 2012 with the establishment of Local World, which he sold to Reach – then known as Trinity Mirror – three years later. Mr Montgomery then formed National World after snapping up titles from collapsed publisher JPI Media.\nReach declined to comment. Mr Montgomery this weekend said there was “nothing to this takeover speculation” and that he remained under contract to National World, and complies with those obligations.", "content_hash": "3c3ae490ea5459f0bbcac18cf5eb3f64", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

While valuations for the market’s largest technology names remain elevated, he noted that earnings growth outside Tesla helped justify the multiples. “MAG-7 year-on-year growth is like 54%,” he said, adding that the pace makes the sector difficult to ignore.\nOn the bond side, Rieder highlighted the appeal of income.\nInvestors can still build portfolios yielding between 6.5% and 7%, a level he described as highly attractive in a world where inflation has drifted below 3% on a core basis. He argued that while the Federal Reserve has room to cut rates — potentially starting as soon as September — current yields already offer investors solid returns.\n'Crazy low' volatility\nRieder also emphasized today’s unusually subdued volatility. He described trading equity volatility, or “vol,” at levels near 9.5 to 10, which he called “crazy low.” Low volatility, he said, makes hedging against downside risk relatively cheap, giving investors what he called an “escape hatch” if conditions sour. “You don’t actually have to take the downside risk,” Rieder said.\nStill, Rieder cautioned that complacency is his biggest concern. With insurance in markets so inexpensive, he sees signs investors may be underestimating risks, particularly in credit spreads and other corners of fixed income.\nFed's interest rate\nOn monetary policy, Rieder argued the Fed’s rate hikes have done little to suppress inflation, given that large corporations rely less on borrowing to finance investment.\nThe real drag, he said, has been on housing activity and lower-income households that depend more heavily on credit. Keeping rates too high, he warned, risks imposing excessive costs on the government and households without meaningful disinflation gains.\nHe believes the central bank could lower the funds rate by as much as 100 basis points over the coming year, a move he sees as unlikely to rekindle inflation given low structural volatility and rising productivity from advances in data, hyperscale computing and even space-related technologies.\n“There’s something spectacular happening around productivity,” he said, calling it a once-in-a-generation dynamic.\nFor crypto investors, Rieder’s comments reinforce a broader narrative: an environment with falling rates, ample liquidity, and low volatility could support renewed appetite for risk assets beyond equities. If his call proves correct, the same technical tailwinds driving stocks higher could spill into digital assets that thrive on excess cash and investor risk-taking.", "content_hash": "3b17f68d48dc91933007b306e1d63eec", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company’s shares fell after first-quarter Vyvgart sales missed high investor expectations, primarily due to seasonal factors like insurance reverification and increased Medicare Part D utilization that led to higher discounts.\nNevertheless, ongoing discussions with management and neurologists affirm Vyvgart’s significant clinical value and its role as a key treatment option. The drug is successfully launching in key indications such as generalized myasthenia gravis and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, showing solid adoption. Furthermore, the company’s pipeline offers promising expansion potential, as evidenced by encouraging Phase 2 data for myositis presented at a major medical conference.\nThis suggests Vyvgart’s efficacy may extend across a broader range of autoantibody-driven autoimmune conditions, supporting a compelling long-term growth outlook. Despite short-term volatility, Argenx’s core asset remains highly differentiated in the autoimmune market, with strong physician support and a growing patient base. The current share price appears to underappreciate the durable demand trajectory and the company’s capacity to capture incremental indications, presenting a compelling risk/reward opportunity for investors focused on innovative biotech with sustainable growth prospects.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Argenx SE by FluentInQuality in May 2025, highlighting Vyvgart’s platform approach, broad autoimmune applications, and durable revenue. Since then, the stock price has appreciated by about 5.13% by May 2025, driven by strong clinical adoption. The thesis remains valid.

CPRT’s trailing and forward P/E were 30.59 and 26.11, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nCopart (CPRT), a global leader in online salvage and resale vehicle auctions, is being initiated at a 2% model portfolio weight as a long-term holding rooted in its durable competitive moat and secular growth tailwinds. Founded in 1982, the Dallas-based company operates a patented online auction platform, a global buyer base spanning 180+ countries, and over 250 storage yards worldwide. Its asset-light, consignment-style model generates high margins (~45–50%) and steady cash flows, with Q3 FY2025 revenue up 7.5% YoY despite flat volumes, underscoring its pricing power.\nCopart benefits from rising total-loss insurance claims, which reached a record 22.8% in early 2025, as complex and costly vehicle repairs make totaling cars more economical. Weather events and high used-car prices further drive salvage supply. The company’s unmatched physical footprint, global marketplace network effects, proprietary technology, and decades-long customer relationships form high barriers to entry that competitors cannot easily replicate.\nIts duopoly position with IAA/Ritchie Bros. provides market stability, while Copart’s superior international reach and auction returns help it gradually win share. Risks—such as lower total-loss frequency from vehicle safety technology, competitive fee pressure, land acquisition constraints, or cyclical volume swings—are viewed as manageable given the moat and diversification.\nWith minimal debt, significant insider ownership, and disciplined reinvestment in land and technology, Copart is positioned to compound earnings and cash flows over the long term. The market underappreciates its resilient volumes, capital efficiency, and defensiveness, making the current price an attractive entry point. Copart offers a rare blend of market dominance, secular growth drivers, and superior economics that support sustained value creation.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Copart, Inc.

Despite near-term concerns around export-control uncertainties and the potential for a capex slowdown in 2025, the company’s long-term growth outlook remains robust. AMAT benefits from strong secular tailwinds, including the rising compute demands driven by artificial intelligence, the increasing adoption of advanced packaging technologies, and the development of new transistor architectures.\nThese technological trends are fueling sustained demand for the company’s core solutions, positioning it to capitalize on evolving industry needs.

CVNA’s trailing and forward P/E were 86.46 and 69.44, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nCopyright: sonyae / 123RF Stock Photo Carvana (CVNA) has surged from near-bankruptcy to a $45+ billion market cap on strong earnings, but its valuation appears disconnected from its fundamentals. Despite being branded as an online used-car dealer, its true profit engine is consumer finance, not vehicle sales. The company originates loans, packages them, and sells them at a premium, with tiny “metal margins” of $400–$500 per car. In 2024, it sold $6.15 billion in loans, generating $541 million in gain-on-sale income, or 26% of gross profit. Most financing flows through Bridgecrest, serving lower-credit borrowers with average FICO scores in the 567–584 range, which allows for higher rates but comes with elevated delinquency risk. Nearly 80% of customers finance through Carvana, with loans often securitized and sold, while retaining roughly 5% exposure. The business model’s fortunes are tied to credit cycles—when credit weakens, loan buyers retreat, volumes collapse, and balance sheet risk rises, as seen in 2021–22. Unlike brick-and-mortar dealers, Carvana cannot fully capture lucrative service, warranty, and insurance revenue streams, which remain a major profit driver for peers trading at far lower multiples. Competitors like AutoNation, with steady profitability and broader revenue streams, are valued at a fraction of Carvana’s market cap. With a price-to-book ratio near 30, investors are paying tech-like multiples for a leveraged finance operation heavily exposed to subprime auto credit and securitization markets. Without a defensible moat, Carvana’s valuation hinges on sustained credit market strength, making the risk/reward profile skewed sharply if macro or credit conditions deteriorate. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Carvana Co. (CVNA) by Investing City in May 2025, highlighting its integrated e-commerce platform and operational efficiencies. The stock has risen about 8.5% since, as optimism outweighed macro risks. The thesis still stands on execution strength. Nick Nemeth shares a contrarian view, focusing on Carvana’s reliance on subprime auto finance and credit cycles. Carvana Co. is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.

It is a trusted source for analysis across areas such as cybersecurity and cloud computing, maintaining a strong market position and consistent cash flow generation.\nRecent weakness in the stock has been driven by market concerns over two primary risks: a potential slowdown in future government IT consulting spending and the longer-term threat of artificial intelligence commoditizing Gartner’s core research and advisory services. The fear is that AI tools could automate and undercut some of the premium advisory work that forms the backbone of the company’s revenue.\nHowever, with the price-to-free cash flow ratio at just over 10, valuation appears compelling relative to its quality and resilience. If the anticipated headwinds from government budget tightening and AI disruption prove less severe than currently feared, Gartner could see a meaningful re-rating. Its entrenched client relationships, high renewal rates, and intellectual property suggest it retains significant competitive advantages that may be difficult for AI to replicate in the near term.\nThis dynamic sets up a potential rebound scenario where the market has over-discounted the risks. Given its stable cash generation and established brand, the current share price may offer an attractive entry point for long-term investors seeking exposure to a technology thought leader at a value-oriented multiple, provided the structural threats remain manageable and cyclical pressures ease.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Gartner, Inc.

Management’s $500M real estate sale claim lacks clarity given limited owned stores, and prior China sourcing commitments have slipped.

Known for its “Modern Alpha” approach—combining alternative indexing with passive efficiency—the firm differentiates itself through innovation, launching first-to-market products like dividend- and earnings-weighted equity ETFs, currency-hedged strategies, and more recently, tokenized assets.\nFinancially, WisdomTree is scaling efficiently, with Q2 2025 revenues up 5% year-over-year to $112.6M, net income up 14% to $24.8M, operating margins above 30%, and record-high AUM driven by $3.5B quarterly net inflows. The company maintains strong gross margins (~81%), robust free cash flow generation, and a history of shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, including a $150M repurchase authorization extended to 2028.\nBeyond core ETFs, WisdomTree is an early mover in regulated digital finance via WisdomTree Prime and Connect, offering tokenized gold, money market funds, and other blockchain-enabled products. This expansion targets long-term opportunities in tokenization, although revenue impact remains nascent and execution risk is high. The company faces challenges from intense ETF fee competition, market-driven AUM volatility, smaller scale versus trillion-dollar peers, and activist shareholder pressure, notably from ETFS Capital, which has pushed for cost control, capital returns, and focus on core strengths.\nLeverage from $520M in convertible notes adds potential dilution risk, though debt levels are manageable. Overall, WisdomTree’s combination of a differentiated product suite, global diversification, margin expansion, and optionality from digital assets positions it for long-term growth, while valuation could benefit from sustained inflows, operational discipline, and successful monetization of new initiatives.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Brookfield Asset Management Ltd.

Following a sharp slowdown in spending after COVID-driven durable goods pull-forward and the housing market freeze from higher rates, Newell rapidly streamlined operations, cutting its portfolio from 80 to 55 brands and reducing SKUs by 80%, focusing on higher-margin categories.\nThis has driven gross margin expansion from 28.3% in Q3 2023 to 34.4%, with EBITDA up 25% year over year despite lower volumes—an impressive feat given the absence of scale benefits. However, algorithms have penalized the stock for declining revenues and goodwill write-downs, missing the underlying improvement in profitability and cash flow. The company remains cash flow positive, is less than 10% exposed to China versus 35% a few years ago, and could benefit from tariffs thanks to diversified global manufacturing.\nManagement guides 2025 EPS of $0.75 on a $5.62 stock, with positive comps unlikely until tariff uncertainty clears. The cyclical recovery is expected when 30-year mortgage rates fall below 5.5%, potentially in 2026 if post-Powell policy shifts to 2.5% benchmark rates, unlocking housing-driven demand. At a normalized 1.0x price-to-sales multiple, NWL could trade at $20–$24 by 2027, depending on revenue recovery to $8–$10 billion.

As a major player in Southeast Asia, Vietnam imports substantial raw materials, primarily from China, Thailand, and the US. Global feed manufacturers are encouraged to explore investment opportunities in this expanding market.\nThe global feed market demand has maintained steady growth in recent years, mainly benefiting from population growth, accelerated urbanization and people's continued growth in animal protein consumption. With the development of the global economy and the improvement of residents' income levels, the consumption of livestock and poultry and aquatic foods such as meat, eggs and aquatic products has continued to rise, directly driving strong demand for feed products. In developing countries, the expansion of livestock and poultry farming has driven the rapid growth of feed demand. For example, China, India, Brazil and Vietnam, as populous and agricultural countries, have rapidly developed their breeding industries, and the demand for compound feed, premixes and other products has increased year by year.\nAs a major agricultural country, Vietnam has seen rapid development in livestock and poultry and aquaculture, driving the continued growth in feed demand. Livestock and poultry feed (especially pigs and poultry) is still the main consumer area, while aquaculture feed is growing faster and has become an emerging force driving market growth. The driving factors for the growth of Vietnam's feed market mainly include Vietnam's population growth and increased protein consumption, the government's vigorous promotion of large-scale and intensive development of the breeding industry, and the expansion of aquaculture and export growth.\nVietnam is an important feed producer in Southeast Asia, and the production capacity of foreign-funded enterprises (such as CP, New Hope, CJ) and local enterprises (such as GreenFeed) is continuing to expand. However, Vietnam's feed industry is heavily dependent on imports of raw materials, such as corn, soybean meal, wheat, fish meal and some feed additives. The import scale is huge. At the same time, due to the rapid growth of market demand, some regions are also facing a situation of insufficient supply of feed and need to rely on imports, especially high-quality feed.\nVietnam's feed imports exceeded US$663 million in 2024, an increase of about 10% year-on-year. According to the publisher's analysis, Vietnam's main sources of feed imports include China, Thailand, the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and the Netherlands, among which China, Thailand and the United States account for more than 50% of the total imports. China is the largest source of imports, accounting for about 31%, Thailand accounts for about 17%, and the United States accounts for about 9%.\nThe publisher predicts that in the future, with the modernization of Vietnam's agriculture, the scale of breeding and the upgrading of residents' consumption, Vietnam's feed market will continue to show a steady expansion trend.\nTopics covered:\nOverview of the Feed Industry in Vietnam\nThe Economic and Policy Environment of Feed Industry in Vietnam\nThe Market Size of Feed Industry in Vietnam (2025-2034)\nAnalysis of Major Feed Industry Manufacturers in Vietnam\nMain Driving Forces and Market Opportunities of Feed Industry in Vietnam\nWhat are the main driving forces, challenges and opportunities of Feed industry in Vietnam during the forecast period of 2025-2034?\nWhich companies are the main players in Vietnam's Feed industry market and what are their competitive advantages?\nWhat is the expected revenue of Vietnam's Feed industry market during the forecast period of 2025-2034?\nWhich part of Vietnam's Feed industry market is expected to dominate the market in 2034?\nWhat are the main disadvantages facing Vietnam's Feed industry?\nHow can foreign capital enter Vietnam's Feed industry?\nKey Attributes:\nKey Topics Covered:\n1 Overview of Vietnam 1.1 Geography of Vietnam 1.2 Demographics of Vietnam 1.3 Economic Condition of Vietnam 1.4 Minimum Wages Standard in Vietnam\n2 Overview of Feed Industry 2.1 Definition and Classification of the Feed Industry 2.1.1 Definition of the Feed Industry 2.1.2 Classification of Feed 2.2 Feed Industry Chain in Vietnam 2.2.1 Upstream: Raw Material Supply 2.2.2 Midstream: Feed Processing 2.2.3 Downstream: Breeding Applications 2.3 The Policy Environment of Feed Industry in Vietnam 2.4 Publisher's recommendations for foreign companies investing in Vietnam's Feed industry\n3 Supply and Demand of Feed Industry in Vietnam 3.1 Supply Analysis 3.1.1 Supply Sources and Production of Feed in Vietnam 3.1.2 Supply Structure of Feed in Vietnam 3.1.3 Factors affecting Feed Production in Vietnam 3.2 Demand Analysis 3.2.1 Market Size of Feed in Vietnam 3.2.2 Analysis of Downstream Application Demand of Feed in Vietnam 3.2.3 Factors affecting Feed Demand in Vietnam\n4 Import and Export of Feed Industry in Vietnam 4.1 Import Situation of Vietnam's Feed Industry 4.2 Export Situation of Vietnam's Feed Industry\n5 Market Competition of Feed Industry in Vietnam 5.1 Entry Barriers to Vietnam's Feed Industry 5.1.1 Technical Barriers 5.1.2 Regulatory Approval Barriers 5.1.3 Capital Investment Barriers 5.2 Competition Structure in Vietnam's Feed Industry\n6.

These funds can be broadly categorised into two main types: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Mutual Funds.\nExchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. They hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to its net asset value, though deviations can occur. ETFs offer liquidity and are typically passively managed, aiming to replicate the performance of a specific index.\nMutual Funds, on the other hand, pool money from many investors to purchase securities. They are managed by professional portfolio managers who actively make investment decisions. Mutual funds are not traded on exchanges and are priced at the end of the trading day.\nBoth types of funds provide investors with the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of retail companies, reducing the risk associated with investing in individual stocks.\nKey retail ETFs to consider\nFor investors looking to gain exposure to the retail sector through ETFs, several options are noteworthy:\n-\nSPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT): This fund tracks the S&P Retail Select Industry Index, providing exposure to a broad range of retail companies. It is known for its equal-weighted approach, ensuring no single company dominates the fund's performance.\n-\nVanEck Retail ETF (RTH): Focusing on large-cap retail companies, RTH offers exposure to well-established retailers. Its portfolio includes companies like Amazon and Walmart, which are significant players in the retail industry.\n-\nProShares Online Retail ETF (ONLN): This fund targets companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenue from online retailing. It provides exposure to the growing e-commerce segment, which has seen significant growth in recent years.\n-\nAmplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY): Similar to ONLN, IBUY focuses on companies with a strong online presence. It includes a mix of traditional retailers with robust online operations and pure-play e-commerce firms.\n-\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Discretionary ETF (RSPD): While not exclusively a retail fund, RSPD includes a significant portion of retail companies within its consumer discretionary sector. Its equal-weighted approach ensures balanced exposure across its holdings.", "content_hash": "906139ad7d2088828e39fd688715626c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Martin Dodd, CEO of Huntswood, warns that firms face two immediate challenges — reconstructing historic customer data and protecting vulnerable borrowers — if they are to deliver a fair, transparent process.\nThe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Wrench v FirstRand Bank Ltd, alongside Johnson v FirstRand and Hopcraft v Close Brothers has reshaped the legal landscape for motor finance. While the Court ruled that car dealers do not owe a fiduciary duty to customers, it upheld the principle that certain commission arrangements — particularly those involving high, undisclosed payments — can render the lender-consumer relationship unfair under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.\nIn response, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced its intention to consult on a redress scheme that could see billions paid out to affected consumers. This process will move quickly with the six-week consultation commencing in October with the intention of redress payments commencing in early 2026. For motor lenders and dealers, this marks a critical juncture — not only in terms of compliance, but in how firms manage legacy data and support vulnerable customers through the claims process.\nOne of the most pressing operational challenges is data retrieval. The proposed redress scheme may cover agreements dating back to 2007, well beyond standard retention periods. Many firms will need to locate and interpret documentation that was never digitised, stored across disparate systems or held by third-party dealer networks. This includes structured data such as loan terms and commission logs, but also unstructured records like scanned contracts, emails and handwritten notes.\nThe ability to reconstruct a clear picture of what was disclosed to the customer — and when — is essential to determining eligibility and calculating redress. Firms must prepare to deploy a combination of forensic data tools to establish as clear a picture as possible of the experience of individual customers at point of sale. The goal is not just to retrieve data, but to do so in a way that is auditable, consistent and defensible under regulatory scrutiny.\nAs we engaged with the various stakeholders — right from lenders to motor dealers, trade bodies and regulators — one of the key challenges noted was the ability to locate and consolidate data — structured and unstructured. This has led us to collaborate with these stakeholders to create an industry-wide data-gathering tool that addresses the challenge by identifying the issue, intelligently identifying and segmenting customers, designing remediation and then properly closing each case.\nEqually important is the need to identify and support vulnerable customers. Many of those affected by historic commission arrangements may be financially unsophisticated, digitally excluded, or experiencing hardship. Our own research indicates that 51% of customers were vulnerable at some point in 2025.\nThe Supreme Court’s judgment in Johnson highlighted how vulnerability can amplify the unfairness of a transaction, particularly when high commissions are not adequately disclosed. As firms prepare for the redress scheme, they must embed vulnerability considerations into every stage of the process — from customer outreach and claims handling to redress calculation and communication. This means training frontline staff to recognise signs of vulnerability, offering alternative channels for engagement (such as phone or in-person support), and ensuring that communications are clear, empathetic and jargon-free. It also means putting in place governance structures that allow for case-by-case discretion, especially where data gaps or customer circumstances require a more nuanced approach.\nRecognising the challenges posed in treating vulnerable customers fairly, one of the approaches we have seen work internally is setting up new systems to manage this. For example, introducing mandatory 'how to identify and manage vulnerability' measures has delivered promising results, not just across our complaints & remediation and redress teams, but more broadly in our customer operations teams. This is something we would encourage firms to consider if they are not doing so already.\nUltimately, the redress scheme presents an opportunity for the motor finance industry to demonstrate accountability and rebuild trust. But doing so will require more than technical compliance — it demands a commitment to fairness, transparency, and customer care. Firms that invest early in data readiness and vulnerability support will not only mitigate risk but position themselves as leaders in responsible finance. A properly-run redress scheme also reduced the risk that customers will turn to claims management companies, who can take up to 30% of their claim in fees.\nOur experience is that motor finance firms have done exceptional work in preparing for this, and want to do the right thing to help affected customers. As the FCA prepares to publish its consultation in October, now is the time for lenders and dealers to take stock of their data estates, review their customer engagement strategies and ensure they are ready to meet both the letter and the spirit of the regulator’s expectations.\n\"Countdown to FCA’s motor finance redress has begun\" was originally created and published by Motor Finance Online, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Retailers typically import seasonal goods in advance because many products need six-month lead times.\n\"We're going to have a lower supply year,\" said Chris Butler, CEO of National Tree Company, a New Jersey-based artificial tree importer supplying Walmart, Home Depot, Lowe's and Amazon.\nThe company, which sources roughly half its trees from China and the rest from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, will hike prices by 10% to 20% on its Carolina pine, Nordic spruce, and Dunhill fir trees, Butler said.\nChina is the biggest exporter of Christmas decorations to the U.S., accounting for 87% of such imports last year, worth roughly $4 billion, according to United States International Trade Commission data.\n\"We're not overbuying (from our suppliers) because we're not sure about consumer demand and don't want expensive inventory on our books,\" Butler said.\nBig retailers are more keen than usual to have National Tree ship directly to consumers rather than buying them as inventory, reducing the stores' risk on their balance sheets.\nButler's rival, Mac Harman, CEO of California-based Balsam Hill, expects about 15% fewer trees in the market this season. \"Even with the extended 90 days, it's too late for any of us to add orders,\" he said.\nRetailers started cutting orders after U.S. President Donald Trump flip-flopped on China tariffs - raising them to 145% in April, then cutting them to 30% a month later - because they are unwilling to buy trees at elevated prices, said Harman. He sources trees from around 80 suppliers, half of which are in China.\nStill, the latest pause has netted Balsam Hill some $2.5 million in savings, he said.\nA Walmart spokesperson said the company was confident in its inventory position heading into the holiday.\nHome Depot and Amazon declined to comment, while Lowe's did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.", "content_hash": "e43416284c68655fdb18556a04cb147d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

She retired at 62 and is already collecting Social Security. I plan to retire at the end of this year at 67. We only have approximately $150,000 in a 401(k) account together and we will get approximately $6,500 in Social Security per month when we retire. We only have a mortgage, which we are actively trying to pay off. My house is worth between $650,000 and $700,000. Can we retire?\n– Tim\nWhether you can retire comfortably will largely depend on your spending needs. While I don't know how much you plan to spend in retirement, I can help you frame the question so you can get a clearer sense of where you stand.\nIf you have similar questions about retirement or need help managing your investment portfolio, consider working with a financial advisor.\nWhat Are Your Spending Needs?\nIf you don't already have a good idea of your budget, start by tracking your expenses for a few months. From there, add or subtract items that you know will change when you retire. For example, you may be paying for some work-related expenses or have costs related to your daily work commute that will decrease when you retire. You don't need an exact figure as long as you're confident your estimate is reasonably accurate.\nBecause your income tax liability will likely change, I wouldn't factor that in here. If your mortgage will be paid off, you can exclude the principal and interest portion of your payment, but you will likely want to keep property taxes and insurance in your estimate.\n(And if you’re struggling to estimate your income needs in retirement, speak with a financial advisor to see how they can help.)\nWill Your Retirement Income Cover Your Expenses?\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\nNext, you'll need to compare your estimated retirement budget against your sources of income. In your case, that's your Social Security benefits and whatever withdrawals you take from your 401(k).\nHowever, there are several things to think about when taking withdrawals from your 401(k). In addition to how much you want to withdraw, you should also have a plan forhow you will withdraw that money.\nThere are many withdrawal strategies available, each with its own benefits and risks. These are worth exploring, but for simplicity’s sake let's assume you use the standard 4% rule. This would allow you to withdraw $6,000 in your first year of retirement and then adjust your withdrawals for inflation each year after that. For example, if inflation was 3%, you would increase your withdrawal the following year to $6,180.\nThen, add your Social Security benefits. Let's use your figure of $6,500 per month. That's $78,000 per year added to your $6,000 withdrawal, giving you a first-year gross income of $84,000. (And if you need additional help mapping out your retirement income sources, consider working with a financial advisor.)\nPlanning for Income Tax\nFortunately, not all of the $84,000 will be subject to income tax. Your 401(k) withdrawals would be taxable, but only a portion of your Social Security benefit will be. The formula is a bit complicated, but if your \"combined income\" is below $32,000 in 2025, none of your benefits would be taxable. (This assumes you and your wife file your taxes jointly.) Combined income is defined as half of your Social Security benefit plus your adjusted gross income (AGI) and tax-exempt interest.\nIf your combined income is between $32,000 and $44,000, up to 50% of the portion over $32,000 is taxable. Above $44,000, as much as 85% of the excess is taxable. In your case, assuming only the income we've discussed, about $9,400 of your Social Security would be taxable ($6,000 + $42,000 = $48,000 in combined income).\nIn this scenario, that gives you a total taxable income of $15,400: $9,400 from Social Security plus $6,000 from your 401(k). That is well below the standard deduction, which rose to $31,500 for married couples after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This means you would owe no federal income tax, though you'll need to estimate your state income tax as well if your state levies one.\n(Taxes play a key role in retirement planning, and a financial advisor can help you navigate them. Match with an advisor for free.)\nRetirement Income vs. Retirement Budget\nNow it's just a matter of comparing your net income against your estimated budget. If $84,000 per year would cover your expenses and still leave you with a comfortable buffer, you're likely in a good position. If not, you may want to adjust your plan accordingly.\nOther Considerations\nWhether the above leaves you feeling prepared or like you're falling short, here are some things you may want to consider:\nSocial Security: This will likely provide the bulk of your income in retirement. I'd give some serious thought to making sure you were making the best possible filing choices. Delaying past full retirement age would allow you to increase your benefit by 8% per year. This isn't the best choice for everyone, but I'd explore it if you haven't already.\nHealthcare costs: Unplanned medical expenses and long-term care needs can be a major risk factor in retirement. Knowing how you plan to address these ahead of time can reduce their impact. That could be by purchasing long-term care insurance or setting aside savings specifically for that purpose.\nHome equity: If you plan to own your home outright soon, I think it makes sense to understand how that may help you in retirement. Even if you don't plan to tap into it, it would be worth knowing how you might be able to use your home equity if the need arose.\nRoth conversions: Given your low expected tax liability, carefully consider Roth conversions.\n(A financial advisor may help you with these considerations and potentially find gaps in your retirement plan.)\nBottom Line\nDepending on your spending needs, you may or may not be able to retire with the income sources you mentioned. Comparing your estimated budget with your expected net retirement income will help you decide if you are truly prepared.\nRetirement Planning Tips\nA financial advisor can help you build a tailored retirement plan, adjust it over time, and make informed decisions about withdrawals, taxes and investments.

Ramit Sethi shares the truth about renting\nFor many people, buying a home is part of the American dream. But is it always the best path? If you're tired of \"throwing money away\" on rent and considering buying, it's important to take the time to ensure it makes sense for your situation — both financially and emotionally.\nRamit Sethi, the author of the New York Times bestseller I Will Teach You to Be Rich and host of a popular podcast by the same name, recently spoke with a couple who bought a home in Arizona after their rent increased, and they discovered it may have been the smartest financial move.\nWhat started as an effort to escape rising housing costs quickly turned into a financial strain, one that, Sethi argues, could have been avoided with a more thoughtful approach. The couple now finds themselves paying more for a mortgage than they would have if they'd stayed in their rental. And they're far from alone.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n-\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n-\nWant an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nIs it always worth it to buy a house versus renting?\nIn the “We bought a house…to avoid a rent hike. Big mistake” episode of the Money for Couples podcast, a couple explains that they purchased a home in Arizona in 2022 because their rent had been rising.\nThey had started out paying $1,300, which increased to $1,800. Their landlord then wanted to raise it again to around $2,400, so they decided to buy instead of putting their money \"toward nothing.\"\nToday, their monthly housing costs, including mortgage and HOA fees, total around $2,700 — $300 higher than if they'd stayed in the rental. And that's without factoring in long-term maintenance costs, which in a place such as Arizona can be steep if the air conditioning goes out.\n“You were afraid of a rent increase, but now you’re paying more,” Sethi tells them bluntly. “Rent is not throwing money away. It’s a financial and lifestyle decision,” he explains. “You can throw money away on interest, too.”\nAccording to Sethi, the notion that renting is \"throwing away money\" is one of the biggest financial myths in America. He compares it to buying a car or subscribing to a service — rent is simply paying for a place to live.\nSethi's larger point is that renting isn't failure, it's a valid choice for many people, especially when home prices are high and inventory is tight. In fact, according to USA Today, the monthly cost of renting across all 50 of the largest metro statistical areas was 37% cheaper than buying a typical home in 2024.", "content_hash": "8bdeb4ab3a6980f41c89c888207322ac", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

There’s a wide gap between different age groups and even seniors who are approaching retirement are struggling to meet conventional targets.\nIn other words, if you think you’re falling behind you’re probably not alone. The other piece of bad news is that hardship withdrawal activity increased, as 4.8% of participants initiated one, up from 3.6% in 2023.\nHere’s a closer look at this snapshot to help you benchmark your own savings progress.\nYounger Americans (under 44)\nUnsurprisingly, the youngest Americans have the smallest average account balances, according to Vanguard’s report.\nParticipants between the ages of 25 and 34 had an average balance of just $42,640 while those aged 35-44 had an average balance of $103,552. Median balances were even lower, at $16,255 and $39,958, respectively for these cohorts.\nThese numbers barely cover a single year’s worth of living expenses, let alone a full retirement. However, younger Americans haven’t had the luxury of time to build up savings, benefit from compounding growth in assets and boost their earnings with relevant skills and experience.\nNevertheless, if you’re between the ages 35 and 44 and already have more than $40,000 in your 401(k) plan, you’re doing better than at least half the people your age with such retirement accounts.\nFinding ways to save extra money in your monthly budget isn’t easy, but there is a way to make even your spare charge go farther. Make the most of every dollar you spend with Acorns, a popular app that automatically invests your spare change.\nSigning up for Acorns takes just minutes: link your cards, and Acorns will round up each purchase to the nearest dollar, investing the difference — your spare change — into a diversified portfolio.\nWith Acorns, you can invest in low-cost ETFs with as little as $5 — and, if you sign up today and set up a recurring deposit, Acorns will add a $20 bonus to help you begin your investment journey.\nMiddle-aged Americans (44-64)\nYour 40s and 50s are the best years to boost your retirement savings. By this age, you’ve probably established a successful career, which allows you to generate excess income. You’ve also had plenty of time to invest this excess cash in assets that appreciate or generate income over decades.\nUnfortunately, most middle-aged Americans seem to be struggling to take advantage of this window of opportunity. Americans aged 45 to 54 have an average balance of $188,643, but the median savings is just $67,796 — highlighting a sharp gap in retirement readiness.\nFor those between 55 and 64, the average rises to $271,320, yet the median remains a modest $95,642, underscoring that even those closest to retirement are often underprepared.\nIf you’re under the age of 64 and have around $300,000, for instance, you’re probably outperforming most of your peers. But that doesn’t mean you’re prepared for retirement.\nBased on the 4% rule, you could safely withdraw just $12,000 a year from this nest egg, which is woefully inadequate for any comfortable retirement.\nMeanwhile, the “magic number” for a comfortable retirement sits at roughly $1.26 million as of 2025, according to a Northwestern Mutual study.\nIf you’re simply relying on your 401(k) or IRA to help you save for retirement, you’re missing out on diversifying your investments and also on benefitting from the potential growth from other high-value investment types. You can boost your retirement savings by investing in alternative assets like real estate.\nFirst National Realty Partners (FNRP)](https://moneywise.com/c/1/227/1177?placement=3) is ideally situated to help you take advantage of the opportunities in this sector. FNRP allows accredited individual investors to access institutional-quality commercial real estate investments — without the leg work of finding deals yourself.\nProviding a white-glove service for investors, the FNRP team takes on the job of finding and managing property deals, while investors can engage with experts, explore available deals and easily make an allocation, all in one personalized portal.\nYou can even invest through a Roth IRA — meaning, you’ll receive tax-free payments and distributions that won’t be added to your combined income calculation.\nAnother way to invest in real estate is with Homeshares. While the $36 trillion home equity market has historically been the exclusive playground of large institutions, Homeshares is changing the game by allowing accredited investors to gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.\nHomeshares’ U.S. home equity fund focuses on houses with substantial equity, using Home Equity Agreements (HEAs) to help homeowners access liquidity without incurring debt or additional interest payments.\nWith a minimum investment of $25,000, this approach provides a hands-off way to invest in high-quality residential properties with the added benefit of diversification across regional markets.\nFinally, you can consider diversifying your investment portfolio with commodities, including gold.\nPriority Gold is an industry leader in precious metals, offering physical delivery of gold and silver. Plus, they have an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and a 5-star rating from Trust Link.\nYou can download their free 2025 gold investor bundle to help you understand more about this high-performing asset, which often remains steady when the stock market sinks.\nPlus, if you’d like to convert an existing IRA into a gold IRA, Priority Gold offers 100% free rollover, as well as free shipping, and free storage for up to five years. Qualifying purchases will also receive up to $10,000 in free silver.\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market? Gain potential quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire. Here’s how to get started with as little as $10\nRetired or near retirement (over 65)\nGiven that the average age of retirement in the U.S. is 62, according to a 2024 Mass Mutual survey, we can assume most Americans over the age of 65 are already retired or within striking distance of it. Many have probably begun withdrawing money from their retirement nest egg.\nThe average 401(k) balance for someone over the age of 65 is just $299,442, barely higher than the 55-64 age cohort. Median balance is $95,425, slightly lower than the 55-64 age cohort.\nTo be fair, many retired Americans may have financial assets beyond their 401(k) plan and real estate which they could rely on to sustain their living expenses. But 40% of baby boomers believe it is likely that they could outlive all their savings, according to Northwestern Mutual.\nPut simply, a significant number of seniors could be in an unsustainable retirement.\nTo ensure this won’t happen to you, consider speaking to a financial advisor so that you can feel confident in your withdrawal strategy, and that your investment mix is risk-balanced and properly diversified.\nAdvisor.com is an online platform that connects you with vetted financial advisors. Just answer a few quick questions about yourself and your finances, and the platform will match you with experienced financial professionals best suited to help you develop a plan to achieve your retirement goals.\nYou can view the advisors’ profiles, read past client reviews, and schedule an initial consultation for free with no obligation to hire.\nHow do you get ahead of the pack?\nThe first step is understanding how much you should have saved by a certain age.\nT. Rowe Price published retirement savings benchmarks to aim for depending on age. For example, at age 50, the analysts recommend you should have 4.5x to 8x of your salary saved today.\nKeep in mind these are simply guidelines and most Americans will fail to achieve these goals. The best thing you can do for yourself is start investing early and shape your strategy based on your risk tolerance and investing horizon.\nLooking into alternative assets like fine art is one way to help you boost your retirement portfolio. Traditionally, fine art has been out of reach for everyday investors, but now with Masterworks you can access the growth potential of this market.\nFine art has consistently outperformed the stock market in the long-run. In fact, contemporary art outperformed the S&P 500 with a compound annual growth rate of 12.6% between 1995 and 2022, according to a report from Fortune magazine.\nAs such, art can sometimes be used to diversify and potentially safeguard your investments. What’s more, Masterworks investors have realized representative annualized net returns like +17.6%, +17.8%, and +21.5% among assets held for longer than one year.\nWhen you’re young, invest not just in assets that appreciate over time but also skills that advance your career and boost your earnings.\nIf you’re middle-aged, focus on reducing expenses and maximizing savings as much as possible.\nIf you’re older, consider delaying your retirement to add a few more years of employment and savings. You could also consider side hustles and self-employment to boost your earnings in the final stretch of your career. You can also make catch-up contributions to your retirement plan.", "content_hash": "2101bb010b299f0a943b22dc1801795e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It damages growth and enables financial misconduct.\n“There is an important role for regulators to play in tackling these issues. This includes making sure that steps are taken to prevent ‘rolling bad apples’ – people moving from firm to firm without appropriate action being taken or without past serious non-financial misconduct being disclosed.”\nThe report coincides with the FCA's July initiative to consult on new regulations aimed at addressing non-financial misconduct (NFM) within the financial services industry.\nThe proposed framework intends to harmonise conduct standards for both banking and non-banking entities, particularly in relation to serious NFM issues such as bullying, harassment, and violence, which the FCA has classified as matters of regulatory significance.\nBasware CEO Jason Kurtz said: “Organisations tasked with upholding industry standards cannot afford to compromise when it comes to dealing with incidents of misconduct.\n“With rising levels of financial crime, fraud, and risks, enforcing the highest standards of compliance is now a top priority, for watchdogs and businesses alike.”\nBasware provides financial technology solutions that give finance teams complete control over their invoices.

Probably. That's one of the hazards of doing a job that I love so much that I'd do it as a hobby anyway ... analyzing investments and making sense of the market. Fortunately, Warren Buffett has once again put me back on the right path. I recently restumbled across one of his less-circulated nuggets of wisdom that hit me like a ton of bricks: \"If a business does well, the stock eventually follows.\"\nIn an instant, a company I've had on my mental radar was ushered to the very top of my watch list. It may soon end up in my portfolio. That's BYD (OTC: BYDDY). Here's why.\nWhat's BYD?\nNever heard of it? You might be more familiar with it than you realize. The company that's now selling more electric vehicles than Tesla? is BYD. It predominantly serves the Chinese market (where it's based) and its neighbors, although it's got a small but growing presence in Europe. Notably, it doesn't sell EVs in North America. Then again, why would it? U.S. drivers appear to be less interested in electric vehicles lately.\nThat's far from being the case in BYD's home market of China, though. While sales of electric vehicles slowed somewhat from June to July, China's Association of Automobile Manufacturers reports 27% year-over-year sales growth for electric vehicles, accounting for 48.7% of all automobile sales. Perhaps more important, BYD continues to dominate this growth. Its 27% share of China's EV sales in July is more than twice the next-nearest Geely.\nAnd for what it's worth, the International Energy Agency believes electric vehicles will make up 80% of China's total vehicle sales by 2030.\nIn short, BYD is doing well. The stock should eventually follow. Not complicated.\nThe kicker\nStill not convinced? This might do the trick. You know who already owns $2.3 billion worth of BYD shares? Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Clearly, he's a believer, too.\nShould you invest $1,000 in BYD Company right now?\nBefore you buy stock in BYD Company, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and BYD Company wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.", "content_hash": "a569b4f691120183316dfc936a1852c6", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

And so that gives us a lot of confidence.\" No pork is on the menu at the Dubai location.\nAnd it’s picking up the pace of new menu offerings, especially in dips.\nThis comes as new fast casual restaurants, from chains like Cava (CAVA) to upstarts with their first stores, sprout up to compete for diners' dollars.\n\"I feel like we're at an inflection point,\" Boatwright said, as consumer uncertainty rises and companies lose pricing power after years of inflation.\n\"It's not new news to anyone that the consumer uncertainty is probably greater this year than it was last year, and it wasn't great last year,\" Boatwright said. \"And so consumers are being very, I guess for lack of a better word, choosy about how they spend their dollars, where they spend their dollars.

Despite the slowdown, there remains a robust pipeline of ongoing and emerging projects across various sectors, including aviation, sport, real estate, public infrastructure and public-private partnerships (PPPs), offering significant opportunities for contractors, consultants and investors.\nEven with the recent dip in contract awards, there is no shortage of work in the Middle East construction sector. The UAE has almost matched its 2024 performance and is now leading the GCC in total project spending.\nKey clients in Saudi Arabia, such as Diriyah Company and Roshn Group, have continued to award contracts, albeit at a slower pace. This reflects a selective, phased approach to project delivery rather than a wholesale retreat from investment.\nSince 2017, the focus of Saudi Arabia’s construction market has been the gigaproject programme. These are a series of very large masterplanned projects that are aimed at modernising the Saudi economy as it seeks to diversify away from oil and gas.\nThere are five official schemes that have officially been given the gigaproject moniker. They are the Neom development in the northwest of the kingdom, which includes the 170km-long The Line; the Red Sea Global tourism focused projects on the west coast; the Diriyah heritage themed development on the outskirts of Riyadh; Qiddiya entertainment city, which includes a Formula 1 racetrack and theme parks to the south west of Riyadh; and the Roshn real estate projects.\nThe focus has now shifted to event driven projects, as well as schemes located in Riyadh. The focus on Riyadh was underscored in mid-July when the Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC) awarded an estimated $800m-$900m contract to build the next phase of the Riyadh Metro project. The Line 2 extension contract was awarded to the Arriyadh New Mobility Consortium, which includes Italy’s WeBuild.\nThe Line 2 extension is 8.4 kilometres (km) long, of which 1.3km is elevated and 7.1km is underground. It includes five stations – two elevated and three underground. The extension adds to the existing Riyadh Metro network, which opened in late 2024. Construction work started on the project, which included six lines with 84 stations in 2013.\nFor events, Saudi Arabia will host five major events over the next decade. The first is football’s AFC Asian Cup in 2027, which will be hosted by venues across the kingdom. Then there is the Asian Winter Games in 2029 at Neom’s Trojena mountain resort. In 2030 there is the World Expo in Riyadh, and in 2034 there is the Fifa 2034 World Cup, which will be hosted by venues across the kingdom, and the Asian Games in 2034, which will be in Riyadh.\nThese events are a key driver for stadium projects and the development of other associated infrastructure. The kingdom's World Cup bid includes plans for 11 new stadiums and 134 training sites across the country.\nThe stadiums include the Mohammed Bin Salman stadium at Qiddiya, for which the construction was awarded to a joint venture of HBK Contracting and Al-Ayuni Investment & Trading in late 2024.\nEarlier in 2024, the Saudi Aramco stadium in Damman was awarded to a joint venture of Besix and Albawani, the Jeddah Central stadium project was awarded to China Railway Construction Corporation and Sama Construction for Trading & Contracting, and the Saudi Binladin Group (SBG) was awarded the contract to expand and upgrade Riyadh's King Fahd Stadium.\nOther stadiums are still at the design and tendering stage. The New Murabba stadium, designed by UK-based Arup, is expected to seat 45,000 spectators and host World Cup Round of 32 games. Another major project is the 46,000-capacity National Guard Stadium in southwest Riyadh, with firms currently submitting revised commercial proposals.\nAlongside the World Cup, Saudi Arabia is pushing ahead with preparations for Expo 2030. In June, the Public Investment Fund (PIF) established The Expo Riyadh Company as a subsidiary to manage the delivery of the Expo. In July, it awarded Bechtel the project management consultancy contract for the delivery of the Expo 2030 Riyadh masterplan construction works.\nThe masterplan for Expo 2030 Riyadh encompasses an area of 6 square kilometres, making it one of the largest sites designated for a World Expo event. Situated to the north of the Saudi capital, the site will be located near the future King Salman International airport, providing direct access to various landmarks within the Saudi capital.\nThe construction works required for the Expo are expected to cost $7bn-10bn to complete and tendering for site offices and initial works has already started.\nAnother event focused construction market is Morocco. There has been a surge in construction projects linked to the 2030 World Cup, which it will co-host with Spain and Portugal. The North African country is investing heavily in transport infrastructure, with significant commitments to road, rail and airport upgrades.\nMorocco's $9.5bn investment plan includes the expansion of Mohammed V International Airport and the development of high-speed rail between Kenitra and Marrakech. Stadium construction is also advancing,\nIn June, A joint venture of local contractors Travaux Generaux de Construction de Casablanca (TGCC) and Societe Generale des Travaux du Maroc (SGTM) was awarded the $320m contract for the next stage of construction works for the Grand Stade Hassan II stadium. It is being built on a 100-hectare site in the El-Mansouria area of Benslimane Province, 38 kilometres north of Casablanca.\nSix additional stadiums are undergoing renovation in major cities such as Rabat, Fez and Tangier.\nHospitality and tourism infrastructure are also benefitting. Projects like the St Regis Marrakech Resort and other hotel developments are underway as Morocco positions itself as a destination for 2030 visitors. These works are expected to generate significant construction activity over the coming five years.\nAviation is another major area of focus for the GCC as it seeks to maintain its position as a global aviation hub. Global airlines with vast networked based in the region include Emirates in Dubai, Qatar Airways in Doha, Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi, Gulf Air in Bahrain, Saudia in Jeddah, and the soon to be launched Riyadh Air in Riyadh.\nMuch of the traffic in the region is transit, which means the region needs large efficient hub airports. As passenger numbers continue to increase amid a broad trend of global aviation shifting eastwards, the region needs to continually expand its airport offerings. Over the past decade major airport projects have been completed in Doha, Muscat, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Jedaah and Riyadh.\nMore are planned, and two of the largest aviation projects globally are simultaneously progressing in Riyadh and Dubai. In the Saudi capital, King Salman International Airport is gradually moving forward through a series of tenders, including for terminal construction, runway works, and associated infrastructure. Spanning 57 square kilometres, the airport aims to become the world’s largest in terms of passenger capacity, with a goal of serving 120 million travellers by 2030 and up to 185 million by 2050.\nThe scale of the project is matched by its complexity. A consortium of international firms is involved, including Bechtel and Parsons from the US, and Foster + Partners from the UK, responsible for masterplanning and delivery roles. Work is progressing on multiple components, such as Terminal 6, the Iconic Terminal, and the fourth runway.\nMeanwhile, in Dubai, the Al-Maktoum International Airport (also known as Dubai World Central) is entering a new phase of development. Construction has begun on the second runway, and tenders are out for major packages including terminal substructure and the automated people mover system.\nOnce complete, the airport will cover 70 square kilometres and is intended to replace Dubai International Airport within a decade, with a targeted capacity of 260 million passengers a year.\nDubai’s real estate market remains a key engine of project activity. Over the past four years there has been a strong surge in property sales and prices. After an initial period when developers focused almost exclusively on villas, attentions are now turning to other real estate asset classes.\nIn recent months there has been a flurry of high-rise and supertall tower launches in recent months, including Avior by Acube, Deyaar's Downtown Residences, Meraas's Jumeirah Residences Emirates Towers, Aldar's Nebula Tower, and Omniyat’s Lumena.\nWhile none of these towers are planned to eclipse the Burj Khalifa as the world’s tallest, they do underscore both the appetite for luxury developments and the challenges that come with them. Specialist contractors are in demand, and the complexity of building tall introduces risks related to delivery, cost management and market conditions.\nFitch Ratings has warned of a potential correction in residential property prices, which could impact the viability of speculative schemes. Nevertheless, Dubai continues to attract foreign investment and maintain momentum, particularly in prime real estate segments. Developers are betting on sustained demand from high-net-worth individuals and the continued expansion of the city as a global lifestyle and business hub.\nOne potential challenge to Dubai’s lifestyle offering. Over the past four years the city has been crippled by gridlock during peak hours, and the emirate has embarked on a wide range of projects that seek to address this problem.\nThe largest project is the Blue Line extension to the Dubai Metro network. The line will have 14 stations, seven of which will be elevated. There will be five underground stations, including one interchange station, and two elevated transfer stations connected to the existing stations. In December last year, the Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority awarded a $5.5bn contract for all civil works, electromechanical works, rolling stock and rail systems. The winning contractor is a consortium of Limak Holding, Mapa Group and China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation (CRRC).\nAnother metro line is also planned. In June, consultants submitted bids for design and engineering works for the Gold Line, which will connect old areas in Bur Dubai with the newer housing developments in Dubailand.\nRoad projects have also been launched. The most recent contract award came in July, when China State Construction Engineering Corporation was awarded the contract to upgrade Umm Suqeim Road from its intersection with Jumeirah Street to Al-Khail Road. As of mid-July, there had been nearly $1.5bn of road construction projects awarded by the RTA over the past year.\nAs public finances come under pressure, there is a renewed push for private sector participation in infrastructure through PPP models. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, and Jordan are among the countries advancing PPP schemes across sectors.\nIn Saudi Arabia, PPP awards reached a record $28.2bn in 2023, and while this fell to 18.3 per cent of total project awards in 2024, it still marks a significant shift from earlier years.\nPower generation remains a key area of success for PPPs, with an established track record since the 1990s. Initially used for hydrocarbon fired power plants, the model is now used extensively for renewables, which are also backed by power purchase agreements (PPAs) with state off-takers.\nThe most recent PPAs were signed in July, when a consortium of Acwa Power, Water & Electricity Holding Company (Badeel) and Saudi Aramco Power Company (Sapco) has signed power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Saudi Power Procurement Company (SPPC) for seven renewable energy projects that will require $8.3bn of investment.\nThe projects, which have a total capacity of 15,000MW, include five large-scale solar photovoltaic plants with a total capacity of 12,000MW and two large-scale wind energy plants with a total capacity of 3,000MW.\nOutside of power, schemes include the One-Stop Station programme for roadside facilities and worker accommodation PPPs linked to mining projects.\nAbu Dhabi is also prioritising PPP delivery, with the Abu Dhabi Projects & Infrastructure Centre partnering with Plenary Group to identify and develop schemes. The student accommodation project at Khalifa University and the Zayed Schools PPP are notable examples.\nElsewhere, Iraq has launched its first airport PPP, tendering the expansion of Baghdad International Airport, while Jordan is moving ahead with school, road, and light rail schemes as part of its Economic Modernisation Vision.\nAlthough many PPP projects are planned. Their success is not guaranteed. While momentum is building for project outside of the power and water sectors, some planned projects have made either slow or little progress in recent year. One such project is the Bahrain Metro scheme, which was launched in 2021, and bidding consortiums were prequalified in 2023. Since then, there has been little progress on the project as the authorities review other transport solutions for Bahrain.\nDespite a subdued start to 2025, the Middle East construction sector remains active, albeit with more measured and strategic project planning. The shift away from blanket capital expenditure toward prioritised delivery, and the increasing role of PPPs, reflects the new market realities for the coming years.\nDelivery is now the main priority. With fixed deadlines for event-driven projects like the World Cup and Expo 2030 on the horizon, and with major transport and real estate schemes underway, the region is still home to some of the world’s most ambitious construction projects.\nAs these projects move into construction, delivering these projects within increasingly tightened cost constraints will be the key determinant of project success over the coming years.\n\"Middle East still offers large scale construction opportunities\" was originally created and published by World Construction Network, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Raghavan himself was paid $22.6 million last year in total compensation, including salary, bonus and stock awards.\n\"His decision to join Citi reflects our ability to attract the best talent to our firm and I look forward to seeing our Banking franchise flourish,\" Fraser said in a social media post on the day he joined.\nSince joining Citi in June 2024, Raghavan, known as Vis, has recruited about 15 senior executives from competitors, most of them from JPMorgan, but also from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Ares Management and HSBC in recent months, Reuters previously reported.\nThe bank announced last week that Amit Nayyar will become co-head in tech investment banking for Europe, Middle East and Africa. Other big hires were two new co-heads of M&A, Guillermo Baygual and Drago Rajkovic, as well as Pankaj Goel, co-head for technology investment banking. All are joining Citi from JPMorgan.\n\"Investment banking is a relationship-intense business, so people make a difference,\" Barclays bank analyst Jason Goldberg said.\nRaghavan has surprised some people at Citi by telling investment bankers to collaborate across divisions to generate more revenue, said two executives who declined to be identified. That type of cooperation is rare in the highly competitive world of investment banking, where client relationships - and the fees generated by them - are closely guarded.\nInvestment bankers meeting clients to discuss M&A or other transactions such as IPOs are expected to introduce clients to executives from other units, including wealth banking and executives at the services division, which caters to 5,000 large corporations worldwide. It also happens the other way around, with services executives making introductions to investment bankers.\nCiti got fifth place in the global investment banking revenue ranking this year, with a 5% market share, 0.5 percentage point above last year, according to Dealogic.\nThe best results came from M&A bankers, which pushed Citi to fourth place in overall global rankings this year, up from seventh last year. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were ranked first through third, respectively, Dealogic data showed.\nThe banking division had the highest growth of all Citi businesses this quarter, up 23% from a year earlier.\nWhile Citi had a role in seven of the 10 largest fee-paying deals this year, it still needs to report several more strong quarters to establish a solid growth trend, Goldberg said.\n\"M&A has become a huge priority,\" adding momentum to the gains in investment banking, said one of Citi's recent hires, who declined to be identified while discussing strategy at his new employer.\nOne of the key challenges, according to bank analysts, is to increase Citi's presence in deals led by private equity firms, where the bank is lagging.\nThe move to broaden Citi's client relationships among the different divisions fits in with Fraser's sweeping turnaround strategy set forth two years ago. She removed management layers, laid off thousands of employees and streamlined the bank's structure into five businesses.\n\"Citi has been losing market share in investment banking for 25 years,\" Wells Fargo bank analyst Mike Mayo said. \"Now Raghavan has a clear mandate to increase market share and returns at the banking division.\"\nThe executive will face some challenges ahead. Although the share in M&A deals increased, Citi has kept stable market share in equity and debt capital market deals. The bank lost ground in loan revenue, coming in at seventh place in the ranking this year, down from sixth in 2024, according to Dealogic.\nMayo has been bullish on Citi stock for a while and said a conversation he recently had with Fraser made him believe the heads of businesses are now held accountable for increasing returns. Fraser set a target of 10% to 11% return on tangible equity to be met in 2026.\nThe lender is still working to fix regulatory punishments dating back to 2020 to improve its risk management and data governance. It was fined $136 million last year by regulators for failing to fix widespread and longstanding deficiencies in its data management.\nSENIOR HIRES BY CITIGROUP'S BANKING DIVISION\nEXECUTIVE TITLE FORMER DATE\nEMPLOYER ANNOUNCED\nAmit Nayyar Co-Head of UK, Europe JPMorgan 08.13.2025\nand MEA Tech\ninvestment Banking\nAashish Dhakad Head of North America Ares 08.13.2025\nPrivate Credit Management\nOrigination\nGuillermo Co-head of M&A JPMorgan 08.07.2025\nBaygual\nPankaj Goel Co-head, tech JPMorgan 07.29.2025\ninvestment banking\nBernal J (BJ) Head, North America JPMorgan 07.21.2025\nVargas Equity Capital\nMarkets\nDavid Friedland Co-head, North Goldman, 07.17.2025\nAmerica Investment Sachs\nBanking\nAlok Gupte Co-head of global JPMorgan 07.16.2025\nequity capital\nmarkets\nAlex Watkins Head of technology JPMorgan 07.16.2025\nfinancing\nJames Head of equity Morgan 06.20.2025\nManson-Bahr capital markets- Stanley\nEurope, UK and MEA\nDrago Rajkovic Co-head of M&A JPMorgan 06.20.2025\nEd Sankey Head of equity HSBC 05.21.2025\ncapital markets-\nEurope, UK, Middle\nEast, Africa, Japan,\nAsia North, South\nAsia and Australia\nAchintya Mangla Head of financing for JPMorgan 07.03.2024\ninvestment banking\n(Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer; Additional reporting by Saeed Azhar: Editing by Lananh Nguyen and Mark Porter)", "content_hash": "277cd0ef16f19ce8bb98cbcceb0c07a2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The technology is like something out of a sci-fi novel and could massively advance computing in ways we don't even quite understand yet. It's a technology with true revolutionary power.\nInvestors interested in this sector may be getting ahead of themselves. While some are betting the widespread commercialization of the technology is just a few years away, there's good reason to think it could be much longer before that happens.\nAlphabet has been working on quantum for years\nBefore quantum computing grabbed headlines, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) was already investing heavily in the field. It has poured a sizable portion of its massive R&D budget and top-tier talent into the effort, leading to milestones like reaching \"quantum supremacy\" -- beating a classical computer in a highly limited task -- in 2019. This is exactly where Alphabet excels -- transforming revolutionary science into revolutionary technology.\nAlphabet has resources few can match\nOnly Microsoft and, to a lesser extent, IBM, can match Alphabet's R&D firepower, both from a financial and personnel perspective. At any point, the company could direct the full weight of its R&D budget toward quantum -- tens of billions of dollars. And when the time comes to commercialize the technology, Alphabet can quickly and readily deploy it through its existing cloud infrastructure.\nAlphabet gives you much of the upside with almost none of the risks\nIf the technology takes five, 10, or more years to reach its potential, Alphabet's steady cash flows mean it never has to worry about where it will find its next six months of funding. That's certainly not true for IonQ, Rigetti, and companies like them. And in the meantime, with Alphabet, you get a mature, highly successful tech company at the forefront of artificial intelligence and a stock that trades at a discount to many of its big tech peers.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Proceeds will go toward general corporate purposes, which may include debt repayment.\nEli Lilly’s offering comes amid a dearth of supply of long-dated corporate bonds. Just 11% of high-grade debt sold this year had a maturity of 30 years or more, down from 15% in 2024, as companies have been reticent to lock in elevated borrowing costs for long periods of time.\nThe firm was one of nine borrowers in the US high-grade market on Monday, with McDonald’s Corp., Marriott International Inc. and Charter Communications Inc. among the others.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected the sentiment score to improve to 34.\nNAHB's measure of current sales conditions declined, and an index tracking future sales expectations was unchanged. Buyer foot traffic, though, edged up to its highest level since May, though it remains at a low level. On a regional basis, sentiment among builders in the Northeast skidded to its lowest level since January 2023, while it was unchanged in the South and Midwest and modestly improved in the West.\n\"Affordability continues to be the top challenge for the housing market and buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to drop to move forward,\" said NAHB Chairman Buddy Hughes, a home builder and developer from Lexington, North Carolina. \"Builders are also grappling with supply-side headwinds, including ongoing frustrations with regulatory policies connected to developing land and building homes.\"\nMortgage interest rates have shown recent signs of easing amid expectations the Federal Reserve will resume its interest rate cuts at a policy meeting next month. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most common U.S. home loan, slipped to 6.58% last week, the lowest level since last October, according to data from Freddie Mac. Rates have fallen nearly half a percentage point since the start of the year.\n\"Given a slowing housing market and other recent economic data, the Fed's monetary policy committee should return to lowering the federal funds rate, which will reduce financing costs for housing construction and indirectly help mortgage interest rates,\" NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz said.\nThe use of price and other incentives remains high, with 37% of builders cutting prices - by an average of 5% - while 66% offered some form of sales incentive, the highest percentage in the post-COVID-19 era.\nOn Tuesday the Census Bureau is due to report data for July on ground-breaking volumes and building permit filings for new homes, both of which remain depressed. In June, single-family housing starts fell to an 11-month low and permits for new homes plunged to the lowest level in more than two years.

It’s about pushing past the predictable stall-out that hits most carriers somewhere between survival and sustainability. That moment when you’re running thousands of miles, grossing big numbers, but seeing almost none of it stick. That’s the plateau. And in 2025, it’s more punishing than ever.\nFreight markets are volatile. Fuel isn’t cheap. Operating costs are rising. And load boards are oversaturated. Owner-operators who rely on hustle alone won’t make it. This is the turning point where strategy, structure, and systems take over.\nThis guide isn’t a pep talk. It’s a tactical survival kit. Use it to turn your truck into a true business. Highlight the sections, execute what applies, and measure your outcomes.\n1. Know Your Numbers or Bleed Out Slowly\nIf you can’t recite your cost-per-mile within a few cents, you’re operating blind. You can’t manage what you don’t measure.\nExecution Points:\nTrack fuel daily. Weekly trends can expose savings opportunities.\nBreak maintenance down by category and frequency.\nBuild a simple cost-per-mile tracker: fuel, insurance, maintenance, tolls, factoring, and downtime.\nReview your profitability per lane, not just per load.\nTool stack: Google Sheets + weekly review + envelope discipline = a $20K/year swing for many ops.\nHighlighter Moment: If a lane nets less than $1.20/mile after all costs, you’re paying to drive.\n2. The Spot Market is a Tool, Not a Business Plan\nIf you live on DAT or Truckstop, you’re letting volatility run your business.\nExecution Points:\nAnalyze 90-day load history. Identify repeat routes and top-paying lanes.\nBuild a “stable lane” plan: 3-5 lanes with known brokers or shippers.\nSchedule weekly broker calls. Ask what lanes they need filled regularly.\nTrack deadhead miles and adjust booking strategies accordingly.\nHighlighter Moment: Consistent lanes beat random high-paying spikes every single time.\n3. Paperwork Chaos Kills Cash Flow\nMissed invoices. Lost BOLs. Late payments. It’s not the freight that ruins cash flow—it’s the sloppy backend.\nExecution Points:\nUse a scanning app (like Genius Scan or Adobe Scan) to digitize PODs at the dock.\nSet up folders: Rate Cons, BOLs, Invoices, Settlements. Organize by week.\nSet a reminder every Friday to reconcile revenue, outstanding invoices, and settlements.\nStore digital and hard copies of compliance docs in a truck-accessible binder.\nEvery hour you spend invoicing, negotiating, or chasing brokers is an hour you’re not strategizing. You’re the operator. Stop acting like the entire staff.\nExecution Points:\nDelegate invoicing and document tracking to a virtual assistant or family member.\nVet part-time dispatchers who align with your lane and revenue goals.\nBuild checklists for fuel management, maintenance reviews, and compliance.\nReview systems quarterly. Adjust for growth and bottlenecks.\nHighlighter Moment: If your business collapses when you take a weekend off, it’s not a business. It’s a job.\n8. Reputation is a Business Asset\nYour MC number carries a reputation whether you manage it or not. Make sure it’s working for you.\nExecution Points:\nBe early. Deliver with zero drama. Follow up with gratitude and professionalism.\nTrack broker ratings, on-time delivery %, and claim rates.\nAsk for references from top brokers. Use them in your outreach.\nHighlighter Moment: In a flooded market, trust closes more deals than rates.\n9. Plan for the Next Level Before You Need It\nDon’t wait until you’re overwhelmed to scale or pivot.\nExecution Points:\nSet 6-month and 12-month goals. Be specific: revenue, number of trucks, lane focus.\nBreak those goals into weekly targets: profit margin, loads, miles.\nBlock 1 hour/month to review progress. Adjust course based on real data.\nHighlighter Moment: Business without a plan is a truck without a map. Direction beats speed.\nFinal Word: Stop Running in Circles. Start Building With Intention.\nMost owner-operators plateau because they never evolve from hustle to strategy. They stay trapped in the same week-to-week grind, with no roadmap and no leverage.\nThe ones who break through? They know their numbers cold. They cut unprofitable freight. They build systems.

The guidance highlighted that poor quality data can lead to unintended biases and other inaccuracies that may stymy the effectiveness of AI models used for varying functions in healthcare systems.\nCRM data includes information on patient demographics, individuals’ medical history, insurance information, billing details, and more. The consolidation of this data is intended to improve patient engagement, personalise care, and track individuals’ medical history.\nA 2022 report indicated that revenue streams from 44% of healthcare respondents were directly affected bypoor quality CRM data. In addition, 69% of respondents said their organisations did not pursue or complete potentially valuable initiatives due to low-quality CRM data.\nAccording to Rachel Mak-McCully, senior data scientist at digital twin developer Unlearn.AI, the cleaning and harmonisation of CRM datasets is not an area that is given enough consideration – despite its significant influence on AI models being deployed in healthcare.\n“In thinking about clean data, there's a few issues, including how accurate and comprehensive the data is,” Mak-McCully told Medical Device Network.\n“In the US, we have a very fractured medical system, so the information that you get about someone may be quite fractured.”\nFractured data can relate to data that is missing because it hasn't been collected at the same time or stored together, Mak-McCully said, or in the sense that it's been measured in different ways.\n“Imagine the data cleaning process as a spreadsheet. You might have a lot of different columns that are named differently, but they're the same thing. You want to make sure that all of those are harmonised into the same column,” Mak-McCully said.\n“And you want to make sure that the units that you're measuring across a range of different data sources are the same. The ultimate goal is to have a clean, tabular dataset at the end that incorporates all relevant sources of data, so that a single, clean source of data can be used to train your AI model.”\nMak-McCully concludes that while there is a lot of talk about the performance of AI models in healthcare and other areas, such as the new benchmarks that have been made, very few people talk about the underlying data.", "content_hash": "5464dd2c6e0d67b2db8ae8ae674fcd32", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Still, it amounts to a slap on the wrist compared to the billions of dollars that Cencora has already agreed to pay to settle opioid-related litigation brought by state and local governments.\nDive Insight:\nIn 2021, Lebanon County Employees’ Retirement Fund and a health plan maintained by the Teamsters union sued Cencora’s directors for breaching their duty to stockholders by failing to stop Cencora from improperly distributing opioids.\nOver 1 million Americans have died of overdoses related to opioids since 1999, but deaths spiked in between 2017 and 2023 as the potent painkillers became more readily available and easily misused, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDuring the epidemic, Cencora failed to “adopt, implement, or oversee reasonable policies and practices to prevent the unlawful distribution of opioids and failed to act when presented with evidence of widespread illegal opioid sales,” the pension funds argued in the Delaware suit.\nIn 2022, a Delaware judge dismissed the case based on a decision from a West Virginia court in Cencora’s favor in separate litigation, saying in a ruling it “knock[ed] the stuffing out of the plaintiffs’ claim[s].”\nHowever, the Delaware Supreme Court revived the case in 2023 after the plaintiffs appealed.\nFollowing mediation in June, both Cencora and the pension funds accepted an arbitor’s proposal that Cencora pay $111.3 million to settle the case, according to court documents. The amount was solidified in the formal settlement disclosed on Friday.\n“Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ Counsel have determined that the Settlement is fair, reasonable, adequate, and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders,” the settlement reads. Meanwhile, “Defendants have denied, and continue to expressly deny, each and all of the claims and contentions alleged by Plaintiffs ...

The boom of shale oil and gas extraction in the US Lower 48 led to realignments in the global energy market and encouraged other countries to explore this resource within their territorial boundaries. It also somewhat lowered the influence of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel in determining global oil prices, reshaped energy alliances and altered trade patterns in the energy landscape.\nAlthough the shale boom has somewhat receded in the US, optimism around this unconventional resource remains, driven by technological advancements and significant discoveries in countries such as China, Argentina and Saudi Arabia. This study highlights the developments in such emerging markets for shale plays.\nAt present, the global outlook for shale oil and gas production indicates a positive trend, with notable increases in production expected from top countries over the next few years, including the incumbent leader US. The growth is anticipated to be largely driven by the sustained rise in oil and gas demand from sectors such as transportation and power generation. Besides, shale oil and gas extraction has become more efficient and cost-effective, thanks to advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. These methods have boosted production and somewhat lowered the break-even price for shale resources. Additionally, adopting digital technologies, including the Internet of Things and data analytics, has refined extraction by enabling precise drilling, reducing waste and enhancing safety.\nThe US stands as the undisputed leader in global shale oil and gas production with a more than 80% share in 2024, thanks to its vast reserves, advanced extraction technologies and supportive regulatory environment. The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has unlocked unprecedented volumes of shale resources, particularly in formations such as the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus Shale.

Intel has so far been awarded $10.9 billion under that act. At the company's current $103.3 billion market capitalization, that would work out to about 10% of the company's market cap.\nAnd that right there, I suspect, is why Intel stock is dropping today, not popping. If Intel had been awarded $10 billion-plus in grants already, and the plan was to invest $10 billion-plus more into Intel for an ownership stake, well, that's one thing -- and probably a good thing in the minds of investors.\nIf the government plans instead to demand shares for the grants it's already awarded, and maybe not make any additional investment at all, well, that's bad news for Intel.\nBuy or sell semiconductor stocks?\nIt wouldn't be great news for investors in other semiconductor stocks, either. However it comes about, giving the government a stake in Intel's success would also give the government an interest in ensuring Intel succeeds -- perhaps at the expense of rivals like Nvidia and AMD.\nBad news for Intel today, it turns out, could be bad news for a whole lot of investors.\nDo the experts think Intel is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

It's freeing, in fact, because it automatically eliminates a bunch of names that aren't worthy long-run ideas. Just don't become so regimented in your thinking that you end up ignoring some solid, shorter-term possibilities, including dividend-paying stocks.\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three great dividend stocks to buy and hold for the next five years, at which time you'll want to make a major reassessment of each one. Think of these picks as long-term leases with an option to buy. See, the next five years could bring significant changes for each of these underlying companies and their industries. This change could be for the better, but this change might also start to clearly work against these companies in the meantime.\nFord\nFord Motor Company (NYSE: F) is, of course, one of the United States' oldest and most iconic carmakers. Investors who know anything about the outfit, however, know that it's not exactly been much of a dividend stock with the most promising future for a while now. Its sales growth has been scant (if not outright negative) since the industry's peak back in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nAlthough the global automobile business recovered well enough from the fallout of the 2008 subprime mortgage meltdown, most of that growth has taken shape outside of the U.S., where Ford isn't much of a factor. Much of the industry's net growth since then has also been driven by sales of electric vehicles (EVs), which haven't exactly been a bright spot for the company either. EVs accounted for only about 2% of last year's total revenue, and that was down from 2023's figure.\nPerhaps the most troubling detail to income-minded investors, however, is that Ford outright suspended its dividend in early 2020 due to the uncertainty of the then-new COVID-19 pandemic. While playing such defense was arguably the right call at the time, it still shows how fragile this stock's dividend payment is.\nIt's since been (mostly) restored, for the record. The company reinstated slightly smaller regular quarterly dividends in 2022 and has occasionally paid an additional special one-off dividend since then. But investors still aren't exactly as bullish on the company or its stock's dividends as they once were. That's why its forward-looking (regular) dividend yield of 5.3% and forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 8 are well above and below (respectively) the industry's norms ... or most industries' norms, for that matter.\nGiven the company's likely ability to at least continue funding its current level of dividend payments, though, the market is pricing in more risk than it arguably needs to. You can collect a sizable dividend as a result of this mostly unmerited worry.\nWhy only five years? The automobile business is changing, but it's not yet clear whether Ford is built to change with it. If it doesn't look any more competitive in 2030 than it does now, there may not be enough long-term growth in store to make it worth holding on to.\nQualcomm\nMost investors are familiar enough with Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM), but many don't realize it's a dividend payer as well. It's not a big dividend, mind you. Its forward-looking yield of 2.3% is just average, even if its annual dividend growth is better than average. It also shines in terms of consistency. The company has now upped its annual payout every year for a couple of decades.\nThat's not necessarily the only or the primary reason you might want to make a point of owning a stake in Qualcomm for the coming five years, however. While its continued cash payments are certainly a nice perk, this ticker will be able to serve double duty as an income and a growth name over this timeframe.\nSee, Qualcomm makes value-priced performance processors for smartphones, tablets, and even some laptops. Microsoft in particular has touted its Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PCs as capable of handling heavy-duty artificial intelligence (AI) duties from the computer itself rather than in the cloud (where it's still usually handled).\nYou'll also find Qualcomm's technology in advanced automobiles, augmented-reality equipment, and video game consoles. It's by no means a leader in most of these markets. But it's well-positioned to serve the consumer technology market, which is increasingly looking for affordable AI-powered solutions that will be made possible by the ever-falling costs of AI platforms themselves.\nAnd that opportunity is certainly brewing. Mordor Intelligence believes the worldwide AI hardware market is poised to grow at an average annual pace of 26% through 2030.\nWhy only five years? Like Ford, you may decide to stick with Qualcomm well beyond 2030. You'll just want to make a major reassessment at that time because its penetration of the mid-priced segment of the AI hardware market could start to be stymied by other manufacturers then. The company will need to make sure it remains competitive in the meantime.\nVerizon\nFinally, add Verizon Communications(NYSE: VZ) to your list of dividend stocks to buy and hold with a five-year deep-dive checkup on your calendar. Verizon is, of course, one of the nation's big three smartphone service providers, controlling roughly one-third of the market. That's not all it does, but that's the source of the vast majority of its revenue.\nAnd it's good at what it does, even if it doesn't do things all that differently or look all that different from rivals AT&T or T-Mobile. The stock just doesn't perform all that well, largely because there's little to no real growth opportunity here, other than sheer population growth.\nVerizon is really, really good at generating cash flow, though a bunch of which gets passed along to shareholders. The stock's usual lethargy, paired with its dividend payments, translates into a forward-looking dividend yield of 6.3%, which you'd be hard-pressed to find with any other stock of a comparable quality. And that's based on a dividend, by the way, that's now been raised for 18 consecutive years. It's not likely to break that streak now, being so close to becoming dividend royalty.\nWhy only five years? The only real concern here might be debt. Verizon is sitting on $124 billion of debt (versus a market cap of $183 billion) that's costing it $1.7 billion worth of interest payments every quarter (versus quarterly net income of around $5 billion). Much of this debt load is still locked in at the relatively low interest rates of yesteryear, but a good portion of this is coming due over the next five years.\nIt can handle it in the meantime, but with rates already as high as they are, investors will want to gauge how much additional interest cost the company will be fielding beyond 2030. For perspective, about two-thirds of its profits are already dished out as dividends. Any more than that, profit margins could become uncomfortably and restrictively thin.\nYou may also want to check in on Verizon's private 5G networking venture then. It's the company's only real growth engine at this time, but a subtly promising one.\nShould you buy stock in Ford Motor Company right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ford Motor Company wasn’t one of them.

Here's how\n-\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n-\nWant an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\n“I don’t need any more stress, and it was presented to me as an option,” Smith told NBC News. “However, if I had to do it again, I wouldn’t go anywhere near it.”\nWhat Smith thought would give him some financial breathing room has instead put him in a financial chokehold. The state’s agreement says that when the 90-day forbearance ends, homeowners should be offered repayment options without being required to make an immediate lump-sum “balloon payment.” Smith was also told his credit score wouldn’t take a hit.\nBut Smith says both of those promises were broken, and he’s not the only one.\n'The whole thing is like going around with a begging bowl'\nBill AB 238 was designed to allow owners of properties in California with four or fewer residential units to hit pause on their mortgage payments for 90 days. After that period, the borrower can request to have the forbearance extended in 90-day segments for up to one year.\n“These financial protections will enable residents to concentrate on taking care of their immediate needs rather than worrying about paying their mortgage bills,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a news release.\nUnder the bill, lenders are not permitted to tag on late fees, raise interest rates or start foreclosure proceedings during the forbearance period. Lenders are also required to keep credit reports clean if homeowners were up to date with their payments before entering the program.\nThe bill was meant to give homeowners some breathing room without wrecking their financial future, but attorney Aimee Williams — whose firm is representing Smith and others — says lenders aren’t holding up their end of the bargain.\n“Four hundred mortgage servicers signed up to abide by these bare minimum standards for mortgage relief,” Williams told NBC News. “Homeowners are instead being offered the complete opposite.”", "content_hash": "143c9826b564c3284d0bc18cae4ea208", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\nBut if you want a quick, simple way to see how today's rates would impact your monthly mortgage payment, try out the calculator below:\n30-year mortgage rates today\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.52%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.52% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,900, and you’d pay $384,055 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n15-year mortgage rates today\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.70% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.70% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,483. But you’d only pay $146,977 in interest over the years.\nDig deeper: How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\nAdjustable mortgage rates\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\nHow to get a low mortgage rate\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown (as mentioned early in the article) is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.5% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.5% for year one, increase to 5.5% for year two, then settle in at 6.5% for the remainder of your term.\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\nMortgage rates today: FAQs\nWhat are interest rates today?\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.52%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.70%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.86%.\nWhat is a normal mortgage rate right now?\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.52%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S.\nWill mortgage rates drop down?\nMortgage rates are not expected to drop significantly in 2025 while economists monitor inflation, tariffs, and the Federal Reserve. Still, there could be a cut to mortgage rates before the next Fed meeting in September.", "content_hash": "384d241ec6cffc417973e8887bda6da7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Last month, the company hit another milestone on its journey to commercialize its breakthrough battery technology, marking steady progress toward a future where electric vehicles (EVs) can drive farther and charge faster than ever before. The stock has surged 133% since June.\nYet, with the company still in its early stages and facing crucial milestones, investors considering buying QuantumScape should consider the following first.\nWhat QuantumScape does\nQuantumScape designs solid-state lithium‑metal battery architecture, focusing on developing and commercializing next-generation batteries for electric vehicles and other applications. It believes this technology will enable a new category of batteries that has greater energy density, faster charging, and improved safety compared to conventional lithium-ion cells.\nIts technology breakthrough, particularly the recent rollout of its Cobra separator process, has already advanced into baseline production, offering a 25-times improvement in heat treatment speed, compared to its prior Raptor process. Simply put, this increased efficiency and productivity are important milestones in helping QuantumScape scale up production.\nVolkswagen has been a key partner in its development\nA key aspect of its business is its relationship with Volkswagen, which owns a 26% voting interest in the battery maker. The German automaker has been a major investor, with cumulative investments of approximately $380 million over more than a decade.\nQuantumScape and PowerCo SE, Volkswagen Group's battery company, have a strategic collaboration and licensing arrangement to industrialize QuantumScape's QSE-5 battery technology. PowerCo SE was formed by Volkswagen in 2022 to consolidate its activities in the development and production of battery cells.\nQuantumScape's agreement with PowerCo last year marked a significant move, helping it transition to a more capital-light business model. Thanks to the agreement, PowerCo has a non-exclusive license agreement to manufacture battery cells with the QSE-5 technology.\nIn the second quarter, QuantumScape expanded its agreement with PowerCo, which includes new cash payments of up to $131 million over two years for joint commercialization activities. These are in addition to a previously announced $130 million royalty pre-payment that will be due upon satisfactory technical progress and execution of the full licensing agreement.\nUnderstanding QuantumScape's cash situation\nThe PowerCo news, along with the ongoing development of its Cobra process, are steps in the right direction for QuantumScape. However, the company remains speculative, without a steady revenue source right now. It continues to rack up losses as it spends on research and development, among other expenses. In the second quarter, it reported a net loss of around $114 million.\nFor this reason, cash on hand is essential, and QuantumScape holds around $797 million in liquid assets. The company believes it has enough to fund its operations through 2029, six months longer than previously guided, largely thanks to its expanded deal with PowerCo. That said, the company continues burning capital with no meaningful income, and if its capital needs increase for any reason, it may be forced to raise additional capital by diluting shareholders.\nAnother aspect to pay attention to is the broader electric vehicle (EV) sector, where QuantumScape would want to see ongoing EV adoption. If the market doesn't develop as expected, it could hurt long-term demand trends for the company.\nNot only that, but it faces competition from other battery developers. Established automakers like Toyota and BMW, along with upstarts like Nio, are increasingly investing in in-house battery development.\nIs QuantumScape a buy?\nIf the battery maker can continue to validate developing technology, scale up production capabilities with PowerCo, and capture additional deals with original equipment manufacturers, it has the potential to deliver excellent returns. That said, it is still in its early stages. Next, it needs to scale up production and have its batteries undergo field testing, which will be on the docket in 2026.\nQuantumScape's technology could be a breakthrough for EVs and other battery-powered applications. But it remains a few years away from generating any meaningful revenue and will continue to incur costs as it works closer to commercial production. Until QuantumScape delivers go-to-market success or sustained revenue -- and given the stock's recent surge -- it remains a high-risk stock with a long road ahead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in QuantumScape right now?\nBefore you buy stock in QuantumScape, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and QuantumScape wasn’t one of them.

Most of the time, they serve different kinds of travelers. But sometimes, the routes overlap enough to matter, and in rare cases, the infrastructural advantages of a new train line can put a dent in plane ticket bookings.\nThis is basically the right mental model for reading Circle Internet Group's (NYSE: CRCL) announcement of Arc, a new Layer-1 (L1) blockchain designed around stablecoin finance. For holders of XRP(CRYPTO: XRP), the potential overlaps between Arc and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) are with payments, foreign exchange (FX) and international money transfers, and transaction settlement for trades.\nSo, does that mean launching Arc is a direct threat to XRP?\nCircle's new chain plans are timely\nFirst, let's clarify exactly what Circle is going for with its launch of Arc. For the uninitiated, Circle is the issuer of USDC(CRYPTO: USDC), the second-largest stablecoin, which has a market value of about $68 billion (as of Aug. 15). Arc is, thus, Circle's bid to make stablecoins move with enterprise-grade reliability on public rails.\nThe design choices are quite transparently intended to generate revenue via incentivizing the use of USDC. USDC is the native gas that's used for predictable, dollar-denominated user fees, and an institutional foreign exchange engine that supports 24/7 on-chain price discovery and settlement.\nTransactions should theoretically settle in less than a second, and there are opt-in privacy features for balances and transactions. Furthermore, the chain intends to be Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible to keep developer switching costs low and grant it access to Ethereum's vast pool of smart contract developers -- just like the XRPL does with its new EVM-compatible sidechain.\nCircle says Arc will enter a private testnet in the coming weeks, with a public testnet slated for this fall, and a mainnet beta test in 2026. Meanwhile, USDC's scale is quietly resetting the competitive baseline for the stablecoin segment. Circle reported USDC in circulation of $61.3 billion at the end of the second quarter and $65.2 billion by Aug. 10, reflecting close to 90% growth year over year. Stablecoins as a category now sit near the $260 billion to $280 billion mark. That mass will be fuel for Arc's launch.\nIs XRP in danger?\nBut where might XRP fit into this picture? In short, XRPL's original mission was cheap, fast, cross-border money transfers, and its most active enterprise deployments fall under those verticals. And Arc's payments and FX features march straight into those same areas. Thus, it is fairly likely it will end up stepping on XRP's toes in cross-border payments and institutional flows, stealing at least a small share of the capital flows. Still, that doesn't spell doom for XRP whatsoever, even if it is a genuine threat.\nStart by looking at what XRP already does well. The XRPL bakes compliance-oriented controls into the protocol for issued assets. Those tools help regulated issuers enforce know-your-customer (KYC) rules without bespoke contracts, and they reduce operational friction for institutions. Once an asset issuer is onboarded, it's burdensome for them to switch to another system, so they probably won't, especially if the increased benefits are only marginal. Remember, XRP's transactions are extremely fast and very cheap, so Arc won't be able to siphon much capital on the basis of those features, even if it can match them.\nFurthermore, Circle's go-to-market strategy is different and, in some segments, more direct. For fintechs or other companies that already use USDC, Arc promises a vertically integrated path to reduce implementation risk and vendor sprawl. But those users likely weren't in XRP's reach anyway, as they were already participants in Circle's soon-to-be-budding ecosystem.\nSo, where does all of this leave investors? In practice, Arc and XRPL will likely segment the market rather than one obliterating the other. XRP should remain the more institutionally configurable rail for issuer-controlled assets and payment corridors where XRPL features and existing integrations shine. Therefore, the right stance is to be secure but not complacent if you hold XRP.\nKeep an eye on Arc's public testnet traction with payments partners. If Arc converts Circle's USDC distribution into on-chain settlement at scale, some of the capital share will shift. At the same time, if XRP keeps landing new issuer programs, its investment thesis stays intact.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Circle Internet Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Circle Internet Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Circle Internet Group wasn’t one of them.

The semiconductor company, whose graphics processing units (GPUs) power data centers and large language models to make artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) possible, is reporting its second-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings results after the closing bell on Aug. 27.\nInvestors should be pleased to know that all signs point to another solid earnings report. Particularly when it's not hindered by tariff fears, Nvidia has a history of seeing its stock jump following a positive report.\nLet's take a closer look at what is to be expected from Nvidia -- and why investors who have the stock will likely be richer afterward.\nWhy you should expect a solid earnings report\nNvidia has an overwhelming market share in the GPU market, with recent estimates indicating that it has a 92% piece of the business. These GPUs are designed to work collectively, so when a data center customer buys hundreds and links them together, they can work faster and more powerfully, running top-of-the-line platforms with generative AI.\nSome of Nvidia's biggest customers have already announced plans to increase their data center spending even more. Meta Platforms is adding $30 billion this year to its capital expenditures (capex) to a level between $66 billion and $72 billion. Alphabet says it will increase its capex guidance for 2025 from $75 billion to $85 billion. And Microsoft says that it will increase its spending in 2026, although it won't be as rapid as it was for the 2025 fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2025.\nAnalysts surveyed at Yahoo! Finance forecast Nvidia revenue in Q2 to be $45.75 billion (at the midpoint) versus $30.04 billion a year ago, and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.00 versus $0.68 in the same quarter a year ago. That represents a 52% gain on revenue and a 47% improvement in EPS if the forecasts are correct.\nIn addition, investors hope to get more details from Nvidia about a reported deal it made with the White House to allow it to sell its valuable H20 AI chips in China. The company was forced to take a $4.5 billion charge against earnings in Q1 because it was blocked from selling the high-performance chips. The company recently announced that the Trump administration agreed to let it restart sales. The deal would allow Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell their chips in China, with 15% of the revenue going to the U.S. government. But no additional details on how the deal would work have been released since. Nvidia is likely to get questions from analysts about the deal and how it might affect guidance for the rest of the 2026 fiscal year.\nHow Nvidia stock moves after earnings\nTo get a better idea of what to expect from the post-report market, it pays to see what the stock did following the last several earnings reports.\nSource: Nvidia. Note: Q1 2026 was released May 28, 2025; Q4 2025 was released Feb. 26, 2025; Q3 2025 was released Nov. 20, 2024; Q2 2025 was released Aug. 28, 2024. * Stock performance is for the 90 days following the report's release, except Q1 2026, which is performance only through Aug. 13, 2025. YOY = Year over year.\nTwo things stand out here: First, Nvidia is remarkably consistent in adding roughly $5 billion in new revenue each quarter. While the year-over-year increase in growth is reduced, that's only because each quarter Nvidia faces more challenging comparable numbers. That's not a serious problem to have, so if I see a report that says \"Nvidia's growth is slowing,\" that's not something I'm going to stress about as an investor.\nSecond, Nvidia's post-market performance appears to be solid. There are two quarters in the last calendar year where the stock dropped, but that was entirely because of the tariff and trade war battles being fought between Washington and the rest of the world. The demand for Nvidia chips isn't going away, and as long as the government doesn't interfere, Nvidia's performance should be solid. That's why the company's news that it will be allowed to sell its H20 chips in China -- followed by the separate White House statement -- is so important to Nvidia stock, and it's one of the reasons why Nvidia currently has a market capitalization of $4.4 trillion.\nI am confident that Nvidia will have a solid quarter, particularly with major tech companies increasing their capex spending and expanding their data centers. And now that the H20 sales to China appear to have a green light, we should expect a more-than-respectable report from Nvidia on Aug. 27. I recommend buying the shares before the report date and holding them for a long time.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

(AP) — For decades, Miles “Burt” Marshall was the man you went to see in a stretch of upstate New York if you had some money to invest but wanted to keep it local.\nWorking from an office in the charming village of Hamilton, down the road from Colgate University, Marshall prepared taxes and sold insurance. He also took money for what was sometimes called the “8% Fund,” which guaranteed that much in annual interest no matter what happened with the financial markets.\nHis clients spread the word to family and friends. Have a retirement nest egg? Let Burt handle it. He'll invest it in local rental properties and your money will grow faster than in a bank.\nMarshall was friendly and folksy. He gave away gift bags with maple syrup, pickles and local honey in jars labeled with cute sayings like, “Don't be a sap. For proper insurance coverage call Miles B. Marshall.\"\n“He would tell you about all the other people that invest. Churches invest. Fire companies invest. Doctors invest,” said one client, Christine Corrigan. “So you’d think, ‘Well, they’re smart people. They wouldn’t be doing this if it wasn’t okay to do ... Why are you going to be the suspicious one?”\nThen it all came crashing down.\nMarshall owed almost 1,000 people and organizations about $95 million in principal and interest when he filed for bankruptcy protection two years ago, according to the trustee's filings.\nThis summer, the 73-year-old businessman was indicted on charges that his investment business was a Ponzi scheme. He could face prison time if convicted.\nMarshall's lawyers declined to comment.\nTotal losses by Marshall's investors fall short of the multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme masterminded by Bernie Madoff. But they loom large in the small, college town of about 6,400 people and its largely rural surrounding area.\nMany investors were Colgate professors, laborers, office workers or retirees. Some lost their life's savings of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. Corrigan and her husband, who own a restaurant 30 miles (48 kilometers) east, were owed about $1.5 million.\nNow they're wondering how someone who seemed so reliable, who held annual parties for his clients and even called them on their birthdays could betray their trust.\n“You look at life differently after this happens. It’s like, ‘Who do you trust?’” said Dennis Sullivan, who was owed about $40,000. “It’s sad because of what he’s done to the area.”\nA reliable local businessman\nMarshall and his wife lived in a brick Victorian, blocks from his office. Aside from insurance and tax preparation, he rented more than 100 properties and ran a self-storage business and a print shop.\nHis parents had run an insurance and realty business in the area and the Marshall name was respected locally.\nThough he quit college, he was a federally enrolled tax professional. To many in the area, he seemed knowledgeable about money and kept a neat office.\n“He had French doors and a beautiful carpet and a big desk and he just looked like he was prosperous and reliable,\" Corrigan said.\nMarshall began taking money from people to buy and maintain rental properties in the 1980s. People got back promissory notes — slips of paper with the dollar amount written in. Withdrawals could be made with 30 days’ notice. People could choose to receive regular interest payments.\nParticipants saw the transactions as investments. Marshall has called them loans.\nFor many years, Marshall made good on his promises to pay interest and process withdrawals. More people took part as word spread. Sullivan recalls how his parents gave Marshall money, then he did, then his fiancee, then his fiancee’s daughter, then his son, and even his snowmobile club.\n”Everybody gets snowballed into it,” Sullivan said.\nA number of investors lived in other states, but had connections to the area.\nThe promise of 8% returns was unremarkable in the '80s, a time of higher interest rates. But it stood out later as rates dropped. Marshall told a bankruptcy proceeding that he assumed appreciation on his real estate would more than cover the debts.\n“That’s obviously false now,\" he said, according to filings, \"but that’s what I always thought.”\nReckoning with more than $90 million in debt\nThe money stopped flowing by 2023.\nMarshall filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection that April, declaring more than $90 million in liabilities and $21.5 million in assets, most of it in real estate.\nHe explained in a filing that he had been been hospitalized for a “serious heart condition” that required two surgeries, costing him $600,000. As news of his illness spread, there was a run on note holders asking for their money back.\nThe bankruptcy trustee, Fred Stevens, blamed Marshall's insolvency on incompetent business practices and borrowing from people at above-market rates. The trustee contended that by 2011, Marshall was using new investment money to pay off previous investors, the hallmark of a Ponzi scheme.\nProsecutors claim Marshall falsely represented the profitability of his real estate business and had his staff generate \"transaction summaries” with bogus information about account balances and earned interest.\nMoney was funneled into his other businesses and he spent hundreds of thousands of investors’ dollars on personal expenses, including airline travel, meals out, groceries and yoga studios, according to prosecutors.\nMarshall's clients feel betrayed.\n“We left it there so that it would accumulate. Well, it accumulated in his pocket,” Barbara Baltusnik said of her investment.\nThe ripple effects of multimillion-dollar losses\nMarshall pleaded not guilty in June to charges of grand larceny and securities fraud. He's accused of stealing more than $50 million.\nMarshall's home and properties were sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings, which continue. People who gave Marshall their money stand to recoup around 5.4 cents on the dollar from the asset sales. Potential claims against financial institutions are being pursued, according to the trustee.\nBaltusnik said she and her husband were owed hundreds of thousands of dollars and now she wonders how she will pay doctors’ bills. Sullivan’s mother moved in with him after losing her investment.\nIn Epworth, Georgia, retiree Carolyn Call will never see money she hoped would help augment her Social Security payments. She found out about Marshall though an uncle who lived in upstate New York.\n“I’m just able to pay my bills and keep going,\" she said. \"Nothing extravagant. No trips. Can’t do anything hardly for the grandkids.”", "content_hash": "589a641ee57ebd98020df2a0e066c9a7", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Medicare Advantage plans can offset some of these costs, but they require separate monthly premiums.\nRiggs says the surge in costs is driven by several factors, including longer life expectancies and a health care inflation rate that has outpaced general inflation for years.\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market?

Goldman Sachs analysts agree, saying the 10-year Treasury will remain near 4.1% through 2027.\nMeanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts the Treasury yield to be 4.1% by the end of 2025, down to 4% in 2026 and remaining near 3.9% through 2029.\nDig deeper: When will mortgage rates go down?\nEstimating a 5-year spread\nAs we mentioned up top, the 10-year Treasury and 30-year fixed mortgage rates are separated by a spread. That difference between the two has been on either side of 2.5 percentage points in recent years. That's a significant change when compared to the spread from 2010 to 2020 when it was under two percentage points — and often near 1.5.\nUsing a 2.5 percentage point spread, here's an example of how Treasurys and mortgage rates compare:\n10-year Treasury rate = 4%\nSpread = 2.5 percentage points\nMortgage rates = 6.5%\nHere's a recent example: As of the last week of August, the 10-year Treasury yield was 4.24%, and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.56%. The spread was 6.56 - 4.23 = 2.23 percentage points.\nThe latest version of artificial intelligence, GPT-5, suggested using a spread of 2.1 to 2.3 percentage points. Here is its rationale:\n-\nHistorical standard (2010s): ~1.7 pp\n-\nRecent years (2022 to 2025): ~2.6 pp\n-\nEstimated 5-year average spread: ~2.1 to 2.3 percentage points\nUsing these spread estimates, we can now complete our five-year mortgage rate forecast.\nRead more: How to get the lowest mortgage rate possible\nThe 5-year mortgage rate forecast\nUsing the Treasury forecast from above, we add the spread between the bond market and 30-year fixed mortgage rates to compile a five-year forecast:\nLearn more: When will mortgage rates go back down to 6%?\nThe margin of error\nOf course, these are long-range estimates based on historical norms and broad expectations. All of these numbers could be thrown out the window if any of the following happens:\n-\n10-year Treasurys outperform or underperform the forecast. For example, yields could crash in a severe economic setback, such as a recession.\n-\nThe spread between Treasurys and mortgage rates narrows — or dramatically expands.\n-\nMonetary policy, as driven by the Federal Reserve, substantially changes.\nMortgage rate predictions for the next 5 years FAQs\nWill we ever see a 3% mortgage rate again?\nThere is no forecast that predicts a 3% mortgage rate in the next five years. However, who saw such low home loan rates on the horizon in 2007 when rates were about where they are now? Things like the Great Recession and a global pandemic are rarely on the radar, and such black swan events are what it takes to move mortgage rates into the cellar.\nWhat will mortgage rates be in 2027?\nThe analysis above predicts 2027 mortgage rates to be around 6.2% to 6.4%.\nWill mortgage rates drop in the next 5 years?\nBased on the estimates above, rates are not expected to drastically drop in the next five years. However, a recession or other unknown disruption to the economy (such as a financial collapse or pandemic) could change the outlook.\nIs it better to fix a rate for 2 or 5 years?\nIf you are considering an adjustable-rate mortgage with an initial fixed-rate period, you'll first want to consider how long you'll actually remain in the house you are financing. Then the long-term mortgage rate forecasting begins. The best idea is probably to choose the initial term that best fits your current budget.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article.", "content_hash": "41267ec1d52cd0bc9a05b7d5322a31c8", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Speculating instead of investing\nSome investors fail to recognize the difference between a speculative asset and an investment-worthy asset. According to Buffett, the difference is in how the asset generates a return.\n“All investment is laying out some money now to get more money back in the future,” Buffett once explained. “Now, there’s two ways of looking at getting the money back. One is from what the asset itself will produce. That’s investment. [The other] is from what somebody else will pay you for it later on, irrespective of what the asset produces. And I call that speculation.”\nBuffett believes that assets that produce income organically — such as farmland, profitable companies, dividend stocks and real estate investment trusts — are investment-worthy.\nYou can build your own circle of competency with trusted advisors who bring their expertise on growing wealth — and Advisor.com can help you find a financial professional that’s right for you.\nAdvisor.com is a free online platform that connects you with vetted financial advisors.

Trying to time the market\nMarket timing is tempting but deceptive. Investors often convince themselves they can wait for the right time to buy or sell a stock. However, experienced investors understand that market cycles are unpredictable, so staying invested for longer is typically the best approach.\n\"You shouldn't buy stocks unless you expect to hold them for a very extended period and you are prepared financially and psychologically to hold them,\" Buffett had said during Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in 2020.\nIf you are investing for retirement, you need to make sure you are picking the right stocks.

Gain potential quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire. Here’s how to get started with as little as $10\n3. Hedging against volatility\nReal estate has historically been less speculative than stocks, with stable returns generating a steady stream of passive income. It is often touted as one of the best avenues to build wealth — a move that can pay off brilliantly for your retirement.\nHowever, with home prices steadily increasing over the past few years, direct ownership of residential real estate might be challenging.\nBut that doesn’t mean you can’t tap into the $30 trillion home equity market, with real estate crowdfunding companies that let you invest in residential properties without constantly worrying about mortgage or home maintenance expenses.\nFor those who prefer accessible fractional investing, Arrived — an online platform backed by prominent investors like Jeff Bezos — offers retail investors the opportunity to buy shares in existing rental and vacation homes. You can get your foot into the real estate market without buying property outright.\nWith Arrived, you can browse a curated selection of homes, each vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, you can choose the number of shares you want to buy and start investing in real estate with just $100.\nA recent report from Cushman & Wakefield also commented, “for the first time in years, the retail market is at a point of being supply-constrained — at least for space in quality shopping centers.\"\nWith both commercial and residential supply constrained, rental prices could be pushed higher, creating attractive returns for investors.\nFor accredited investors looking to expand their portfolios and make a larger allocation, First National Realty Partners (FNRP) offers accredited investors access to retail-anchored real estate investments, without the legwork of finding deals yourself.\nThe FNRP team has developed relationships with shopping centers and health-care facilities across the U.S., as well as the nation’s largest essential-needs brands, including Kroger, Walmart and Whole Foods.\nThey also offer white-glove service for investors, providing key market insights and finding the best properties both on and off-market, while investors can passively collect distribution income.\nYou can engage with experts, explore available deals and easily make an allocation, all in one personalized secure portal.\nTo truly accelerate your net worth, consider getting expert guidance across all areas of your wealth.

See our Advertiser Disclosure.\nAs of 2025, 42.5 million people have outstanding federal student loans. Of those, approximately 12.3 million — about 29% of borrowers — are currently enrolled in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. These plans provide significant relief, giving borrowers more affordable monthly payments.\nPresident Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) overhauled federal student loans and their repayment options. The changes will have a major impact on both current and future student loan borrowers. And, depending on what loans you have, you may have a limited amount of time to take action — or risk losing repayment options permanently.\nHow the Trump administration will change student loan repayment\nThe OBBB made sweeping changes, but when they go into effect varies by provision. Whether you have existing loans or plan on taking out loans in the near future, here's what you need to know.\n1. It creates a new standard repayment plan\n-\nWho it affects: Any borrower who takes out a federal student loan on or after July 1, 2026\n-\nWhen it goes into effect: July 1, 2026\nThe current loan system's standard repayment plan requires fixed monthly payments over 10 years. The OBBB scraps that design and introduces a tiered repayment schedule based on borrowers' loan balances.\nThe new standard repayment plan applies to borrowers who take out a new loan — even if they have existing federal loans — on or after July 1, 2026.\n2. There is a new income-based repayment plan\n-\nWho it affects: All undergraduate and graduate loan borrowers\n-\nWhen it goes into effect: July 1, 2026\nThe bill creates a new repayment plan tied to borrowers' income, the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Unlike the current IDR plans, the RAP requires all borrowers — regardless of income or dependents — to make payments of at least $10 per month. The new plan bases payments on the borrower's income (minus $50 for each dependent).\nFor example, say your AGI is $45,000 per year and you have one child. Your payment would be set at 4% of your income or $1,800 per year ($150 per month). But, because you have a dependent child, your payment is reduced by $50 per month, so your monthly payment amount would be $100.\nThe RAP waives interest that accrues if your payment amount doesn't cover the full amount, but borrowers will be in repayment for 30 years.\n3. New borrowers will have just two repayment options\n-\nWho it affects: Undergraduate and graduate loan borrowers who take out loans on or after July 1, 2026\n-\nWhen it goes into effect: July 1, 2026\nBorrowers who take out new loans will have just two repayment options.\n\"Any borrower who takes a loan on or after July 1, 2026, will only have access to the new standard and RAP repayment plans,\" said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance.\nNew borrowers won't have access to today's IDR plans, extended repayment, or graduated repayment.\n4. Current undergraduate and graduate borrowers will transition to new plans\n-\nWho it affects: Undergraduate and graduate loan borrowers with existing loans\n-\nWhen it goes into effect: July 1, 2028\nLegacy undergraduate or graduate borrowers — meaning those with existing loans — have a bit more time before they need to change their payment plans. As long as you don't take out any new loans on or after July 1, 2026, you can continue under any of the following repayment plans for the time being:\n-\nIncome-Contingent Repayment (ICR)\n-\nIncome-based Repayment (IBR)\n-\nPay As You Earn (PAYE)\n-\nSaving on a Valuable Education (SAVE)\n-\nExtended repayment\n-\nGraduated repayment\nHowever, the OBBB will phase out most of these options over time, and all borrowers in discontinued payment plans will be required to enroll in a new plan — either IBR, the new RAP, or the new Standard Repayment plan — by July 1, 2028.\nRead more: Can you change your student loan repayment plan?\n5. New parent loan borrowers will no longer be eligible for alternative repayment plans\n-\nWho it affects: Borrowers who take out new Parent PLUS Loans on or after July 1, 2026\n-\nWhen it goes into effect: July 1, 2026\nUnder the current system, Parent PLUS Loan borrowers can consolidate their loans with a Direct Consolidation Loan and qualify for an ICR repayment plan (and if they work for an eligible employer, they can qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness).\nThe OBBB eliminates those features; anyone who takes out a new Parent PLUS Loan on or after July 1, 2026, will only be eligible for standard repayment. Parents can't qualify for alternative payment plans or PSLF.\n\"[Parent borrowers] will not be eligible for RAP or other old repayment plan options,\" said Buchanan.\n\"Keep in mind: The new standard plan will flex monthly payments based upon the balance of the loan, offering a lower monthly payment over a longer period for larger balances, which is different from the old standard plan that was set at a 10-year term regardless of balance.”\n6. Current parent borrowers have to take action\n-\nWho it affects: Current parent loan borrowers\n-\nWhen it goes into effect: July 1, 2026\nParent PLUS Loan borrowers will no longer be eligible for alternative payment plans. For existing borrowers, only those who consolidate their debt by July 1, 2026, and enroll in an IDR plan will have access to alternative payment plans.\nIf you have not yet consolidated your loans, you must complete the process before June 30, 2026.\n\"Any Parent PLUS borrower who consolidates or takes out new loans on or after July 1, 2026, would only have access to the standard plan,\" said Adam Minsky, a student loan attorney.\n7. Federal consolidation won't be as useful\n-\nWho it affects: All student loan borrowers\n-\nWhen it goes into effect: July 1, 2026\nFor borrowers who cannot afford their payments, consolidating with a Direct Consolidation Loan could provide some relief. It gives some borrowers access to repayment plans they wouldn't otherwise qualify for, and some borrowers can qualify for 30-year terms and get more affordable payments.\nAlthough Direct Consolidation Loans will still exist in the future, the OBBB reduces their usefulness.\n\"Consolidation will be an option, but one with very little practical value for most borrowers going forward after July 1,\" said Buchanan.\nThe new RAP and standard repayment plan have longer repayment terms. And consolidating on or after July 1, 2026, will cause legacy borrowers to lose access to alternative payment plans.\nManaging your debt after the OBBB\nThe OBBB completely changed federal financial aid and repayment options, and details are still forthcoming on some updates. For example, the ICR plan will be eliminated, but the deadlines borrowers must meet are unclear.\n\"We will publish more information about the ICR enrollment deadlines that borrowers must meet before ICR is eliminated in order for them to continue to be able to access the IBR Plan,\" the Department of Education said on the Federal Student Aid announcement site.\nAs you adjust to these changes, check in with the announcement page for the latest details. And if you need help understanding your loan options or enrolling in a different repayment plan, contact your loan servicer.", "content_hash": "a28aa2204a35f64d2cc7a7fa283adfd9", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That's where XRP(CRYPTO: XRP) might be today.\nOn July 18, XRP marked a fresh all-time high of about $3.65, and the coin has gained 440% during the past 12 months. That makes the idea of doing the same thing again less of a fantasy and more of a reasonable scenario for investors to weigh, especially if the tailwinds supporting the coin's price continue or even accelerate. Let's consider the coin's chances of beating its prior record price.\nWhy another new high is very plausible in the near term\nThe coin making new highs might grab headlines, but long-term compounding comes from utility and adoption. Ripple, the company that issues XRP, is building the payments and liquidity stack around XRP in ways that can add durable demand.\nIts U.S. dollar stablecoin launched in December 2024, and crossed $642 million outstanding this summer, a helpful on-chain base layer for payments and settlement.\nThe company also agreed to acquire Rail, a stablecoin-focused payments platform, for roughly $200 million, signaling a faster push to enterprise payment flows that can use XRP. The purchase should close sometime in the fourth quarter.\nAs the XRP Ledger (XRPL) becomes more of a destination for hosting stablecoins and applications that use them, the total value stored on the chain will increase, pumping up the price of its native token, XRP. Importantly, Ripple's control of the issuance of its stablecoin effectively means that it can inject liquidity directly into the ecosystem of its chain whenever it wants. As more institutional investors onboard, Ripple will be pushing that button more frequently, as holders of large sums of capital will be attracted by the ability to do on-chain transactions in the size they prefer.\nThat won't be the only driver of higher prices for XRP. XRPL is intentionally built for financial institutions that need compliance-friendly money movement and asset issuance. That design shows up in the network's feature set, which is slated to continue expanding.\nToday, asset issuers can require authorization before their tokens are held, freeze assets at the issuer level when legal obligations demand it, and generally enforce transfer restrictions without a duct-taped tangle of smart contracts. Those are the controls that banks and asset managers look for when they consider moving real value on-chain.\nSo between significantly shoring up its stablecoin platform and building out the chain's technology, XRP is very likely to continue climbing in the near term as financial operators look to find safe and compliance-friendly places for their capital.\nWhat actually matters for investors from here\nWhat could go wrong to prevent XRP from reaching a new high? Quite a bit.\nThe exchange-traded fund (ETF) approvals anticipated for later this year could slip, especially if regulatory priorities change. Competition from other chains, particularly Ethereum (and, to a lesser extent, Solana) remains fierce in key segments like stablecoins and payments tooling, where network effects and developer mindshare are meaningful advantages XRP is still working to attain.\nTherefore, the smarter move here is not to waste time thinking about whether the coin can surpass its former all-time high. Rather, focus on whether the odds are improving that XRP's utility and capital base will be larger in 12 to 36 months. Based on the evidence, that second proposition looks extremely likely. That's before even taking into account other favorable dimensions, like the bullish macro environment or Ripple's receding legal issues.\nIf you are building a position in XRP, the price at the high water mark is less important than your conviction that the next few highs will be driven by growing usage. Accumulate it gradually, and size your positions so that delays or setbacks in the chain's roadmap don't lead you to sell on emotion.\nLastly, be sure to keep your eye on the boring metrics that actually matter, like on-ledger assets, institutional partnerships that move real payments, and tangible regulatory wins.\nShould you buy stock in XRP right now?\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and XRP wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $668,155!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,106,071!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,070% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 184% for the S&P 500.

Here’s why.\nSave Enough for Public School — but No More\nSchultz admits she went to a private college and had student loans. Her plan for her own children is to save enough for a public school in a 529 plan, but not to fund that account with enough for a pricier, private school.\nHer reasoning?\n“If I save for private school and my kid goes to public or decides to be a YouTube creator, we would owe taxes and a penalty on any money not used for qualified education expenses,” Schultz wrote.\nThe personal finance expert makes a valid point, and there could be even more scenarios where a child doesn’t use all of the money in their 529 account. A child could get an academic or athletic scholarship to college, or they could start at a community college and then transfer to a four-year school. Any of these scenarios could result in having money left in a 529 plan.\nRead Next: 8 Frugal Habits Americans Are Ridiculed for — and Why You Shouldn’t Care\nCollege Savings in a 529 Plan\nA 529 college savings plan lets parents (or grandparents, or anyone, for that matter), save money for a child’s college education. The plan is funded with after-tax dollars, but the gains are tax-free if the money is used for college-related expenses, such as tuition, room and board, books, and supplies.\nIf the money is withdrawn for other purposes, as Schultz said, the gain in the account would be taxed and subject to a 10% penalty.\nSaving for College Outside a 529 Plan\nSchultz explains that she will save additional money for her kids’ college, just not in a 529 plan.\n“I would rather save additional dollars outside of a 529 that can be used for a house down payment, a business or something else entirely,” she said.\nThis is valid reasoning, since you would not incur the 10% penalty if you withdrew these funds for something other than college.

More than 100 public companies were implicated, dozens of executives resigned or faced criminal charges, and billions in earnings had to be restated.\nI never intended to be a whistleblower. I was simply doing what academics are trained to do: ask questions, follow the data, and let the evidence speak. But what the evidence revealed was staggering: executives at hundreds of companies were manipulating stock option grant dates to enrich their executives at the expense of shareholders. The practice became known as backdating.\nNow, on the 20th anniversary of that research, I see troubling parallels emerging in other corners of the financial world.\nA pattern too precise to be chance\nMy journey into this murky corner of corporate behavior began with a desire to understand how executive compensation influenced firm decisions. While analyzing large datasets of compensation and stock prices, I noticed something peculiar: stock option grants often coincided with recent dips in the company’s share price. Too often.\nThe pattern was statistically improbable. It was as if executives had a crystal ball, repeatedly receiving options at the most opportune moment. But the truth was more mundane—and more troubling. Companies were retroactively selecting grant dates that coincided with low stock prices, effectively locking in instant, unearned gains. This allowed executives to buy shares at a discount while maintaining the illusion that they had to earn the discount by lifting the stock price.\nThe simplicity of the scheme\nWhat made the fraud so insidious was its simplicity. Backdating didn’t require complex financial engineering or elaborate cover-ups. It was a quiet manipulation of paperwork—choosing a date in the past when the stock price was low and pretending that was the day the options were granted.\nThat simplicity likely contributed to its spread. There’s evidence that individuals on multiple boards passed along the practice. But even isolated executives and directors could easily conceive the scheme, much like someone backdating a check to make it appear they paid a bill on time.\nHidden in plain sight\nWhat struck me most was that backdating went unnoticed for at least a decade. It was a silent epidemic of opportunism. The option grant data was public. Thousands of participants were involved. Surely some auditors must have seen isolated traces of the fraud. But no one connected the dots.\nMy research, combined with a timely nudge, eventually prompted the SEC to launch targeted investigations.

The number of outstanding contracts has more than tripled since 2022, while the average daily volume has climbed 44% over the past year, according to data from Cboe.\nTheir popularity is largely tied to the blistering growth in the defined-outcome exchange-traded funds. These ETFs aim to deliver highly specific goals — whether that’s hedging against losses or enhancing income — using options. Assets in such products have swelled more than 60% over the past year to $215 billion, according to Asym 500, with nearly $90 billion of that managed by buffer funds that can reduce downside risk by giving up some potential upside.\nFlex contracts are crucial for building these products, thanks to their ability to let users pick custom strike prices and expiration dates, according to Kaufman, the head of ETFs at $44 billion asset manager Calamos.\n“I cannot reliably or effectively use listed equity options to build a defined outcome strategy,” Kaufman said. “If you went to the listed equity options marketplace, you might not be able to find the exact strike prices that you need.”\nWhile such a-la-carte features are common in over-the-counter derivatives, Flex options retain the benefits of being listed on exchanges and cleared by the Options Clearing Corp. That adds transparency and reduces counterparty credit risk — a key advantage for US ETFs regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which tightly limits credit exposure.\n“Using Flex options, we can now create something that’s exchange traded,” Kaufman said. “That gives you liquidity. You can buy in and out whenever you want, and you can know exactly what your outcome is before you buy.”\nOne particularly popular feature of Flex options is the ability to leave the strike price blank, meaning it automatically executes at the end of the day based on the closing price of the underlying security — for example as a hedge against a 10% drop in the S&P 500 Index.\nDealers can offer more competitive pricing on such contracts because they don’t need to worry about hedging their position dynamically through the day, according to Chad Blank, RBC Capital Markets’ global co-head of flow trading.\nBeyond ETFs\nThere are other uses beyond just ETFs, including so-called synthetic stock borrow and reverse conversion trades, which account for roughly half of Flex option trading, said Henry Schwartz, vice president of derivatives market intelligence at Cboe.\nNormally, US-listed single-stock and ETF options are “American-style,” meaning the holder can exercise them any time they like. That can cause complications for investors trying to maintain a hedge for a specific period of time.\nFlex options, on the other hand, can be “European-style,” where the contracts can be exercised only at the expiration date. That eliminates the possibility of early exercise and ensures positions remain in place until closed or expired.\nHedge funds “prefer the European style options, because then there’s just no chance of an early assignment and no chance their trade gets morphed into something else,” Schwartz said.\nShort sellers betting against a stock often turn to Flex contracts to build a synthetic short position by buying a put and selling a call at the same strike price. That allows them to avoid going through a stock loan desk, with the cost of borrow instead embedded in the option premiums.\nHere are some examples of Flex options with bespoke strikes and expiration dates that traded Friday:\nThis is particularly valuable when a stock is hard to borrow — if there is high demand from short sellers and limited supply — which can lead to unstable or prohibitively high costs. According to Schwartz, Circle Internet Group Inc., Wolfspeed Inc. and Paramount Skydance Corp. are among the companies with sizable outstanding Flex options. They’re all hard to borrow names.\nFlex options are also increasingly used in reverse conversion trades that give an alternative method of financing a stock position while locking that in for a specific time horizon.\nRisk arbitragers often use this multi-leg package — long stock, long put, short call — to structure bets on complex deals and tender offers because they need the trade to stick through the deadline of the offers. In recent years, that was seen in situations including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s conversion of preferred stock into common shares and Johnson & Johnson’s split-off of its $40 billion stake in Kenvue Inc.\n“That business is seemingly going to increase just because the desks that are using it, they love it, and there are more people figuring out that there’s a more efficient way to locate stock,” Schwartz added.\nThe bespoke expiration dates lets a client isolate protection for specific events such as earnings, Blank noted. That mirrors the precision of major index and ETF options, which have expiry dates every day of the week.\nSmall But Growing\nTo be sure, Flex options are still a drop in the ocean compared with listed equity derivatives, representing just 2% of total volume on a typical day, according to Cboe data. They’re not for the casual trader as they typically come with more brokerage and execution fees.\nOn the other side of the trading spectrum, some seasoned hedge funds might still prefer over-the-counter trades to keep their moves under the radar. And to brokers and other intermediaries, a lingering concern is that this product might eat into their profitable business of bilateral contracts.\nBut banks and clients are getting more adept at putting these trades on, according to Alex Kosoglyadov, managing director for equity derivatives at Nomura Holdings Inc.\n“It is getting easier to book Flex options trades,” Kosoglyadov said. “There is definitely more awareness of the product.”\nMeanwhile, at RBC, the Flex options business of Blank’s desk has increased “in orders of magnitude” over the past couple of years as demand from ETF providers has risen, he said.\n“Growth has exploded,” Blank said.\n--With assistance from Carly Wanna and Christian Dass.", "content_hash": "b5c1fce75293d2e0c3dfa6c330a10ffb", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

This allows them to avoid direct competition from larger pharmaceutical companies.\nThat's not exactly the strategy Viking Therapeutics(NASDAQ: VKTX) chose. The mid-cap biotech is working on weight loss therapies, an increasingly competitive market dominated by Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk, as well as numerous other well-established players in the industry seeking to enter the space.\nGoing up against these giants is no small challenge, but Viking is, so far, holding its own. And if it can play its cards right, its stock could soar by the end of the year and go on to generate strong returns from then on out. Here's more on Viking Therapeutics.\nEli Lilly's setback creates an opportunity\nViking Therapeutics' shares soared last year following the release of strong phase 2 data for its subcutaneous weight management candidate, VK2735. The stock has declined significantly since that milestone, although it's not due to anything Viking did wrong. Broader market volatility, combined with long-term shareholders taking some profits, is likely responsible for the stock's 40% drop over the trailing-12-month period.\nVK2735 is currently in phase 3 studies, but Viking is also developing an oral version of the medicine, which is in phase 2 clinical trials. There is a race to develop a highly effective oral GLP-1 anti-obesity therapy, since the current market leaders are administered via subcutaneous injection. If Viking Therapeutics' oral candidate can impress in mid-stage studies, the stock could soar.\nThat's especially the case since Eli Lilly's investigational oral GLP-1 medicine, orforglipron, failed to perform as well as expected in a phase 3 study in obese or overweight patients who didn't have diabetes. Orforglipron led to a mean weight loss of 12.4% in a 72-week study, which wasn't as impressive as the market wanted. This result paled in comparison to Lilly's injectable Zepbound, which led to an average weight loss of 20.2% in a phase 3 study.\nViking Therapeutics' shares jumped on the pharmaceutical giant's bad news, but there's plenty of upside left if its oral weight loss candidate meets Wall Street's expectations.\nIt's best to start small\nEli Lilly is perceived as the leader in the weight management market. The company's continued dominance in this field was likely somewhat baked into investor expectations, requiring it to deliver outstanding clinical trial results to justify its share price. Viking is a much smaller drugmaker than Lilly, so the market will likely have lower expectations for its data readouts for VK2735.\nViking also has several other exciting candidates. The company is working on a drug called VK2809, a potential therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which produced solid results in phase 2 studies. There is a vast unmet need in MASH, considering several million people have the disease, yet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved just a single medication for it.\nElsewhere, Viking has a next-gen anti-obesity candidate that could soon start human clinical trials. The company has a lot going on, and if VK2735-related developments remain strong through the end of the year, the stock could soar.\nHowever, Viking -- like any clinical-stage biotech company -- is a somewhat risky bet. On the one hand, it has generated strong mid-stage data for two separate medicines that address high unmet needs. Its leading candidate, VK2735, has the potential to become a blockbuster; that's impressive. Even so, the stock will plummet if VK2735 encounters clinical setbacks.\nSo, should you buy shares? In my view, it depends on your level of risk tolerance. Risk-averse investors should look elsewhere. If you're comfortable with a bit of volatility, you should seriously consider the stock; however, it would be wise to start by initiating a small position. If the data from the ongoing phase 2 study for oral VK2735 is good, it might be worth adding even more shares thereafter.\nShould you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Viking Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

But the truth was more mundane—and more troubling. Companies were retroactively selecting grant dates that coincided with low stock prices, effectively locking in instant, unearned gains. This allowed executives to buy shares at a discount while maintaining the illusion that they had to earn the discount by lifting the stock price.\nThe simplicity of the scheme\nWhat made the fraud so insidious was its simplicity. Backdating didn’t require complex financial engineering or elaborate cover-ups. It was a quiet manipulation of paperwork—choosing a date in the past when the stock price was low and pretending that was the day the options were granted.\nThat simplicity likely contributed to its spread. There’s evidence that individuals on multiple boards passed along the practice. But even isolated executives and directors could easily conceive the scheme, much like someone backdating a check to make it appear they paid a bill on time.\nHidden in plain sight\nWhat struck me most was that backdating went unnoticed for at least a decade. It was a silent epidemic of opportunism. The option grant data was public. Thousands of participants were involved. Surely some auditors must have seen isolated traces of the fraud. But no one connected the dots.\nMy research, combined with a timely nudge, eventually prompted the SEC to launch targeted investigations. Journalists followed, including a team at The Wall Street Journal with the time, resources, and incentives to pursue the story. Their work earned the paper its first Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.", "content_hash": "a4e94b50e8a26009ee994ac1ed109508", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The number of outstanding contracts has more than tripled since 2022, while the average daily volume has climbed 44% over the past year, according to data from Cboe.\nTheir popularity is largely tied to the blistering growth in the defined-outcome exchange-traded funds. These ETFs aim to deliver highly specific goals — whether that’s hedging against losses or enhancing income — using options. Assets in such products have swelled more than 60% over the past year to $215 billion, according to Asym 500, with nearly $90 billion of that managed by buffer funds that can reduce downside risk by giving up some potential upside.\nFlex contracts are crucial for building these products, thanks to their ability to let users pick custom strike prices and expiration dates, according to Kaufman, the head of ETFs at $44 billion asset manager Calamos.\n“I cannot reliably or effectively use listed equity options to build a defined outcome strategy,” Kaufman said. “If you went to the listed equity options marketplace, you might not be able to find the exact strike prices that you need.”\nWhile such a-la-carte features are common in over-the-counter derivatives, Flex options retain the benefits of being listed on exchanges and cleared by the Options Clearing Corp. That adds transparency and reduces counterparty credit risk — a key advantage for US ETFs regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which tightly limits credit exposure.\n“Using Flex options, we can now create something that’s exchange traded,” Kaufman said. “That gives you liquidity. You can buy in and out whenever you want, and you can know exactly what your outcome is before you buy.”\nOne particularly popular feature of Flex options is the ability to leave the strike price blank, meaning it automatically executes at the end of the day based on the closing price of the underlying security — for example as a hedge against a 10% drop in the S&P 500 Index.\nDealers can offer more competitive pricing on such contracts because they don’t need to worry about hedging their position dynamically through the day, according to Chad Blank, RBC Capital Markets’ global co-head of flow trading.\nBeyond ETFs\nThere are other uses beyond just ETFs, including so-called synthetic stock borrow and reverse conversion trades, which account for roughly half of Flex option trading, said Henry Schwartz, vice president of derivatives market intelligence at Cboe.\nNormally, US-listed single-stock and ETF options are “American-style,” meaning the holder can exercise them any time they like. That can cause complications for investors trying to maintain a hedge for a specific period of time.\nFlex options, on the other hand, can be “European-style,” where the contracts can be exercised only at the expiration date. That eliminates the possibility of early exercise and ensures positions remain in place until closed or expired.\nHedge funds “prefer the European style options, because then there’s just no chance of an early assignment and no chance their trade gets morphed into something else,” Schwartz said.\nShort sellers betting against a stock often turn to Flex contracts to build a synthetic short position by buying a put and selling a call at the same strike price. That allows them to avoid going through a stock loan desk, with the cost of borrow instead embedded in the option premiums.\nHere are some examples of Flex options with bespoke strikes and expiration dates that traded Friday:\nThis is particularly valuable when a stock is hard to borrow — if there is high demand from short sellers and limited supply — which can lead to unstable or prohibitively high costs. According to Schwartz, Circle Internet Group Inc., Wolfspeed Inc. and Paramount Skydance Corp. are among the companies with sizable outstanding Flex options. They’re all hard to borrow names.\nFlex options are also increasingly used in reverse conversion trades that give an alternative method of financing a stock position while locking that in for a specific time horizon.\nRisk arbitragers often use this multi-leg package — long stock, long put, short call — to structure bets on complex deals and tender offers because they need the trade to stick through the deadline of the offers. In recent years, that was seen in situations including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.’s conversion of preferred stock into common shares and Johnson & Johnson’s split-off of its $40 billion stake in Kenvue Inc.\n“That business is seemingly going to increase just because the desks that are using it, they love it, and there are more people figuring out that there’s a more efficient way to locate stock,” Schwartz added.\nThe bespoke expiration dates lets a client isolate protection for specific events such as earnings, Blank noted. That mirrors the precision of major index and ETF options, which have expiry dates every day of the week.\nSmall But Growing\nTo be sure, Flex options are still a drop in the ocean compared with listed equity derivatives, representing just 2% of total volume on a typical day, according to Cboe data. They’re not for the casual trader as they typically come with more brokerage and execution fees.\nOn the other side of the trading spectrum, some seasoned hedge funds might still prefer over-the-counter trades to keep their moves under the radar. And to brokers and other intermediaries, a lingering concern is that this product might eat into their profitable business of bilateral contracts.\nBut banks and clients are getting more adept at putting these trades on, according to Alex Kosoglyadov, managing director for equity derivatives at Nomura Holdings Inc.\n“It is getting easier to book Flex options trades,” Kosoglyadov said. “There is definitely more awareness of the product.”\nMeanwhile, at RBC, the Flex options business of Blank’s desk has increased “in orders of magnitude” over the past couple of years as demand from ETF providers has risen, he said.\n“Growth has exploded,” Blank said.\n--With assistance from Carly Wanna and Christian Dass.", "content_hash": "b5c1fce75293d2e0c3dfa6c330a10ffb", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

This allows them to avoid direct competition from larger pharmaceutical companies.\nThat's not exactly the strategy Viking Therapeutics(NASDAQ: VKTX) chose. The mid-cap biotech is working on weight loss therapies, an increasingly competitive market dominated by Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk, as well as numerous other well-established players in the industry seeking to enter the space.\nGoing up against these giants is no small challenge, but Viking is, so far, holding its own. And if it can play its cards right, its stock could soar by the end of the year and go on to generate strong returns from then on out. Here's more on Viking Therapeutics.\nEli Lilly's setback creates an opportunity\nViking Therapeutics' shares soared last year following the release of strong phase 2 data for its subcutaneous weight management candidate, VK2735. The stock has declined significantly since that milestone, although it's not due to anything Viking did wrong. Broader market volatility, combined with long-term shareholders taking some profits, is likely responsible for the stock's 40% drop over the trailing-12-month period.\nVK2735 is currently in phase 3 studies, but Viking is also developing an oral version of the medicine, which is in phase 2 clinical trials. There is a race to develop a highly effective oral GLP-1 anti-obesity therapy, since the current market leaders are administered via subcutaneous injection. If Viking Therapeutics' oral candidate can impress in mid-stage studies, the stock could soar.\nThat's especially the case since Eli Lilly's investigational oral GLP-1 medicine, orforglipron, failed to perform as well as expected in a phase 3 study in obese or overweight patients who didn't have diabetes. Orforglipron led to a mean weight loss of 12.4% in a 72-week study, which wasn't as impressive as the market wanted. This result paled in comparison to Lilly's injectable Zepbound, which led to an average weight loss of 20.2% in a phase 3 study.\nViking Therapeutics' shares jumped on the pharmaceutical giant's bad news, but there's plenty of upside left if its oral weight loss candidate meets Wall Street's expectations.\nIt's best to start small\nEli Lilly is perceived as the leader in the weight management market. The company's continued dominance in this field was likely somewhat baked into investor expectations, requiring it to deliver outstanding clinical trial results to justify its share price. Viking is a much smaller drugmaker than Lilly, so the market will likely have lower expectations for its data readouts for VK2735.\nViking also has several other exciting candidates. The company is working on a drug called VK2809, a potential therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which produced solid results in phase 2 studies. There is a vast unmet need in MASH, considering several million people have the disease, yet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved just a single medication for it.\nElsewhere, Viking has a next-gen anti-obesity candidate that could soon start human clinical trials. The company has a lot going on, and if VK2735-related developments remain strong through the end of the year, the stock could soar.\nHowever, Viking -- like any clinical-stage biotech company -- is a somewhat risky bet. On the one hand, it has generated strong mid-stage data for two separate medicines that address high unmet needs. Its leading candidate, VK2735, has the potential to become a blockbuster; that's impressive. Even so, the stock will plummet if VK2735 encounters clinical setbacks.\nSo, should you buy shares? In my view, it depends on your level of risk tolerance. Risk-averse investors should look elsewhere. If you're comfortable with a bit of volatility, you should seriously consider the stock; however, it would be wise to start by initiating a small position. If the data from the ongoing phase 2 study for oral VK2735 is good, it might be worth adding even more shares thereafter.\nShould you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Viking Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

During the pandemic, these companies had to take on a huge amount of debt and sell equity, diluting their shareholders, to raise cash and ride out COVID-19.\nBut in the post-pandemic world, the cruise industry has been incredibly strong, initially due to \"revenge\" travel and the need for experiences. But even after inflation and interest rates spiked in 2022, the cruise industry held up very well, showing perhaps a longer-term growth trend. Cruising is also a more efficient form of travel than staying in hotels, which have gotten more expensive.\nDespite the strong recent results, these companies are still digging themselves out of their debt holes, which could lead to further upside as they pay down debt and de-lever their balance sheets.\nTwo leaders in the space are Carnival(NYSE: CCL), the oldest publicly traded cruise stock, having been on the stock market since 1987, and Viking Holdings(NYSE: VIK), the newest public cruise stock, having just had its initial public offering (IPO) in June.\nWhich is the better buy today for those looking to play the continued recovery of cruise stocks? The experienced veteran or new kid on the block?\nBoth companies are hitting it out of the park\nThere appears to be great strength across the cruise industry, with both companies posting terrific recent numbers. Off of a very strong 2024, Carnival grew revenue 9.5% last quarter, but with a massive inflection in profitability as adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share more than tripled.\nNot only that, Carnival CEO Josh Weinstein noted that Carnival had already achieved its 2026 SEA Change operational and financial targets it had set for itself two years ago, 18 months ahead of schedule. Those targets included operational goals around sustainability, the important profit-centered metrics of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) per available lower berth day (ALBD), and return on invested capital (ROIC).\nAs of the second quarter of 2025, EBITDA per ALBD had grown 52%, and ROIC had more than doubled to 12.5% over just the past two years. That's really impressive, owing to Carnival's pricing actions, capacity restraint, and a focus on costs.\nBut Carnival isn't the only cruise company reporting impressive results. In its first quarter, Viking impressed investors with revenue growth of 24.9% on the back of a 7.1% increase in net yields and a 14.9% increase in capacity. Net yields are essentially the direct profits per customer, equaling net revenues per available passenger cruise day minus the costs of travel commissions, transportation, and onboard costs.\nViking's management also forecasted good times ahead, noting that it was basically sold out for 2025, and 37% of capacity was already booked for 2026 -- ahead of where the company was with forward bookings at this point last year.\nBut Viking's debt picture looks much better than Carnival's\nSo, both companies appear to be on a good path operationally. But for the foreseeable future, these companies will be devoting most or all of their profits to paying down their COVID-era debt.\nOn that front, Viking appears to be in a much better position. Today, its debt sits at 2.0 times its trailing EBITDA as of March 31, while Carnival's debt-to-EBITDA ratio sat at a higher 3.7 times as of May 31.\nIt's not entirely clear why Viking came out of the pandemic with a lower debt load than Carnival. It could be that since Viking was a private company before 2020, it hadn't taken on the leverage to repurchase stock as aggressively as Carnival had done as a public company in the years leading up to the pandemic.\nIt could also have something to do with each company's business model. Carnival is largely in the business of ocean cruises all over the world across a number of brands. Viking is largely engaged in river cruises, mostly in Europe, and focuses on older cruise enthusiasts, who tend to be less economically sensitive. Viking also has ocean cruises, but those ships totaled only about 12% of its capacity last quarter.\nBut Viking's valuation has already taken off\nOn the back of strong results, both stocks have done well in recent months. However, Viking has done extraordinarily well, with the stock having appreciated 150% from its June $24 IPO price to $60 as of this writing. Carnival has also had a strong recent run, with the stock up nearly 23% on the year.\nStill, Viking's run has caused its valuation to soar much higher than Carnival's, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and forward enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV-to-EBITDA) ratio of 24.5 and 16.9, respectively. Meanwhile, Carnival is much cheaper, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 15.3. And while Carnival does sport a higher debt load, even its forward EV-to-EBITDA ratio, which accounts for debt, is much lower, at 8.8 times this year's EBITDA estimates.\nGetting what you pay for\nAs it stands now, it appears that investors are paying fairly for what they're getting. Viking's less-risky business model and lower debt load have led to a much higher valuation. And since it's in a better balance sheet position, it's also able to expand capacity faster than Carnival, as evidenced by last quarter's growth rates.\nMeanwhile, Carnival looks cheaper on all metrics, significantly so, but it also has a debt load nearly twice that of Viking's relative to each company's EBITDA. And because it has to pay down its debt, management isn't expanding capacity as fast as it probably would otherwise.\nThus, each stock could still be a buy if you believe in the continued strength of the cruise industry. Viking may be the better play for growth-oriented investors, with its near-25% growth rate and relatively lower risk. But for value investors, Carnival may be the better play here, as its lower valuation could get a rerating as the company continues to pay down its sizable COVID-era debt load, which would de-risk its story.\nDo the experts think Carnival Corp. is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

One of the main beneficiaries has been graphics processing unit (GPU) maker Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). As of Aug. 14, Nvidia sits as the world's most valuable public company, with a market cap of over $4.4 trillion. It's the first company to cross the $4 trillion mark.\nNvidia first went public in January 1999, but the past few years have been what have ascended the company into elite territory -- and it has made many investors a lot of money along the way.

Nvidia has over a 90% market share of data center GPUs, which are critical to the AI ecosystem. Nvidia's GPUs allow companies to train, deploy, and scale AI models efficiently. Their capabilities have made Nvidia the go-to.\nIn Nvidia's fiscal first quarter (ended April 27), its revenue increased 69% year over year to $44.1 billion.

To put that into perspective, no other company is even worth $4 trillion today.\nThe huge surge in value for the maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) stems from a few big tech companies spending hundreds of billions on its chips every year. The four biggest hyperscalers are set to spend around $380 billion on AI infrastructure this year, and they have guided for significant steps up in spending next year.\nNvidia is set to be the prime beneficiary of that increased spending for some time, but that doesn't mean the stock will continue to climb. Market prices are based on what investors expect in the future, and the expectations for Nvidia remain high.\nBut two other AI stocks look like they could surpass investor expectations, pushing both companies to exceed Nvidia's value by 2030.\nCan Nvidia keep climbing from here?\nContinued growth in AI spending is giving investors more and more confidence that Nvidia can keep up its torrid sales growth.\nThe three main public cloud providers all reiterated that demand exceeds computing capacity, which means they will continue to spend growing amounts to meet their customers' needs. Meanwhile, Nvidia is selling chips as fast as it can make them. That led to a 69% rise in revenue in the company's first quarter, and a 59% increase in adjusted income.\nBut it's unlikely to see growth continue at this pace. All four hyperscalers are working on custom silicon solutions for their own AI training. Microsoft is reportedly planning to shift a significant portion of its spending to its Maia300 chip in late 2026. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is working on expanding the AI workloads that its custom Meta Training and Inference Accelerating (MTIA) chips can handle.\nInvestors should expect a significant slowdown in sales as Nvidia faces fierce competition for its share of data center servers and it battles with the law of large numbers. As supply-demand forces reach equilibrium, the chipmaker might not be able to command such high gross margins, either. That could weigh on earnings growth.\nBut with the stock currently trading at more than 42 times forward earnings, investors seem to think those risks aren't going to materialize. I think it's more likely they will keep Nvidia from continuing to outperform the market at such a torrid pace, limiting how much more upside there is from here.\nIf investors want to buy shares of a big tech company capitalizing on the growth of AI, the following two industry giants present better value with more upside. In fact, I expect they will both be worth more than Nvidia by 2030.\n1. Amazon\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the largest provider of public cloud computing in the world with Amazon Web Services (AWS), making it one of Nvidia's biggest customers. While the company was caught flat-footed as generative AI took off in 2022, management quickly caught up with the competition thanks in part to its investment in Anthropic.\nManagement continues to see strong demand for its AI services, with revenue more than doubling year over year. However, AWS's scale has masked that strong growth.\nThe cloud services segment generated $116 billion in revenue over the last 12 months. That's roughly 55% larger than its next closest competitor, Microsoft. But AWS's 17% year-over-year growth looks disappointing compared to Microsoft's 39% growth in cloud services last quarter. Nonetheless, Amazon has mostly kept its market share despite strong growth by its competitors.\nWhat's more important is that the margin profile on AWS is extremely strong. The operating margin of 36.8% over the last 12 months is up from 33.4% a year ago. And while it took a dip in the second quarter, that's due to the timing of share-based compensation. The long-term trend shows continued improvement in margins.\nMeanwhile, Amazon's retail business is becoming very profitable in its own right. The North American segment saw its operating margin climb to 7% last quarter while the international segment's margin came in at 3.4%. Strong top-line growth of 11% for both helped, which was bolstered by high-margin ad revenue growth of 22%.\nThe long-term trends favor steady revenue growth across Amazon's businesses with particular strength in its high-margin operations (namely AWS and advertising). That should result in earnings growth well above average.\nAnd as its spending growth on AWS slows down, free cash flow should rise to new records by the end of the decade. That gives the company more opportunities to invest for growth, just as it has managed to do throughout its history. The stock currently looks attractive amid a small pullback in price.\n2. Meta Platforms\nMeta is another major Nvidia customer, but unlike Amazon, it only uses Nvidia chips for its own AI needs. In fact, it might be spending more on its own AI needs than any other company in the world. And Meta's second-quarter results are a clear example of why it's willing to spend so much.\nSales grew 22% last quarter, and its operating margin expanded 5 percentage points. For some perspective, that's faster revenue growth than both Snap and Pinterest despite being a much bigger force in social media advertising. Meta's AI capabilities are a clear reason for the outperformance.\nArtificial intelligence has led to better recommendations for both advertisements and organic content. As a result, the company served up more ads and was able to command higher pricing per ad impression. Meanwhile, it's seeing strong uptake of its generative AI tools for ad creation, which makes it easier for marketers to create and test new ideas.\nThere are a number of other opportunities that AI could unlock. Those include AI chatbots for businesses in WhatsApp and Messenger, which could drive increased click-to-message ads in Facebook and Instagram.\nAnd management has said its Meta AI chatbot built into its apps now has 1 billion monthly active users, giving it yet another surface to monetize with ads. It only recently started showing ads in WhatsApp and Threads. That should give it room to grow supply as demand increases due to its generative AI tools making advertising easier.\nLastly, Meta is at the forefront of development in augmented and virtual reality. AI can unlock a lot of value in an environment that's also aware of your surroundings. The company has already seen strong early adoption of its Meta Glasses with AI built in.\nShares look very attractive with an enterprise value around 16 times forward estimates on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). While depreciation of its data centers will weigh on its margins, the company is proving the investments are paying off with very strong revenue growth and by unlocking a lot of potential profits in the long run.\nDo the experts think Amazon is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.
