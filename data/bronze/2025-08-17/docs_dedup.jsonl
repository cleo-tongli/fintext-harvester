He explained that he originally wanted a 20% cut of Nvidia’s sales in exchange for the company obtaining export licenses to sell H20 chip to China, but he was persuaded to settle at 15%. The H20 chip is “obsolete,” Trump added … “he’s selling a essentially old chip.”\nThe chips do appear to be quite significant to China, considering that the Cyberspace Administration of China held discussions with Nvidia over security concerns that the H20 chips may be tracked and turned off remotely, according to a disclosure on its website. The deal, which lifted an export ban on Nvidia’s H20 AI chips and AMD’s MI308, and followed heated negotiations, was widely described as unusual and also still theoretical at this point, with the legal details still being ironed out by the Department of Commerce. Legal experts have questioned whether the eventual deal would constitute an unconstitutional export tax, as the U.S. Constitution prohibits duties on exports. This has come to be known as the “export clause” of the constitution.\nIndeed, it’s hard to find much precedent for it anywhere in the history of the U.S. government’s dealings with the corporate sector. Erik Jensen, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who has studied the history of the export clause, told Fortune he was not aware of anything like this in history. In the 1990s, he added, the Supreme Court struck down two attempted taxes on export clause grounds (cases known as IBM and U.S. Shoe). Jensen said tax practitioners were surprised that the court took up the cases: “if only because most pay no attention to constitutional limitations, and the Court hadn’t heard any export clause cases in about 70 years.” The takeaway was clear, Jensen said: “The export clause matters.”\nColumbia Law School professor Eric Talley agreed with Jensen, telling Fortune that while the federal government has previously applied subsidies to exports, he’s not aware of other historical cases imposing taxes on selected exporters. Talley also cited the export clause as the usual grounds for finding such arrangements unconstitutional.\nRather than downplaying the uniqueness of the arrangement, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been leaning into it. In a Bloomberg television interview, he said: “I think you know, right now, this is unique. But now that we have the model and the beta test, why not expand it? I think we could see it in other industries over time.”\nBessent and the White House insist there are “no national security concerns,” since only less-advanced chips are being sold to China. Instead, officials have touted the deal as a creative solution to balance trade, technology, and national policy.\nThe arrangement has drawn sharp reaction from business leaders, legal experts, and trade analysts. Julia Powles, director of UCLA’s Institute for Technology, Law & Policy, told the Los Angeles Times: “It ties the fate of this chip manufacturer in a very particular way to this administration, which is quite rare.” Experts warned that if replicated, this template could pressure other firms—not just tech giants—into similar arrangements with the government. Already, several unprecedented arrangements have been struck between the Trump administration and the corporate sector, ranging from the “golden share” in U.S. Steel negotiated as part of its takeover by Japan’s Nippon Steel to the federal government reportedly discussing buying a stake in chipmaker Intel.\nNvidia and AMD have declined to comment on specifics. When contacted by Fortune for comment, Nvidia reiterated its statement that it follows rules the U.S. government sets for its participation in worldwide markets. “While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide. America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America’s AI tech stack can be the world’s standard if we race.”\nThe White House declined to comment about the potential deal. AMD did not respond to a request for comment.\nWhile Washington has often intervened in business—especially in times of crisis—the mechanism and magnitude of the Nvidia\/AMD deal are virtually unprecedented in recent history. The federal government appears to have never previously claimed a percentage of corporate revenue from export sales as a precondition for market access. Instead, previous actions took the form of temporary nationalization, regulatory control, subsidies, or bailouts—often during war or economic emergency. Examples of this include the seizure of coal mines (1946) and steel mills (1952) during labor strikes, as well as the 2008 financial crisis bailouts, where the government took equity stakes in large corporations including two of Detroit’s Big three and most of Wall Street’s key banks. During World War I, the War Industries Board regulated prices, production, and business conduct for the war effort.\nCongress has previously created export incentives and tax-deferral strategies (such as the Domestic International Sales Corporation and Foreign Sales Corporation Acts), but these measures incentivized sales rather than directly diverting a fixed share of export revenue to the government. Legal scholars stress that such arrangements were subjected to global trade rules and later modified after international complaints.\nThe U.S. prohibition on export taxes dates back to the birth of the nation. Case Western’s Jensen has written that some delegates of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, such as New York’s Alexander Hamilton, were in favor of the government being able to tax revenue sources such as imports and exports, but the “staple states” in the southern U.S. were fiercely opposed, given their agricultural bent, especially the importance of cotton at that point.\nStill, many other countries currently have export taxes on the books, though they are generally imposed across all exporters, rather than as one-off arrangements that remove barriers to a specific market. And many of the nations with export taxes are developing countries who tax agricultural or resource commodities. In several cases (Uganda, Malaya, Sudan, Nigeria, Haiti, Thailand), export taxes made up 10% to 40% of total government tax revenue in the 1960s and 1970s, according to an IMF staff paper.\nGlobally, most countries tax profits generated within their borders (“source-based corporate taxes”), but rarely as a direct percentage of export sales as a market access precondition. The standard model is taxation of locally earned profits, regardless of export destination; licensing fees and tariffs may be applied, but not usually as a fixed percent of export revenue as a pre-negotiated entry fee.\nAlthough the Nvidia\/AMD deal doesn’t take the usual form of a tax, Case Western’s Jensen added. “I don’t see what else it could be characterized as.” It’s clearly not a “user fee,” which he said is the usual triable issue of law in export clause cases. For instance, if goods or services are being provided by the government in exchange for the charge, such as docking fees at a governmentally operated port, then that charge isn’t a tax or duty and the Export Clause is irrelevant. “I just don’t see how the charges that will be levied in the chip cases could possibly be characterized in that way.”\nPlayers have been known to “game” the different legal treatments of subsidies and taxes, Columbia’s Talley added. He cited the example of a government imposing a uniform, across-the-board tax on all producers, but then providing a subsidy to sellers who sell to domestic markets. “The net effect would be the same as a tax on exports, but indirectly.” He was unaware of this happening in the U.S. but cited several international examples including Argentina, India, and even the EU.\nOne famous example of a canny international tax strategy was Apple’s domicile in Ireland, along with so many other multinationals keeping their international profits offshore in affiliates in order to avoid paying U.S. tax, which at the time applied to all worldwide income upon repatriation. Talley said much of this went away after the 2018 tax reforms, which moved the U.S. away from a worldwide corporate tax, with some exceptions.\nIf Trump’s chip export tax is an anomaly in the annals of U.S. international trade, the deal structure has some parallels in another corner of the business world: organized crime, where “protection rackets” have a long history. Businesses bound by such deals must pay a cut of their revenues to a criminal organization (or parallel government), effectively as the cost for being allowed to operate or to avoid harm.\nThe China chip export tax and the protection rackets extract revenue as a condition for market access, use the threat of exclusion or punishment for non-payment, and both may be justified as “protection” or “guaranteed access,” but are not freely negotiated by the business.\n“It certainly has the smell of a governmental shakedown in certain respects,” Columbia’s Talley told Fortune, considering that the “underlying threat was an outright export ban, which makes a 15% surcharge seem palatable by comparison.”\nTalley noted some nuances, such as the generally established broad statutory and constitutional support for national-security-based export bans on various goods and services sold to enumerated countries, which have been imposed with legal authority on China, North Korea, Iraq, Russia, Cuba, and others. “From an economic perspective, a ban on an exported good is tantamount to a tax of ‘infinity percent’ on the good,” Talley said, meaning it effectively shuts down the export market for that good. “Viewed in that light, a 15% levy is less (and not more) extreme than a ban.”\nStill, there’s the matter, similar to Trump’s tariff regime, of making a legal challenge to an ostensibly blatantly illegal policy actually hold up in court. “A serious question with the chips tax,” Case Western’s Jensen told Fortune, “is who, if anyone, would have standing to challenge the tax?” In other words, it may be unconstitutional, but who’s actually going to compel the federal government to obey the constitution?\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","content_hash":"1b3d4e0e655524873a220b0416bd2a7d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":10395,"method_rank":0}

Move all stocks and bonds onto a blockchain, or create digital versions of them that can be traded, transferred and tracked using the same technology powering cryptocurrencies.\nSupporters say this approach could make markets more efficient by speeding up transactions, lowering costs and expanding access for investors around the world. But turning that vision into reality may still be a long way off.\n“A widespread shift from the current trading system to an exclusive blockchain-based system would be a real paradigm shift that would require changes up and down issuers, intermediaries, investors, throughout the whole securities-trading ecosystem — and I think that would take a lot of time to develop the right systems and to put into place,” said Marc Rotter, capital-markets counsel at law firm Ropes & Gray.\nStill, optimism is growing — fueled in part by Paul Atkins, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, who last month announced a new crypto agenda aimed at “moderniz[ing] the securities rules and regulations to enable America’s financial markets to move on-chain,” he said in remarks\nThat vision has some crypto bulls convinced the shift could happen sooner than many expect. “I would say definitely within the next five years —probably sooner, closer to two — I think large financial players will end up tokenizing [stocks and bonds],” said Thomas Cowan, head of tokenization at crypto financial-services firm Galaxy.\nOthers are more cautious. Trish O’Donnell, a partner at law firm Reed Smith, said she thinks tokenization could be the future, but called it “a generational switch.” It could take decades for market participants who are used to the traditional financial system to move fully to one built on blockchain, she noted.\nWhile companies including Robinhood HOOD, Kraken and Bybit have launched stock tokens this year targeting investors outside the U.S., these are not actual stocks. Instead, they’re “wrapped” versions, analysts said. In practice, that means the exchange buys the real shares from a broker-dealer when an investor purchases a stock token, and sells those shares when they dispose of the token.\nThese products may face issues like low liquidity during off-market hours, no shareholder rights and the risk of depegging, according to Rob Hadick, general partner at crypto venture-capital firm Dragonfly.\nMeanwhile, although Wall Street heavyweights such as BlackRock BLK, Apollo Global Management APO and Franklin Templeton BEN have launched tokenized funds focused on U.S. Treasurys, money markets and credit, they face far fewer hurdles than they would with tokenizing public equities and corporate bonds, noted Justin Browder, partner at law firm Simpson Thacher.\nInvestors in such funds are also concentrated in digital-asset firms, which are not the traditional investor base for these assets, noted Louis LaValle, chief executive and co-founder at crypto investment manager Frontier Investments. Most firms buying tokenized money-market funds are using them as collateral, but the majority of traditional brokerage firms don’t accept them because they lack the necessary digital infrastructure, LaValle said in a phone interview.\nHere are the changes experts say are needed for true tokenization, whereby stocks and bonds primarily operate on a blockchain, to become a reality.\nRegulatory changes\nTo start with, there need to be a wide range of regulatory updates, Browder said.\n“A number of SEC rules, in particular, don’t contemplate transactions on a blockchain. They assume the existing market structure, which is an intermediated system where transactions flow through a central clearinghouse,” Browder noted.\nOne example is Reg NMS, or the Regulation National Market System, a set of SEC rules adopted in 2005 aiming to ensure fair pricing and transparency across different trading venues. The rules are built for the existing market structure, whereby investors trade through a broker-dealer while a clearinghouse handles settlement. A broker-dealer is a firm or individual licensed to buy and sell securities either for clients or for its own account, while a clearinghouse ensures that trades between buyers and sellers are settled accurately and on time.\nThe rules work well for today’s stock market because it relies on middlemen to route trades, collect data and publish prices to ensure all market participants can understand what’s a good value for a particular security, noted Browder. But in a peer-to-peer setup like blockchain-based trading, where people can deal directly without intermediaries, there’s no central source for tracking and sharing prices. That makes it unclear how Reg NMS’s rules on fairness and transparency would still work, Browder said.\nWhat’s more, if a company wants to record its issued shares on a blockchain today, its transfer agent still has to keep the official records off-chain, while also maintaining a duplicate ledger on the blockchain, said Seoyoung Kim, a finance professor at Santa Clara University with expertise in cryptocurrencies. Transfer agents are the official recordkeepers for a company’s stocks or bonds, tracking who owns them and logging any changes in ownership.\nThat is because the blockchain record is not yet legally recognized as the official source of truth, said Kim.\n“In the longer term, what we really hope to have happen is the blockchain itself become that source of truth,” said Galaxy’s Cowan. In that scenario, the stock or bond tokens people hold would be the actual asset, rather than a digital placeholder for something that primarily operates off-chain, Cowan said in a phone interview.\nStill, Michael Sonnenshein, president of tokenization startup Securitize, said he thinks there is already a clear, regulated path for issuing tokenized securities. The firm has partnered with Apollo to launch a tokenized credit fund; teamed with BlackRock to launch a tokenized money-market fund; and has helped crypto software company Exodus tokenize its shares.\nIt comes down to firms applying for the proper licenses from the SEC, Sonnenshein said, adding that Securitize is one of the “select few” registered as a transfer agent, a broker-dealer and an alternative trading system authorized to engage with tokenized securities. (An alternative trading system is a regulated trading platform that matches buyers and sellers of securities outside of traditional stock exchanges.)\nDigital rails\nIn addition to regulations, existing clearinghouses would also need to be upgraded to operate on the blockchain to encourage more issuance of tokenized securities, according to LaValle.\n“You have to have on-chain clearing and settlement if you want to have tokenized securities. Otherwise it’s like having a brand new wrapper on old rails — it just doesn’t work,” LaValle said.\nAt the moment, even when assets are tokenized, the actual clearing and settlement still happen off the blockchain. In most cases, that means the blockchain record is essentially just a duplicate of the real transaction, which is finalized through the old systems, LaValle noted.\nOnly by innovating clearing and settlement can the benefits of the blockchain truly be realized, according to LaValle. For most stock and bond trades, settlement happens one business day after the trade date. By contrast, blockchains could enable near-instant settlement, cutting down on counterparty risk and freeing up capital much faster, LaValle said.\nExchanges would also have to upgrade their infrastructure to handle the trading of tokenized securities, he added.\nMore adoption\nTo reach a point where the entire financial system operates on the blockchain, every issuer of stocks and bonds would have to agree to not have their securities in physical form and move them entirely onto a blockchain, said Simpson Thacher’s Browder.\n“It’s not necessarily the case that every one of the over 4,000 publicly listed companies out there today [in the U.S.] are going to have an interest in having their securities represented in tokenized form. Those are issues we have to confront if we want to move the whole market on-chain,” Browder noted.\nEven if that hurdle is cleared, there must also be enough liquidity in the secondary market to ensure trading remains efficient, said Frontier’s LaValle. Without active trading, tokenized assets risk becoming illiquid, making them less attractive to investors.\nThat’s why interest from market participants is essential, and why tokenization firms must demonstrate clear, tangible advantages over the traditional system, added Julian Sawyer, CEO at digital-asset platform Zodia Custody.\n“I think where we are at the moment is that a lot of the tokenization projects have not yet really articulated why they are different from the traditional securities,” said Sawyer.\nUltimately, changes in regulation and technology, and participation from broker-dealers and exchanges, will all have to happen in tandem for full-scale tokenization to take hold, LaValle said.\n“If you have the tech without the regulation, there are no rails. If you have the regulation without the tech, or if we don’t have enough market participants or liquidity, it’s not going to happen,” he noted.","content_hash":"c8f6a1dea51570613dedead28ee5667c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":9298,"method_rank":0}

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.22%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -0.44%.\nStocks on Friday saw downward pressure from the weaker-than-expected US consumer sentiment report. Other bearish factors included a +3 bp rise in the 10-year T-note yield and reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts at the next two FOMC meetings. The rest of Friday's US economic news was largely in line with market expectations, and the US retail sales report was supportive of the US economic growth outlook.\nThe markets as of Friday's stock market close were still awaiting the outcome of the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. The outcome could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.\nFriday's headline US retail sales report was slightly weaker than market expectations, but there was an upward revision for June, leaving the report roughly neutral for the markets. The markets welcomed the report amidst worries about how US retail spending will hold up with a weaker labor market and consumer uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook. July US retail sales rose +0.5% m\/m, slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.6%, although June was revised higher to +0.9% from +0.6%. July retail sales ex-autos rose +0.3% m\/m, in line with market expectations and down from June's revised +0.8% (preliminary +0.5%).\nThe University of Michigan's preliminary-Aug US consumer sentiment index fell by -3.1 points to 58.6, which was weaker than expectations for a +0.3 point increase to 62.0. The survey showed that US consumer expectations for inflation rose to +4.9% over the next year and +3.9% for the next 5-10 years. The survey also found that 58% of consumers plan to cut spending due to inflation.\nJuly US import prices rose +0.4% m\/m, stronger than expectations of +0.1%. On a year-on-year basis, July US import prices strengthened to -0.2% from a revised -0.5% y\/y in June. July US import prices ex-petroleum rose +0.3% m\/m versus June's revised -0.2% (preliminary unchanged).\nFriday's July US industrial production report of -0.1% m\/m was slightly weaker than expectations of unchanged, although June was revised upward to +0.4% m\/m from +0.3%. July manufacturing production was unchanged m\/m, matching market expectations, while July was revised higher to +0.3% from +0.1%.\nThe Aug Empire manufacturing index of 11.9 was substantially stronger than market expectations of zero and was up from July's 5.5.\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee delivered mildly hawkish remarks on Friday, stating that he would like to see at least one more inflation report to ensure that persistent inflation pressures aren't emerging. He expressed concern about the high service inflation data in the July CPI report but noted the importance of not placing too much weight on a single month's data.\nThe markets on Friday continued to adjust to the inflation outlook following Thursday's hawkish PPI report. The July final-demand PPI surged to +3.3% y\/y (nominal) and +3.7% y\/y (core). The PPI report suggested that the markets were overly optimistic about Tuesday's CPI report and that companies are passing through tariffs at the wholesale level at a higher pace than earlier thought. Following the report, the markets erased any hopes of a -50 bp rate cut at the Fed's September meeting and pulled back expectations for a -25 bp rate cut to 93% from 100% before the report.\nWeak Chinese economic reports overnight on Friday were negative for the global economic growth outlook. China's economy is weakening due to US tariffs and the Chinese government's attempt to crack down on excessive competition that has driven prices to loss-making levels in some industries. China's July retail sales report of +3.7% y\/y was weaker than expectations of +4.6% and down from June's +4.8%. China's July industrial production report of +5.7% y\/y was weaker than expectations of +6.0% and was down from June's +6.8%. China's July jobless rate rose to 5.2% from June's +5.0% and was higher than expectations. China's July property investment fell -12.0% ytd y\/y from -11.2% in June and was weaker than expectations of -11.4%.\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump on Friday said, \"I'll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we'll be setting sometime next week, week after.\" Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 85% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% on Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 40% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29, down from 53% on Thursday.\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets on Friday closed higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.26%. China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.83% but remained below Thursday's 3.75-year high. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 rallied +1.71% but remained below Wednesday's record high.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Friday fell -5.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +3.3 bp to 4.318%. T-note prices fell on Friday as the University of Michigan's survey showed an increase in consumer inflation expectations and as the market slightly curbed expectations for Fed rate cuts at the next two meetings.\nUnderlying bullish factors on Friday included the weak US consumer sentiment report and the -1.1 bp decline in the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate to 2.385%. The rest of Friday's US economic news was roughly neutral.\nEuropean government bond yields rose. The 10-year German bund yield rose +7.6 bp to 2.788%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose by +5.6 bp to 4.696%.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 5% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nThe Magnificent Seven on Friday closed mixed. The largest decliner was Tesla (TSLA) with a decline of -1.49%. Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta (META) showed modest gains, and Amazon (AMZN) was little changed.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average showed relative strength compared to the broader indexes due to a +12% rally in UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and a +3.9% rally in Salesforce (CRM).\nChip stocks nearly all traded lower on Friday, led by a decline of -14% in Applied Materials, -8.4% in KLA-Tencor (KLAC), and -7.3% in Lam Research (LRCX).\nOn the positive side for the chip sector, Intel (INTC) closed up +2.7% after a Bloomberg report said the Trump administration is investigating using US Chips Act funds to take a US government stake in Intel.\nApplied Materials (AMAT) fell -14% after disappointing management guidance.\nBitcoin (^BTCUSD) fell -0.7%. Crypto stocks moved lower, led by a sell-off of -7.5% in Riot Platforms (RIOT) and -2.2% in Coinbase (COIN).\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH), Lennar (LEN), and DR Horton (DHI) saw support Friday after a 13F filing showed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought shares in the companies during Q2. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) rallied nearly +14% since 13F filings showed that David Tepper's Appaloosa Management also boosted its holdings in the health care insurer.\nSandisk (SNDK) fell -4.6% after issuing disappointing management guidance.\nTarget (TGT) fell -1.2% after a downgrade by Bank of America to underperform from neutral.\nEarnings Reports (8\/18\/2025)\nPalo Alto Networks Inc (PANW), XP Inc (XP).\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Even if only by a penny, in this market environment, anything less than perfection is punishable.\nThat's why its shares are down since last Wednesday's release of the company's second-quarter numbers. Investors briefly tested post-earnings gains, but ultimately decided there was more risk than reward.\nThe market may not be seeing the full picture for this online sports betting site, though. After DraftKings' second-quarter report, there are four reasons I'm even more excited about this stock's long-term upside than I was before, which I will get into below.\nA strong quarter\nThe second-quarter numbers were actually pretty good. DraftKings turned a record-breaking $1.51 billion in revenue into two other record-breaking figures: adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $301 million and net income of $158 million -- or $0.38 per share -- versus a year-ago comparison of $1.1 billion in sales and bottom line of $0.22 per share.\nThe company also broke a few records with this latest quarter's results. Total customer headcount and average revenue per user (ARPU) ticked higher for the three-month stretch. And its full-year sales and EBITDA forecasts still call for healthy growth, unchanged from the first quarter's outlook.\nThe only problem: Analysts were looking for a per-share profit of $0.39. The one-cent miss didn't initially bother investors, who gladly celebrated the sizable beat of revenue estimates of $1.42 billion. Over time, however, the market has increasingly changed its mind; weakness from shares of rival FanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment around this same time helped sway investors.\nAnyone interested in buying DraftKings stock might want to count themselves lucky, though. Last quarter's report could have just as easily been interpreted in a bullish light, rekindling a rally seen in June. There's every reason to believe this ticker has plenty of upside left despite having gone nowhere since early 2024.\nFour reasons I'm bullish on DraftKings\nMost investors understand that when you buy a stock for the long haul, you're actually buying into a business (and even a business premise) rather than buying a bunch of numbers. It's numbers, on the other hand, that prove a company's operation is strategically sound.\nTo this end, there are four quantifiable highlights to draw from DraftKings' second-quarter report and conference call.\n1. Growth remains ridiculously strong\nIf it were just last quarter's top-line growth of 37%, it might be dismissed as a fluke. There was nothing fluky about it, though. This is the sort of growth the company has been producing for years and is expected to continue to do for at least a few more. Ditto for earnings.\n2. Its sports book's profit margins are widening\nAnd its growing profitability can't be overemphasized. All too often, a company's growth becomes more difficult and more expensive to muster the bigger the organization gets. All the low-hanging fruit is picked first.\nNot with DraftKings, though. As it adds scale, net margins on its sports book revenue (which make up about two-thirds of its business) continue to widen, suggesting it's becoming more efficient the bigger it gets.\nThis is always the goal of any company, but not everyone can produce wider profit margins as it expands.\n3. The balance sheet is healthy\nFor many high-growth companies, major problems are often evident on their balance sheet before they manifest themselves anywhere else. Too much debt, not enough cash, an ever-growing number of shares diluting existing shareholders: It's all quietly hiding in plain sight on these accounting statements.\nDraftKings doesn't have any such ticking time bombs on the books, though. It has nearly $1.3 billion in the bank versus less than $800 million as of the end of last year. And, while this $22 billion company added roughly $200 million more in long-term liabilities in 2024, it also managed to create $300 million less in short-term obligations.\nThe point is, there are no capitalization problems right now that are going to come back to haunt investors.\n4. The growing online sports betting market is still only half-tapped\nAs much as DraftKings has grown since evolving from a fantasy sports platform to an online sports-betting service in 2018 (and adding online casino gambling shortly thereafter), there's still tons of room for more growth. The company noted in its second-quarter report that only half the country's population currently has legal access to its online sports book, while only about a tenth of the nation can play its online casino games.\nThe rest are coming around, though. Numbers from Legal Sports Report, an industry monitor, indicate that only 38 states currently allow sports betting of any sort, and only 30 of those allow it online. And of the ones that do, many of them still have prohibitive rules. But all of this is changing, slowly but surely.\nIn the meantime, more consumer education and further penetration of existing markets can continue fueling DraftKings' growth.\nDitto for the 43 states that don't yet allow online casino gambling (according to BettingUSA.com). More and more states are entertaining the idea, eyeing the tax revenue it generates.\nThe researcher Optima Insights believes the country's online sports betting business will grow from last year's $35 billion to $58 billion in 2033, while Mordor Intelligence expects North America's entire online gambling market to grow at an even-faster annualized pace of nearly 12% through 2030. DraftKings is well-positioned to win at least its fair share of this growth.\n5. The kicker: Analysts like the stock\nAnd there's a fifth bonus reason to be bullish on DraftKings stock that doesn't directly have anything to do with the company's efforts, or the sports-betting or i-gaming industries. And that's analysts' opinion of it.\nWhile investors aren't exactly stoked right now, the vast majority of the analyst community currently rates DraftKings stock as a strong buy, with a consensus target of $55.08, more than 27% above the present price. That's not a bad tailwind to start out a new trade with.\nMuch more to like than not\nNo company or investment prospect is perfect, and DraftKings is no exception. For instance, even though no analysts or investors said it outright, I suspect several of them balked at the fact that it didn't actually add any new monthly users between the first and second quarters. Although the betting business can be seasonal, it's never been seasonal enough to stymie the company's progress on its customer count.\nI'm not going to read too much into this slowdown, however, given that average per-user revenue as well as total revenue still grew quite a bit once again.\nMore than anything, I'm going to tout the bigger bullish picture that most investors seem to have lost sight of here. This company is doing everything that could reasonably be expected of it, and it's doing it in an industry with plenty of growth on the horizon. There's no need to make it any more complicated than that.\nJust bear in mind that it will take a long-term mindset to stick with this stock. The near term remains unpredictable.\nShould you invest $1,000 in DraftKings right now?\nBefore you buy stock in DraftKings, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and DraftKings wasn’t one of them.

The benchmark index has also delivered one of its strongest three-month returns since 1950.\nWith the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rocketing to fresh all-time highs, and the Dow Jones just a stone's throw away from surpassing its record close set in December, it would appear nothing can slow down this bona fide wealth-creating machine. But things may not be as unbreakable as they seem.\nWhile a lot of attention is currently being paid to President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy and how it could adversely impact Wall Street, a far more sinister worry lies in wait that can act as a significant drag on stocks.\nPresident Trump's tariffs bring uncertainty and inflation to the forefront\nOn April 2, following the close of trading, Donald Trump unveiled his long-touted tariff and trade policy. It included a sweeping 10% global tariff, as well as introduced higher \"reciprocal tariff rates\" on dozens of countries that have historically had adverse trade imbalances with America.\nThe president's primary goals with his tariff and trade policy are to promote domestic manufacturing, keep American goods price-competitive with those being brought in from foreign markets, and to pad the federal government's pocketbooks with tariff revenue. Though tariff revenue is undeniably climbing, so is the level of uncertainty associated with these tariffs.\nOne of the more prominent issues with President Trump's tariff and trade policy is there's been little follow-through or consistency. There have been two separate 90-day pauses on reciprocal tariffs with the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product, China, and the president has adjusted the effective date, reciprocal tariff rate, and\/or goods subject to tariffs for other countries on a variety of occasions. Wall Street demands predictability, and this administration hasn't been providing it.\nInvestors are also worried about the potential inflationary impact of the president's tariff policies.\nA report (\"Do Import Tariffs Protect U.S. Firms?\") issued in December by four New York Federal Reserve economists working for Liberty Street Economics raised a good point about the lack of clarity Trump's tariffs have offered between input and output tariffs. Output tariffs are duties placed on finished products imported into the U.S., while input tariffs are duties applied to goods used to complete a finished product domestically.\nIdeally, tariffs are being applied to finished products, which can allow domestic manufacturers to be more price-competitive with imported goods. However, some of Trump's tariffs are being directed at goods used to complete the manufacture of products in the U.S. Input tariffs often end up increasing domestic manufacturing costs and can drive the prevailing rate of inflation higher.\nThe other concern, which builds on the report from the four New York Fed economists, is historical precedent. The authors examined the performance of public companies whose stock struggled when Trump's China tariffs were introduced in 2018-2019. On average, companies directly impacted by Trump's China tariffs during his first term in the Oval Office saw their sales, profits, employment, and labor productivity all decline from 2019 through 2021.\nWhile there are ample reasons to believe President Trump's tariffs are a genuine concern for stocks, a far bigger threat to upend the bull market exists.\nWall Street has a serious earnings quality problem\nAs of the closing bell on Aug. 13, the S&P 500's Shiller P\/E Ratio closed at a multiple of almost 39. With the exception of the dot-com bubble and the first week of 2022, this is the third-priciest stock market in history, when back-tested 154 years.\nAlthough historical precedent portends trouble for the stock market, valuations have the ability to remain extended if companies are delivering strong earnings growth and offering analyst-topping guidance.\nWhile many of the stock market's leading businesses have made a habit out of surpassing consensus profit expectations, a dive beneath the headline figures uncovers just how poor the earnings quality truly is on Wall Street.\nIdeally, the companies responsible for pushing the broader market higher should be letting their operating performance do the talking. But quite a few prominent businesses have been buoyed by unsustainable and\/or non-innovative income sources that partially mask their true operating performance.\nOne of the more prominent examples of a high-flying stock with abysmal earnings quality is Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). This member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and a business valued at $1.1 trillion, as of this writing.\nThrough the first half of 2025, Tesla generated $2.138 billion in pre-tax income. However, $1.649 billion (77.1%) traced back to automotive regulatory credits given to the company for free by federal governments and net interest income (interest earned on cash less interest paid on debt). President Trump's \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" will eliminate Tesla's automotive regulatory credits in the U.S.\nFor a company expected to be a market leader, Tesla has been consistently reliant on income sources that have absolutely nothing to do with selling EVs and its energy generation and storage operations. To boot, earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates for future years have been falling with some level of consistency for nearly three years.\nIt's a somewhat similar story for red-hot artificial intelligence (AI) stock Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR). Palantir's sought-after AI-driven software-as-a-service Gotham and Foundry platforms are delivering sizzling growth, with full-year sales now projected to climb by 45% in 2025.\nBut one of the interesting quirks about Palantir is that it generates a sizable percentage of its pre-tax income from interest earned on its cash. Though I'm not faulting Palantir for bringing in $106.7 million in interest income through the first six months of 2025, it's worth noting that this represents more than 19% of its pre-tax income.\nA company that's valued at a completely unjustifiable price-to-sales ratio of 135 should be doing all the talking with its operating performance. Instead, Palantir's trailing-12-month P\/E ratio of more than 610 is being partially propped up by non-innovative interest income earned from its cash.\nTesla and Palantir aren't unique examples -- they just happen to be some of the most prominent businesses. If earnings quality remains poor or suspect, premium valuations can easily become the stock market's downfall.\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

And today, we haven’t. So we may have to slice that price again.\n“The guy’s probably going to come out even from a property he bought three years ago, because he’s frightened his interest rate is just going to hike up on his mortgage deal in November.”\nThe same is true across much of the South of England.\nHouse prices have dipped from March’s peak, when the market was boosted by buyers rushing to beat the rise in stamp duty.\nHowever, more serious may be the market’s failure in many parts of the country to rise at all since Liz Truss’s mini-Budget of 2022, which led to a sharp drop in sales.\nPrices in London, the South East, the South West and the East of England are all still below their peaks almost three years ago.\nAcross the UK as a whole, prices are up just 1.1pc over that timeframe.\nWorryingly, the long-held British belief that investment in property is a one-way bet is being shattered.\nAccording to Trevor Brown, a surveyor in Southend, Essex, owners can only sell if they accept the reality that their home is not worth as much as they hoped.\n“There are fewer potential buyers, borrowing is still very expensive and stamp duty is levied on every sale that we see,” he says. “It makes buying expensive.\n“The first-time buyer market is out of the equation unless you have mum and dad ready to contribute considerably. And nobody is buying buy-to-lets any more at all.”\nConcerns over the property market have been fuelled by a recent exodus of landlords, triggered by a barrage of tax rises under the Conservatives and the introduction of Labour’s renters’ rights bill, which aims to strengthen the power of tenants.\n“Auctions are full of tenanted properties, where landlords are getting out of the marketplace,” says Brown.\nAll of which is teeing up what some see as a fresh housing crunch, threatening to undermine confidence in the wider economy and curbing much-needed tax revenues.\nHowever, the market has not yet completely stalled.\nBanks and building societies approved 188,000 mortgages in the three months to June.\nThat is down from the 200,000 in the quarter before the stamp duty holiday ended on March 31, but is above the low of 135,000 in early 2023 in the wake of Truss’s mini-Budget.\nBut this rebound is far short of making up for lost sales in recent years, while mortgages are still running below levels seen before the pandemic.\nWorse still, pessimism on prices has crashed to its worst level in a year, according to the latest report from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which regularly questions its members on the state of the market.\nEven though the Bank of England has cut its headline interest rate from 5.25pc to 4pc over the past 12 months, the average rate paid on mortgages is still rising.\nThat is because the cheap loans which millions of families locked into before the cost of living crisis are now coming to an end. Those borrowers often bought with a mortgage rate of less than 2pc, but must now refinance with repayments north of 4pc.\nThe average rate paid on the nation’s mortgages is up from 2.1pc at the end of 2021 to 3.9pc today, with the Bank predicting that it will keep rising to 4.1pc into 2026.\nBefore the pandemic, the average mortgage payment was less than £700, according to direct debit data from the Office for National Statistics and Vocalink. Now it is just shy of £1,000.\nBank officials estimate that 3.6 million households will remortgage onto higher rates over the next three years, while only 2.5 million will see their rate fall. It means an average increase in repayments of £107 per month in the coming years.\nCompounding the problem is a renewed rise in living costs.\nDavid Hickman, a surveyor in Devon, says that Rachel Reeves’s National Insurance tax raid has hammered the local jobs market, undermining confidence among buyers.\n“There’s this job insecurity going around, and that’s making people sit tight and not move unless they have to,” he says.\nA weaker housing market, in turn, becomes a danger to both the economy and the public finances.\n“When asset prices rise, it gives people confidence to go out and spend,” says Sam Miley, at the Centre for Economics and Business Research. “And when prices are falling, it encourages people to be a bit more cautious.\n“At the moment, it is an environment of slower house price growth, so that plays out in a slower rate of consumption growth.”\nSuch concerns will not go unnoticed for those in the Government, particularly as the Chancellor prepares to plug a black hole worth as much as £50bn.\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility predicts that Labour’s pledge to build more homes will trigger more property sales, which in turn will help the Treasury bring in more stamp duty for each sale.\nThe watchdog anticipates annual revenues from stamp duty and other transaction taxes will rise from £13.5bn last year to £24.5bn by the end of the decade.\nBut dwindling house prices will serve as a threat to that, fuelled by a recent drop-off in construction activity.\nHousing starts have barely budged and planning approvals have fallen to a record low since the Government unveiled its pledge to build 1.5 million homes by 2030.\nAny shortfall in property transactions could prove critical for Reeves, says Andrew Wishart, economist at Berenberg Bank.\n“It is a relatively small tax but when the Chancellor is working with headroom of 0.2 or 0.3pc of GDP, any small tax could make the difference,” says Wishart.\n“The forecast looks optimistic – when looking at housing construction volumes, they are a long, long way off the target.”\nHowever, support for the market might be on the way.\nNot only is the Bank of England expected to cut interest rates a little further in the coming months, but looser mortgage lending rules should also make life a little easier for first-time buyers.\nYet regardless of that, many believe it will remain a buyer’s market, including Jeremy Leaf, an estate agent in north London.\n“There is a hell of a lot of property on the market, and if you want to stand out, you have to be realistic about price,” he says.\n“A lady came in wanting to look at one of our properties. She said, ‘It is very nice. But I have got 12 to see today.’”\nBroaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Known for its deep roots in government intelligence and enterprise data solutions, Palantir has pivoted fast into AI, shortening deal cycles and expanding its reach across major commercial sectors. Now, with enterprise demand heating up, the company is gaining serious traction as a go-to platform for mission-critical AI deployment.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Palantir crossed a major milestone, recently reporting stellar results and pulling in its first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter, beating estimates and raising full-year guidance. PLTR stock surged past $180 after a record-breaking run, up over 11% since its Q2 release, and the Street took notice.\nWedbush’s Dan Ives upped the price target to $200 – the highest on the Street – anticipating Palantir is on a “golden path to become the next Oracle” of the AI era due to its explosive product demand and long-term enterprise runway.\nBut it's also true that PLTR's valuation is becoming a sticking point. So, can the momentum carry it to $200, or will gravity catch up?\nAbout Palantir Stock\nFounded in 2003 with backing from the CIA’s In-Q-Tel, Palantir Technologies has evolved from a post-9\/11 counterterrorism startup into a leading force in AI and data-driven decision-making. Headquartered in Denver, the company has built platforms like Gotham, Foundry, Apollo, and AIP – each designed to unlock actionable insights across defense, healthcare, and finance.\nNow worth $423.7 billion by market capitalization, Palantir is stepping into the large-cap arena. Its deepening role in U.S. defense and enterprise AI, highlighted by initiatives like Warp Speed for Warships, signals its expanding influence across both government and industry.\nPalantir’s rally has been impressive. PLTR has surged 134% year-to-date (YTD), tagging a fresh high of $190 on Aug. 12, crowned as the S&P 500 Index's ($SPX) top gainer of 2025. Zoom out and it’s even more stellar. The stock has rallied 467% in one year, 1,051% over two, and over 2,027% in three.\nBut the air seems thin up here. With its 14-day relative strength index (RSI) at 62 it is just shy of flashing overbought, and fading volume on green candles hints at buyers stepping back. Momentum is strong, but the next leg might need fresh fuel.\nPLTR stock has been on a stellar run, but its valuation raises eyebrows. Priced at 439 times forward earnings and a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio north of 140, puts the stock in ultra-premium territory, well above big tech norms. While commercial growth is accelerating, government contracts still anchor revenue. The valuation assumes flawless execution and sustained hypergrowth, and any slowdown could trigger multiple compressions quickly.\nPalantir’s Q2 Results Exceed Projections\nPalantir’s Q2 earnings hit like a thunderclap on Aug. 5, sending bulls into celebration mode and forcing skeptics to rethink the narrative. For the first time ever, the company crossed the $1 billion revenue mark, coming in at $1.004 billion, up a massive 48% year-over-year (YoY) and comfortably ahead of Wall Street estimates. The growth largely came from its U.S. business, especially the commercial side, where revenue jumped 93% YoY to $306 million and 20% sequentially. That segment alone now makes up over 30% of total revenue.\nPalantir continues to deepen its enterprise grip, closing 157 deals over $1 million, including 66 worth over $5 million and 42 crossing the $10 million line. Its top 20 customers are now averaging $75 million in trailing 12-month revenue, a 30% annual jump. Total contract value (TCV) for Q2 soared over 140% to $2.3 billion, while U.S. commercial contract value exploded 222% to $843 million. Government momentum didn’t slow down either, with government revenue growing 49% to $553 million, and the U.S. Government revenue up 53% annually.\nAnd it wasn’t just a top-line story; profitability crushed expectations, too. Adjusted EPS hit $0.16, while operating income reached $464.4 million for a margin of 46.3%. Adjusted free cash flow (FCF) rose to $568.8 million, with margins coming in at 57%. Palantir now sits on a healthy $6 billion in cash, giving it room to keep scaling and investing in AI dominance.\nWith that kind of performance, it’s no surprise the company raised its full-year guidance. The management now anticipates revenue to be between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion, up from a previous range. U.S. commercial growth alone is projected to soar at least 85%. Adjusted operating income is expected to be between $1.912 billion and $1.920 billion, with FCF estimated to be between $1.8 billion and $2 billion.\nMeanwhile, Q3 revenue is expected to land somewhere between $1.083 billion and $1.087 billion, while adjusted operating income is estimated to be between $493 million and $497 million.\nAnalysts monitoring Palantir expect the company’s Q3 revenue to be $1.09 billion, while EPS could climb 50% YoY to $0.09. Looking further ahead to fiscal 2025, the bottom line is estimated to be around $0.38 per share, up 375% annually, and rise by another 18.4% to $0.45 per share in fiscal 2026.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Palantir Stock?\nAfter Palantir’s impressive Q2 earnings report, Wedbush’s Dan Ives raised its price target from $160 to a Street-high $200, keeping its “Outperform” rating. The firm called it another “eye-popping quarter for the Messi of AI,” pointing to surging U.S. commercial revenue, massive deal flow, and rising enterprise adoption.\nPalantir’s top 20 customers are spending more, government momentum is strong, and cash flow crushed expectations. Wedbush believes Palantir is on a golden path to become the next Oracle, and might just grow into that premium valuation.\nMeanwhile, Piper Sandler bumped PLTR’s price target to $182 from $170, keeping its “Overweight” call. The brokerage firm called it Palantir’s biggest beat yet and praised its eighth straight quarter of revenue acceleration. With double-digit gross margins, U.S. commercial growth, and that massive $10 billion Army deal, Piper sees serious staying power. Sure, valuation is rich, but Piper Sandler analysts say Palantir’s blend of growth and margin earns the premium.\nWall Street is not exactly rolling out the red carpet for this software stock. It's more of a polite handshake than a standing ovation. The stock holds a consensus “Hold” rating. Of the 22 analysts keeping tabs, only four are bullish with a “Strong Buy.” The majority - 15 of them - are cautiously watching from the sidelines, tagging it with a “Hold.” One analyst takes a step back with a “Moderate Sell,” while two go all in on the skepticism, stamping it with a “Strong Sell.”\nWhile PLTR is trading at a premium to its average analyst price target of $155.78, Wedbush’s Street-high target of $200 suggests that the stock can still rise by as much as 13% from current levels.\nFinal Thoughts on Palantir\nPalantir’s momentum since my last coverage has been nothing short of electric. The commercial engine, powered by AIP and its viral bootcamp strategy, is scaling fast.\nAdd in the Army deal and steady defense wins like “Golden Dome,” and investors have real dual-engine growth. Yes, valuation is rich and government lean remains, but if Palantir keeps delivering like this, the stock has the potential to hit Wedbush's target.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Sales are still growing, margins are healthy, and Wall Street analysts still expect Lululemon's earnings to grow meaningfully in the next two years.\nThe stock could easily double in value if the price-to-earnings ratio that investors are willing to pay for Lululemon's earnings per share increases from the current 13 multiple on this year's consensus estimates to 26, which is where the stock has historically traded. But using the consensus $16.91 estimate in the next two years, a 25 forward earnings multiple puts the share price at $422. That's a reasonable target for where it could trade in a stronger economy.\nLululemon is demonstrating solid brand strength in this weak consumer spending environment. Revenue grew 8% year over year on a constant currency basis last quarter, and management maintained its full-year guidance for revenue growth of between 7% to 8%.\nMargins are expected to be under pressure this year due to external factors, such as tariffs, higher discounting, and investments in growth initiatives. But Lululemon's premium brand positioning has served it well for 20 years, allowing the business to earn a much higher gross profit margin than competing brands, and that's still the case. This indicates that Lululemon has a competitive advantage built on brand power.\nWith first-quarter revenue coming in at the high end of management's guidance, Lululemon is poised to experience stronger growth when consumers are in a better position to spend. In the last quarter, management noted strong customer responses to new product launches in shirts and pants with Daydrift and BeCalm.\nLululemon is a resilient brand that has recovered from worse episodes, such as the 2013 recall over its Luon pants. It has one of the most loyal customer followings in retail. I wouldn't bet against it, and I believe it's deeply undervalued at around $200.\nThis coffee chain has a massive expansion opportunity\nJennifer Saibil (Dutch Bros): Dutch Bros is a young coffee chain that's rapidly expanding across the U.S., gaining fans and generating high sales. It has crafted a differentiated brand, which isn't so simple when you're talking about a cup of coffee. It's highly deliberate in its beverage and menu curation as well as its real estate strategy, and customers are loving its innovative products and its fun and friendly culture.\nThis is a concept that can easily cross state lines. What began as a coffee truck in Grant Pass, Oregon, three decades ago is now past its 1,000th store and climbing up the East Coast. More importantly, management thinks it can reach 7,000 stores. In the short term, it plans to reach 2,029 stores by 2029, doubling its store count over the next five or so years.\nInvestors are confident because Dutch Bros has been reporting fantastic results. In the 2025 second quarter, revenue increased 28% year over year, and same-shop sales were up 6.1%. Dutch Bros offers franchise opportunities, but its company-owned stores did even better, with a 7.8% increase in same-shop sales. Net income is growing even faster, up 73% from last year to $38.4 million.\nManagement's guiding growth strategy includes beverage innovation, paid advertising to build its brand as it enters new markets, and developing its loyalty program. It recently launched mobile ordering throughout its stores, and it's rolling out a new morning menu to drive more beverage sales at that critical morning coffee hour.\nIf Dutch Bros can grow its sales at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next three years, its revenue will reach $2.8 billion, or about double today's trailing 12-month figure. Stocks often track profitability, which is likely to keep growing even faster than sales. As it grows, Dutch Bros stock will likely follow.\nAn under-the-radar growth stock\nJeremy Bowman (Lyft): Lyft has been a disappointment since its 2019 IPO. Like rival Uber, the company entered the market overvalued and sold off shortly after its debut.\nWhile the stock seems to have been forgotten since then, the business has made some significant improvements, including reaching profitability, expanding to Europe through acquisitions, and innovating with its product in ways that are outpacing Uber.\nIn the second quarter, revenue rose 11% on a 14% increase in rides, which was its ninth consecutive quarter with double-digit ride growth.\nIts Lyft Silver program, geared at making ridesharing easier for seniors, is exceeding expectations. It's driving one in five new user activations and achieving a retention rate of nearly 80%.\nNet income also jumped from $5 million in the quarter a year ago to $40 million, and its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 26% to $129 million.\nOver the last four quarters, the company has generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow, meaning it trades at just 6 times trailing free cash flow. That seems like a mismatch for a stock that's delivering double-digit top-line growth, expanding margins, and growing its addressable market.\nLyft stock has been essentially flat over the last three years, but the business has improved significantly during that time. Investors seem to be underrating the recovery here, and the Freenow deal in Europe gives it significant upside in the coming years.\nIf management continues to execute, a double looks to be well within reach over the next three years.\nDo the experts think Lululemon Athletica Inc. is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

The Snapchat parent's stock is trading down more than 20% since posting its second-quarter numbers last Tuesday, in fact, and still testing lower lows. The company's revenue miss clearly rattled investors.\nThe question is, is yet another disappointing quarter enough of a reason to finally give up on Snap? Or is this stock's recent setback a chance to step into a compelling story at an even better price?\nSnap's second-quarter numbers\nSnap's Snapchat app is a social media platform, albeit a very different one than Meta Platforms' Facebook or X (formerly known as Twitter). Namely, Snapchat doesn't feature a \"news\" feed like X and Facebook do in the center of their user interfaces. Snapchat's focus is instead on messaging and sharing pictures specifically with friends.\nThe core business is still ultimately the same as any social media site's, though: advertising. More users and usage of the Snapchat app means more opportunities to monetize the platform.\nAnd Snap did a fair amount of business during the three-month stretch ending in June. The top line of $1.34 billion for the recently ended quarter was up 9% year over year, lifted by a 9% increase in the average number of daily users (469 million) and 7% growth in average monthly users (932 million). Most of that user growth took shape outside of Europe and North America. Although the company remains in the red with a reported net loss of $262.6 million, or $0.16 per share, free cash flow swung from a negative $73.4 million to a positive $23.8 million this time around.\nProblem? The analyst community was calling for a top line of $1.35 billion and a per-share loss of $0.15, matching the year-ago quarter's loss. Sales growth guidance for the third quarter (now underway) was in line with estimates, but investors also noticed that these numbers still trail those being reported by Meta and other social media companies. In addition, \"an issue related to our ad platform\" crimped both the top and bottom lines by underpricing Snap's ad inventory. A company as developed as Snap shouldn't face such self-created glitches.\nNevertheless, this stock's subsequent setback is far more of an opportunity than an omen.\n(Much) more to like in the long run than not\nSnap's got plenty to figure out. Even while the technical glitch was temporary, it's concerning that user growth has outright stalled in North America and Europe, where average per-user revenue is highest. It's also simply not growing as briskly as its rival platforms are, and perhaps never will. As RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson noted, last quarter's numbers \"will continue to reinforce the bear case that Snap cannot break out of being a smaller ad platform lacking the ability to durably grow its direct response business in line with the market.\"\nJust don't lose sight of the bigger, longer-term picture. And that picture is still pretty bullish for a handful of reasons.\nOne of those reasons is Snap's never-ending willingness to learn from its past failures as well as past successes, and then evolve as merited. Case in point: In June, the company announced the augmented reality glasses it's been working on for a while now will be ready for launch sometime in 2026. Its first go-around with \"Spectacles\" back in 2016 ended up being a bit of a disaster. But those glasses were only a camera, and AR technology has come a long way since then. Undeterred by its previous flop, Snap's next shot at stand-alone hardware is a reasonable risk.\nIn the meantime, the company's doing something far more practical by adding artificial intelligence-powered tools (including AI-generated ads) to its advertisers' toolkit. Its relatively new Sponsored \"Snaps\" are also producing 20% more conversions than ordinary ads.\nPerhaps the overarching argument for betting on beaten-down SNAP shares despite them going nowhere since their 2021\/2022 rout is that Snapchat still has a long growth path ahead of it.\nIt's difficult to quantify, or even see. But the world is growing weary of the toxicity on Facebook and X. Consumers are increasingly looking for alternative online gathering places where they're in control of what they're exposed to. They're finding less-crowded and more decentralized corners of the web on platforms like Discord, Bluesky, and yes, Snapchat. Indeed, the Snapchat app lends itself to providing what its biggest cohort of users -- the Gen Z crowd, ages 16 to 30 -- craves to the point of demanding it: advertiser authenticity.\nAccording to recent research from Target's retail media network Roundel, 73% of Gen Z regularly watch influencers' shopping videos. That's more than 40% above the average. And website hosting service provider WPEngine says 82% of Gen Z is more likely to trust a company that uses real people (like Snapchat's creators) rather than paid actors in its ads.\nAds on Facebook and X tend to lack this authenticity, while Snapchat's heavily featured ads from the platform's well-followed creators is about as authentic as it gets.\nFocus on the long-term marketability of the business\nIt's tough to get excited about buying into any promising business while that business's results are lackluster, and Snap's are. The stock's lingering lethargy isn't helping the bull thesis either.\nJust bear in mind something that Warren Buffett said long ago that still applies in the modern market environment: \"If you aren't thinking about owning a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes.\" Snapchat's got the right idea and formula. It's just going to take a while to prove it. It's going to take even longer for the market to fully see it.\nOn the other hand, as other investors increasingly do see it, they'll at least start pricing in Snap's promising future. That's why it might be wiser to go ahead and wade into a position now while nobody else is thinking about doing the same. As Buffett has also said, \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.\" You can control your total risk just by adjusting the size of the Snap stake you take on.\nShould you buy stock in Snap right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Snap, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Snap wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $663,630!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,115,695!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,071% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500.

The dollar also suffered from underlying foreign investor concern about the possibility of a politically-driven US monetary policy after US Treasury Secretary Bessent on Wednesday appeared to give the Fed marching orders on how much to cut interest rates. The dollar fell on Friday despite a +4 bp rise in the 10-year T-note yield, which supported the dollar's interest rate differentials.\nThe markets on Friday were awaiting the outcome of the Trump-Putin summit on Friday afternoon. The outcome could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.\nFriday's headline US retail sales report was slightly weaker than market expectations, but there was an upward revision for June, leaving the report roughly neutral for the markets. The markets welcomed the report amidst worries about how US retail spending will hold up with a weaker labor market and consumer uncertainty about inflation and the economic outlook. July US retail sales rose +0.5% m\/m, slightly weaker than market expectations of +0.6%, although June was revised higher to +0.9% from +0.6%. July retail sales ex-autos rose +0.3% m\/m, in line with market expectations and down from June's revised +0.8% (preliminary +0.5%).\nThe University of Michigan's preliminary-Aug US consumer sentiment index fell by -3.1 points to 58.6, which was weaker than expectations for a slight +0.3 point increase to 62.0. The survey showed that US consumer expectations for inflation rose to +4.9% over the next year and to an annual +3.9% for the next 5-10 years. The survey also found that 58% of consumers plan to cut spending due to inflation.\nJuly US import prices rose +0.4% m\/m, which was stronger than expectations of +0.1%. On a year-on-year basis, July US import prices strengthened to -0.2% from a revised -0.5% y\/y in June. July US import prices ex-petroleum rose +0.3% m\/m versus June's revised -0.2% (preliminary unchanged).\nFriday's July US industrial production report of -0.1% m\/m was slightly weaker than expectations of unchanged, although June was revised upward to +0.4% m\/m from +0.3%. July manufacturing production was unchanged m\/m, matching market expectations, while July was revised higher to +0.3% from +0.1%.\nThe Aug Empire manufacturing index of 11.9 was substantially stronger than market expectations of zero and was up from July's 5.5.\nChicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee on Friday delivered mildly hawkish remarks, stating that he would like to see at least one more inflation report to ensure that persistent inflation pressures aren't emerging. He expressed concern about the high service inflation data in the July CPI report, but noted the importance of not placing too much weight on a single month's data.\nThe markets on Friday continued to adjust to the inflation outlook following Thursday's hawkish PPI report. The July final-demand PPI surged to +3.3% y\/y (nominal) and +3.7% y\/y (core). The PPI report suggested that the markets were overly optimistic about Tuesday's CPI report and that companies are passing through tariffs at the wholesale level at a higher pace than earlier thought. Following the report, the markets erased any hopes of a -50 bp rate cut at the Fed's September meeting and pulled back expectations for a -25 bp rate cut to the 93% area from 100% before the report.\nWeak Chinese economic reports on Thursday night were negative for the global economic growth outlook. China's economy is weakening due to US tariffs and the Chinese government's attempt to crack down on excessive competition that has driven prices to loss-making levels in some industries. China's July retail sales report of +3.7% y\/y was weaker than expectations of +4.6% and down from June's +4.8%. China's July industrial production report of +5.7% y\/y was weaker than expectations of +6.0% and was down from June's +6.8%. China's July jobless rate rose to 5.2% from June's +5.0% and was higher than expectations. China's July property investment fell -12.0% ytd y\/y from -11.2% in June and was weaker than expectations of -11.4%.\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump on Friday said, \"I'll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we'll be setting sometime next week, week after.\" Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 85% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 40% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEUR\/USD (^EURUSD) rose +0.47% on dollar weakness. The euro had some underlying support from hopes of some progress on ending the Russia-Ukraine war at Friday's Trump-Putin summit.\nSwaps are pricing in a 5% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUSD\/JPY (^USDJPY) fell -0.56% due to weakness in the dollar. The yen saw some underlying support after US Treasury Secretary Bessent earlier this week said the Bank of Japan is falling behind the curve in addressing inflation and that he expects a rate hike. However, the yen continues to be undercut by concern that US tariff policies will harm the Japanese economy.\nDecember gold (GCZ25) on Friday closed down -0.60 (-0.02%), and September silver (SIU25) closed down -0.094 (-0.25%). Gold prices fell Friday as the market trimmed expectations for a -25 bp rate cut by the Fed in September to 85% from 93%. Silver saw weakness on concern about industrial metals demand after Friday's weaker-than-expected US consumer sentiment index and Chinese economic data.\nGold continues to have safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices after gold holdings in ETFs rose to a 2-year high on Tuesday, and silver holdings in ETFs reached a 3-year high on Thursday.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

On the surface, they can all sound the same — and many people use \"financial advisor\" as a catch-all for anyone who works with investments or retirement planning. But in reality, there's a critical distinction hiding behind those labels, and it can have a huge impact on your financial future. That difference comes down to whether or not your advisor is a fiduciary.\nUnderstanding what separates a fiduciary advisor from a traditional financial advisor isn't just a matter of jargon — it's about knowing whether the person giving you advice is legally required to put your best interests ahead of their own. For many investors, that one detail is the difference between a plan built around your goals and one that quietly funnels money into products that benefit the advisor more than you.\nWhat Is a Financial Advisor?\nAt its broadest, the term \"financial advisor\" can apply to almost anyone in the business of helping clients manage their money. This could mean someone who sells you life insurance, someone who opens a retirement account, or someone who builds a long-term investment plan. Financial advisors can be found at the biggest brokerage firms, at banks, or operating independently.\nThe key thing to understand is that not all financial advisors operate under the same legal standard of care. Many advisors are held only to what's called the suitability standard. That means they're obligated to recommend products that are \"suitable\" for your circumstances, but not necessarily the best or most cost-effective options available. In practice, that could look like an advisor steering you into a mutual fund with higher fees that pays them a commission, even though there's a nearly identical fund available with much lower costs. Both options may be \"suitable,\" but only one puts more money in your pocket over time. The other keeps more money in theirs.\nThis doesn't mean all financial advisors are acting against your interests — many genuinely want to help — but it does highlight why the lack of a stronger legal requirement can leave room for conflicts of interest. And that's where fiduciary advisors come in.\nWhat Is a Fiduciary Advisor?\nA fiduciary advisor is different because they're bound to a much stricter standard — the fiduciary standard. This means they are legally and ethically required to put your best interests first at all times. Fiduciaries must minimize conflicts of interest whenever possible, disclose any conflicts that remain, and always ensure that the advice they give benefits you, not them.\nFiduciary advisors are often registered investment advisors (RIAs) or fee-only financial planners. Instead of relying on commissions from selling you products, they usually charge in one of three ways: a flat fee, an hourly rate, or a percentage of assets under management. This fee structure is designed to reduce the temptation to push unnecessary or high-cost products. For example, if you hire a fiduciary on an hourly basis to create a retirement plan, they're compensated for their time and expertise — not for selling you a specific annuity or mutual fund.\nFor many investors, especially those looking for comprehensive planning across retirement, investments, taxes, and estate issues, the fiduciary model provides a level of trust and transparency that's hard to match. You know that when a fiduciary advisor recommends a move, it's because they believe it's the best option for you, not because it boosts their paycheck.\nHere's where things often get confusing: every fiduciary is a financial advisor, but not every financial advisor is a fiduciary. Think of it like a square and a rectangle. Fiduciary advisors fall under the broader umbrella of financial advisors, but they're operating under a much stricter set of rules.\nThe differences show up most clearly in a few areas:\nLegal obligation: Fiduciaries must act in your best interest. Advisors under the suitability rule only need to ensure recommendations are \"suitable.\"\nCompensation: Fiduciaries often work on fee-only models that avoid commissions. Traditional advisors may earn commissions or incentives from products they sell.\nConflicts of interest: Fiduciaries must avoid or disclose conflicts, while suitability-based advisors may not always be transparent.\nTransparency: Fiduciaries are generally upfront about costs, fees, and risks. Other advisors may present information in less straightforward ways.\nWhen you boil it down, fiduciaries are held to a higher bar, both legally and ethically. That makes them the preferred choice for anyone who wants advice that's as unbiased as possible.\nWhich Should You Choose?\nFor most people, a fiduciary advisor is the safer and smarter option. Knowing that your advisor is legally bound to put your interests first offers peace of mind — and it can prevent costly mistakes or unnecessary fees down the road. If your goal is long-term financial planning and wealth building, fiduciaries are almost always the better fit.\nThat said, there are scenarios where a traditional financial advisor might make sense. If you're shopping for a very specific product — say, an insurance policy or a 529 plan for college savings — a commission-based advisor can still be helpful. They can provide access to those products quickly, and you may not need the ongoing oversight that comes with a fiduciary relationship. But for comprehensive planning, where all aspects of your financial life are interconnected, the fiduciary duty is what makes the difference.\nHow to Tell If an Advisor Is a Fiduciary\nHere's the tricky part: you can't always tell just by looking at someone's business card whether they're a fiduciary or not. Titles like \"financial advisor\" and \"wealth manager\" aren't regulated the way you might expect. That's why it's crucial to ask direct, pointed questions before hiring someone.\nA few good ones include:\n\"Are you a fiduciary at all times when working with me?\"\n\"How are you compensated — fees, commissions, or both?\"\n\"Can you provide your Form ADV or fiduciary oath?\"\nThe way an advisor answers these questions will tell you a lot. Fiduciaries will usually welcome them and answer clearly. If you get vague responses or resistance, that's often a red flag that the advisor isn't truly bound to act in your best interest.\nFind a Fiduciary Advisor:\nSmartAsset can match you with up to three vetted fiduciary advisors in your area so you can start your search with confidence — find your advisor today for free.","content_hash":"304277af81465b9bb137b2aa761ed4bf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6789,"method_rank":0}

It's making us rethink energy. The surge in AI adoption is driving a massive build-out of hyperscale data centers, each packed with power-hungry processors that run 24\/7.\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that global data center electricity consumption could double by 2030, with some forecasts showing U.S. AI facilities alone rivaling the output of several large nuclear plants within a few years.\nSupplying AI's appetite will require reliable, scalable, and often innovative power solutions. The companies that can deliver that power -- whether through clean baseload, rapid-deploy generation, or cutting-edge infrastructure -- stand to benefit for years to come. Here are four stocks to buy today to take advantage of this.\nConstellation Energy\nConstellation Energy(NASDAQ: CEG) is the largest U.S. producer of carbon-free electricity, operating the nation's biggest nuclear fleet alongside wind, solar, hydro, and gas assets. The advantage of nuclear power for AI-era data centers lies in its baseload reliability. It can operate 24\/7 with zero emissions, thereby meeting hyperscaler carbon-neutral mandates while avoiding grid intermittency issues.\nConstellation's nuclear fleet has a generating capacity of approximately 22 gigawatts (GWs), producing 182 terawatt-hours (TWhs) of zero-emissions electricity in 2024. On top of that, data center clusters, notably in Virginia and Illinois, are within Constellation's service territory.\nAnalysts project that it could grow earnings per share by 17% compounded through 2028. Given its huge nuclear fleet and strong tailwinds from hyperscalers, Constellation Energy is a solid way to invest in AI and its rising power demand.\nGE Vernova\nGE Vernova(NYSE: GEV), spun off from General Electric Company (which is now GE Aerospace) in 2024, provides power generation technology, from gas turbines and wind to grid infrastructure. Its installed base generates roughly 25% of the world's electricity.\nFor AI-driven data centers, its aeroderivative gas turbines stand out because they can be deployed and provide power within weeks. These units are highly valued because they can be commissioned faster, providing rapid, dispatchable power crucial for meeting immediate energy needs when traditional grid connections may lag.\nThe demand for this technology is experiencing robust demand to support data centers, as evidenced by GE Vernova securing nearly $500 million in data center orders in the first half of 2025. This is a notable acceleration compared to its $600 million in orders for all of 2024.\nGE Vernova's grid stabilization solutions are critical for hyperscalers to integrate renewables without compromising uptime or reliability. Technologies like synchronous condensers, which GE Vernova has manufactured for years, provide voltage support and frequency regulation, which helps to balance the grid when generation levels are volatile.\nThe stock is quite expensive, at 150 times earnings, pricing in lofty growth expectations. With analysts projecting growth of earnings per share to $7.61 (up 151% year over year) in 2025, and 45% compounded growth in earnings per share in the next three years after that, GE Vernova's growth potential is eye-opening.\nVertiv\nVertiv(NYSE: VRT) supplies power management, cooling, and servicing of critical infrastructure technology for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial customers. It makes uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), switchgear, and advanced cooling systems -- all of which are essential to keeping AI servers running reliably.\nThe increased adoption of AI and high-performance computing is driving significant demand in the data center industry. Higher rack densities from AI accelerators mean more heat and power demand per square foot, which Vertiv can address with liquid cooling and high-capacity UPS.\nHyperscale data center growth is expected to drive sustained order backlogs for Vertiv's solutions. In the second quarter, orders surpassed $3 billion for the first time, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x showing robust demand for its solutions. The company's backlog has expanded significantly, reaching $8.5 billion, which is up 21% versus the prior year and 7% sequentially.\nBloom Energy\nBloom Energy(NYSE: BE) manufactures solid oxide fuel cells that generate clean, on-site power from natural gas or biogas, with hydrogen-ready capability. Where Bloom Energy has an advantage is in grid independence. Its Bloom Energy Servers use fuel cell technology, which can power data centers without waiting for utility interconnects, delivering scalable, low-carbon electricity at the point of use.\nThe U.S. power grid is facing significant challenges, including an estimated 42-gigawatt shortfall by 2028, potentially growing to 60 GW through 2029 for data centers due to interconnection delays. Bloom's servers are well-positioned to address these medium-term constraints.\nA significant advantage of Bloom's solutions is their faster time to power compared to traditional grid upgrades or other large-scale power generation methods. While grid interconnection requests can take up to four years to become operational, Bloom Energy Server systems can provide power to customers in months. This makes it attractive in grid-constrained regions like Northern Virginia or Texas.\nBloom could enjoy massive tailwinds from near-term energy demand, and it has the solution to address these shortfalls quickly. Analysts covering the company project earnings per share of $0.52 in 2025, with growth projected to compound at a staggering 76% annually through 2027.\nShould you buy stock in Constellation Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Constellation Energy wasn’t one of them.

The chip giant occasionally puts its vast financial resources to work by investing in other AI companies, and SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN) was one of them.\nSoundHound is a specialist in conversational AI technologies, and its customers include some of the world's biggest brands. Nvidia first revealed its stake in the company in a 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2024, but the chipmaker had sold its entire position by December.\nSoundHound's revenue tripled during its most recent quarter, and its stock is up by a whopping 40% in the past month alone. Did Nvidia make a mistake by dumping its position? Read on for the surprising answer.\nA leader in conversational AI\nSoundHound's conversational AI applications are popular in a variety of industries, but they are experiencing particularly high demand in quick-service restaurant chains and with automotive brands that want to include a powerful AI assistant in their new vehicles.\nIn the restaurant space, SoundHound's Voice AI technology can accept customer orders autonomously in-store, over the phone, and in the drive-thru. It can also answer queries from employees, whether they need help making menu items or need clarity on a particular store policy. Chains like Chipotle, Krispy Kreme, and Papa John's are just a few of SoundHound's customers.\nIn the automotive industry, companies like Hyundai and Stellantis (Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge) are using SoundHound's Chat AI software in their latest vehicles. It can give drivers information about the weather, stocks, and everything in between with a simple voice command, and manufacturers can customize its personality to suit their brand.\nLast August, SoundHound acquired another conversational AI specialist called Amelia. The joint companies recently launched a new platform called Amelia 7, which allows businesses to create custom AI agents that can assist customers with their inquiries or even help employees troubleshoot technical issues. Of course, these agents can be controlled entirely with voice commands.\nSoundHound's revenue is absolutely skyrocketing\nSoundHound generated a record $42.6 million in total revenue during the second quarter of 2025 (ended June 30), which was a blistering 217% increase from the year-ago period.\nThe strong result gave management the confidence to increase its full-year revenue guidance for 2025 from $167 million to $169 million (at the midpoint of the forecast range), which would be a 99% increase compared to 2024. That would mark an acceleration from the 85% growth SoundHound generated last year, highlighting the significant momentum in its business.\nBut that growth is coming at a significant cost, because SoundHound continues to burn truckloads of cash. It lost $74.7 million on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis during the second quarter, which was twice as much as it lost in the year-ago period.\nSoundHound did suffer a one-off, $31 million hit to its bottom line from a liability associated with one of its acquisitions during the quarter, but even after stripping it out -- along with every other one-off and non-cash expense -- the company still lost $11.8 million.\nSoundHound has a solid balance sheet with $230 million in cash on hand and no debt, so it can sustain losses of that size for the foreseeable future. However, the company will eventually have to prioritize profitability, or else it might need to raise capital, which could dilute existing shareholders. Cost cuts would almost certainly dent SoundHound's revenue growth, which is something for investors to keep in mind.\nHere's why Nvidia didn't make a mistake by selling SoundHound stock\nNvidia never told investors why it sold SoundHound stock, but if I had to speculate, I think its valuation likely had something to do with the decision. Its price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio is trading at an eye-popping level of 48.6, which is more than a 50% premium to Nvidia's P\/S ratio of 29.9.\nIt was even more expensive when Nvidia sold it toward the end of 2024, because its P\/S ratio was hovering near 100.\nSoundHound will quickly grow into its current valuation if its revenue continues to increase at such a blistering pace, but the financial results of companies in the early stages of commercialization are notoriously unpredictable, so there's no guarantee it will. Moreover, Nvidia is one of the highest quality companies in the world with a track record of success that spans decades, a rock-solid balance sheet, and surging profits, so I don't think SoundHound deserves to trade at a premium to the chip giant.\nNvidia held 1.73 million SoundHound shares, which would've been worth around $27.7 million at the current price of $16. Given the chip giant's market cap of $4.4 trillion, a total loss would've been a mere rounding error. However, holding a stock with such a steep valuation opens the door to substantial downside if the underlying company falters, so I don't think Nvidia made a mistake by closing its position.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

It's also reshaping the stock market, and it is certainly an area you want to invest in.\nLet's look at the stocks of five AI leaders that would make top stock buys this month.\n1. Nvidia\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) remains the king of AI infrastructure. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) power most AI workloads worldwide, and in the first quarter, it commanded an astonishing 92% of the GPU market. What really sets it apart is its CUDA software platform, which it planted into universities and research labs years before AI went mainstream. That early push created a generation of developers trained on its tools and libraries built on top of its platform, building a moat that rivals struggle to cross.\nNvidia has also accelerated its product cycle, planning new chip launches annually to stay ahead of the competition. Its growth opportunities also go beyond data centers, with the automotive market another big opportunity, thanks to the rise of self-driving and robotaxis.\nNvidia's mix of market dominance, software moat, and expansion into new markets keeps it firmly at the center of AI.\n2. Palantir Technologies\nPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) started as a critical analytics partner to U.S. government agencies but is now making its mark in commercial markets. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) integrates data from numerous sources into an \"ontology,\" allowing AI models to produce clear, actionable results.\nAIP is essentially becoming an AI operating system, making it a vital platform as companies begin to use AI in their operations. The strength of AIP could be seen in its Q2 results, as the company's U.S. commercial revenue surged 93%, while its total deal value more than doubled and its customer base climbed 43%.\nGiven the breadth of use cases across very different industries that AIP can handle, Palantir has a long runway of growth in front of it. The company has continued to see accelerating revenue growth, and the best part is that many of its customers are still in their early stages of usage.\nAs an essential component of the emerging AI economy, Palantir has the potential to grow into one of the largest companies in the world.\n3. Alphabet\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) is proving that AI can strengthen its core businesses. Search has gained momentum with AI Overviews, which is now being used by over 2 billion people a month, helping drive a 12% year-over-year increase in search revenue last quarter. Google Cloud is another major beneficiary of AI, with its revenue jumping 32% and operating profit more than doubling in Q2, thanks to strong AI demand on its Vertex platform.\nAnother area that is often overlooked is Alphabet's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). As inference performance per dollar starts becoming one of the most important factors in running AI models, Alphabet has a nice advantage with its custom chips.\nIn addition to search and cloud computing, Alphabet is also seeing solid contributions from its other businesses. YouTube ad revenue grew 13% last quarter, with Shorts leading the way. Meanwhile, Waymo is picking up steam, rolling out its robotaxi services to new cities across the U.S.\nFrom a valuation perspective, Alphabet is one of the most attractive AI stocks in the market, trading at a forward P\/E just over 20. This makes it a must-own stock.\n4. Broadcom\nRather than competing directly with Nvidia with GPUs, chipmaker Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) is playing to its strengths in AI networking and custom chip design. Its Ethernet switches and other networking components are critical for moving vast amounts of data between AI clusters. Demand here is booming, with its AI networking revenue up 70% in Q1.\nThe real prize, though, may be its work on custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Broadcom helped develop Alphabet's TPUs and is now designing chips for multiple hyperscalers (companies with massive data centers), with management estimating its top three customers alone could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity in fiscal 2027.\nIts recent acquisition of VMware adds another growth lever, with its Cloud Foundation platform helping enterprises manage AI workloads across hybrid cloud environments. Between its leadership in data center networking components, custom chip expertise, and virtualization software, Broadcom is becoming one of the most important players in AI infrastructure.\n5. GitLab\nGitLab(NASDAQ: GTLB) is evolving from a code repository into a full-fledged AI-powered software development platform. Its GitLab 18 release brought more than 30 upgrades, including Duo Agent, which can automate testing, deployment, security, and monitoring. That's important, because developers spend only a fraction of their time writing code. Automating the rest of the workflow can dramatically increase productivity.\nGitLab has delivered steady 25%-plus revenue growth since going public, with Q1 sales rising 27% year over year. The value of its platform in an AI-driven development world opens the door to a possible shift from seat-based to consumption-based pricing, which could drive revenue even higher. With AI changing how software is built, GitLab's end-to-end approach positions it as a key player in enterprise software development.\nAs investors worry about the impact of AI on software, GitLab's stock has fallen to a very attractive valuation of a forward price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 7 times the 2025 analyst estimates.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

It's up about 10% year to date and almost 20% over the past 12 months. That has the market trading at an elevated valuation of about 22 times forward earnings. The only other times it has been this high in the last quarter century are right before the dot-com bust and shortly after the pandemic.\nWhile most stocks currently trade at high valuations (especially the \"Magnificent Seven\"), there are some bargains out there. Here are three dirt cheap stocks worth investing $1,000 into right now.\nAlphabet: The cheapest Mag 7 stock\nA big driver of the stock market's rally has been the strong returns of the Magnificent Seven tech titans. They've grown significantly in value and currently make up more than 35% of the S&P 500's market cap. The Magnificent Seven collectively trade at nearly 30 times forward earnings, and are a big factor driving the index's elevated valuation.\nHowever, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stands out from the rest of the Magnificent Seven. The search giant currently trades at slightly more than 20 times its forward earnings, which is a discount not only compared to the group's average of nearly 30 times, but also slightly below the S&P 500's average of about 22 times forward earnings. The lower valuation is due to investor concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) will eat into its lucrative search business.\nThose concerns seem to be overblown. Google search revenue rose nearly 12% in the second quarter to over $54 billion. AI has been a tailwind, not a headwind, for this business. CEO Sundar Pichai noted in the second-quarter earnings press release that:\nWe are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. Search delivered double-digit revenue growth, and our new features, like AI Overviews and AI Mode, are performing well.\nThe company also saw robust growth in Google Cloud (up 32%), driven in part by AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions.\nAlphabet's strong AI growth drivers and attractive valuation make it stand out these days.\nRealty Income: A consistent performer with multiple upside catalysts\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) knows how to create shareholder value. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has delivered above-average total operational returns (dividend yield plus FFO- per-share growth) over the past one-, three-, and five-year periods. Despite this track record, Realty Income currently trades at a much lower earnings multiple (13) compared to its peer group average of 18. That lower valuation relative to peers contributes to Realty Income's high dividend yield (over 5.5%).\nSeveral catalysts could boost the REIT's valuation in the coming years. Interest rates, which have been a headwind in recent years, could become a tailwind as they fall. Lower rates would help lower Realty Income's funding costs while also making its higher-yielding dividend more attractive to income-seeking investors.\nAdditionally, there's a massive and growing need for retirement income as more people retire in the coming years. That will likely make Realty Income a more attractive investment option for a broader audience.\nFinally, the company is starting to tap into the massive private capital market by launching a private fund. This strategy should generate management fee income and higher investment returns. It could also boost its valuation as the market starts seeing Realty Income as more of an asset manager (which investors value more highly).\nEnergy Transfer: High-octane total return potential\nEnergy Transfer(NYSE: ET) is one of the largest and most diversified energy midstream companies. The master limited partnership (MLP) has been growing earnings at a 10% compound annual rate over the past five years and is in its strongest financial position ever. Despite these positives, Energy Transfer currently trades at the second-lowest valuation in its peer group -- less than 9 times earnings compared to the peer average of 12 times. This lower relative valuation helps explain its high distribution yield (over 7.5%).\nThe MLP has a lot of growth still ahead. It's investing $5 billion into growth capital projects this year, which should boost its financial results in 2026 and 2027 as they enter service. Meanwhile, it recently significantly enhanced and extended its growth outlook by securing several new expansion projects. They include the massive $5.3 billion Desert Southwest Expansion project that should enter commercial service by the end of the decade.\nEnergy Transfer has more growth ahead. It's close to finally approving its Lake Charles LNG export terminal. It's also working on several projects to supply gas to AI data centers and power plants. Additionally, the company has ample financial capacity to make acquisitions as opportunities arise. Energy Transfer's combination of yield, growth, and low valuation positions it to potentially produce high-octane total returns in the coming years. The MLP also offers potential tax benefits by sending investors a Schedule K-1 federal tax form each year.\nSmart stocks to invest in these days\nWhile the stock market is getting more expensive as it continues to rise, several stocks are still pretty cheap. Alphabet, Realty Income, and Energy Transfer currently stand out as some of the cheapest stocks to buy these days. They could turn a $1,000 investment into a much bigger future payday.\nShould you buy stock in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

It’s easy. You contribute your part, you choose your funds and you never think about it again. When you do have to visit it, it’s usually an emergency and you make desperate decisions on your own.\nFor this reason, many people are not doing as well with their employer-sponsored retirement plan as they could be. To help you avoid that pitfall, we spoke to financial experts who focus on 401(k) plans in their line of work. They’ve offered us these five things people always regret doing with their retirement fund.\nNot Contributing More\nYou hear it all the time, right? People don’t lie on their deathbeds thinking, “I wish I didn’t have all those adventures.” Or “I wish I hadn’t spent all that quality time with my family.” You rarely regret doing those things. Instead, you regret not doing the things. The same philosophy applies to your money.\n“The number one regret people have regarding their 401(k) is not contributing more and earlier to their 401(k) [plan]s. I’ve been doing this for over 15 years and I’ve never once heard a client say, ‘Man, I wish I didn’t have all that money saved in my 401(k).’ I have, however, heard, ‘I just wish I started earlier,'” said David Silversmith, certified public accountant (CPA) and certified financial planner (CFP) at the Eisner Advisory Group LLC.\nRemember, the more you contribute, the more interest you’ll earn and the more interest you earn, the more interest you’ll earn. It’s a compounding financial equation that can make you very wealthy by the time you retire.\nAccording to Bob Wood, Ph.D., professor of finance at the University of South Alabama, you should at the very least be contributing what your employer will match. “Foregoing a 100% return on those funds is inexcusable,” he explained.\nBut, as Wood said, even that is not enough. “An employee should contribute up to the legal maximum contribution,” he added.\nIn short, cut corners in other places if you have to, but do everything you can to max out your 401(k) contribution.\nWithdrawing Early\nEmergencies happen. We get it. Virtually everyone has been there. But you cannot think of your 401(k) as a savings account.\n“Withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) are taxable income. Withdrawals before the age of 59 and a half are subject to an additional 10% penalty. The IRS gives a list of exceptions to this penalty. If one makes an early distribution without meeting one of the exceptions, the individual could be subject to a hefty tax bill,” Silversmith said.\nSo, unless your emergency falls under one of these exceptions, you’ll pay way more than you’ll want to by withdrawing from your fund.\nAnd even if it is one of those emergencies, think long and hard before making that withdrawal. You’ll be losing the chance to make money on your money. In many cases, you may even be better off taking out a small loan rather than withdrawing from your 401(k).\nNot Consulting With Your CPA\nWhatever you decide to do, make sure you consult your CPA or financial advisor. Talking to someone who knows finance, whom you trust, can mean the difference between losing thousands of dollars and making thousands of dollars.\n“Another common regret people make is that they do not notify their CPA or financial advisor when they conduct major financial transactions in their 401(k) [plan]s. The rules around 401(k) plans and IRAs are complex. Not checking first with a CPA or financial advisor can result in costly mistakes and being assessed substantial tax and financial penalties,” Silversmith explained.\nSo, before you make any big moves with your 401(k), pick up the phone. You’ll be glad you did.\nNot Paying Attention to Your Funds\nBack to that “set it and forget it” mentality. For whatever reason, people pick their funds when they sign up through their employer. But then, they never revisit that decision.\nOver the years, your employer may add new funds. Old funds may not match your interests. Or your lifestyle may just have changed.\n“The number three regret people have is not periodically monitoring their plan’s fund menu to see if there are new funds added that may be more cost-effective. Older plans often still include costly mutual funds. As the investor, it is in your best interest to research every fund available to you,” said Amy Zamikovsky, Juris Doctorate, CFP and certified private wealth advisor (CPWA).\nMake sure that you revisit your financial plan and your funds every couple of years as a practice. This will help you build your wealth in a way that makes more sense. So you won’t get left behind while others are maximizing their potential for growth.\n“A few important things investors should be looking out for when choosing funds inside their 401(k) are: the fund’s historical performance as compared to benchmarks, market cap, expense ratio, risk profile — such as standard deviation, beta and Sharpe ratio, whether the fund is active or passive, Morningstar rating and the fund manager’s background and tenure,” Zamikovsky added.\nNot Rolling Over\nFinally, one of the biggest regrets people have about their 401(k) plans is not even realizing their growth capabilities once they reach a certain age.\n“At 59.5, many 401(k) plans provide for what’s called an in-service rollover. This allows the employee to roll the existing funds in their 401(k) into a rollover IRA managed by a dedicated financial advisor. Once someone becomes an accredited investor (earning $200,000 or more per year or $300,000 or more if married or having a net worth of more than $1 million, excluding their primary residence), they legally gain access to far more investment opportunities than the average retail investor,” Zamikovsky said.\nShe made the point that you could be earning much more money, even if you have to pay a bit more to level up. You’ll end up coming out ahead in the end. Just having this kind of knowledge can be incredibly helpful when you reach the age or price point to start taking advantage of these extra benefits.\n“Various alternative investments can offer investors enhanced portfolio diversification, potential inflation protection and access to strategies that are not correlated with public markets, which can help reduce portfolio volatility. The problem is that most investors who transition into accredited status are unaware of their new status and the long-term financial benefits it can unlock for them,” she added.","content_hash":"16489b11556e32565bc942cfd120c31a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6459,"method_rank":0}

Many of them still offer tremendous opportunity. I think Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), American Express(NYSE: AXP), and Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) look like no-brainer stocks to buy today.\n1. Amazon: AI and more\nAmazon has a huge, multi-pronged business that services individuals and businesses in numerous ways, making it an important player in the economy. It's coming close to being the largest company in the world by sales, giving it a leg up on any competitor.\nE-commerce sales are not usually one of its higher-growth segments, but they were strong in the 2025 second quarter, up 11% year over year. So although the market still seems to be worried about tariffs, so far, they have had the unintended effect of shoppers stockpiling goods early in case tariffs make them more expensive at some point down the line. Although that's still uncertain, management has pointed out that its selection of products and varied suppliers provide it with strength even if tariffs impact its suppliers from China.\nAmazon's investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics provide it with further ways to speed up deliveries. One example is that AI improved robot travel efficiency by 10%, which over Amazon's vast network has large-scale effects. It added 1,000 new regions where it offers same and next-day deliveries in the second quarter, and it's planning on adding 4,000 more.\nThe major opportunity for Amazon today is in AI through its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is by far the leading cloud company in the world, and management is investing in developing its AI business to retain that title. It's releasing its own powerful chips for customers to access AI tools through its Bedrock program, and it's launching more tools that make it even easier to create robust AI applications.\nThen of course there's advertising, streaming, and Amazon's other businesses that provide long-term opportunity. Amazon still has a long growth runway, and it's a no-brainer stock for almost any portfolio.\n2. American Express: Resilient consumers\nAmerican Express has a differentiated model that's fee-based and focuses on an affluent consumer, and that's led to strong performance despite a pressured economy. Revenue increased 9% year over year in the second quarter, with record cardmember spending. There's also strong demand for its premium cards, which come with an annual fee and create a recurring revenue stream. It added 3.1 million new cards in the second quarter, with about half of them U.S. consumer cards. Sixty-three percent of global additions were millennials and Gen Z, younger cohorts that will drive future growth, and 71% of new accounts were for fee-based products. Fee revenue increased 20% year over year in the second quarter and accounted for almost 14% of total revenue.\nThe focus on a resilient, upscale client base along with robust risk management also results in best-in-class credit metrics. Among millennials and Gen Z consumers, past dues were 1.9% versus 4.4% for the industry in the second quarter, and 1.3% for Gen X and baby boomers versus 3.1% for the industry.\nThe company has a closed-loop model, which means it funds its own credit and it also offers a large array of banking services to its users. That gives it a lot of cash to invest and use to fund its business, and net interest income increased 12% over last year in the second quarter.\nAmerican Express is one of Buffett's oldest stocks, and since Berkshire Hathaway has been selling Apple and Bank of America, American Express now accounts for 15.8% of the portfolio, the second-largest position.\n3. Domino's: Everyone's favorite takeout\nPizza is a big business, and Domino's is the biggest pizza company. That's a feature Buffett appreciates, because when you're the largest operator in a space that everyone needs (like Coca-Cola or Visa, two of his other stocks), that already gives you an edge. So while Domino's is fairly new to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, it fits right in.\nCEO Russell Weiner described Domino's as having \"what we believe are best-in-class unit economics, the largest advertising budget, a robust supply chain, and a rewards program that is bigger than ever.\" That builds on its ability to strengthen its moat and keep its dominant position.\nThere's plenty of room to grow even at the top. Domino's has more than 21,000 stores globally, but it's always adding more. It opened 178 net new stores in the 2025 fiscal second quarter (ended June 15) and more than 600 over the trailing 12 months. But the investments in advertising and the rewards program are leading to higher comparable sales as well. And because pizza is cheap fast food, it's resilient when there's inflation. Domino's has been able to increase prices to offset increasing costs, making sure the bottom line is still strong, too.\nDomino's may not be the highest-growth company or stock, but it's likely to keep gaining and reward shareholders for years.\nShould you buy stock in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The company is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It originally developed its AI-powered data mining tools in the wake of the 9\/11 terrorist attacks, with the idea that information buried deep in various intelligence databases could be combined to root out and stop terrorist attacks.\nIts process developed such useful insights that Palantir expanded beyond its original mandate, using these sophisticated algorithms to help business leaders make data-driven decisions. By aggregating information from current and legacy software systems under a single dashboard, Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) can provide clear analysis and actionable intelligence, saving businesses time and money.\nThat unbridled success has translated into meteoric growth and a blistering run for the stock. But this could be just the beginning. CEO Alex Karp just announced plans to grow the company's revenue tenfold while reducing Palantir's head count.\nLet's review what he said and see what this could mean for the stock price.\nAccelerating growth\nAlex Karp is no stranger to controversy, so it isn't a surprise that he would make what some might consider an outlandish claim. In an interview with Morgan Brennan on CNBC on August 5, he turned heads when he remarked, \"We're planning to grow our revenue ... while decreasing our number of people. This is a crazy, efficient revolution. The goal is to get 10x revenue and have 3,600 people. We now have 4,100.\"\nIt's important to give Karp's comments some context. When he talks about the \"crazy, efficient revolution,\" he's no doubt referring to the productivity gains made possible by generative AI. He seems to suggest that those efficiency gains will allow Palantir to multiply its sales by 10 with slightly fewer employees.\nIn Q2, Palantir generated revenue that had increased 48% year-over-year to $1 billion. This marked the eighth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue and the first time in the company's history that it surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue. At the same time, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.16 surged 78%.\nThe results were driven by its U.S. commercial segment (which includes AIP), which grew 93% year over year and 20% quarter over quarter to $306 million, representing nearly 31% of revenue. Not bad for a product that debuted just over two years ago.\nPalantir clearly believes its growth streak has room to run, as management increased its guidance for the coming quarter. The company's forecast is calling for revenue of $4.146 billion at the midpoint of its guidance (increased from $3.895 billion), which would amount to growth of 44%. Palantir also increased its outlook for U.S. commercial revenue growth, guiding for an increase of at least 85%.\nIt's also worth noting that Palantir's Rule of 40 score, a key metric that views revenue in the context of profitability, soared to 94% during Q2. Any number above 40% is considered a success, so Palantir's score is outrageously good.\nWith that as a backdrop, let's see how long it could take for Palantir to grow its revenue by 10x (in a perfect world) and what it would mean for the stock price.\nAchievable or just plain hubristic?\nAt first glance, Karp's pronouncement might seem like sheer hubris, but running the numbers reveals that, given the company's current trajectory, Palantir could actually achieve this lofty goal sooner than later -- but plenty of things will have to go right.\nPalantir currently sports a market cap of $429.44 billion (as of this writing). Wall Street is forecasting revenue of $4.16 billion this fiscal year, which gives the company a forward price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 103 (not a typo). Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of roughly 39% annually over the coming five years. From here, we'll have to make a few big assumptions:\nThe P\/S remains constant\nThere are no stock splits\nThe outstanding share count remains the same\nPalantir can maintain year-over-year revenue growth of 39% (or more)\nAssuming these factors, Palantir could grow its revenue to $41.6 billion annually by mid-2033. If that happened, its market cap would be in the neighborhood of $4.3 trillion, resulting in a share price of $1,891, or share price gains of 945%, or a 10-bagger.\nAll the usual disclaimers\nTo be clear, this is all fun with numbers, and a lot would have to go right for Palantir to reach this goal, especially by 2033. It would have to execute flawlessly for the next eight years.\nAny combination of slowing growth, multiple compression, stock market corrections, bear markets, or black swan events could throw a wrench in the works, slowing or reversing Palantir's relentless march higher.\nWhat's more likely to occur is that Palantir will experience years of fluctuating revenue growth, its multiple will decrease, and the stock will appreciate tenfold sometime over the next decade or two. But there are simply no guarantees.\nLest there be any doubt, I'm a Palantir bull and believe the company has accomplished amazing things and will continue to do even more. I simply think the thought exercise I've laid out above is a bit ambitious.\nThe good news for those planning to hold Palantir for the next decade is that the future looks bright, and the stock price will likely be much higher 10 years from now.\nShould you buy stock in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

However, in 2025, the company's focused and disciplined approach is quietly turning heads.\nBy concentrating on its core North American ride-hailing business and strategically expanding into Europe through its recent acquisition of FreeNow, Lyft is charting a path toward sustainable growth and profitability.\nThe power of focus\nLyft's geographic and product focus has two clear advantages. First, it avoids the complexity of managing multiple business lines across dozens of countries. Instead of figuring out the regulations, pricing dynamics, and competitive threats in every region of the world, Lyft can concentrate resources on improving service, increasing driver supply, and fine-tuning pricing where it already operates.\nSecond, this singular focus allows management to dedicate attention and capital to its primary product -- ride-hailing. That's showing up in the numbers. In Q2 2025, Lyft reported a record 26.1 million active riders, a 10% year-over-year increase, and facilitated nearly 235 million rides, up 14% from the prior year. These gains suggest Lyft is successfully attracting and retaining customers and drivers alike, crucial ingredients for long-term viability.\nThis strategy contrasts with Uber's expansive portfolio, which includes food delivery, freight, and fintech businesses across more than 70 countries. While Uber benefits from diversification, its leadership has to balance competing priorities and capital allocation. Lyft's leaner model is simpler but also potentially more efficient.\nFocus reflected in the bottom line\nThat focus isn't just a talking point -- it's showing up in Lyft's financials. The company reported $4.5 billion in gross bookings for the second quarter of 2025, representing a 12% year-over-year increase. Net income expanded to $40 million, up from $5 million the previous year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) grew 26% to $129 million, reflecting steadily improving margins, up from 1.2% in the second quarter of 2023 to 2.9% in the current period.\nImportantly, Lyft has turned positive on free cash flow -- a milestone in an industry notorious for cash burn. It first delivered positive trailing-12-month free cash flow (FCF) of $368 million in the second quarter of 2024. Since then, the FCF has increased to $993 million in the second quarter of 2025, representing a nearly threefold increase over the past year.\nWith a growing free cash flow, Lyft can redirect it into further refining its operations, as well as its targeted expansion strategy -- starting with Europe.\nEurope enters the picture with the FreeNow acquisition\nLyft's recent €175 million acquisition of FreeNow, a leading European mobility platform serving 180 cities in nine countries, marks a meaningful step beyond North America. FreeNow's established presence offers Lyft a ready-made platform to test its focused ride-hailing model internationally, expanding its addressable market while maintaining operational discipline.\nThis move signals Lyft's intention to grow -- but on its terms. Instead of chasing global dominance, Lyft is opting for targeted, capital-efficient expansion that complements its core strengths.\nAnd the benefits could be massive. One thing to note is that Lyft's U.S. riders can now use the Freenow service when traveling to Europe, and vice versa for Freenow riders. Similarly, drivers can now expect more rides, which should improve driver income and enhance loyalty.\nWhat investors should watch in the coming quarters\nOf course, focus cuts both ways. The challenge for Lyft will be to grow meaningfully without diluting its focus. That could mean expanding into adjacent mobility services, such as rentals, bikes, or partnerships with autonomous vehicle providers, while still keeping its operations concentrated in North America and now in Europe.\nAs Lyft executes this strategy, investors should track several key indicators:\nActive riders and ride volume: Sustained growth in this area indicates continued demand and engagement in core markets.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin: Indicates whether Lyft can sustain and improve profitability as it scales.\nFree cash flow: Essential for assessing Lyft's financial health and its ability to invest internally.\nDriver supply and retention metrics: Drivers are the backbone of ride-hailing economics. Improvements suggest stronger unit economics.\nFreeNow integration: Progress and contribution from the European acquisition will reveal if Lyft's international push is gaining traction.\nWhat does it mean for investors?\nLyft's \"stay small, execute well\" strategy bucks conventional wisdom in a tech world that is often obsessed with size and diversification. However, in ride-hailing, where operational execution and unit economics are paramount, this approach could prove effective.\nWith a growing base of riders, improving profitability, and a smart European expansion under its belt, Lyft is quietly carving out a sustainable, profitable niche. The risks remain -- particularly Uber's scale and market power -- but for investors focused on disciplined growth and cash flow, Lyft's focused comeback deserves attention.\nIt's worth keeping the stock on watch while Lyft executes on its strategy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lyft right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Lyft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lyft wasn’t one of them.

That's like creating a company the size of Home Depot out of thin air.\nAfter languishing for most of the year, let's determine if Apple has what it takes to join Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in the $4 trillion market cap club, and if the growth stock is a buy now.\nApple's massive news\nApple's sudden pop came in response to its $100 billion manufacturing program. Announced last week, the program will create American jobs and onshore some of Apple's complex supply chain.\nDue to Apple CEO Tim Cook's visit to the White House and Apple's manufacturing commitment, President Trump said that Apple would be 100% exempt from a specific tariff on imported semiconductors. The potential for Apple to reduce its costly tariff expense, and maybe even get government support for its onshoring efforts, is undoubtedly a boon for the company's near-term prospects.\nApple isn't the only mega-cap company that is trying to work with the current administration on tariffs. On Monday, reports indicated that Nvidia made a deal with President Trump, allowing the chipmaker to resume exporting its H20 chips in exchange for giving the U.S. government 15% of its revenue from China. The H20 is a scaled-down version of Nvidia's most advanced chips, which are custom-built for Chinese markets to comply with trade restrictions. The current administration intends to retain certain tariffs, but it also appears willing to negotiate deals with big businesses.\nApple's manufacturing news is positive, based on the near-term impact of tariffs. The investment could help Apple reduce its sensitivity to trade tensions and geopolitical risk. However, it's unclear how it impacts Apple's long-term investment thesis. Apple has mastered the art of managing a global supply chain to achieve cost advantages and boost its profit margins. Onshoring some of its supply chain could lead to higher costs.\nHowever, Apple has yet to make a meaningful splash in artificial intelligence (AI) -- which is one of the main reasons why the tech giant has been lagging behind the performance of other, more defined AI winners like Nvidia and Microsoft.\nIn Apple's defense, the company has built on Apple Intelligence and released a new design update called Liquid Glass. Overall, the market is not impressed with the company's AI efforts, considering how sluggish Apple's growth has been in recent years.\nApple's earnings growth doesn't justify its lofty valuation\nApple has heavily relied on its high-margin services segment and stock buybacks to drive earnings to offset weak results from its product segment. Apple's services, which include iCloud, Apple Music, and Apple TV+, have been the standout for years now. But Apple's bottom line depends more on key products, like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and wearables.\nInvestors breathed a sigh of relief after Apple's latest quarter -- the third quarter of fiscal 2025 -- which showed a significant improvement in its product segment. Revenue grew 10% and diluted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 12% including double-digit growth in iPhone, Mac, and services. Despite the solid quarter, Apple's net income has slightly declined over the last three years, so its earnings are only up due to buybacks. But the stock price has gone up substantially, which has made Apple relatively expensive.\nApple's results are headed in the right direction, but the valuation is far from cheap. In fact, Apple's forward price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio, which is the stock price divided by analyst consensus EPS estimates over the next 12 months, is higher than its five-year and 10-year median P\/E ratios. Even if Apple performs as expected and the stock price doesn't move for a year, it will still be relatively expensive.\nApple has to earn $4 trillion the hard way\nApple is taking the right approach to integrating AI across its product suite. Apple's competitive advantages are its design, user-friendly products, seamless integration of software and hardware, and comprehensive product offerings for consumers and businesses. In other words, the everyday usefulness of Apple's AI features is the most important performance indicator.\nInvestors who agree with Apple's deliberate approach to AI may still want to consider buying the stock now, despite the premium valuation. However, given how pricey Apple is, its road to $4 trillion in market cap will likely need to come from earnings growth rather than valuation expansion.\nWith a market cap of $3.418 trillion at the time of this writing, Apple would have to jump 17% to cross $4 trillion. It could certainly grow earnings by that much in a year or two. And if investors like what the company is doing with AI, it could maintain its higher-than-historical valuation.\nAll told, I expect Apple to cross $4 trillion in market cap by the end of 2026 -- but investors shouldn't expect the company to get there overnight -- even after adding $392 billion in market cap in just three days.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Here's what separates these growth stocks from the rest of the pack.\nThe building blocks of AI\nNvidia and Broadcom both play crucial roles in the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI).\nNvidia's graphics processing units, CUDA software platform, and associated infrastructure provide a full-scale AI ecosystem for data centers. Orders continue to pour in for Nvidia's chips as big tech companies ramp up capital expenditures to support AI models.\nBroadcom makes application-specific integrated circuits, which are AI accelerators that can perform specific functions. The company's latest customer accelerator (XPU) is its 3.5D eXtreme Dimension System in Package, which drastically cuts down on power consumption and boosts efficiency between components -- all within a smaller package size. Broadcom offers compute, memory, network, and packaging capabilities, giving customers a vertically integrated solution for AI at scale.\nBroadcom has a highly differentiated networking and infrastructure software business. In addition to AI accelerators, its semiconductor segment also offers a variety of solutions for enterprise clients, like broadband, wireless, storage, and more.\nThree different ways to bet on cloud computing\nMicrosoft, Alphabet, and Oracle offer three distinctly different ways to invest in cloud computing.\nMicrosoft Azure is the No. 2 cloud player behind Amazon Web Services. Azure is Microsoft's fastest-growing segment -- capitalizing on AI demand through cloud offerings specifically geared toward handling AI workloads. But what separates Microsoft from other cloud plays is the strength of the rest of its business. Copilot for Azure, the Microsoft 365 software suite, and GitHub continue to grow their active user base. Microsoft's revenue growth has accelerated, and profit margins are at their highest level in over a decade -- driving Microsoft's surging stock price.\nAlphabet's Google Cloud doesn't have as much market share as Azure, but it is growing quickly and becoming more profitable. But unlike Microsoft, where cloud is the centerpiece of the investment thesis, Google Cloud doesn't contribute nearly as much to Alphabet's bottom line as other services -- namely Google Search and YouTube.\nAlphabet stock has roared higher in recent months, but it's still arguably the best value of the Ten Titans.\nWhile Google Search could see disruption from rival information resources like ChatGPT, it's worth noting that Google Gemini has gained significant traction in recent quarters -- showing Alphabet's ability to adapt.\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is arguably the most exciting play in cloud computing right now. OCI is thriving due to its flexible structure, which leans on Oracle's established database ecosystem. It is best paired with Oracle databases and applications, with certain services not available on other clouds.\nInstead of going toe-to-toe with the \"big three\" cloud providers, Oracle partners with them by combining its database services with the AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud infrastructure. All told, Oracle is a top play in cloud computing because it offers its own vertically integrated suite of solutions, but also stands to benefit from the overall growth of the industry through its partnerships.\nThese titans are worth their premium price tags\nNvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle have all been phenomenal stocks -- crushing the S&P 500 over the last five years. With the exception of Alphabet, outsized gains have made valuations expensive based on their trailing and forward earnings estimates, which may deter some investors from approaching these names.\nHowever, folks who are looking for top companies to buy and hold through at least 2030 will care more about where a company will be years from now than the next few quarters. The advantage of a longer investment time horizon is that you can give a company time to grow into its valuation. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Oracle are some of the most expensive of the Ten Titans, but they also have the most attractive runways for growth. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Alphabet have more reasonable valuations and multiple levers to pull for growing earnings for years to come.\nThere are valid cases for buying all of the Ten Titans, but Nvidia, Broadcom, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Oracle truly stand out as the best of the best for long-term investors.\nDo the experts think Nvidia is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

But some on Wall Street are cautioning that turmoil surrounding relations between the U.S. and its major trading partners is far from over. \"Our views have been at odds with the investor consensus all year – and they still are,\" Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler, wrote in a report this summer. \"The emerging narrative is that even though tariffs are high, we now have deals that will provide stability in trade policy. Therefore, economic actors can adjust to the new reality and move on,\" he said. In his firm's opinion, however, \"trade stability is not in the cards.\" Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs went into effect on Aug. 7. The president had announced the sweeping levies back on April 2, and their initial size sent stocks reeling before a series of walk-backs from the White House eased investors' concerns. Stocks have since recovered these losses and gone on to score record highs. Lately, investors have been betting that Trump won't implement the most draconian of his trade plans, in what has come to be known as the TACO trade, short for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" But the duties that Trump announced in early April have in large part taken hold. An exception is Vietnam, as shown by Piper Sandler data. Though still high, the rate on imports from Vietnam is less than half the level Trump threatened on April 2, Laperriere said. \"One of the things that I think is interesting, that I think is underappreciated is that 'liberation day' mostly arrived,\" Laperriere said during a webinar earlier this month. \"When you look at our major trading partners, most of what was put on the board on April 2 is on the board now.\" Catalysts for instability Trump's tariffs have faced significant legal challenges, with a federal appeals court judge seeming skeptical in late July of the president's claim that he has the authority to impose new tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), a law that grants the president authority to regulate international commerce in response to a national emergency. Trump later warned U.S. courts against blocking his tariff policy. With the ongoing litigation and unsettled backdrop, uncertainty around the future of tariffs and trade persists. \"If the courts find he is overstepping his authority to impose tariffs, which is highly likely, then the deals are null and void,\" Laperriere wrote in his report. \"The Supreme Court is likely to rule against Trump's use of IEEPA within the next 10 months.\" One reason countries continue to negotiate is the assumption that Trump could pivot to use another authority if his IEEPA claim is struck down, said Ed Mills, managing director and Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. For example, Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 — the original Smoot-Hawley protectionist legislation — allows a president to implement tariffs of up to 50% on imported goods from countries that discriminate against U.S. commerce. Trump \"has a history of taking the entire legal process to run out the clock,\" Mills told CNBC. \"Tariffs are here to stay.\" Another driver of instability is the lack of details about the trade agreements that have so far been reached. For instance, Trump announced trade deals with Indonesia and the Philippines , but the specifics have yet to be confirmed. Additionally, officials from other countries including Japan and South Korea have disagreed with Trump on the terms of their agreements, signaling they have not yet been finalized. Unsettled \"Foreign officials describe the few details differently than Trump and his top advisors, so even some of the high-level features have not been ironed out,\" Laperriere wrote. \"These deals aren't settled and are built in part on phony promises. They could easily fall apart.\" On top of that, some trading partners, such as the European Union, are unlikely to live by their deals for very long, he claimed. Last month, Trump said that he reached a deal with the bloc , one that involves a 15% tariff on most European goods coming into the U.S. But European leaders and analysts criticized the deal shortly thereafter, calling it \"unbalanced.\" Meanwhile, no final agreements have been reached between the U.S. and key partners such as Canada, Mexico and China . In fact, Trump last Monday delayed imposing additional tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days. The president could meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping \"around the [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] summit\" in the fall, though \"what happens at that meeting is a big wild card,\" Mills said. \"There are going to be some countries where they're able to get to a final agreement and other countries where they fall apart,\" Mills said to CNBC. \"I think that the larger the trading partner is, the more likely they are going to find a way to get to yes.\" 'Priced out' risk Even with some of Trump's tariffs going into effect, the stock market has soared to all-time highs this summer, underscoring optimism that the U.S. economy can withstand threats of high tariffs at home and abroad. Yet, Laperriere believes Wall Street isn't properly accounting for the potential impacts of the duties on the economy. For now, JPMorgan projects that tariffs could result in about a 1% hit to gross domestic product. Prediction markets have been pricing out recession risk, with the likelihood down to 10% over the weekend from about 70% in May. That suggests markets were either pricing in a recession scenario that was \"too high in early May or it's too low now,\" Laperriere said. \"The broader tariff risk is arguably completely priced out of markets, though individual companies and sectors that would be adversely impacted by them have generally underperformed,\" he wrote in a report in early August. Ultimately, perhaps, the biggest unknown remains the quixotic \"Trump factor,\" which can't be quantified, Brian Gardner, Stifel's chief Washington policy strategist, said in an interview. \"He can change his mind at any given time, and has, as some of these deals have progressed,\" he said. \"There's nothing to prevent him from changing his mind again down the road.\"","content_hash":"b71095ff353f4059d6fb36d08a1ce9ea","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6283,"method_rank":0}

Let's look at three master limited partnerships (MLPs) that offer ultra-high yields, dependable operations, and steady growth. To begin investing in these names, $1,000 is a great starting point. But these have the type of steady operations that you can also feel free to dollar-cost average into over time.\nEnergy Transfer -- 7.6% Yield\nEnergy Transfer(NYSE: ET) is entering its next phase of growth with plenty of projects in its pipeline. The company recently announced the $5.3 billion Desert Southwest pipeline, a project that will transport natural gas coming from the Permian Basin to the Arizona and New Mexico markets. Backed by long-term contracts, it will be part of Energy Transfer's expanding Transwestern network and is expected to be online by late 2029. That's on top of its multiphase Hugh Brinson Pipeline, which will help serve power plants and data centers in Texas.\nThe company is also making progress on its long-awaited Lake Charles LNG export project, having now partnered with MidOcean Energy and secured several offtake deals. It is still looking for more equity partners before it green-lights the project, but it's getting close. With about $5 billion in growth capital expenditures (capex) this year -- half aimed at natural gas projects -- Energy Transfer is positioning itself to capture growing demand from both LNG (liquified natural gas) exports and energy-hungry data centers.\nMeanwhile, its financial foundation is solid. Leverage is at the low end of its targeted range, and it had a robust distribution coverage ratio of 1.7x last quarter based on its distributable cash flow (operating cash flow minus maintenance). Management has raised the distribution for 15 straight quarters, including a recent 3% increase, and expects 3% to 5% annual growth moving forward. With nearly 90% of 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) from fee-based contracts, this is a steady income generator with big growth optionality.\nEnterprise Products Partners -- 7% Yield\nEnterprise Products Partners(NYSE: EPD) is the definition of a reliable income stock. The company has increased its distribution for 26 consecutive years while having a strong coverage ratio and keeping leverage in check. About 80% of cash flow comes from fee-based contracts, many with take-or-pay provisions and inflation escalators, ensuring stability in any energy environment.\nEnterprise is conservatively run, with leverage just over 3x and debt locked in for an average of 18 years at only 4.7%. It self-funds most of its growth, avoiding the need for constant equity issuance. Meanwhile, it had a robust distribution coverage ratio of 1.6x in the second quarter.\nThe company is also seeing strong growth opportunities. It will spend between $4 billion and $4.5 billion in growth capex this year, which is a significant jump from the $1.6 billion it spent in 2022. With most of its growth projects set to come online this year or next, Enterprise should start to see accelerating growth next year. Overall, Enterprise offers solid income, stability, and a clear runway for growth.\nWestern Midstream -- 9.5% Yield\nWestern Midstream(NYSE: WES) delivers the highest yield of the group, but its payout is anchored by steady cash flows and disciplined management. The company is backed by parent Occidental Petroleum, which owns over 40% of the partnership. Western Midstream benefits from a strategic alignment with its parent company, as its contracts with Occidental are heavily tied to cost-of-service and minimum volume commitments (MVCs). This gives it a highly visible cash-flow stream.\nThe company is also starting to ramp up growth, with a focus on expanding its produced water business. Its two largest projects are the Pathfinder produced water system, which will handle over 800,000 barrels per day when it comes online in 2027, and the expansion of its North Loving natural gas processing plant.\nWestern Midstream also recently agreed to acquire Aris Water Solutions(NYSE: ARIS) in a $2 billion deal. The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive and brings with it over 625,000 acres of dedications, significant MVCs, and an expected $40 million in cost synergies.\nFinancially, Western Midstream is in solid shape with 2.9x leverage. Management plans to keep leverage at around 3x, even as it increases growth spending, while maintaining mid-single-digit distribution growth over the long term. However, it is looking to grow its profitability more quickly than its distribution to help bolster its distribution coverage ratio.\nWestern Midstream combines strong assets, clear growth drivers, a disciplined capital allocation strategy, and, most of all, a very robust yield that is sure to make any income-oriented investor happy.\nDo the experts think Energy Transfer is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

The big tech companies have been reporting strong performance, and the financial stocks are telling a story of economic growth.\nMany great growth stocks are riding the rise in the market, or generating it, and no matter what happens in the short term, they have incredible long-term prospects. In fact, depending on how much you invest, these stocks can lead to millionaire status even in five years from now. Consider Dutch Bros(NYSE: BROS), Upstart Holdings(NASDAQ: UPST), and Lemonade(NYSE: LMND).\n1. Dutch Bros: A new concept in coffee\nDutch Bros is a young coffee chain that's demonstrating rapid growth and improving economics. It has a distinctive culture that focuses on fun, fast, and friendly service, and it's leaning into beverage innovation to carve out a niche in a market that's mostly just coffee.\nCustomers are responding, and Dutch Bros has been reporting increasing sales, both overall and comparable. In the 2025 second quarter, revenue increased 28% year over year, and same-shop sales were up 6.1%. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) were up from $0.19 last year to $0.26 this year.\nThe opportunity in Dutch Bros is in its expansion. Although it just opened its 1,000th store, it envisions having 7,000 stores, with 2,029 stores by 2029. That implies an accelerated opening rate, since it's planning on opening 160 stores this year, and leaves open a long growth runway that should keep revenue increasing for many years.\nIf it can keep up a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% during the next five years, keeping the price-to-sales ratio constant, the stock would almost triple. It could be an incredible growth addition to a diversified portfolio, and if you invest enough, it could help you become a millionaire.\n2. Upstart: A better lending model\nUpstart has been a volatile stock, soaring in good times and plunging in challenging times. It's been all about interest rates, which is the case for many financial companies. Upstart, however, comes with the extra risk of being a young company in uncharted territory, which is why the impact on its stock has been more pronounced than on established bank stocks.\nIt uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers. As it refines its model, gets more experience, and demonstrates growth, there's a lot of future potential. In the second quarter, revenue rose 102% year over year on transaction growth of 159%. It's also back to net profitability on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis of $5.6 million.\nUpstart's expansion into newer types of loans is creating important diversification that's helping the platform. It recently started to roll out its first home loan product, and home loan originations increased ninefold from last year in the second quarter. Auto loans grew sixfold, and low-risk super prime loans continue to be a major part of the business.\nAt the current valuation, the stock is looking more stable. Upstart stock trades at a reasonable forward one-year price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 25. That gives it more room to expand. If interest rates decline, Upstart could continue reporting rapid growth, even if it falls back into double-digit percentage territory. This isn't a stock for the most risk-averse investor, but an investment in Upstart today could lead to market-beating gains during the next five years.\n3. Lemonade: A better insurance model\nLemonade is another AI disruptor that's growing fast and winning fans. It makes sense to use AI to price insurance policies, since the business relies on sophisticated algorithms in any case. Lemonade has built its platform from the ground up using digital technology, and the interconnected model is fast and efficient, approving many claims in minutes. That's a clear edge over legacy insurance models, which typically involve independent agents.\nIn-force premium (IFP) increased 29% year over year in the second quarter, and customer count increased 24%. Lemonade targets a younger customer who's looking for their first policy, often renters insurance, and the intention is to impress them and get more of their business as they continue on their insurance journey, creating high lifetime value.\nIt's not profitable yet, but its net loss narrowed from last year in the second quarter, and management expects positive profit on an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis next year. The loss ratio, which measures how much the company pays out in claims as a share of premiums, is decreasing, reaching 67% in the second quarter, or 70% for the trailing 12 months, well within management's target.\nLemonade stock is up 275% during the past year (as of Aug. 14), and if it maintains growth while keeping the loss ratio in check and becomes profitable, it should continue to skyrocket. For example, if revenue increases at a compound annual growth rate of 25% during the next five years, revenue will more than triple. If you invest enough today, your investment could soar during the next five years and be a part of a millionaire-maker portfolio.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dutch Bros wasn’t one of them.

Investors are always looking for a glimpse into the genius of Buffett and his team of investors, especially with Buffett set to step down as CEO of the company at the end of the year.\nWhile Berkshire has been quiet in recent quarters, the large conglomerate made some notable moves in the second quarter. Berkshire recently sold some shares in two of its largest positions, while piling into an embattled healthcare stock that has struggled immensely this year.\nTrimming Apple and Bank of America\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire continued to trim its largest position, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), and its third-largest holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). In the quarter, Berkshire sold 7% of its stake in Apple and 4% of its stake in Bank of America. Over the past year, Berkshire has reduced its stake in Apple by 30% and Bank of America by 41%.\nWhile the bull market has raged for more than 2.5 years, Berkshire has plodded along conservatively, hoarding hundreds of billions of dollars in cash and cash equivalents, selling more stocks than it buys, and even turning away from share repurchases more recently. Given stretched valuations and the stock market's big run, many investors simply think Buffett and his team are not seeing compelling opportunities.\nThere's also talk that Berkshire is staying conservative to prepare for the big transition that will see Buffett step down as CEO but retain his role as chairman of the board of directors. Longtime Berkshire veteran Greg Abel is set to step into Buffett's big shoes. Berkshire's stock got off to a terrific start this year but has floundered since the transition was announced.\nApple has been dealing with tariff-related issues all year. Buffett and Berkshire may have foreseen this once President Donald Trump won the election, leading them to pare back their position. If Berkshire is concerned about the economy, perhaps paring back some of their bank holdings makes sense as well, as banks are typically cyclical.\nPlaying contrarian on this healthcare giant\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire initiated a $1.57 billion position in the nation's largest healthcare insurer, UnitedHealth Group(NYSE: UNH). UnitedHealth's stock has been crushed this year and is down about 46%. However, after the news came out about Berkshire buying the stock, shares increased close to 9.5% in after-hours trading.\nUnitedHealth has dealt with a flurry of issues this year, including higher medical insurance costs, which is a common trend across the sector. In the second quarter, management at UnitedHealth revised its prior full-year outlook down to $16 adjusted earnings per share, significantly below Wall Street's consensus estimates coming into the year.\nThe main culprit is medical costs, which management thinks will come in $6.5 billion higher than previously expected. The sector has struggled in the face of an aging population, higher utilization of and more expensive services, higher drug prices, and inflation.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing UnitedHealth in a criminal investigation over the way it charges customers in its Medicare Advantage program. The Wall Street Journal has previously reported on suspicious billing practices that allegedly increase payouts to the company. In a statement in late July, UnitedHealth said it is cooperating with the DOJ but has \"full confidence in its practices and is committed to working cooperatively with the Department throughout this process.\"\nAt their core, Buffett and his team are value investors, meaning they look for stocks with a market value below a company's perceived intrinsic value. While UnitedHealth has struggled and is forecasting a significant earnings decline this year, management is still projecting double-digit revenue growth in 2025. Furthermore, the company's balance sheet seems to be on solid footing. Sure, the company has high debt, but through the first six months of the year, earnings from operations of about $14.3 billion are still more than 7 times debt interest expense.\nAdditionally, UnitedHealth's dividend yield is now roughly 3.25%, while the company's trailing free-cash-flow yield is above 10%, showing the company can easily cover the dividend for the foreseeable future. In fact, UnitedHealth recently increased its quarterly dividend by 5%.\nUltimately, UnitedHealth trades at a lower-than-usual forward price-to-earnings ratio, despite expectations of much lower earnings this year, and at less than 1 times revenue. Buffett and his team value strong moats, so with UnitedHealth still controlling market share in the healthcare insurance industry, they likely see an attractive risk-reward proposition.\nShould you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group right now?\nBefore you buy stock in UnitedHealth Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and UnitedHealth Group wasn’t one of them.

And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest public cloud as measured by infrastructure and platform services spending.\nAmazon is leaning on artificial intelligence across its retail business to improve customer service, product listings, supply chain management, and developer productivity. Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley says Amazon's retail business could be the most underappreciated generative AI beneficiary in the technology space, and he estimates cost savings initiatives could raise its operating margin by several percentage points.\nMeanwhile, AWS is ideally positioned to monetize AI simply because it is the largest public cloud. It accounted for 30% of infrastructure and platform services spending in the recent quarter, while the next closest cloud platform was Microsoft Azure with 20% market share. AWS has also designed custom chips for AI training and inference, and added tools that let developers build generative AI applications and agents.\nImportantly, Amazon is positioning itself to monetize AI beyond its core e-commerce and cloud businesses. Its subsidiary Zoox builds robotaxis, and the company will launch its first autonomous ride-hailing service in Las Vegas in 2025, followed by other cities in subsequent years. Morgan Stanley estimates Zoox could have commercial robotaxi services in seven U.S. cities by 2028.\nLooking ahead, Wall Street expects Amazon's earnings to grow at 18% annually over the next three years. That makes the current valuation of 35 times earnings look reasonable, especially when the company beat the consensus earnings estimate by an average of 22% in the last six quarters. Patient investors should take a cue from Bill Ackman and buy a few shares of this stock today.\nUber Technologies: 21% of Bill Ackman's portfolio\nUber leads the U.S. ride-sharing market with 76% share, according to Bloomberg. It also ranks second in the restaurant food delivery market with 24% share. That scale affords the company a competitive advantage in that it creates a significant amount of data that lets Uber predict demand, route drivers, and set prices more efficiently over time.\nUber has another important advantage in its ability to offer ride-sharing and food delivery services through a single mobile app. That makes customer acquisition very cost-efficient because the company can cross-sell users on both sides of its platform. For instance, 31% of first delivery trips come from mobility users, and 22% of first mobility trips come from delivery users.\nCEO Dara Khosrowshahi recently told analysts that autonomous vehicle (AV) technology will be a $1 trillion opportunity for ride-sharing platforms. Uber is uniquely positioned to benefit given its unparalleled scale. \"Uber can deliver the lowest operational costs for our AV partners because we are leaps and bounds ahead on every aspect of go-to-market capabilities,\" Khosrowshahi said.\nIndeed, Uber may not be a traditional AI stock, but it could be a major winner as robotaxis become more prevalent due to the many partnerships it has formed with AV companies, according to Mark Mahaney at Evercore. Most notably, Uber connects riders with Waymo robotaxis in Phoenix, Austin, and Atlanta. And it connects riders with WeRide robotaxis in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, with 15 additional cities to follow in the next five years.\nWall Street estimates Uber's earnings will increase at 26% annually over the next three years, a reasonable estimate given the ride-sharing market is forecast to expand at 21% annually through 2033, according to Straits Research. That makes the current valuation of 16 times earnings look relatively cheap. Long-term investors should feel confident buying a small position in this stock today.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

My portfolio is composed of dozens of stocks, as it provides me with a level of safety and diversification that lets me sleep at night. Even if one of my largest positions falls 30% or 40% (and they have), my entire portfolio only loses between 1% and 2%. I can't imagine a scenario where I would limit myself to one stock, and I recommend building a portfolio of 15 to 20 stocks at a minimum.\nThat said, and purely as a thought exercise, if I were to hold only one stock, it would have to meet certain criteria. I would want a company that is an industry leader, with a large addressable market and a long track record of performance. I would want to own a company that's a proven leader -- a business fueled by innovation, strong secular tailwinds, and a history of financial success.\nIf I could only buy and hold a single stock, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) would have to be it.\nChecks all the right boxes\nThere's certainly a lot to like about Nvidia, and it checks all the right boxes. The company has long been a leader in the video game market, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the top choice among hardcore and casual gamers alike. Nvidia is the undisputed leader in the discrete desktop GPU space, controlling 92% of the market, according to data compiled by Jon Peddie Research.\nNvidia was also able to capitalize on the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), as its GPUs are equally adept at ferrying data around the ether at lightning speeds. As a result, the company also leads the data center GPU space -- where most AI processing takes place -- with a dominant 92% of the market, according to IoT Analytics.\nAI has been the driving force behind Nvidia's performance over the past few years, but this wasn't simply luck. CEO Jensen Huang saw the writing on the wall back in 2013 and focused the company's research and development efforts on AI, which positioned Nvidia for future success.\nThis spirit of innovation has kept the company well ahead of would-be rivals. In its fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 26), Nvidia spent $13 billion on research and development (R&D) -- roughly 10% of its total revenue -- to maintain its competitive advantage. The company continues to explore emerging opportunities, including quantum computing, agentic AI, robotics, automation, self-driving cars, and more.\nIt's easy to see why Nvidia is investing heavily as it looks toward the future. The opportunity represented by AI alone is vast, but there's no consensus. Global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company estimates that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy over the coming decade. The estimate from Big Four accounting firm PwC is much higher, clocking in at $15.7 trillion between now and 2030.\nThis helps to illustrate the size of the opportunity Nvidia has in its sights.\nThe numbers are compelling\nNvidia has already been reaping the rewards of the AI revolution, and it's difficult to overstate the scale of its success. The results of the past two fiscal years help provide context:\nIn fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28, 2024), Nvidia's record revenue of $60.9 billion climbed 126%, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $12.96 surged 288%.\nIn fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 26, 2025), Nvidia's record revenue of $130.5 billion jumped 114%, while adjusted EPS of $2.99 soared 130%.\nIn its 2026 first quarter, Nvidia's revenue of $44 billion climbed 69% year over year and 12% quarter over quarter. Earnings per share, adjusted for a one-time charge related to its chip sales to China, came in at $0.96, rising 62%. While that's notable in its own right, it becomes even more impressive when viewed against the backdrop of triple-digit comps.\nManagement believes the company's growth streak will continue. For the second quarter, Nvidia is forecasting revenue of $45 billion, or growth of about 50%. However, given the company's history of issuing conservative guidance, the actual results will likely be higher.\nThis history of financial success has propelled a meteoric rise in the stock price, which has gained 1,130% since early 2023, and has helped Nvidia become the world's first $4 trillion company, when measured by market cap.\nWhile the company's performance over the past few years has been nothing less than stunning, its track record is much longer. Over the past decade, Nvidia's stock has soared more than 30,000% (not a typo), driven higher by its consistently strong operational and financial results.\nThere's also the matter of Nvidia's valuation. Despite the company's growth trajectory and history of success, the stock is selling for roughly 30 times next year's earnings, an attractive multiple given the magnitude of the opportunity.\nTaken together, its industry leadership, track record of innovations, visionary CEO, and large and growing market opportunity create a persuasive argument for owning Nvidia stock. Add to that the company's stunning financial performance and reasonable valuation, and it's easy to see why Nvidia would be the one stock to own if I could own just one.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Clues from Powell about the speed and depth of the cycle the Fed is about to embark on will be the week's biggest market-moving event.\nOn the corporate calendar, results from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and Home Depot (HD) highlight a slowing earnings schedule that sees the retail sector remain the key focus.\nAnd the economic data flow will be slow this week, with Thursday's updates on initial jobless claims and service sector activity the top highlights.\nInvestors may also keep a closer eye than usual on the minutes from the Fed's July 30-31 meeting released Wednesday, which could offer more color on the decision from Fed governors Waller and Bowman to vote against the central bank's decision to keep rates unchanged in a range of 4.25%-4.50% last month.\nOne more for the road\nIn 2018, Jerome Powell addressed the Jackson Hole symposium for the first time as Fed chair, outlining his views on the key variables that central bankers wrestle with, elucidating his non-economist's view on the most technical aspects of monetary policy.\nIn the intervening seven years, Powell has proven himself to be more of a pragmatist than a theoretician as he navigated 2018's false start on rate hikes, the COVID pandemic, the 2022 inflation shock, and the still-incomplete rate-cutting cycle that kicked off over a year ago.\n\"The time has come for policy to adjust,\" Powell said last August.\nRate cuts from the Fed in September, November, and December of last year have been on pause since. Growing dissent among his colleagues on the FOMC — and months of more forceful commentary from the White House — has seen Powell end up right where he stood a year ago.\nIn his 2018 speech, Powell spoke at length about Alan Greenspan's decisions in the mid-90s to hold off on rate hikes, lauding the former Fed chair's \"wait and see\" approach and foretelling a preference to wait that has defined much of Powell's tenure.\n\"Given what the economy has shown us over the past 15 years, the need for the sort of risk‑management approach that originated in the new-economy era is clearer than ever before,\" Powell said at the time. Barring the Fed's quick actions in March 2020, this line explains much of Powell's approach.\nAs Powell gets set to end his time leading the Fed, the president has bestowed on him a nickname: \"Too Late.\"\n\"The diversity of views on the FOMC is one of the great virtues of our system,\" Powell said. \"Despite differing views on these questions and others, we have a long institutional tradition of finding common ground in coalescing around a policy stance.\"\nIn a year, a new Fed chair will address the crowd at Jackson Hole. Interest rates will likely be lower. But how this new chair views these tenets of central banking will be the more important answer for the future of the Federal Reserve.\nEconomic data indicates US consumer spending has stabilizedafter tariff-related surprises this spring. How this information comes through in earnings reports scheduled for the week ahead will be one of the week's defining themes.\nWalmart's results Thursday morning, given the retailer's sheer size, will offer the broadest canvas for investors to work from.\nThe company said in May that consumers remained \"choiceful,\" with the company seeing growth across all income cohorts. Three months later, any signs of more confident spending will be welcomed by investors.\nWall Street expects its US same-store sales rose 4% in its fiscal second quarter, according to Bloomberg data. In its fiscal first quarter, same-store sales rose 4.5% in the US. Walmart stock has gained over 10% this year, outperforming the S&P 500 by roughly a percentage point.\nSingle-stock stories always stand at the ready to push around markets. Earnings from Nvidia on Aug. 27 will be another in this genre.\nBut last week's market action showed investors starting to move past the daily headlines in an indication of a market finding firmer footing.\n\"The bull market for stocks continued this week, and we’ve even seen some rotation out of the year’s biggest winners into beaten down laggards like Health Care and homebuilders,\" Bespoke Investment Group wrote in its weekly letter to clients.\n\"When momentum names stall or sell-off, it can really hit the major indices hard if no other areas of the market are there to pick up the slack, but this week, the year’s worst performers finally saw some buying interest as investors rotated across the market instead of out of it.\"\nLike most things in modern life, the stock market story remains defined by easily digestible ideas like \"Sell America\" or acronymic memes like TACO. But the S&P 500 hit a record high this week. Twice. The absence of euphoric feelings from the investor class is another way to stamp this rally with a clean bill of health.\nAnd while the market has been driven by Big Tech and the AI trade, this week's market rotation shows investors acting on another one of the society's defining themes in 2025 — everybody gets a turn.\nEconomic and earnings calendar\nMonday\nEconomic data: NAHB homebuilder sentiment, August (34 expected, 33 previously)\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week of Aug. 16 (224,000 previously); S&P Global US manufacturing PMI, August preliminary (49.8 previously); S&P Global US services PMI, August preliminary (55.7 previously); Existing home sales, July (-0.8% expected, -2.7% previously)","content_hash":"c11061d918f7b5546b2642dc50f084b3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6003,"method_rank":0}

Fifty hostages remain, and 20 of them are believed to still be alive.\n\"We don't win a war over the bodies of hostages,\" protesters chanted in one of the largest and fiercest protests in 22 months of war. Even some former Israeli army and intelligence chiefs now call for a deal to end the fighting.\nProtesters gathered at dozens of places including outside politicians' homes, military headquarters and on major highways. They blocked lanes and lit bonfires. Some restaurants and theaters closed in solidarity. Police said they arrested 38 people.\n\"The only way to bring (hostages) back is through a deal, all at once, without games,\" former hostage Arbel Yehoud said at a demonstration in Tel Aviv. Her boyfriend Ariel Cunio is still being held by Hamas.\nOne protester carried a photo of an emaciated Palestinian child from Gaza. Such images were once rare at Israeli demonstrations but now appear more often as outrage grows over conditions there for civilians after more than 250 malnutrition-related deaths.\nNetanyahu opposes leaving Hamas in power\nAn end to the conflict does not seem near. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is balancing competing pressures, including the potential for mutiny within his coalition.\n\"Those who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas' position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. 7 will be repeated,\" Netanyahu said, referencing the Hamas-led attack in 2023 that killed some 1,200 people and sparked the war.\nThe last time Israel agreed to a ceasefire that released hostages earlier this year, far-right members of his cabinet threatened to topple Netanyahu's government.\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on Sunday called the demonstrations \"a bad and harmful campaign that plays into Hamas' hands, buries the hostages in the tunnels and attempts to get Israel to surrender to its enemies and jeopardize its security and future.\"\nThe new offensive would require the call-up of thousands of reservists, another concern for many Israelis.\nAnother 17 aid-seekers killed in Gaza\nHospitals and witnesses in Gaza said Israeli forces killed at least 17 aid-seekers on Sunday, including nine awaiting U.N. aid trucks close to the Morag corridor.\nHamza Asfour said he was just north of the corridor awaiting a convoy when Israeli snipers fired, first to disperse the crowds, then from tanks hundreds of meters (yards) away. He saw two people with gunshot wounds.\n\"It's either to take this risk or wait and see my family die of starvation,\" he said.\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which runs the Israeli-backed and U.S.-supported distribution points that have become the main source of aid since they opened in May, said there was no gunfire \"at or near\" its sites, which are located in military-controlled areas.\nIsrael's military did not immediately respond to questions.\nIsrael's air and ground war has displaced most of Gaza's population and killed more than 61,900 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not specify how many were fighters or civilians but says around half were women and children.\nTwo children and five adults died of malnutrition-related causes Sunday, according to the ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.\nThe United Nations has warned that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began. Most aid has been blocked from entering Gaza since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after ending a ceasefire. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed.\nFears of the coming military offensive\nIt is not clear when Israel's military will begin the new offensive in the crowded Gaza City, Muwasi and what Netanyahu has called the \"central camps\" of Gaza.\nThe military body that coordinates its humanitarian aid to Gaza, COGAT, this weekend noted plans to forcibly evacuate people from combat zones to southern Gaza \"for their protection.\" Designated \"safe zones,\" however, also have been bombed during the war.\nWar-weary Palestinians on Sunday insisted that they won't leave, arguing that there is \"no safe place\" in Gaza.\n\"There are no humanitarian zones at all,\" said Raghda Abu Dhaher, who said she has been displaced 10 times during the war and now shelters in a school in western Gaza City.\nMohamed Ahmed also insisted that he won't move south. \"Here is bombing and there is bombing,\" he said.\nAirstrike on power plant in Yemen\nIsraeli airstrikes hit Yemen's capital Sunday, escalating strikes on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who since the war in Gaza began have fired missiles at Israel and targeted ships in the Red Sea.\nThe Houthi-run Al-Masirah Television said the strikes targeted a power plant in the southern district of Sanhan, sparking a fire and knocking it out of service. Israel's military said the strikes were launched in response to missiles and drones aimed at Israel.\nWhile some projectiles have breached its missile defenses — notably during its 12-day war with Iran in June — Israel has intercepted the vast majority of missiles launched from Yemen. Its military later Sunday said it had intercepted another.","content_hash":"0385cbc58466234b074c3c8b6c48230c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5904,"method_rank":0}

My spouse and I ( 51 and 59) have a household net worth of around $11 million, which includes oversized college funds for our two teenagers. We have retired from full-time work, although one of us does some 1099 work.\nWe recently bought a nicer home (and its value is included in that net worth). We’re trying to increase our charitable donations and plan some exciting travel for the summer and our upcoming empty-nest lives, but none of that is likely to make a big dent in our savings.\nThere’s no need to leave the kids more than $1 million to $2 million each (or spending equivalent at the time they inherit). What do other people spend their money on? We don’t want a boat or a second home (unless they would magically maintain themselves without headaches)\nDo we find one cause or charity or political movement? Am I delusional in thinking that even though we have too much, we should hold onto it all because we may need it in our old age? My spouse’s parents were in their 90s when they passed away and my mother is 79.\nWe live very modestly, which is fine; that’s our nature. What should we do?\nFinancial security shouldn’t change who you are. Even though you’ve got 11 million reasons to feel smug as well as secure, I like that you’re not into showboating your wealth or acquiring a lifestyle to which you would both like to become accustomed.\nYou’re the same people with $11 as you are with $11 million, except you have more choices now, including whether to work or not and whether or not to reward your children with enough money so they never have to work. Housing and education will be their biggest expenses.\nThere’s something freeing and life-affirming about a person who doesn’t feel compelled to share every vacation and dinner plate on social media, who doesn’t need the clicks and likes in order to get up in the morning and feel great about their life and the day ahead.\nIn 2025, you can give any third parties up to $19,000 each in a single tax year without having to give a taxable gift ($38,000 for spouses). Wealthy families can gift money freely without any major tax consequences: The lifetime gift\/estate tax exemption is currently $13.99 million.\nAs much as you (and I) will get pushback for your letter — accusations of humblebragging and “rich people’s problems” — and as much as I endeavor to answer letters from all walks of life economically, it’s easy to forget we are all alike, despite our bank balances.\nWhat truly makes us different is our values. Some people value charity and fundraising and allowing their kids to find their own way in life, while others value vacations and fancy schools and property, and making sure everyone knows about it.\nThis is a good time to put your assets in revocable and\/or irrevocable trusts, so you can organize your distributions to your children and to charities. What are the causes close to your heart? Animals? Mental health? Democracy? The environment? Cures for cancer?\nYou obviously have some kind of independent health insurance policy if you have both stopped working, but this is also a good time to plan for your long-term care. Medicare, as you may be aware, will not pay for long-term custodial care.\nConsider setting up a donor-advised fund: a charitable investment account that offers tax deductions for donating cash, securities or other assets to a sponsoring organization. But you are also trusting the fund to distribute your contributions in a timely manner.\nYou may get the biggest reward by becoming personally involved in a local charity or charities. Given that you don’t see the advantage of handing your children a multimillion-dollar fortune to sit on their laurels, you can also sponsor other people’s education.\nDo you love literature or art? You could establish a retreat for writers and\/or artists to visit either at a low cost or free of charge, based on their body of work. That sounds like more work, granted, but it illustrates the possibility of personal as well as financial investment.\nYou could renovate your existing home to make every day feel like a vacation. Some home-exchange sites have high-end houseswapping, if staying in a five-star hotel is not your cup of tea. Or try more expensive National Geographic Expeditions.\nCharles Schwab SCHW advocates for “dynasty trusts” for wealthy families to organize tax-efficient ways to distribute their wealth. The beauty of these trusts is that they can continue to do your good work long after you’re gone.\nThese are all-encompassing estate-planning vehicles. “A dynasty trust can be funded with almost any type of asset or property, including cash, investments, real estate, business interests, and valuable personal property,” Charles Schwab says.\n“Grantors looking to lower their taxable estate and slow its growth often elect to transfer assets with high growth potential,” it adds. “By contrast, those more concerned with reducing income tax for their heirs tend to fund their dynasty trusts with cash or tax-efficient assets.”\nSome states limit the lifespan of a trust, but others — among them Alaska, Delaware, Illinois, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island and South Dakota — all allow the trust to exist in perpetuity. So where the trust\/trustee is based is important.\n“To help extend the life of their legacy, a trust’s grantor can set certain rules for how the trust funds may be used,” Charles Schwab says. “Grantors commonly limit distributions to funds used for the health, education, maintenance, and support of the beneficiaries.”\nWhat’s more, a grantor (you and your wife, in this case) may add additional incentives, such as authorizing the trustee to make distributions each time a beneficiary is awarded a degree from an accredited institution for higher education, it adds.\nYour era of accumulation is effectively over. This should be an exciting time.","content_hash":"b2aeded104dad49b52d8ea58192009e1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5889,"method_rank":0}

And it’s coming off a very recent all-time high of $3.65, which the coin hit less than a month ago. So where is it going next?\nFor starters, the distance from its current price (the white line in the chart below) to the moon (the green line) and its distance towards doom (the red line) is basically the same: 33.33%. So, odds based on the percentage leap required to hit either scenario is not really a factor right now. It’s going to require a little further digging.\nOne classic indicator for traders is the Relative Strength Index, or RSI. For XRP, this sits right at 48, just shy of the neutral 50 mark.\nRSI measures momentum on a scale of 0-100, where readings above 70 signal overbought conditions (time to sell) and below 30 indicate oversold (time to buy). At 48, we're in no-man's land—slightly bearish but not enough to panic. This is what traders call the \"decision zone,\" where markets pick their next direction.\nGoing off RSI, under current conditions, market forces are in equilibrium. However, the overall trend is bullish, so this would signal to traders that prices are more likely to maintain momentum and speed unless something else affects the trend.\nThe Average Directional Index, or ADX, at 28 tells a more decisive story. ADX measures trend strength regardless of direction. Think of it as a speedometer that doesn't care if you're going forwards or backwards. Readings above 25 confirm a strong trend exists, and at 28, XRP is definitely trending. This signals to traders that XRP’s upward movement is likely to continue, even if slowly. And, of course, the more the price goes up, the less likely a $2 “doom” scenario becomes.\nAnother key indicator is the exponential moving average, which measures the average price of an asset over a certain amount of time. For XRP, the 50-day EMA sits comfortably above the 200-day EMA, creating what traders call a \"bullish stack.\"\nThis means the average price of XRP in the short-term is trading above the average price over the long-term, and that typically means buyers will keep stepping in at higher prices. It’s a vote of confidence in the uptrend. This setup usually favors continuation higher unless something breaks.\nFor XRP to correct down to the “doom” zone, it would need to switch momentum entirely and, likely, enter a death cross formation.\nThe only indicator that is not bullish for XRP right now seems to be the Squeeze Momentum Indicator, which shows a price consolidation zone as the Ripple-linked token struggles to break past its recent all-time high. Think of it as the market taking a deep breath before the next sprint.\nPrices can experience a stronger trend either up or down, depending on catalysts. That “squeeze” zone is considered a price compression because there are a large number of orders fighting to determine the trend. If short-term traders exit those positions in search for other markets, then there could be a fast dip in the same zone as it could trigger many “stop-loss” zones. On the other hand, if there is a short squeeze, or bulls take control, it could trigger a spike based on buy orders activated too close to each other.\nBut technicals only tell half the story. The 30-day moving average for XRP whale inflows to exchanges jumped to 260 million tokens from 141 million tokens at July's start, with large holders offloading nearly $6 billion worth since mid-July. That's a serious distribution that historically precedes corrections, because the most logical reason to send an asset to an exchange is to sell it.\nMeanwhile, the SEC and Ripple finally ended their legal battle, removing a major overhang. Add an 88% chance of spot XRP ETF approval by December according to Polymarket and nearly 60% preference over a Litecoin ETF on Myriad Markets, and you've got catalysts that could send XRP either direction—violently.\nXRP bulls have the edge\nWeighing all of the data, it’s clear the charts today slightly favor the XRP moon scenario. The combination of price respecting an upward channel, maintaining position above both key EMAs, and the Squeeze ready to fire would convince traders of a compelling bullish setup. The ADX confirming trend strength while RSI sits neutral gives XRP room to run without being overextended.\nConsidering indicators show traders in equilibrium during a bullish move (instead of showing such behavior when the coin is trading sideways), the ascending channel and compressed volatility suggest XRP could test $3.30 within days. A clean break above would likely trigger momentum toward $4.\nBut those massive whale sales keep the doom scenario very much alive. If the $2.80 support cracks, all bullish bets are off. This is crypto—and when things break, they break hard.\nThe views and opinions expressed by the author are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, investment, or other advice.","content_hash":"88b6669f6722afe6c52f8de608f90a40","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5844,"method_rank":0}

With a 9.7% year-to-date gain, the index is on track to have another solid year, despite a brutal sell-off earlier this spring.\nThe S&P 500 is now up over threefold in the last decade and more than 50% in the last three years -- which may make some investors hesitant to buy stocks at all-time highs. Here's the best way to approach investing in the stock market at elevated levels, including a major mistake worth avoiding.\nStocks aren't like consumer goods\nOne of the most common mistakes when investing in a stock after a major run-up is assuming it's expensive, just because its price is higher.\nStocks represent partial ownership in businesses and aren't commodities or household goods. If the cost of a Toyota Camry suddenly jumped to double that of the Honda Accord, then Camry sales would likely plummet, as many buyers would view the Camry as overpriced.\nStocks don't work like that. They aren't products with set specifications and design elements, but evolve as the business evolves. Sometimes, a business can reinvent itself, leading its stock price to surge for all the right reasons. Two examples of this dynamic hiding in plain sight are Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\nTransformational growth\nNvidia was founded in the early 1990s to create 3D graphics for the gaming and multimedia markets. Recently, the company's data center segment has surpassed its gaming and professional visualization segment.\nIn Nvidia's most recent quarter -- the first quarter fiscal 2026 -- data center revenue made up 88.7% of total revenue. The company may have started as a gaming company, but it's something entirely different today.\nValuing Nvidia based on what it was rather than where it's going would have made the stock look expensive at any point over the last few years. So far, Nvidia has backed up the torrid ascent of its stock price with earnings growth, and there's reason to believe that can continue.\nMicrosoft hasn't undergone as dramatic a transformation as Nvidia. The core applications that make up the Microsoft 365 software suite are nothing new, and Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure has been a major player in the space for over a decade. However, the company's revenue growth rate and profit margin are on another level -- which is driving its surging stock price.\nMicrosoft is achieving these incredible results largely due to growing demand for Azure and the company's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) across its business, from legacy software to cloud, Azure OpenAI, gaming, electronics, and more. It has leveraged AI to enhance its products and services, and that's driving margin growth.\nLike Nvidia, Microsoft is a good example of a stock at an all-time high because the underlying business is doing well and is expected to continue doing well.\nBalancing quality and valuations\nWhen a major index like the S&P 500 is near an all-time high and coming off an extended period of outsized gains, the market is viewed as expensive. However, it doesn't mean that all stocks are overvalued.\nThere are plenty of S&P 500 components at multiyear lows, and there are many that may have run up too far, too fast, to where their valuations are getting separated from fundamentals. The key is to stick with the companies that can justify their valuations because they have proven business models, impeccable growth prospects, or a combination of the two.\nBuying stocks like Nvidia and Microsoft after their massive gains isn't a bad idea, but only if you believe the results are here to stay and can be built upon.\nNvidia and Microsoft make up a combined 14.6% of the S&P 500. Throw in the rest of the \"Ten Titans\" -- Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Broadcom, Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix -- and that's 39% of the index. Investing in the S&P 500 at an all-time high inherently means that you believe the companies leading the index are still good buys.\nThe higher the valuation of a stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF), the more conviction you need to justify paying a premium. If there's a terrific company on sale, you don't need that much to go right to make a solid investment case.\nDo the experts think Nvidia is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

The stock of the multinational technology giant is still down slightly in 2025 but popped over 10% in the last week after management announced new planned spending in the U.S. CEO Tim Cook even visited the White House in a joint press conference with President Donald Trump to announce this new planned spending on components for the iPhone as well as other Apple products in America. It has helped the company achieve some breathing room around potential tariffs on semiconductors, iPhone components, and iPhones themselves getting imported to America.\nApple's stock got its mojo back on this upsized spending news, but should you actually buy shares today? Here's what the numbers say.\nA $600 billion investment\nEarlier this year, Apple announced that it would spend $500 billion over the next four years in the United States. Last week, it upped its estimate to $600 billion, or $150 billion annually. This is different than a company's announced capital expenditure plans, such as when Amazon promises $100 billion in investments related to data centers and its delivery network. Apple is spending money with its suppliers, including advanced glass screens and various semiconductor manufacturers. It is more of an announcement around committed orders for products, which will spur demand for factory work in the United States.\nApple is a sprawling company, and the announced spending will occur in all 50 states, impact 450,000 jobs, and involve 79 different factories. It is astounding how complex Apple's supply chain for the iPhone and other computing hardware is today. However, Apple is still not at the point of a \"Made in America iPhone\" as assembly and other services are performed in China and India, with Apple negotiating with the U.S. government around what is feasible to bring to the United States.\nInvestors applauded the spending plans as a way to shy away from tariff risks on iPhone and semiconductor imports, which could have added huge costs to Apple's supply chain, damaging its profits. Now, it seems to be in good standing with the U.S. government and regulation authorities again.\nDoes the announcement matter?\nIn regard to tariffs, this spending announcement won't necessarily hurt the company, it just prevents Apple from having future cost increases across its supply chain. However, since the U.S. has higher salaries and labor standards, this investment may lead to higher input costs for product components, which could lead to margin compression. Apple's operating margin has steadily risen since the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting a record high of 32% over the last 12 months. Sourcing components in the United States may reverse this expansion.\nWhat matters more at the end of the day is demand for Apple's products. Last quarter, the company released solid figures for the three months ending in June. Total revenue grew just under 10% year over year, driven by services revenue and iPhone revenue growth. Even though the iPhone is almost 20 years old, it remains the bread and butter of Apple's business today.\nThis puts the company in a tough spot. Even though the iPhone remains wildly popular, unit volumes have stagnated for years, meaning Apple is only able to grow revenue by increasing prices. This is not an ideal position to be in. Price increases may be necessary just to maintain profit margins in the future if input costs grow due to the Made-in-America investments.\nAll in all, this announcement does matter. It just might be a negative for Apple's business, contrary to the stock's initial reaction.\nThe truth about Apple stock\nThere are a lot of arguments to be made -- both bearish and bullish -- for Apple stock. Bulls might say this is a fantastic brand with major lock-in effects along with a growing services division with strong profit margins. Bears may say that Apple's unit volumes for the iPhone have fallen with no new successful products coming down the pipeline. For example, the Apple Vision Pro has turned into a total product bust, likely losing the company billions if not tens of billions of dollars.\nA deciding factor in this debate could be the stock's valuation. Apple's price-to-earnings ratio (P\/E) is 35. This is quite expensive for a business with low revenue growth. Compare that to Alphabet, which has grown its revenue significantly faster than Apple over the last few years but trades at a more reasonable P\/E ratio of 22. Apple may be a great business, but that doesn't mean you should ignore the price you pay when analyzing its stock. Avoid buying shares of Apple after this post-announcement pop.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

By diversifying your portfolio across a wide range of stocks, bonds, and other assets, you reduce its volatility and help insulate yourself from market downturns. That's why it's sometimes smarter to simply invest in an S&P 500 index fund or exchange-traded fund, instead of individual stocks.\nBut if I could only invest in a single stock, I'd pick one with a market-leading position, a diversified business model, and a wide moat. I'd also pick one that has consistently outperformed the S&P 500. One stock checks all of those boxes: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), the world's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure company.\nWhy did Amazon consistently beat the market?\nAmazon went public on May 15, 1997, at a split-adjusted price of $0.075 per share. It has rallied 293,233% since then, so a $1,000 investment in its IPO would be worth $2.93 million today. That same investment in an S&P 500 index fund would have only grown to about $7,600. It also delivered market-beating gains for investors who didn't hop aboard its IPO right away. Over the past 10 years, its stock rallied more than 730% as the S&P 500 rose nearly 210%.\nFrom 1997 to 2024, Amazon's annual revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36%, from $148 million to $638 billion. It turned profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis in 2003, and its net income increased at a CAGR of 42%, from $35 million to $59.2 billion, over the following 21 years. Those explosive growth rates attracted a stampede of bulls and helped it consistently crush the market.\nWhat are Amazon's core growth engines?\nAmazon's growth was fueled by the expansion of its e-commerce marketplace, which grew from just 1.5 million customers at the time of its IPO to an estimated 310 million active users today. It has locked more than 240 million of those customers into its Prime subscriptions, which provide exclusive discounts, free shipping options, streaming media services, and other perks. It reinforces the stickiness of that ecosystem with its Alexa-enabled devices, and it reaches even more brick-and-mortar shoppers through its Whole Foods Market stores (which it acquired in 2017).\nAmazon's advertising business sells promoted listings and display ads across its platforms. It's now the third-largest advertising platform in the U.S. after Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google and Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) Facebook, and that segment generates higher-margin revenues than its core marketplace business.\nHowever, Amazon's biggest profit engine is still Amazon Web Services (AWS), which controlled 32% of the global cloud infrastructure market in the first quarter of 2025, according to Canalys. The market's demand for its cloud-based computing and storage services is surging as more companies pivot away from on-site servers and launch more cloud, mobile, and AI services. In 2024, AWS generated 17% of Amazon's net sales but accounted for 58% of its operating profits.\nAmazon's higher profits from AWS and its advertising business subsidize the ongoing expansion of its lower-margin retail business. That's why it can afford to sell its products at lower prices than many of its brick-and-mortar rivals, while retaining its Prime subscribers with loss-leading discounts and perks.\nHow much bigger can Amazon grow?\nAmazon's growth is slowing as it matures, and its retail business faces stiff competition from superstore survivors like Walmart(NYSE: WMT), cheap cross-border e-commerce challengers like PDD's (NASDAQ: PDD) Temu, and warehouse club leaders like Costco (NASDAQ: COST). But it plans to keep expanding its marketplace into higher-growth emerging markets as it upgrades its fulfillment centers and logistics network with more AI, robotics, and automation services.\nThe growth of the AI market should also drive more companies to ramp up their spending on AWS, which provides the computing power, storage, and tools for creating new AI applications. Amazon will also expand its advertising business with more ads on Prime Video and Alexa. These two higher-margin businesses should drive its long-term profit growth.\nFrom 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share to grow at CAGRs of 10% and 19%, respectively. It might not be a bargain at 34 times next year's earnings, but it's still an easy way to profit from the growth of the e-commerce, cloud, AI, and digital advertising markets. So if you could only buy a single stock, Amazon would be a great pick.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Yet, their strengths, risks, and income profiles could not be more different. Tractor Supply, the leading rural retailer, has a smaller yield but comes with a track record of measured growth and strong coverage. Coffee giant Starbucks offers a richer payout but faces questions about its sustainability.\nLet's take a look at how each company's dividend stacks up today, consider the underlying business trends that support (or challenge) those payouts, and explore what income-focused investors should keep in mind before committing capital for the long haul. Choosing whether to invest in either of these companies isn't just about their dividend yield today. It's more complex than that. So, let's dig into what makes each of these dividend stocks unique and attractive in their own right.\nTractor Supply: steady fundamentals and a sustainable payout\nBased on its stock price today, Tractor Supply offers investors a dividend yield of about 1.5%, paying $0.92 annually (the quarterly payment currently stands at $0.23). Importantly, the company has a payout ratio of just 44%, leaving plenty of room for the company to pay shareholders quarterly while reinvesting in its operations and repurchasing shares.\nIn addition, a low payout ratio like this enables the rural retailer to maintain these practices while continuing to raise its dividend over time. Indeed, with 16 consecutive years of dividend increases, Tractor Supply has demonstrated a commitment to rewarding shareholders with a growing stream of cash in a disciplined fashion.\nAnother key factor making Tractor Supply look attractive is its loyalty program, Neighbor's Club. The program now has 41 million members. Highlighting its importance, 80% of its sales come from members. This program drives repeat visits and helps the company better target promotions. It's a quiet advantage that supports the company's growth story and ultimately its dividend growth prospects.\nTractor Supply's business has been resilient, benefiting from steady demand in rural and suburban markets. Its focus on rural lifestyle products, store expansion, and customer loyalty programs has provided a reliable growth engine.\nStarbucks: higher yield but more risk\nStarbucks pays a dividend yield of roughly 2.6% as of this writing. Its quarterly payments total $2.44 annually. While the payout is more generous than Tractor Supply's, there's more risk to it. This is evidenced by the fact that the company's payout ratio currently exceeds 100% of earnings. That means the coffee giant is currently paying more in dividends than it earns, raising questions about the dividend's long-term sustainability at this level unless profits improve.\nAt the moment, the business doesn't look great on the surface. In its most recent quarter, Starbucks reported generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share of $0.49, compared with a quarterly dividend of $0.61. Management has also notably opted not to provide full-year 2025 guidance as it works through plans to revitalize its business. So, for now, we just have to hope the company's slow revenue growth (sales increased just 2% year over year in the company's most recent quarter) will pick back up soon.\nDespite rough fundamentals at the moment, management is confident about the company's future. It believes its current negative sales trends are only temporary. Under new leadership, Starbucks is working to simplify its menu, speed up service, and modernize operations. If these efforts are successful and uncertainty is replaced by excitement, the stock price could benefit and the dividend will likely get robust support from growing earnings.\nFor now, however, the higher yield comes with greater uncertainty. But that doesn't mean investors should rule Starbucks out. The higher yield helps make up for some of the uncertainty. Additionally, the stock price could jump if the company starts demonstrating a successful turnaround.\nThe verdict on both of these dividend stocks? They make a dynamic pair when bought together. For investors seeking a reliable, lower-risk income stream backed by a durable business model, Tractor Supply is a great dividend investment idea. Its modest dividend yield is backed by a durable business, a long history, and excellent financials. Starbucks, on the other hand, offers a higher yield and the potential for a jump in the stock price if management's efforts to revitalize the business are successful.\nShould you buy stock in Starbucks right now?\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $668,155!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,106,071!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,070% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 184% for the S&P 500.

Based on this red-hot performance, many analysts are already ratcheting up their price predictions for XRP.\nIn April, for example, Standard Chartered predicted that XRP would hit a price of $12.50 by the end of 2028. That suggests that XRP could eventually quadruple in value within just three years.

Essentially, financial institutions can use XRP as a bridge currency to transfer value across the XRP blockchain. This is a faster, cheaper, and more efficient way to transfer money across borders than traditional financial services. This is what makes XRP (and the XRP blockchain ledger) potentially so valuable.\nIn a best-case scenario, the XRP-powered payment network from Ripple (the company that created XRP) will take over a larger and larger role in the global financial system during the next few years. As Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse pointed out earlier this year, at some point in the future, the Ripple payment network could rival the legacy SWIFT payment network in size and importance.\nThat implies a very important role for XRP, because it will be the digital currency used to move money across borders. No wonder analysts are expecting XRP to double, triple, or even quadruple in value.\nRisk factors\nBut is that really going to be the case? XRP is really just a bridge currency used to move large amounts of money across a blockchain. It will never be used for day-to-day transactions, the way other digital currencies might be used. That has opened the door for stablecoins to take on the same role as XRP.\nIn many ways, Ripple has already seen the writing on the wall when it comes to stablecoins. Last year, it decided to issue a stablecoin of its own, known as Ripple USD(CRYPTO: RLUSD). It was reported to be a potential suitor for stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group(NYSE: CRCL) before it went public in June. It also acquired the Rail stablecoin payment platform for $200 million in August. If you look at the core offerings on the Ripple website, stablecoins are now one of the three featured options.\nEven if the enthusiasm around stablecoins fizzles, financial institutions could decide to use an entirely different blockchain network other than Ripple to move money. Why not use Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH), for example, to move money around the world?\nArguably, using a Layer-2 blockchain on top of Ethereum, such as the Base blockchain from Coinbase Global(NASDAQ: COIN), is just as effective for moving money across borders. This is especially the case now, given that Ethereum is the most dominant blockchain for stablecoins.\nOr financial institutions could decide to create digital currencies of their own, much as JPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM) did earlier this year. Many of the defining features of the new coin from JPMorgan Chase sound like what you would get if you put XRP and stablecoins together in a blender.\nWhat is a realistic price target for XRP?\nIt's very easy to find ultra-bullish price predictions for XRP. For example, some think XRP could hit a price of $20. Some even think XRP could hit a price of $100 or higher. But all this implies a very high rate of growth, and it's just not clear that that's happening right now.\nA more realistic price prediction for XRP takes into account the market cap of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world. Right now, Ethereum has a market cap of about $550 billion, while XRP has a market cap of $180 billion. As a general rule of thumb, then, XRP will need to triple in value in order to catch up to Ethereum.\nThus, if you ask me where XRP is going to be in three years, then $10 might be a reasonable estimate. It's slightly lower than Standard Chartered's prediction of $12.50 for 2028. But it certainly hints at the explosive upside potential of XRP during the next few years, as long as the pace of institutional adoption picks up.\nShould you buy stock in XRP right now?\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and XRP wasn’t one of them.

That way, if stocks on your list fall to those levels, you can quickly pull the trigger and buy them. In the brief crash that took place this year due to tariffs and the pandemic-fueled crash of 2020, there was a sudden drop in share prices across the board, and if you weren't prepared to buy, you might have missed out on some incredible deals. That's where having a plan in place can be crucial.\nThree growth stocks that are on my watchlist today that I would love to buy if they dropped in value include Uber (NYSE: UBER), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). Here's why I think they can be no-brainer buys for the long haul, and why I wouldn't hesitate to load up on them if they were to fall significantly in value.\n1. Uber\nYou know a company has made it big when its name effectively turns into a verb, such as when a person says they'll \"Uber\" to somewhere, to indicate they are going to use a ride-hailing service. But as prevalent as Uber's services are in North America, there's still much more growth potentially available in international markets, including in Argentina, Italy, South Korea, and other countries where the company is focused on growing its business.\nAnd Uber's growth opportunities extend beyond just ride-hailing services. Last year, there were rumblings that it was looking at possibly acquiring travel booking company Expedia. While nothing came of that, I do believe the company's potential is massive. For example, it has partnered with Thames Clippers to run a river bus service in London, which is not only convenient but offers scenic views. In the future, I believe Uber will become a significant travel company, offering its customers many different modes of transportation.\nUber's business has grown from more than $17 billion in sales in 2021 to $44 billion this past year. It's a growth beast, and although it's a great buy today, it's a bit pricey, trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P\/E) multiple of 29 (based on analyst estimates). It's a solid long-term buy, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it if it got back down to around its 52-week low.\n2. Alphabet\nAlphabet is a phenomenal company, and its stock is probably the most undervalued of the three on this list. It trades at a forward P\/E of only 21, which is below the S&P 500 average of 24. But there's an element of risk and uncertainty with the business, pertaining to whether it will be broken up due to antitrust issues, and how competitive it will be with respect to artificial intelligence (AI).\nGoogle Search and YouTube are terrific assets, and I see tremendous potential in its AI chatbot, Gemini, being able to integrate with them and add significant value for users in the future. I'm also encouraged by the company's recent quarterly results, which don't seem to imply that other chatbots are hurting its core business as many investors and analysts feared they might; Google's advertising business generated 10% revenue growth last quarter (which ended on June 30). And Alphabet's overall sales rose by 14% to over $96 billion.\nAlphabet's stock is only up 6% this year, and with many question marks surrounding the tech company's future, I know there's a potential for its value to drop in the near future. And if that happens, it could be an excellent time to buy the stock at a cheaper price point.\n3. Amazon\nAnother big tech stock that has produced lackluster gains this year is Amazon -- it's up just 1% as of Monday's close. However, it's the most expensive of the three, as it trades at 34 times its estimated future earnings. But that's still a smaller premium than what it has averaged in the past. A sharp decline in value would make it an even better buy.\nAmazon's marketplace has been the go-to option for many shoppers over the years. And its Prime membership might be one of the best value options, packing in many benefits, including free shipping, video streaming, and music. The value proposition is incredible, so it's little wonder that the company has more than 240 million Prime subscribers all over the globe.\nThis is an unstoppable business to invest in, with Amazon reporting $670 billion in revenue over its past four quarters, and profits totaling $71 billion. It's hard to go wrong with buying the stock at any time, but if there's a downturn in the markets, it could make for one heck of a bargain buy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

And then there can be an abrupt reversal, leading doomsayers to come out of the woodwork.\nWe're all just one headline away from another sharp market move, either up or down.\nIncoming news and its riptides can be overwhelming, to say the least, leaving many an investor scratching their head about what comes next.\nSo, how is an investor able to tell which way markets are likely to move next?\nDifferent schools of thought on market outlook\nOne school of thought focuses on the economic fundamentals, such as interest rates, inflation, growth, and jobs, to develop an outlook for what to expect.\nThis all sounds good until you try to apply it to the real markets, where things can get more complicated.\nTake, for instance, the current economic environment, where interest rates are widely expected to fall in coming months and quarters.\nOn the one hand, prospects of lower rates are typically a positive for market sentiment and consequently stock prices. That thought line relies on lower rates stimulating borrowing demand, generating job creation, increasing consumer spending, and enhancing corporate profitability.\nAnd all of that is supposed to come back to propel the economy ahead, and with it, stocks. That's the optimistic outlook and argues for still higher stock prices, all-time highs be damned.\nBut there's always that other hand, which casts doubt on many of those assumptions.\nThe other hand points to signs of weakness in the labor market (July's disastrous jobs report), sticky inflation (Aug. 14 July CPI & PPI), and tariff uncertainty (President Donald Trump), among other factors, to justify a steady, wait-and-see attitude.\nThis position argues that the Fed is likely easing because of economic uncertainty and weakness, which would tend to augur poorly for the stock market outlook.\nAnd then there are those who also correctly point to policy uncertainty itself as being another headwind. But that can be modeled away, as the Fed will make a decision one way or the other come Sept. 18.\nApart from tariffs, then, much market uncertainty will be resolved in a few weeks.\nIt leaves us in a conundrum (that helps explain the back-and-forth of the market in recent weeks) about which way markets will eventually move.\nPrices (usually) never lie when predicting market movement\nThen there's a second school of thought that could not care less what inflation is doing or whether jobs are being added or subtracted.\nIt's only concerned with what past price movements are saying about potential future price movements.\nThis position is known as technical analysis, and it relies on past prices to predict the future, which, as we all know, is not guaranteed.\nOne can use technical analysis in many ways to identify key price points that are potential triggers to future gains or declines, including trendlines and channels.\nTechnical indicators such as the RSI (shown on the chart below) can aid in estimating the strength of a market move and suggest potential outcomes.\nThen there are chart patterns that have routinely formed in the past and frequently have quantifiable price targets, a discipline known as \"pattern recognition.\"\nThe chart below combines all of these elements and more and highlights the key price points to watch.\nSpotting market trends: what to look for\nLet's begin by noting that price has broken down out of the major up-channel dating back to the April 2025 lows, potentially suggesting an end to the uptrend.\nAlso look at the potential triple top forming, a major reversal pattern, denoted by the 1,2,3 above the current price. That triple top happens to be forming around the $75.00 to $75.50 area, which is more than just a nice, big, round number.\nIt also happens to be the post-pandemic highs of 2022 (not shown), which (KBWB) has yet to surpass.\nFor comparison's sake, the S&P 500 already blew through those highs back in Jan. of 2024! Hence, it was earlier noted that bank stocks are lagging the overall market.\nPrice has since established a sideways range over the past few weeks between recent highs just above $75.00 and below $71.00. It is this range, along with the daily Ichimoku cloud top (currently at $71.40 and set to move sideways for several days), that defines the key price levels for KBWB.\nLastly, it's worth noting that the Relative Strength Index (RSI), seen in the bottom panel of the chart, has turned up again and made a bullish crossover of both trendline resistance and the green \"signal\" line, potentially setting the stage for a break higher.\nUltimately, events on the fundamental front will dictate which way prices move, but at least we have identified the likely key price points to a break in either direction.\nTo recap, a move higher may unfold if price closes above $75.50 on a daily basis. A move lower may develop on daily close weakness below the Ichimoku cloud top at $71.40 or below recent lows at 70.60, leaving the $70.60 to $71.40 area as the key support zone.\nWe'll have to see which way the current conundrum unfolds. The $75.00 to $75.50 area could be a major reversal top and hold, or a break above could signal fresh gains ahead.\nMaybe third time's the charm and banks finally catch up with the rest of the market?","content_hash":"5d203dfc396edbe927a6bcec62cd0fa2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5523,"method_rank":0}

Some ETFs track indexes, while others target themes, such as growth stocks, value stocks, or passive income.\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(NYSEMKT: VIG) is unique because it accomplishes several investment objectives -- from holding positions in top growth stocks to being a decent vehicle for collecting passive income.\nHere's why the ETF is still worth buying in August, even though it's at an all-time high.\nNot your typical list of top dividend stocks\nInstead of focusing solely on dividend yield, the Dividend Appreciation ETF targets companies that are growing their earnings and can support future dividend raises.\nData sources: Vanguard, YCharts.\nAs you can see in the table, eight of the 10 largest holdings in the ETF have yields under 1%. However, the lineup features industry leaders across a variety of sectors -- including technology, financials, consumer staples, healthcare, and energy.\nFunds that pursue higher-yielding stocks tend to be overweight low-growth sectors and underweight growth-focused sectors -- like tech. But because the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF prioritizes companies that can support a growing dividend with higher earnings, it can include tech giants like Broadcom, Apple, and Microsoft.\nBroadcom and Apple have increased their dividends for 14 consecutive years, and Microsoft has a 15-year streak. These stocks sport low yields not because they haven't been boosting their payouts, but because their stock prices have gone up by so much.\nIn this vein, the Dividend Appreciation ETF doesn't penalize companies for having low yields because they have been winning investments.\nA higher yield and lower valuation than the S&P 500\nMany of the largest holdings in the ETF sport low yields. But the top 10 holdings only make up 32.6% of the ETF. Just outside of the top 10, holdings 11 through 20 are Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Home Depot, Oracle, AbbVie, Bank of America, UnitedHealth Group, Cisco Systems, Coca-Cola, and International Business Machines. Combined, these names make up 15.8% of the fund. However, many of these names have higher yields and extensive track records of boosting their payouts.\nBecause a sizable chunk of the larger holdings in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF are blue chip stocks with higher yields and reasonable valuations, the fund sports a relatively attractive valuation and dividend yield compared to the S&P 500. In fact, the price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is 25.7 and its yield is 1.7% compared to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO) -- which has a 27.8 P\/E and a 1.2% yield.\nA balanced fund you can confidently buy and hold\nBuying stocks or ETFs at all-time highs seems counterintuitive. After all, who wants to pay a record price for something? However, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF could appeal to investors who are looking to put capital to work in the market without betting big on companies with lofty valuations.\nThe ETF's emphasis on dividend quality over quantity will appeal to long-term investors who want to make sure they aren't achieving a high yield just by investing in mediocre companies.\nThe fund could be an especially good pick for folks who don't want to collect passive income at the expense of limiting their exposure to tech stocks. Nvidia has been the poster child of artificial intelligence investor excitement, but Broadcom, the largest holding in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, has been no slouch -- with a staggering 474% gain in just three years.\nAll told, the ETF is a great way to balance exposure to megacap growth stocks and blue chip dividend-paying value stocks -- which could make the fund a better buy for certain investors than the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF wasn’t one of them.

Seniors who are already retired often look for steady, reliable, dividend-paying companies. Younger investors, on the other hand, can afford to take more risks and tend to seek out companies that, despite being more volatile, also boast significant long-term upside potential.\nWith that in mind, let's consider two stocks that people in their 30s -- who are still a good distance away from retirement -- should consider investing in: Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG) and Moderna(NASDAQ: MRNA).\n1. Intuitive Surgical\nIntuitive Surgical is a medical specialist that leads the market for robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) devices, thanks to its famous da Vinci system, which is by far its most important growth driver. This machine enables physicians to perform minimally invasive surgeries across a range of approved indications, including bariatric, urologic, and general surgery.\nThe company has faced several challenges over the past few years, including a decline in bariatric surgeries due to the growing popularity of anti-obesity medications, and the threat posed by the Trump administration's tariffs.\nDespite those problems, its long-term prospects look incredibly attractive. One reason is that Intuitive Surgical has a resilient business. The company has achieved excellent results over the past five years, with consistently growing top- and bottom-line numbers:\nAnother great reason to remain bullish on the company's long-term prospects is that its addressable market still looks underpenetrated. Intuitive Surgical makes more than half of its revenue from sales of instruments and accessories, which are tied to procedure volume. The more surgeries physicians perform with its devices, the higher its sales. Thus, Intuitive Surgical will benefit from demographic changes that are happening right under our noses, as the world's population ages.\nBy the time investors in their 30s retire, a much higher proportion of the population will be seniors who are in greater need of the kinds of procedures Intuitive Surgical offers. Furthermore, even with mounting competition, the company benefits from a wide moat due to switching costs (da Vinci systems are expensive) and intangible assets, namely patents that protect its inventions.\nIntuitive Surgical has consistently outperformed the market over the past 25 years, and it's likely to continue doing so, helping younger investors significantly grow their capital over time.\n2. Moderna\nModerna is a riskier bet than Intuitive Surgical, but the biotech also has significant upside potential. The vaccine maker demonstrated its innovative capabilities by developing one of the most successful COVID-19 vaccines on the market. Several pharmaceutical leaders tried and failed, but Moderna succeeded; that's saying something. The company's mRNA platform is attractive because vaccines based on it tend to be faster and cheaper to develop.\nAnd since its success in the coronavirus space, Moderna has recorded several clinical and regulatory wins. It earned approval for a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and recorded phase 2 or phase 3 wins for vaccines against influenza, influenza plus COVID, and even cancer.\nWhy, then, has the stock significantly lagged the market over the past three years? Moderna's coronavirus vaccine franchise is no longer generating the sales and profits it once did. The company's shares probably rose too much too fast in the early pandemic years, meaning a sell-off was justified. However, now Moderna could take off and deliver superior returns over the long run, provided it continues to innovate.\nTo that end, the company's pipeline looks attractive, with potential candidates across even ambitious targets. Moderna's personalized cancer vaccine, mRNA-4157, which helped decrease the risk of recurrence and death in melanoma patients in phase 2 studies, is now in late-stage clinical trials. The company is targeting many other cancers, and is even working on a potential HIV vaccine that's in early-stage clinical trials.\nWhile mRNA vaccines are still relatively new to the market, if Moderna manages to make them mainstream by launching several over the next five years, there could be a massive upside for the stock. Again, it's a riskier bet, but investors in their 30s who can handle the volatility should seriously consider Moderna.\nShould you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intuitive Surgical wasn’t one of them.

Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high, while the United States is passing legislation and embracing these new digital assets as a part of the financial world, which is driving further investor interest.\nThis does not mean cryptocurrencies are good investments in the fundamental sense, though. Why? Because cryptocurrencies do not generate earnings or cash flow. Growth in earnings and cash flow are what drive stock prices over the long term. Everything else is just hope.\nHere are two technology stocks -- Shopify(NASDAQ: SHOP) and Coupang(NYSE: CPNG) -- with more potential than any cryptocurrency because of their potential for free cash flow growth.\nShopify's insatiable growth\nShopify's goal is to make commerce easier for everyone. It provides software and other services to businesses, giving them the tools to compete with large retailers such as Amazon or Costco Wholesale. These include customer-built online storefronts, online checkout, shipping management, and in-person point-of-sales (POS) terminals.\nIt makes money mainly through subscription sales, add-on services, and payments. Subscription revenue was $2.55 billion over the last 12 months, up from just $19 million in 2012. Merchant Solutions revenue, which includes payments and other services, was $7.55 billion over the last 12 months, up from virtually zero dollars in 2012. Clearly, businesses love using Shopify, which is why it processed over $200 billion in payments volume over the last 12 months.\nLast quarter showed the company's ambitions to expand globally to Europe, where payment volume grew 42% year over year, outpacing overall payments volume growth of 31%. At the same time it is growing so quickly, the company is now generating consistent profits. Last quarter, Shopify generated $291 million in operating income, or an operating margin of 11%. As the business matures, investors should expect profit margins to move even higher.\nShopify's free cash flow has begun to show enormous growth. Over the past 12 months, free cash flow was $1.8 billion, compared to close to zero a few years ago. As this free cash flow accumulates on its balance sheet, this should help drive value for Shopify's stock price over the long haul, making it a better bet than any cryptocurrency you could buy today.\nA sneaky e-commerce company outside of America\nThe next stock is also in the commerce space, but is a little different than Shopify and at an earlier stage in its life. Coupang is a South Korean e-commerce platform that has taken inspiration from, and perhaps improved on, the Amazon model in North America. It offers its Rocket Wow subscribers free delivery in just a few hours or overnight if ordered by midnight the night before, with reusable delivery containers and quick fresh grocery delivery.\nAn enormously strong value proposition has led Coupang to gain a ton of market share on commerce spending in South Korea. Last quarter, revenue was $8.5 billion, up 19% year over year on a constant currency basis. Gross margin expanded to 30%, while operating income remained positive at $149 million. Profits are slim today versus Coupang's revenue, but that is because it continues to invest and expand its offering in South Korea.\nOver the next five years, Coupang's free cash flow might begin to dip temporarily. In fact, it has already begun falling in recent quarters. Why? Because the brand is making an aggressive push to expand into Taiwan. So far, it is showing strong growth. Revenue is up 54% quarter over quarter and growing well into the triple digits, according to management on the last quarterly conference call.\nTaiwan is a wealthy island nation that could be a great way for Coupang to expand its addressable market. In the short run, it will affect free cash flow as all the investments are set up. However, over the long term, it will help revenue and cash flow reach new heights.\nCoupang's revenue was $32 billion over the last 12 months. With continued growth in South Korea, adding new offerings such as food delivery, and the expansion into Taiwan, I think revenue can keep growing until it reaches $100 billion or more for the company. Not long after, free cash flow will follow. This makes Coupang a great stock for investors to own instead of cryptocurrencies.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

","description":"Does This Make Slate Electric Truck Dead on Arrival ? ","published_at":"2025-08-17T13:15:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"At a time when the global automotive industry is contemplating how to deal with highly advanced and highly affordable Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) slowly spanning more of the globe, Slate Auto has been slowly growing in Detroit.\nThe young automaker -- just founded in 2022 -- seemingly came out of nowhere to take hold of the market's intrigue, especially with the backing of Amazon's Jeff Bezos, with its mid-$20,000 priced electric truck. But with a couple of new developments, is it dead on arrival?\nBad timing\nIt sure seems like a rough time to launch an EV start-up company, with the Trump administration's steadfast desire to roll back EV incentives and even remove penalties for companies not meeting emissions standards. On the flip side, you could argue that it's a great time for Slate Auto to launch, as it tackles the industry's primary hurdle: Affordability.\nAs previously mentioned, Slate Auto became the latest company to raise the price of its vehicles before even delivering its first. One of the big selling points of the Slate truck was that you could configure a vehicle for under $20,000, including incentives and tax credits. However, with the EV tax credit going away, and the increased cost from tariffs on imported parts, the cost is now in the mid-$20,000s.\n\"People are looking at Slate because it's a throwback, with roll-up windows and no radio,\" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, according to Automotive News. The company hopes buyers \"will pay a little more for a better wrap, accessory panels, or anything that adds profit.\"\nIt's an impressive feat to produce a truck at such a price tag, much less an electric truck. Slate Auto deserves its applause, but in losing the EV tax credit and raising its price tag, it's now going to compete with a selection of combustion engine vehicles and hybrids at or around $30,000 with far more technology and equipment packed in.\nOne big-time example\nIf you're wondering what some of the competition could look like, take a quick glance at what Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F) has been up to recently. The company developed a small \"skunkworks\" team based in California that was dedicated to making a universal low-cost EV platform.\nFord is certainly hyping what's to come, calling Monday's announcement and unveiling a \"Model T moment.\" Ford's first vehicle to launch on the new EV platform will be a midsize electric truck, closer to the size of the Maverick than the Ranger, due in 2027. It will be the first of potentially eight EV models to launch on the platform, and -- most importantly -- Ford says the $30,000 four-door electric truck will be profitable.\nThe company also made massive adjustments to its production process and changed its assembly line to be an \"assembly tree,\" where three sub-assembly lines will run simultaneously before combining the parts at the end. It's a process that, along with other optimizations, should enable the plant to assemble the new EV platform 15% faster than current vehicles. It reduces parts by 20% versus a typical vehicle, with 25% and 40% fewer fasteners and workstations in the plant. This is important to generate profits from such a low-priced vehicle.\nDead on arrival?\nSlate Auto and its vehicle are an intriguing development within the EV industry. Its bare-bones approach was refreshing, and there's little doubt it'll find a target consumer, although it's possible that it'll be more niche than mainstream. Slate said it has over 100,000 reservations in the U.S., but as reservations are secured with only a $50 refundable deposit, there's a good chance only a small percentage will be converted into orders.\nNot only is Ford soon to release a highly competitive electric truck in 2027, both Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group are launching electric crossovers next year at prices between $45,000 and $50,000, tens of thousands of dollars lower than their original models.\nSo, is Slate's truck dead on arrival? Without Slate being able to hold its core marketing selling point of a sub-$20,000 electric truck, the young EV maker might find it really difficult to gain traction in the increasingly competitive and more affordable EV market. It's not dead on arrival, but there are serious reasons for concern.\nDo the experts think Ford Motor Company is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

Sure, some companies can fade away as their businesses are rendered obsolete by new technologies. However, others flourish and make smart investors a lot of money over time.\nI believe we're currently in the early stages of two massive disruptions. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds the potential to transform our world in too many ways to count. Quantum computing could accelerate AI advances while also revolutionizing finance, healthcare, logistics, and more.\nAlthough these are distinct disruptive technologies, you don't have to invest in them separately. Here are my picks for the three best stocks to buy now to profit from both AI and quantum computing.\n1. Alphabet\nGoogle parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been a pioneer in AI for years. The company developed the \"T\" (transformers) in ChatGPT. Its 2014 acquisition of DeepMind was, in retrospect, a pivotal move. Today, Google Gemini Pro ranks among the world's most powerful large language models (LLMs).\nAlphabet has multiple ways to profit from AI. Google Cloud is the fastest-growing major cloud services provider thanks to a massive AI tailwind. Google Search and YouTube use AI to boost ad revenue. Waymo is a leader in autonomous ride-hailing (robotaxis).\nBut the company is also a major player in quantum computing. Google Quantum AI (note that both disruptive technologies are in the unit's name) has already notched two key quantum computing milestones. Its Sycamore chip achieved quantum supremacy (solving a problem in relatively short order that would take the most powerful classical computer an exceptionally long time) in 2019. The unit made a giant leap in quantum error correction (reducing errors by increasing the cubits) in 2023.\nI think it's a good bet that Alphabet will be one of the biggest winners in both AI and quantum computing over the long run. But this stock isn't a highly risky bet, in my view. The company is on track to generate close to $400 billion in revenue and more than $100 billion in profits this year.\n2. Microsoft\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) arguably struck one of the best deals in business history by partnering with ChatGPT creator OpenAI back in 2022. The longtime technology giant has integrated OpenAI's AI models throughout its software suite.\nLike Alphabet, Microsoft is poised to benefit as organizations build and deploy AI applications in the cloud. Its Azure is the second-largest cloud services platform, behind only Amazon Web Services (AWS).\nAlso like Alphabet, Microsoft is investing heavily in quantum computing. Earlier this year, the company introduced its Majorana 1 quantum chip, which uses a new type of material called a topoconductor. Microsoft thinks that topoconductors will pave the way for highly scalable, powerful quantum computers.\nMicrosoft technical fellow Chetan Nayak believes that topoconductors might be the \"transistor for the quantum age.\" If he's right, the company that dominated the PC software market could also dominate the quantum computing market.\n3. Nvidia\nWhich company is the most essential player in AI today? There's a strong argument that it's Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) remain in a league of their own in powering AI systems.\nNvidia's customers include Alphabet and Microsoft, both of which use its GPUs extensively in their cloud platforms. And while rivals are trying desperately to knock Nvidia off its perch, the company's fast-paced development of new AI chips seems likely to keep it on top for years to come.\nHowever, Nvidia isn't developing quantum computers. How is investing in it a smart way to profit from both AI and quantum computing? The company is trying to make it easier for others to advance their quantum computing efforts through its NVIDIA Accelerated Quantum Computing (NVAQC) Research Center. Nvidia is also pairing its GPUs with quantum chips for a hybrid quantum-classical computing approach.\nBack in the gold rush days, the providers of picks and shovels often made more money than the gold miners themselves. Nvidia is positioning itself to be the pick-and-shovel investment of the quantum computing era.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $663,630!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,115,695!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,071% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500.

Whether the advice comes from a podcast, a TV expert, or even your in-laws, the message is always the same: save big, save more, save for the future.\nSo, yes, you know you’re supposed to be aggressive about saving. But how to prioritize your savings goals is a trickier question. Retirement? Emergency fund? That trip you’ve been planning for years? When every savings goal feels urgent, knowing how to prioritize can feel impossible.\nBarbara Huson understands this dilemma well. She’s not only a wealth coach, bestselling author and founder of The Wealth Connection, but also a financial therapist. Through her work, she’s seen how people — especially women — can feel overwhelmed and anxious when it comes to juggling competing financial goals. But according to Huson, learning how to save for multiple things at once is absolutely possible, with a little intention and structure.\nWith a plan, a little automation, and some honest conversations — both with yourself and others — you can stop spinning your wheels and start saving in the order that works best for your life.\nA Simple System That Works\nWhen Huson was teaching her kids to save, she gave them an allowance to divide between three jars: saving, spending and giving. The act of physically splitting their money made the process easy and, more importantly, automatic.\n“They learned to budget, to save for what mattered, and to give generously in areas they cared about — which they never would’ve done on their own, but it made them feel so good when they did,” she said. “That’s the same approach I recommend for adults. When you’re saving for multiple goals, the biggest mistake is overthinking or trying to pick the ‘perfect’ order.”\nInstead of stressing about whether you should build your emergency fund before contributing to retirement, or wondering if your car fund should come before a home down payment, Huson recommends something she calls “mindless saving.”\nHere’s how it works: Like her kids and their jars, you divide your savings among your different goals. Only instead of dropping coins into a jar, you automate transfers into separate savings accounts.\n“That way, you’re making steady progress on everything, without the mental drain of constant decision-making,” she said.\nStill, Huson acknowledges that sometimes, this approach of dividing your savings equally won’t alleviate anxiety — especially when a bill is due or a big expense pops up.\nReal-life needs often collide all at once, and it can feel like financial quicksand. When that happens, Huson suggests starting with a simple exercise: Write down your needs and goals, and rank them in order of importance or urgency.\nTalking things out with someone you trust, like a partner, friend, coach, or a financial advisor, can also help you sort out your priorities. Getting their advice can help you untangle the knot in your head and give you clarity on what’s urgent and what can wait.\nFinally, look at what’s due soonest. “If your car just broke down and you need it to get to work, that takes priority over a future vacation or even retirement — at least in the short term,” she said. “Urgency often reveals itself when you consider timing and consequences.”\nLet Your Values Guide You\nOf course, if you know your cable bill must be paid on the 15th of every month and you need to budget for your upcoming summer vacation, your short-term savings goals can largely take care of themselves. But what about the long term?\nHuson advises developing your long-term savings strategy by aligning your spending with your values (remember, her kids had one jar for giving, after all). Need some help clarifying those values? She recommends searching for a values clarification exercise online to help you figure out what is truly important to you.\nDo you value the stability of owning a home, or would you rather travel frequently, even if it means continuing to rent? Would monthly donations to a cause bring you more joy than saving for a luxury item? Would having money set aside for family support give you peace of mind? When you know what’s truly important to you, you can make savings decisions that support the life you really want.\nBefore you buy something, Huson suggests asking yourself: “Will this bring me closer to the life I truly want?”\n“Satisfy short-term wants mindfully, while prioritizing long-term goals,” she said. “Mindful spending means being present with your choices — enjoying small pleasures without letting them derail bigger dreams. Prioritizing long-term goals doesn’t mean never indulging — it means choosing with intention, not impulse. It’s not about deprivation — it’s about conscious choice.”\nBottom Line\nFiguring out how to save wisely when so many goals and needs are competing for your attention — and your wallet — can be tough. But if you consult your head and your heart in equal measure, you can create a realistic plan that reflects your priorities and values.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates’ Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

After a pandemic-fueled surge, when the world raced toward digital payments and Block rode the wave of skyrocketing adoption, the stock has cooled considerably. Today, it remains 74% below its all-time high of $289 per share in 2021.\nThe excitement around Block's growth has faded, but don't count it out just yet. The company is streamlining operations, reigniting growth, and has recently earned a coveted spot in the S&P 500 index. Here are five compelling reasons why now might be a good time to buy Block.\n1. Block's Square segment provides a strong foundation for steady growth\nBlock's flagship product, the Square reader system, empowers businesses to easily accept card payments. In the early days, smaller vendors often struggled with expensive and complicated point-of-sale systems. Square stepped in to modernize this experience, providing a seamless solution that opened doors for countless sellers.\nThe Square segment has since evolved into a dynamic commerce system, with a lineup of 30 products and services to support sellers in launching and growing their businesses. In the second quarter, the segment achieved a gross profit of $1.03 billion, or an 11% increase compared to the previous year, contributing to a total segment gross profit of $2.54 billion.\n2. The Cash App is popular among younger users\nAnother pillar of Block's business is its Cash App, the peer-to-peer payment network that allows users to store, send, receive, invest, borrow, save, and use buy now, pay later (BNPL) services. This comprehensive app aims to be a one-stop shop for all customer needs. In the second quarter of 2025, Cash App generated $1.5 billion in gross profit, representing a 16% increase year over year.\nOne of Block's strengths is that Cash App is the most popular investment app across all generations, according to The Motley Fool's Generational Investing Tools survey.\nAs of June 2025, Cash App had 57 million monthly active users in the U.S. Customers younger than 25 are particularly engaged with features like Paycheck Deposit and the Cash App Card. And there were 5 million active sponsored teen accounts on Cash App, with nearly 80% of them being active Cash App Card users.\n3. Block is laser-focused on efficient growth\nIn recent years, CEO Jack Dorsey has placed a strong emphasis on achieving efficient growth, using the \"Rule of 40\" as a key financial framework to balance growth and profitability. Achieving this goal requires strategic cost management, disciplined investments, and a focus on high-return initiatives within its segments Square and Cash App.\nThe Rule of 40 is defined by Block as the sum of its gross profit growth rate and adjusted operating income margin (expressed as a percentage of gross profit). The company aims to reach a Rule of 40 run rate by the end of 2025 and believes it is on track to achieve this goal in 2026.\nIn the second quarter, Block reported strong financial performance, with gross profit growth accelerating to 14% year over year and adjusted operating income margins expanding to 22%, putting the sum at 36, very close to its Rule of 40 goal.\n4. Block forecasts strong growth later this year\nThe company delivered a strong second quarter. Gross profit rose by the aforementioned 14% year over year to $2.54 billion, which came in ahead of analysts' expectations. On top of that, management raised its full-year gross profit forecast to $10.17 billion, up from $9.96 billion.\nA few factors drive management's anticipated growth, but one stands out in particular. Earlier this year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approved the use of Square Financial Services to issue consumer loans for Cash App Borrow nationwide. The company believes this could double the number of Cash App active users eligible for loans, while enabling better unit economics through in-house loan origination and servicing.\n5. It's priced cheaply in an expensive market\nBlock is currently priced at 1.97 times sales and 15.9 times earnings, making it cheap relative to its recent history. Given the high valuation on the S&P 500 on a historical basis, Block's valuation and stable businesses give investors some margin of safety.\nBlock is making good progress on its efficiency initiatives and continues to see strong growth for its Cash App, while also making inroads with younger generations. With growth expected to pick up later this year, I think now is a great time to buy shares of Block.\nShould you buy stock in Block right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Block, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Block wasn’t one of them.

The Elon Musk factor\nElon Musk's leadership is often cited as Tesla's greatest strength -- and, paradoxically, one of its most significant vulnerabilities. Musk's vision and hands-on approach have driven Tesla's technological breakthroughs and ambitious expansion. However, this heavy reliance on a single individual introduces what investors refer to as \"key man risk.\"\nIf Musk were to step back from daily operations or shift his focus to other projects, Tesla might face challenges in maintaining its momentum. Though Tesla's management team has grown stronger, few executives command the same vision, drive, and public attention as Musk.\nRecently, Musk's increasing involvement in political activities has raised concerns about potential distractions or reputational risks for Tesla. While the company has remained operationally strong, these developments underscore the uncertainty around its future leadership continuity. While Tesla's success lies not only with Musk but also with his team, which has executed well on his vision -- no one can build a trillion-dollar company alone -- there is still no clear successor (or a viable management team) . The silver lining here is that the Tesla board has become more serious about finding one in recent months, largely due to the CEO's active involvement in politics.\nFor investors, this means that Tesla's fortunes remain closely tied to Musk's presence and decisions -- a factor that adds a layer of risk to the investment.\n2. Intensifying competition\nTesla might have been an early mover in the EV industry, but its dominance is no longer guaranteed. The industry landscape is rapidly evolving, with legacy automakers and new entrants accelerating their electric ambitions.\nCompanies like Ford and General Motors are aggressively expanding their EV lineups. For instance, Ford plans to introduce a $30,000 midsize truck by 2027. That price is significantly lower than the average for an EV, and Ford is investing $5 billion in its EV production to make it happen. GM, on the other hand, is working hard on next-generation battery technologies to improve range, charging performance, and cost.\nMeanwhile, Chinese manufacturers such as BYD are growing their international footprints, particularly in Europe, where Tesla experienced a nearly 27% sales declinein July 2025. BYD's battery technology, government support, and competitive pricing make it a formidable challenger.\nIn addition, a host of EV start-ups are innovating in battery tech, autonomous driving, and new business models, further intensifying competition. While Tesla is not sitting still -- it is working on becoming the lowest-cost producer by cutting prices to grow sales volume and achieve economies of scale -- there is no guarantee that it can maintain its market share over time.\nIn short, it's no longer the only player in town.\nWhat does this mean for investors?\nTesla's story remains compelling: It's a pioneer with a powerful brand, innovative products, and potential optionality with some of its long shot bets (robotaxi, humanoid robots, etc). But the key man risk surrounding Musk and the escalating competitive landscape are real concerns that investors can't ignore.\nIf Tesla continues to innovate more rapidly than its rivals, the company could sustain its growth trajectory. However, any leadership changes or slips in market position could hurt the business and its share price.\nWhile these two risks don't necessarily call for the sale of the stock, they do mean that investors should think carefully before buying the stock today. Tesla stock trades at a significant premium valuation to other carmakers. For perspective, Tesla has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 12.9, compared to GM's 0.3.\nUnless you're comfortable with the risks and the high valuation, buying the stock today may not be a prudent decision.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The Russell 2000, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 are down 0.44%, 0.41%, and 0.16% respectively. The Dow is the only major U.S. index in the green for the moment, up 0.21%.\nAt face, those moves aren't very dramatic. On Tuesday, U.S. equities jumped dramatically after the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that inflation moderated in July, with the growth-centric Russell 2000 soaring nearly 3%. But by Thursday, things were all topsy-turvy, with the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI). Both elicited much more dramatic responses.\nStill, below the top-line figures we see at the top of the market, there's always stories in the stock market. Even today, a quiet Friday, there are stocks making big moves. In fact, many of today's biggest movers come from the solar, biotech, and health insurance business.\nBut why? Let's start with the reason why the Dow is up today:\nUnitedHealth unites health insurers; lifts Dow\nIf you haven't seen the year-to-date chart on health insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) , you've gotta see it. Back in April, the stock looked like it might be building towards an all-time high. Then, next thing you know, it was the worst performer in the Dow (and one of the worst in the S&P 500.)\nPoor earnings results, a weaker outlook, and few hopes for a quick recovery have weighed on the stock. At one point, it had lost half of its value on the year. But today, it's scoring a bid from a value-minded investors we all know and love: Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett.\nAs such, it's up 14% today, almost single-handedly lifting the Dow. That's not anecdote, either: UnitedHealth is contributing 236 of the Dow's points as of this writing. If it weren't part of the index, the Dow would be down 95 points today, per our very own Charley Blaine.\nThe confidence is also helping lift similarly-situated health insurers, who have been experiencing similar struggles in the face of government budget cuts and higher health care utilization. Centene (CNC) (+6%), Oscar Health (OSCR) (+5.8%), and Elevance Health (ELV) (+5.5%) are all following UnitedHealth onward and upward today.\nPharma stocks jump\nSmall-caps might be down, but pharma and biotech stocks are up today... again!\nFor the unacquainted, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) and the iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB) are up 6.2% and 5.2% this week respectively (mind you, those are intraday figures.) That's a kind premium on these battered-down stocks, especially when you compare it to the Russell's 3% return over the same period.\nSo who's leading the leaders today? Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (+7%), Moderna (+7%), and Sarepta Therapeutics (+6.3%). Ironically, all firms that have faced their fair share of trial and tribulation recently.\nSarepta has faced FDA scrutiny over its gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, forcing it to sell shares of Arrowhead, in which it was a sizable investor, to shore up its cash position.\nAnd Moderna? Well, in case you didn't know, this administration isn't terribly enthused about mRNA vaccines for any number of reasons. Still, the company has an incredibly robust portfolio which might make the U.S. pay for, in every sense of the definition, turning their nose up at them.\nDon't get us wrong, there are some sinkers too, like Tonix Pharmaceuticals (-13.8%), which is atop the trending charts on investing social media platform Stocktwits this P.M., cooling down after the FDA approval of their new fibromyalgia drug. Even that's good news, really!\nOf course, if you zoom out, there have been fantastic returns out of bio land this year in general. This is just another Friday, really.\nNot only are large pharma firms like Sanofi (SNY) and Merck (MRK) rolling up wads of cash and heading to M&A Station, but some smaller names like have been breaking out.\nLet the largest holdings in the XBI speak for themselves: Alnylam (ALNY) (+91% year-to-date), Insmed (INSM) (+80%), Halozyme (HALO) (+39%). Impressive might be an understatement.\nIt's not just sunny in health care land\nThere's still money to be made outside of health care, though. Today, shares of solar stocks like Sunrun (RUN) (+32%), First Solar (FSLR) (+13%), Nextracker (NXT) (+12%), and Enphase Energy (ENPH) (+12%) are higher.\nWhat's charging up these solar names? Sunrun's fantastic Q2 earnings, which dropped this morning. It revealed that the company's profits more than doubled year-over-year, while revenues blew past expectations.\nSunrun's big run comes just a few weeks after First Solar was first to sound off about the fast growth in the solar market. It raised its guidance across the board after a fantastic quarter, giving investors a 'heads up' that it wasn't all so dreary in the clean energy sector, even if the Federal Government is indeed paling back tax credits and incentives for these sorts of energy investments (it plans to direct that money to expendable energy sources like natural gas, oil, and coal.)\nThe Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) is up 10.2% intraday; the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) is up nearly 4%.\nThis story is part of Stock Market Today, our daily live blog where we cover all things markets.

Its year has been marked by a litany of setbacks, comebacks, and everything in between.\nAt the center of Nvidia's headaches in 2025 is China -- and no, not because of DeepSeek. The real culprit has been a wave of sweeping tariff policies and export controls that have curtailed Nvidia's influence in the Chinese AI market.\nNow, after months of negotiations with regulators in Washington, it appears that the tide may be turning. Nvidia could be on the precipice of reestablishing its presence in one of its most crucial Asian markets.\nLet's unpack the details of Nvidia's new deal structure in China and examine why it should be celebrated as a massive win for investors.\nHow big an opportunity is China for Nvidia?\nAccording to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, the global total addressable market (TAM) for semiconductors, as measured by sales, reached $627 billion in 2024. Deloitte projects that the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over the coming decades -- ultimately reaching $2 trillion by 2040.\nOutside of the U.S., China remains one of the most important markets fueling demand for high-performance chipsets, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has estimated that the AI opportunity in China alone could be worth as much as $50 billion.\nIn 2024, Nvidia generated $130 billion in revenue, with China capturing roughly 13% of this sum. During the first quarter of 2025, Nvidia's $5.5 billion of China sales accounted for roughly 12.5% of total revenue.\nThis leveling trend underscores how the current administration's policies toward China have started to constrain Nvidia's growth potential in the region.\nWhy is Nvidia's new China deal so important?\nAccording to multiple news outlets, Nvidia has reached an agreement with Washington regarding its operation in China. Under the terms, Nvidia will pay 15% of its China-based sales to the U.S. government. In effect, the arrangement provides Nvidia with a pathway to penetrate this critical market through its tailored H20 chips.\nWhile this might initially resemble a tax, investors should avoid viewing it through that lens. First, the agreement applies to sales of Nvidia's AI chips rather than to profits, unlike traditional forms of taxation. Moreover, the 15% rate does not appear to be variable in structure like a royalty, which is typically tied to intellectual property (IP) and subject to fluctuate.\nWhile this deal might appear unusual at first glance, these structures are not without precedent in global business practices. For example, energy companies that extract natural resources or commodities in foreign countries often operate under similar revenue-sharing agreements with host nations in exchange for distribution rights.\nIn my view, dedicating a modest share of sales to secure access to China represents a strategic trade-off. In the long run, it allows Nvidia to preserve its dominant position in one of the world's most important AI markets and prevents domestic rivals such as Huawei from eroding its competitive moat.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\nWhile Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio has been expanding recently, levels remain muted compared to peaks reached previously during the AI revolution. In my view, part of this multiple compression reflects concerns surrounding China -- perhaps overly so.\nNvidia's new agreement in Washington offers the company renewed momentum, securing revenue in a critical market without forfeiting much in the way of profits -- even with the 15% remittance to the U.S. government.\nOver the long term, I see this arrangement as a strategic mechanism for Nvidia to strengthen its position overseas and deliver durable growth across the global AI infrastructure market.\nAs these fundamentals take hold, I think the company's valuation multiples could expand further, potentially driving the stock to new highs sooner than many investors may be expecting. For that reason, I see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer opportunity to buy hand over fist right now and hold for years to come.\nDo the experts think Nvidia is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

The world's most popular cryptocurrency is now up nearly 30% for the year and appears poised for further gains, based on improving market sentiment for crypto.\nBut can Bitcoin soar even higher, to $150,000? To answer that question, it's important to consider what's powering it.\nCatalysts for Bitcoin\nThere are several different catalysts pushing Bitcoin higher right now. One of them, of course, is the recent executive order from the White House that will open the door for crypto to be included in 401(k) plans. This is expected to unlock trillions of dollars in new capital, a big chunk of which will likely flow into Bitcoin.\nAnother key factor is institutional adoption. Simply put, everyone seems to be buying Bitcoin these days. Corporations are buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin treasury companies are buying Bitcoin. And the U.S. government continues to suggest that it will find a \"budget-neutral\" way to buy Bitcoin.\nAt the same time, money continues to flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs. This is arguably the best way to track institutional demand. If inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are positive, it means Bitcoin is likely to glide still higher. If inflows dry up, Bitcoin could be in for a rocky ride.\nFinally, there's the overall macroeconomic situation. The broader market seems to be coming to grips with tariffs and what they likely will mean for the U.S. economy. For now, inflationary pressures do not seem as threatening as they were back in April, and investors are now expecting a series of interest rate cuts starting in September. Historically, lower rates have been favorable for crypto and have led to more money moving into risky, volatile assets such as Bitcoin.\nSo everything is trending in Bitcoin's favor. A combination of institutional adoption, improving market sentiment, and expectations of rate cuts are juicing the market and helping to push Bitcoin higher.\nWhat do prediction markets think?\nThat said, Bitcoin is hardly a lock to hit $150,000 this year. One way to get a sense of what the overall market thinks is by looking at data from prediction markets. There, people are trading contracts based on where they think the price of Bitcoin is going next.\nOn the Kalshi prediction market, for example, traders think Bitcoin has a 75% chance of hitting $130,000 this year, a 53% chance of hitting $140,000, and a 37% chance of hitting $150,000. So, basically, there's a 1-in-3 chance that Bitcoin will hit $150,000 by the end of the year.\nThings get a bit dicier from there. For example, there is only a 27% chance that Bitcoin will hit $160,000 and a 10% chance that Bitcoin will hit $200,000. This last data point is particularly noteworthy because, at the start of the year, just about everyone was predicting that Bitcoin would double in value and easily hit $200,000.\nWhat to look for next\nThe market is pricing in an interest rate cut, but that can't happen if inflation rears its ugly head. And that's exactly what happened almost as soon as Bitcoin hit $124,000. New economic data suggested that inflationary pressures were building. As a result, Bitcoin quickly slid back down to $120,000.\nWith that in mind, Bitcoin investors should keep a close eye on any and all economic data that the Federal Reserve might take into account when deciding how to adjust interest rates in September. Notably, this marks a departure from the way people invested in Bitcoin in the past. Historically, money has flowed into Bitcoin regardless of what people think the Fed might (or might not) be doing.\nJust a few years ago, Bitcoin was completely uncorrelated with any major asset class. And that meant Bitcoin could zig when other assets zagged. But we're starting to see a correlation with stocks, and especially tech stocks. With institutional investors lining up for a piece of Bitcoin, the world's most popular cryptocurrency is starting to behave more and more like a risky, high-upside tech stock.\nLong-term, I'm still bullish on Bitcoin. But as we saw back in April, when Bitcoin buckled under the threat of tariffs, it remains a highly volatile digital asset subject to the broader macroeconomic outlook. There's a reasonably good chance Bitcoin will hit $150,000, but only if the broader economy doesn't deteriorate.\nShould you buy stock in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $668,155!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,106,071!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,070% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 184% for the S&P 500.

Instead, hedge fund manager Eric Jackson referred to Opendoor as a 100x stock in a series of social media posts, which also shared an extremely bullish investment thesis.\nJackson doesn't exactly have a flawless investment history -- after all, nobody who actively seeks out 100x candidates does. But he was an early proponent of Carvana, which was essentially priced for imminent demise a few years ago before it generated a 100x rally of its own. Could Opendoor do the same?\nWhy could this struggling real estate company be a 100x candidate?\nJackson has posted many times about Opendoor in the past month or so, and there are a lot of components to his investment thesis. His initial post on X detailing why he's so bullish on Opendoor came on July 14, but there have been hundreds of follow-up posts.\nJackson thinks Opendoor's iBuying business could be a big winner when macro headwinds turn around. In a July 16 post, Jackson (correctly) pointed out that there's no major competition left in iBuying. Both Zillow and Redfin shut down their iBuying businesses several years ago, and there's one more (much smaller) publicly traded competitor in Offerpad that remains. During the last real estate bull market, fueled by low interest rates, Opendoor was competing with all of these companies -- in the next one, it won't be.\nHowever, Jackson's thesis isn't just about the iBuying business itself. Instead, Jackson thinks the real value isn't necessarily in buying and selling homes, but in the vast data set Opendoor has accumulated.\nAs the leader in iBuying, Opendoor has executed over 200,000 real estate transactions, and has not only buy\/sell price data, but also tons of other useful information it can analyze. For example, Opendoor has data on how specific repairs translate into price changes. In a nutshell, he believes Opendoor could use this to build the best artificial intelligence (AI)-powered price estimator and prediction tool in the industry, and license it to create a stream of high-margin revenue.\nJackson also thinks assumable mortgages could be a big opportunity for the iBuying side. Conventional mortgage loans generally are not assumable (transferable to a new owner), but several types of government-backed loans, including VA loans, are. With trillions in low-rate, assumable mortgages out there, Jackson sees an opportunity for Opendoor to use these to invigorate its platform.\nShould you buy shares of Opendoor right now?\nFirst of all, when Jackson made his 100x call, Opendoor was trading for about $0.82 per share. As I'm writing this, it has already climbed to $2.45, so reaching Jackson's ambitious target would result in a roughly 33-fold gain from here. Of course, I'm sure everyone reading this would be fine with an investment turning $100 into $3,300 in a relatively short time frame, but it's still important to point out that the stock has gained significantly in the month or so since Jackson first shared his thesis.\nSecond, it's important to mention that this is a highly speculative stock, and Jackson's thesis (on both AI potential and iBuying growth) depends on a lot of things working in Opendoor's favor, and management being able to execute on unlocking the theoretical value of its data. As it stands, Opendoor is not a profitable business, and management is expecting a significant slowdown in the third quarter. High interest rates and an agonizingly slow real estate market are weighing on the business.\nCould Opendoor do what Jackson thinks, leveraging its data to develop AI price prediction tools? And could the iBuying business eventually become much larger and consistently profitable? Sure. But there's also a chance that won't happen and the stock could certainly go to zero if market conditions don't cooperate. If you want to make a small investment in Opendoor, it could be an interesting one to watch, but I'd caution against using any money you can't afford to lose.\nShould you buy stock in Opendoor Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Opendoor Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Opendoor Technologies wasn’t one of them.

Still, when I took a look at the list of Pentagon contracts published on July 31 in particular, I admit my eyes did goggle a little.\nIn just two announcements amounting to fewer than 600 words total, the U.S. government awarded Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT) and RTX Corporation (NYSE: RTX) just under $7.8 billion.\nBig news for LockMart and RTX\nBoth contracts concern the ordering of missiles for the United States Air Force.\nLockheed Martin's Missiles and Fire Control division got the larger order: $4.3 billion to upsize a previous contract instructing Lockheed to build and deliver Joint Air-To-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) and Long-Range, Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM) for use by the USAF and foreign allies Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, and Poland by Jan. 31, 2033.\nRTX's Raytheon military products division was awarded $3.5 billion to supply Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) by fiscal third-quarter 2031. In addition to the U.S. Air Force, these missiles are destined for the air forces of a huge host of U.S. allies, covering almost the entire alphabet: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\nHow to put big numbers in context\nAre you impressed yet? Well, before getting too excited about the large numbers being bandied about, make sure to note the completion dates for both contracts. Lockheed Martin's LRASM\/JASSM sales, for example, run through early 2033. That means you need to spread out the $4.3 billion contract value over more than seven years to get a sense of how much annualrevenue this contract will contribute, and whether it's enough to \"move the needle\" on Lockheed stock.\nHere's the answer: It bumps up Lockheed Martin's $71 billion-a-year revenue stream to perhaps $71.7 million -- an increase of less than 1%.\nSimilarly, RTX's $3.5 billion win spreads across six years. That works out to less than $600 million a year in extra orders. On RTX's $84 billion revenue stream, it's an increase of at most 0.7%.\nPlus, bear in mind that the Pentagon was already buying missiles from both these companies. The new orders -- in large part -- will simply replenish backlog and continue revenues that LockMart and RTX were already collecting. Viewed in that context, it's entirely possible that the ongoing increase in annual revenue for each company will be less than 1%... or even less than 0.7%.\nWhat this means for investors\nAll this said, and the caveats notwithstanding, we're still \"talking real money\" here -- even if it's not necessarily \"move the needle\" amounts of money. What's surprising to me is how much better RTX has been lately at turning revenue money into GAAP profits.\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Lockheed Martin's operating profit margin in its Missiles and Fire Control division is currently an anemic 4.2%, making it by far the least profitable of Lockheed's four main business divisions.\nRTX's Raytheon division, in contrast, earns 9.7% operating margins on its sales -- twice Lockheed MFC's margin. This makes Raytheon RTX's second most profitable business division after airplane parts division Collins Aerospace, despite Raytheon being the company's smallest division by revenue.\nStrange as it may sound, while RTX won the smaller of the two (still very large) missile contracts last week, measured both by absolute value and by value as a percentage of total sales, RTX is almost certain to earn the most profit from its Pentagon contract.\nThere's a reason why RTX stock sells for 2.5 times annual sales, while Lockheed stock is valued relatively less, at just 1.4x sales.\nAnd RTX's superior profit margin is that reason.\nShould you buy stock in RTX right now?\nBefore you buy stock in RTX, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and RTX wasn’t one of them.

But which companies are the next great investments? It can be hard to know, which is why it's smart to buy a bundle of promising stocks, spreading your risk and opportunity around.\nConsider, therefore, investing in the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG), which you can do with as little as $100. (To clarify, a single share recently went for $463, so if you only had $100 to invest, you'd need to buy a fraction of a share, which some good brokerages allow you to do.) An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a fund that trades like a stock.\nMeet the Vanguard Growth ETF\nThe Vanguard Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index, which is focused on large-cap companies growing at a faster-than-average clip, and the ETF aims to deliver roughly the same returns, minus its low fees. Specifically, its expense ratio (annual fee) is just 0.04%, meaning that you'll be charged a whopping $4 per year for every $10,000 you have invested in the fund.\nThe ETF held 165 stocks, as of June 30, per Vanguard, with 60% of assets in the technology sector, followed by 19% in the consumer discretionary sector. Here are the top 10 holdings, which together made up about 59% of total assets:\nSource: Vanguard.com, as of June 30.\nYou can see that all the Magnificent Seven stocks are there -- and among the top holdings. And given that these 10 holdings make up more than half the ETF's value, it's clear that the other 155 stocks will be relatively minor holdings for the ETF -- and its shareholders. Still, those top 10 companies are in the top 10 because they grew to huge sizes, and it's not crazy to let your winners run and keep winning.\nThis ETF and its more well-known fellow index fund, the S&P 500 index fund, are, like lots of others, market-cap-weighted, meaning that the bigger the component company, the more influence it will wield on the index. That's why the top 10 companies above make up so much of the Vanguard Growth ETF's value -- because they have such hefty market caps.\nIf you're in the market for diversification with less concentration, you might look for a good equal-weighted ETF, such as the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which holds each of its 500-some components in roughly equal proportion. The Invesco equal-weight ETF's top-10 holdings would, therefore, make up only about 2% or 3% of the overall ETF value.\nHow has the Vanguard Growth ETF performed?\nHere's how the Vanguard Growth ETF would have rewarded you over several recent periods. I'll compare its numbers to those of a low-fee S&P 500 index fund, too, and you'll see that it outperformed the S&P index fund handily:\nSource: Morningstar.com, as of August 12, 2025.\nThere's no guarantee that it will always outperform, though, and it's good to remember that since growth stocks tend to fall harder in market downturns, there may be years when it really underperforms. For example, in 2022, when the S&P 500 ETF dropped by around 18%, the Vanguard Growth ETF dropped by 33%. Ouch!\nStill, long-term investors have enjoyed solid overall gains, and it's rarely good to focus on any one year. So go ahead and consider the Vanguard Growth ETF for your growth-stock needs. But perhaps complement it with some other solid index ETFs.\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Index Funds - Vanguard Growth ETF wasn’t one of them.

Each of these schools has high academic standards, experts say — and in return for a degree at no cost, the commitment they require, even after graduation, is steep.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nThese college majors have the best job prospects\nStudent loan forgiveness may soon be taxed again\nStudent loan borrowers — how will the end of the SAVE plan impact you? Tell us\n\"This is a self-selecting group in a lot of ways,\" said Robert Franek, editor in chief at The Princeton Review. Yet \"it gives some hope for parents who worry about making college affordable — these colleges are doing just that.\"\nFor those up for the challenge, The Princeton Review compiled a list of the colleges that cost nothing. Here are the nine schools that don't charge tuition at all.\nBerea College\nFor over 150 years, this small school in Berea, Kentucky has strived to reach first-generation and low-income students who otherwise could not afford to pay for college, according to the school. But it doesn't stop there: Berea gives every student a laptop and funds to cover internship opportunities and even professional clothing for job interviews.\nCollege of the Ozarks\nDubbed \"Hard Work U,\" College of the Ozarks is a coed Christian school in rural Missouri geared toward serving students in the Ozark region. In return for a full scholarship, undergraduates must work 15 hours a week, plus two 40-hour weeks during the academic year as part of the school's work program.\nDeep Springs College\nOnly 12 to 15 students are admitted each year to this all-male liberal arts college in California's remote High Desert, according to the school. However, every student is awarded a scholarship that covers tuition and room and board. Since Deep Springs is a two-year school with no majors, many graduates go on to transfer to four-year programs to complete a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree.\nU.S. Air Force Academy\nIn addition to free tuition and room and board, students receive a stipend to cover all other costs at this academy near Colorado Springs, Colorado. In exchange, the academic and physical demands are rigorous, according to The Princeton Review, with classes from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. followed by fitness training multiple times a week. After four years, graduates are commissioned as second lieutenants in the Air Force or U.S. Space Force and commit to several years of active duty.\nU.S. Coast Guard Academy\nThis New London, Connecticut-based academy is also highly selective and demanding, according to The Princeton Review. The extremely structured four-year program, which is fully paid for by the government, offers 10 academic majors, including civil engineering and marine science. After completing their schooling, students commit to five years of service, although many opt to stay in the Coast Guard for much longer, the academy says.\nU.S. Merchant Marine Academy\nTuition, room and board, uniforms and books are similarly covered at this service academy in Kings Point, New York. As part of the four-year program, cadets gain hands-on experience working aboard commercial and military vessels around the world. Once they graduate, midshipmen can enter any branch of the armed forces as an officer. The service obligation varies depending on what type of job they choose.\nU.S. Military Academy – West Point\nEvery cadet at this prestigious institution in West Point, New York receives free tuition and a scholarship that covers room and board, in addition to a stipend for uniforms, books, supplies and all other expenses. Armed with a BS degree, West Point graduates then serve at least five years of active duty and three years in the reserves and are \"ready for a lifetime of service to the Army and nation,\" according to the academy.\nU.S. Naval Academy\nAll students on campus, known as \"the Yard,\" in Annapolis, Maryland, receive a full scholarship that covers tuition, room and board and other costs, in return for at least five years of active duty after graduation, followed by the reserves. After their rigorous training, many midshipmen go on to have prominent careers within and outside the military, according to The Princeton Review.\nWebb Institute\nFounded by the shipbuilder William Webb, this small, private college in Glen Cove, New York specializes in naval architecture and marine engineering. Every student receives a full scholarship to cover tuition and, along with little to no debt, they benefit from a 100% job placement rate upon graduation, according to the school.","content_hash":"e0a36f1914785f7ec1cecb31a0fe3863","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4949,"method_rank":0}

Applied Optoelectronics(NASDAQ: AAOI) isn't exactly down in the dumps. As of Aug. 15, 2025, it has gained 178% over the last 52 weeks.\nBut Applied Optoelectronics earned its price gains the hard and honest way: by selling high-performance optical networking products into several hungry target markets. And despite the impressive one-year return, the stock has dropped 50% from December's multiyear highs.\nHere's why I think you should consider buying Applied Optoelectronics' stock in this strange blend of soaring gains and sullen dips.\nBooming data center and CATV sales\nIn the recent second-quarter report, Applied Optoelectronics saw fantastic growth in its two largest divisions. With the artificial intelligence (AI) market driving strong demand for the company's fastest networking modules, data center sales rose 30% year over year to $44.8 million. Cable TV (CATV) sales soared from $5.8 million to $56.0 million, as an unnamed mega-customer invested in fiber-optic network infrastructure.\nThese results included the company's first shipment of 400-gigabit data center transceivers to a tech giant that hadn't been buying Applied Optoelectronics products for several years. Looking ahead, several large customers are testing the as-yet-unreleased 800-gigabit products. Shipments should start before the end of 2025, with the exact timing depending on factory upgrades and customers' qualification testing.\nDodging tariffs with smart manufacturing\nApplied Optoelectronics also has enough international manufacturing scale to dodge most of the looming tariff costs. Its laser chips have been made in America for years, and next-generation network transceivers will be made in Texas and Taiwan. The most expensive tariff categories are hardly a concern at all, according to earnings-call commentary by CFO Stefan Murry:\nIn our 800G and 1.6T transceiver designs, less than 10% of the value of the components used is currently sourced from China, and we have a pathway as we scale production to further reduce this China content, ultimately to near zero. We also are in discussion with several key suppliers about onshoring their production to the US to support a robust domestic supply chain.\nCan you stomach these investor risks?\nBesides AI and CATV networking, Applied Optoelectronics also makes laser-based sensors and network controller chips. It's an exciting company at the nexus of many promising growth markets.\nThat being said, it's not a flawless success story. I can see how two issues might keep you from buying Applied Optoelectronics stock.\nThe company's financial results are a bit jumpy, as a large chunk of its revenue generation comes from very large orders from a handful of key customers. That's a deal-breaker for investors who prefer a predictable business with smooth revenue streams. However, the bumpy road should calm down over time as Applied Optoelectronics expands its client roster.\nApplied Optoelectronics is in the habit of printing new shares, largely to support its stock-based compensation program. The share count has increased by a whopping 125% in the last three years. But this dilution took place in a period of impressive stock returns. It's hard to complain about heavy dilution when the stock price still soared 1,340% higher.\nThere will be surprises on the road ahead, and not all of them will be pleasant. I'm still impressed by Applied Optoelectronics' disciplined innovation and market-leading performance boosters. Its focus on American manufacturing should also be helpful in this era of international trade tension.\nThe AI boom is here to stay, and high-speed networking isn't going out of style any time soon. If you can focus on Applied Optoelectronics' business growth and overcome these potential downsides, I think the stock should serve you well over the next few years.\nShould you buy stock in Applied Optoelectronics right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Applied Optoelectronics, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Applied Optoelectronics wasn’t one of them.

That marked the beginning of a strong run for the company on the stock market. However, the Denmark-based drugmaker has given up most of these gains over the past year; the stock is down by 40% since January alone.\nDespite its recent misfortunes, Novo Nordisk's shares could still deliver strong returns to patient investors. Here's why.\nThe weight management opportunity\nNovo Nordisk primarily develops medicines for diabetes and, in recent years, weight management. Its stock has plunged over the past year because its financial results haven't been as impressive as the market had hoped. It also faced some clinical setbacks, while its biggest rival in its core markets, Eli Lilly, earned some important wins.\nHowever, there's more to the story. The market for anti-obesity medications could grow at an incredibly rapid rate. Some analysts estimate that it will be worth $150 billion by 2035, compared to $15 billion last year.\nNovo Nordisk still has one of the deepest pipelines in the industry. In fact, it's challenging to find a company other than Eli Lilly that has more promising products. Recently, Novo Nordisk expanded its pipeline through various licensing deals.\nHere's one more thing that recently broke its way: Eli Lilly's oral GLP-1 candidate, orforglipron, did not perform nearly as well as expected in a phase 3 study. This opens the door for Novo Nordisk to catch up to its longtime rival.\nThe company's oral version of Wegovy is currently awaiting approval from regulators in the U.S. The oral version led to an average weight reduction of 13.6% in a phase 3 clinical trial, slightly higher than the 12.4% that orforglipron recently posted in its late-stage study.\nWhile it's always hard to compare across clinical trials, the data at the very least suggests that oral Wegovy is comparable to orforglipron -- but only the former drug is closing in on approval. Novo Nordisk also has yet another promising anti-obesity candidate in phase 3 studies, amycretin, which the Denmark-based pharmaceutical giant is testing in both subcutaneous and oral formulations.\nWhy is the race to develop an oral weight loss option so important? Pills are easier and cheaper to manufacture, store, and transport. So, compared to injectable weight loss therapies, oral versions would allow drugmakers to produce them more cost-effectively and to expand the reach of weight loss therapies. On top of that, some patients are strongly averse to needles. Because the current leading weight management drugs are administered subcutaneously, an oral option would likely take a decent share of the market.\nNovo Nordisk is likely to be first to market. And the company could follow up that win with another oral product in amycretin.\nThe price is right\nLet's go back to Novo Nordisk's recent and disappointing financial results. In the first half of the year, revenue rose by 16% year over year to 154.9 billion Danish kroner ($24.2 billion), while net profit came in at 55.5 billion DKK ($8.7 billion). Perhaps that's not quite what the market expected to see, but these are still excellent results for a pharmaceutical giant -- most drugmakers of that size would be happy to grow their revenue at high-single-digit or low-double-digit rates.\nMeanwhile, the stock appears reasonably valued, trading at 13 times forward earnings, compared to the healthcare industry's average of 16.2.\nWhat's the verdict? Novo Nordisk looks attractive at current levels, given the company's strong pipeline in weight management and a lineup that continues to deliver consistent profits. Despite recent setbacks, the stock is well-positioned to deliver excellent results over the long term.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Novo Nordisk right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Novo Nordisk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Novo Nordisk wasn’t one of them.

That can work, but if you live a long time, you do run the risk of running out of dollars before you run out of breath. So, consider generating passive income from some great exchange-traded funds (ETFs) -- funds that trade like stocks.\nFor my own retirement, I plan to generate a significant amount of income passively via dividends from dividend-paying stocks. I own various dividend payers along with a dividend-focused ETF or two. Here are three for you to consider.\nCan you get $1 million in passive income?\nI have to say, collecting $1 million in passive income, presumably annually, is a tall order. It's not like you're going to be able to have a $2 million portfolio and a 50% dividend yield, generating $1 million.\nA more typical dividend yield for good blue chip companies is between 2% and 4%, with plenty of exceptions higher and lower. Some well-regarded companies do have yields of 5% or 6% or more, though. Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), for example, recently yielded 6.4%, and Realty Income (NYSE: O) yielded 5.7%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index, which holds 500 of America's biggest companies, sported an overall dividend yield of only 1.2% recently. (Many of those 500 companies don't pay a dividend at all.)\nSo, here are some scenarios that show how much passive income you might generate with different kinds of portfolios:\nSource: Calculations by author.\nYou'd need a portfolio worth $33,333,333, per the table above, if you want to collect $1 million annually via an overall average dividend yield of 3%. The table below doubles that to 6% and shows that you'd only need a $16,666,667 portfolio.\nSource: Calculations by author.\nTake some comfort in the other numbers, though. You might set up $30,000 or $60,000 or some other excellent amount of passive income with a more reasonable-sized portfolio.\n3 ETFs that could generate lots of passive income for you\nYou might now be wondering which ETFs to consider for that wonderful passive income. Here are three solid contenders:\nSource: Yahoo! Finance and Morningstar.com, as of August 6, 2025.\nEach offers a solid dividend yield along with impressive average annual gains. Such returns are not guaranteed, of course, and some ETFs will post poor or even negative results now and then. But overall, these have done well and are poised to continue.\nIf you want fatter yields, you might consider the iShares Preferred & Income Securities ETF(NASDAQ: PFF), which recently sported a yield of 6.5%. Its average annual gains are far lower, though, as it's a fund specializing in preferred stocks, which tend to be generous dividend payers with little stock-price appreciation.\nAnother option to consider is a covered-call ETF such as the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF(NYSEMKT: JEPI) or the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ), recently yielding 8.4% and 11.2%, respectively. But read up on these kinds of ETFs first to make sure you understand what you're investing in and how they work.\nHowever you go about it, give serious consideration to loading up much of your long-term portfolio with dividend payers, as they can generate a lot of passive income for you.\nShould you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF wasn’t one of them.

Key questions on the breadth of the offer versus local grocery players remain.\nIt's mportant to note, Wells Fargo said, that many customers already have grocery-delivery options.\nEvercore ISI noted that Amazon's expansion of same-day delivery to include perishable groceries marked a significant strategic move into one of retail's most competitive and high-retention categories.\nThe firm said the move deepened Amazon's customer engagement by strengthening a high-frequency purchase category into the Prime ecosystem, increasing loyalty and longtime customer value.\nThe deeper integration of groceries with Amazon's vast general merchandise offering positions the company more aggressively against competitors like Instacart and Walmart+.\nBy setting a relatively low free delivery threshold of $25, Evercore said Amazon applies pricing pressure that may challenge rivals' ability to compete on convenience and cost.\nGiven that this segment is a $1 trillion-plus market in the U.S. and perhaps $2 trillion-plus across all of Amazon's global markets, there should be a large growth opportunity here, the firm added.\nEvercore has an outperform rating on Amazon with a price target of $280 on the shares.","content_hash":"2b83295708153970d557178891bb3d3b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4550,"method_rank":0}

Air Canada said in a statement that the union \"illegally directed its flight attendant members to defy a direction from the Canadian Industrial Relations Board.\"\n\"Our members are not going back to work,\" Canadian Union of Public Employees national president Mark Hancock said outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport. \"We are saying no.\"\nHancock ripped up a copy of the back-to-work order outside the airport's departures terminal where union members were picketing Sunday morning. He said they won't return Tuesday either.\nFlight attendants chanted \"Don't blame me, blame AC\" outside Pearson.\nThe federal government didn't immediately provide comment on the union refusing to return to work.\nHancock said the \"whole process has been unfair\" and said the union will challenge what it called an unconstitutional order.\nLess than 12 hours after workers walked off the job, Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the 10,000 flight attendants back to work, saying now is not the time to take risks with the economy and noting the unprecedented tariffs the U.S. has imposed on Canada. Hajdu referred the work stoppage to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.\nThe airline said the CIRB has extended the term of the existing collective agreement until a new one is determined by the arbitrator.\nThe shutdown of Canada's largest airline early Saturday was impacting about 130,000 people a day.

Around the same time, Air Canada said it would begin locking flight attendants out of airports.\nThe bitter contract fight escalated Friday as the union turned down Air Canada's prior request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.\nLast year, the government forced the country's two major railroads into arbitration with their labor union during a work stoppage. The union for the rail workers is suing, arguing the government is removing a union's leverage in negotiations.\nHajdu maintained that her Liberal government is not anti-union, saying it is clear the two sides are at an impasse.\nPassengers whose flights are impacted will be eligible to request a full refund on the airline's website or mobile app, according to Air Canada.\nThe airline said it would also offer alternative travel options through other Canadian and foreign airlines when possible. Still, it warned that it could not guarantee immediate rebooking because flights on other airlines are already full \"due to the summer travel peak.\"\nAir Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but they have yet to reach a tentative deal. Both sides have said they remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.\nThe airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years, that it said \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada.\"\nBut the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.","content_hash":"094a634fee333982ab29f470b4f7785c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4447,"method_rank":0}

Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit to block the federal takeover of the department.\nTrump, a Republican, said this week he was deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops to Washington and temporarily taking over the Democratic-led city's police department to curb what he depicted as a crime and homelessness emergency.\nJustice Department data, however, showed violent crime in 2024 hit a 30-year low in Washington, a self-governing federal district under the jurisdiction of Congress.\nWest Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey's office said in a statement he was deploying 300 to 400 National Guard troops to D.C. in \"a show of commitment to public safety and regional cooperation.\" The statement said he also was providing equipment and specialized training.\nSouth Carolina Governor Henry McMaster responded to a Pentagon request by announcing that 200 of his state's National Guard troops would be sent.\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine said he would send 150 military police members in the coming days, adding none of them were \"currently serving as law enforcement officers in the state.\"\nAfter the announcements, Mayor Bowser posted on X: \"American soldiers and airmen policing American citizens on American soil is #UnAmerican.\"\nTroops to other cities?\nThe National Guard serves as a militia that answers to the governors of the 50 states except when called into federal service. The D.C. National Guard reports directly to the president.\nTrump, who has suggested he could take similar actions in other Democratic-controlled cities, has sought to expand the powers of the presidency in his second term, inserting himself into the affairs of major banks, law firms and elite universities.\nIn June, Trump ordered 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, against the wishes of California's Democratic governor, during protests over mass immigration raids by federal officials.\nSouth Carolina's McMaster said his troops would immediately return to South Carolina if needed to respond to a possible hurricane or other natural disaster. Hurricane Erin, now northeast of Puerto Rico, has become a catastrophic Category 5 storm that could bring ocean swells to the U.S. East Coast early next week, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Saturday.\nNational Guard troops often respond to natural disasters and rarely police U.S. civilians.\nDrew Galang, a spokesperson for West Virginia's Morrisey, said the state's National Guard received the order to send equipment and personnel to D.C. late on Friday and was working to organize the deployment.\nA White House official said on Saturday that more National Guard troops would be called in to Washington to \"protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime.\"\nA U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said a formal order was expected to go out that would authorize National Guard troops in D.C. to carry firearms. The official said this order would affect mostly military police officers with sidearms. Reuters has reported that the National Guard troops would have weapons nearby, such as in their vehicles.\nThe White House said on Saturday that D.C. National Guard members have conducted patrols on foot and in vehicles around the National Mall and Union Station. The White House said the National Guard troops are not making arrests now and that they may be armed.\nIt is not clear how the administration could deploy National Guard troops elsewhere. A federal judge in San Francisco is expected in the coming weeks to issue a ruling on whether Trump violated the law with the Los Angeles deployments.","content_hash":"d606043c2589e5a5e7f9e54e6d1bc341","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4237,"method_rank":0}

Several Long Island and New Jersey beaches also will be off-limits.\n\"Enjoy the shore, enjoy this beautiful weather but stay out of the water,\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Tuesday.\nOff the coast of Massachusetts, Nantucket Island could see waves of more than 10 feet (3 meters) later this week. But the biggest threat is along the barrier islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks where evacuations have been ordered. At least one town asked residents to secure their trash cans so they don't float or blow away.\nErin has become an unusually large and deceptively worrisome storm while moving through the Caribbean, with its tropical storm winds stretching 200 miles (320 kilometers) from its core. Forecasters expect it will grow larger in size as it moves through the Atlantic and curls north.\nIt continued to lash the Turks and Caicos Islands on Tuesday, where government services were suspended a day earlier and residents were ordered to stay home, along with parts of the Bahamas before it's expected to turn toward Bermuda and the U.S.\nBy Tuesday, Erin had lost some strength from previous days and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (170 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It was about 655 miles (1,050 kilometers) south-southeast of North Carolina's Cape Hatteras.\nRough ocean conditions already have been seen along the U.S. coast — at least 60 swimmers were rescued from rip currents Monday at Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina.\nThe biggest swells along the East Coast are expected to develop Wednesday and last into Thursday.\nTwo years ago, Hurricane Lee grew with surprising speed while barreling offshore through the Atlantic, unleashing violent storms and rip currents up and down the seaboard.\nClimate scientists say Atlantic hurricanes are now much more likely to rapidly intensify into powerful and catastrophic storms fueled by warmer oceans.\nOn the Outer Banks, local leaders said Erin's storm surge could swamp roads with waves of 15 feet (4.6 meters). Mandatory evacuations were ordered on Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands, and more than 1,800 people had left Ocracoke by ferry since Monday.\nNorth Carolina Gov. Josh Stein warned residents along the coast to be prepared in case they need to evacuate and declared a state of emergency on Tuesday in advance of the storm. Bulldozers were busy shoring up the dunes, and on Hatteras, the owners of a pier removed a few planks, hoping the storm surge will pass through without tearing up the structure.\nHolly Andrzejewski, who just bought a bed-and-breakfast on Hatteras Island with her husband, said they spent the last few days bringing in all the outdoor furniture and making sure there were generators, extra water and flashlights.\n\"It's just one of those things where you know this is always a possibility and it could happen, and you just make the best out of it. Otherwise you wouldn't live at the beach,\" she said.\nThe Outer Banks' thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that jut into the Atlantic Ocean are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges. There are concerns that parts of the main highway could be washed out, leaving some routes impassible for days.\nFarther south, no evacuations had been ordered, but some beach access points were closed as forecasts call for water levels up to 3 feet (1 meter) over normal high tides for several days.","content_hash":"fafd54bb89626f3f64b7874585f6701d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3967,"method_rank":0}

Shares tumbled, driven by worries about slowing growth, execution missteps, and a worsening net loss. But dig deeper, and the underlying narrative is more nuanced; there were a lot of positives in the report, too.\nRevenue and users continue to grow at a robust rate, free cash flow has turned positive year over year, and new ad formats, such as sponsored Snaps, are demonstrating real engagement traction. Given the mix of good and bad in its underlying business and the stock's recent sell-off, it makes sense to check whether the shares have been pushed into oversold territory.\nLet's look at what changed in the business and what it might mean for investors today.\nMomentum in key areas\nSnap reported second-quarter revenue of $1.345 billion, marking a 9% gain from a year earlier. Further, the lifeblood of the company -- user activity -- performed exceptionally well.\nDaily active users (DAUs) rose 9% to 469 million, while monthly active users (MAUs) climbed 7% to 932 million. Operating cash flow reached $88 million, and free cash flow came in positive at $24 million, a notable reversal from the previous year, when the company burned cash. Still, Snap posted a net loss of $263 million (wider than a net loss of $249 million in the year-ago quarter), and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) slid lower on a year-over-year basis to $41 million, underscoring that profitability remains out of reach.\nAn ad platform glitch -- where auction settings pushed some campaigns to clear at unusually low prices -- weighed on performance early in the quarter. Snap reversed the change mid-period, and management said that advertiser activity is recovering.\nOne of my favorite data points to support the bull case: On the diversification front, \"other revenue\" -- primarily from subscriptions like Snapchat+ -- grew 64% year over year, and Snapchat+ subscribers rose roughly 42%, nearing 16 million.\nOne of the quarter's most promising developments was sponsored Snaps -- video ads delivered directly into users' inboxes. Snap co-founder Evan Spiegel said in the company's second-quarter earnings call that after a user opens a sponsored Snap from their chat feed, they \"exhibit significantly higher engagement per full-screen ad view, driving a 2x increase in conversion, a 5x increase in click-to-convert ratios and a 2x increase in website dwell times compared to other inventories. That signals a powerful new lever for monetizing deeply engaged users.\nGiven the company's fast-growing subscription business, advertising revenue growth trends after the glitch was addressed, and momentum in sponsored Snaps, management guided for continued top-line growth in Q3.","content_hash":"db64cb5d5c26cfc1d623f1ef9b21a1fc","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3099,"method_rank":0}

With these near record-high numbers, many Americans are feeling the pinch and want to find ways to dig themselves out. But should you allow your debt to disrupt your retirement plans?\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nLet's look at the example of Gavin, a 40-year-old married man with two children. He bought a home in the Caribbean in 2019 with the goal of eventually making the house his retirement home.\nThe house is worth $400,000 now, with a $120,000 mortgage balance. Unfortunately, the mortgage loan has a variable interest rate, which is currently at 10.5% with no possible options for refinancing.\nThe home currently generates $700 per month in profit as a short-term rental, but makes less during off off-season and managing it is stressful. Worse, the neighborhood may soon prohibit short-term rentals in the area, so that would be the end of this revenue stream. Additionally, Gavin might also be on the hook for local property taxes and, as a foreign investor, other possible fees and taxes too.\nOn top of this, the buyer is a renter in the US where he currently lives and he has $50,000 in credit card debt. Does it make sense for him to sell the vacation property to pay off what he owes? He’s considering buying a home locally and using the rest of the money to invest, build up an emergency fund, or start a college fund for his kids.\nSelling the vacation home could be a great solution\nSelling the vacation home in this particular case seems like an easy answer.\nWhile it is currently generating a small profit, earning $8,400 per year on a $400,000 asset isn't a great return, especially given the hassle of being the host and the substantial interest he is paying on his mortgage. But losing the short-term rental income would be a major downside.\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market?

But finding the right ones is more difficult than you might think. That's because stocks with ultra-high dividend yields may look appealing but have underlying issues. For instance, if a company struggles and its stock sinks significantly, the dividend yield will rise, but the company could still be at risk of a dividend cut.\nIt's key for investors to analyze company financials and make sure the company can continue to generate enough free cash flow and earnings to not only cover the dividend but also increase the dividend annually. I've found one company could be a Dividend Champion in the making and may even announce another dividend hike next month.\nBusiness is thriving\nIt's one of the larger mobile carriers in the U.S., and T-Mobile's (NASDAQ: TMUS) business has been thriving. Investors have rewarded the stock, sending shares up over 14% this year as of Aug. 14.\nFor the second-quarter, T-Mobile reported diluted earnings per share of $2.84, up 14% year over year. Total revenue grew nearly 7%. The solid performance was driven by new customer growth, including postpaid net customer additions of 1.7 million, the company's highest second-quarter additions ever and industry leading, according to T-Mobile. The company also grew 5G broadband customers by 454,000, up 12% year over year and industry-leading growth as well.\nT-Mobile's success in part stems from its marketing strategy of being the \"un-carrier,\" which essentially means trying to be the opposite of a traditional carrier by eliminating hidden fees and not forcing customers to sign longer-term, more prohibitive contracts.\nA newer dividend that could grow over time\nT-Mobile is a relatively new dividend company, having only initiated its dividend in 2023. The quarterly dividend started at $0.65, but management hiked it to $0.88 in September of 2024, representing a 35% increase. That puts the annual yield at 1.40% at the current stock price, which is not a high dividend yield, but a quick start for a company that's been paying a dividend for less than two years.\nThe good news is the dividend looks more than sustainable for now and there's room to grow it. The company has a trailing 12-month free cash flow yield of 4.25% and a payout ratio of nearly 31%. To put that in terms that are easier to understand, T-Mobile has paid out about $3.78 billion of dividends over the last year. Management is guiding for $17.8 billion of free cash flow this year at the midpoint of its guidance, plenty to cover the dividend payout.","content_hash":"4981f53faa2237ff83738e7712a6c0b3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2973,"method_rank":0}

The chatbot, however, did acknowledge that it may require time, skill, and, often, some luck. The AI tool broke down my options for joining the financial elite into three overarching categories: realistic, long-term Strategies, moderate-risk, high-effort options, and high-risk, low probability paths.\nDiscover Next: I Asked ChatGPT How To Get Rich Off of Bitcoin — Here’s What It Said\nRealistic, Long-Term Strategies\nChatGPT offered two long-term options for turning $10 into $1 million: investing in the stock market or starting a low-cost business. The chatbot recommended adding to the initial investment each month. It said that if $100 a month is invested in an S&P 500 index fund with ~10% annual return, I could become a millionaire in around 35 to 40 years as a result of compounding interest.\nWhile most financial experts agree that investing is the most solid way to grow wealth, it may take more than $10 to reach millionaire status. Market volatility may also derail the strategy. It is strongly recommended that hopeful investors meet with a financial advisor first to develop the right plan moving forward. According to Fidelity, potential investors should first determine what they are investing for, the most part retirement, before deciding on a stock. A financial professional can then help determine what account is best based on individual needs and goals.\nThe second option suggested by ChatGPT was to start a low-cost business. This can be achieved, according to the online platform, by spending the $10 on a domain and then creating a blog or selling a digital product. While this may seem easy enough, in reality, it takes a level of expertise to get an online business started and even more to make it successful, given the crowded industry.\nModerate-Risk, High-Effort Options\nThe next set of options, as suggested by the popular chatbot, involves a little more risk and a lot more effort. In the moderate-risk category is flipping, arbitrage or skill-based work. As noted by the AI platform, the success of these depends on skill level, scale, and effort. Arbitrage involves the buying of an asset in a lower-priced market and selling it in a higher-priced market. ChatGPT recommended doing this via online marketplaces such as eBay and Craigslist.","content_hash":"a7f8aabb4ab0db5fdfd14eaba123faaa","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2954,"method_rank":0}

(NYSE:LAD) one of the largest global automotive retailers operating in North America and the United Kingdom. In late June, the auto industry was impacted by a cyberattack on CDK Global’s dealership management system, which runs all back-office functions at Lithia as well as over 85% of all franchised dealers in the United States. In its Q2 2024 earnings release, LAD reported a -6.4% decline in same-store sales, driven primarily by a -4.7% decline in new vehicle units as LAD was not able to process sale transactions late in the quarter due to the CDK outage. Despite lower same-store sales, LAD outperformed expectations as its cost reduction initiatives and a shift in capital allocation resulted in sequential margin improvement and a lower share count. The company achieved its $150MM in annualized cost savings target ahead of schedule and now expects to double these savings by the end of 2024 through further inventory optimization and reductions. This will result in the all-important SG&A as a percentage gross profit declining to the mid-60s range and in line with LAD’s long-term target. Acquisitions have added $27B in annualized revenues since 2020, ahead of LAD’s goal of adding $25B in acquired revenues by 2025. Given the current high private market multiples for auto dealerships, LAD’s management has shifted its capital allocation toward share repurchases, buying back 2.9% of the company in Q2. With low net leverage of 2.3x and year-to-date free cash flow of $740MM, we expect management to continue repurchasing shares aggressively. During the quarter, we added to the position prior to its Q2 results.”","content_hash":"70b59045cdb24a4082b162d0008e799c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2918,"method_rank":0}

And, if certain circumstances align, they might also talk to you about life insurance. You might assume that policy you have through your job is enough, but group coverage is often limited (commonly one to two times salary), can change if you leave the employer and may not be portable. Fortunately, it’s your financial advisor’s job to know.\nGOBankingRates talked to Dan White, ChFC, CLU, RICP, founder and CEO of Daniel A. White & Associates, and Melissa Murphy Pavone, CFP, CDFA, founder of Mindful Divorce Partners to see when they’d recommend their clients seek out life insurance.\nWhen Your Earning Potential Is High but Assets Are Low\nWhen White is helping clients decide on the financial products that will meet them where they are now, while keeping an eye toward the future, he thinks about their potential — and younger clients are full of it. Their earning potential is high as they rise in their career, but they might still be at the stage where they’re waiting to see the full rewards from all their hard work.\nIn other words, yes, the earning potential is high, but the assets are still low, comparatively. On top of that, younger, upwardly mobile clients may still be taking on debt for student loans and mortgages as they think about their own children’s futures. In these cases, White points to term life insurance for straightforward, affordable protection that can replace income, cover debts and protect the family’s standard of living if a breadwinner dies.\n“Many times, term insurance would be used for circumstances that have a finite length, like a mortgage or to get their children through college,” he said.\nExplore More: 8 Truths Any Competent Financial Advisor Will Tell You About Legacy Planning\nWhen You’re Concerned About Legacy\nThough term insurance can be good for young people who are emerging into their careers or family life, White acknowledges that people often outlive their initial term insurance.

Why risk it if you don’t have to?” Pulliam said. “However, if you have money that you don’t mind losing, then invest whatever amount makes you feel comfortable.”\n“Time horizons are important,” Lisa Wang, head of goals-based investment solutions at Franklin Templeton, noted. “If someone is younger, and therefore, has many years ahead of investing, then allocating to relatively riskier assets might be appropriate.”\nShe added that it’s important to take other factors into consideration when determining risk tolerance, including long-term financial goals like saving for retirement, education or generating income sources. “Having enough assets on hand to cover such an emergency is important to plan for,” she said. “All of this requires careful planning and consideration.”\nSeech pointed out that people often determine their risk tolerance not based on their age, savings or financial goals, but on past experiences. “Some people either sold or witnessed relatives or friends selling at a market low. They tend to associate negative feelings with equity investing because they anchor to the risk of loss,” she said. “The opposite is true for those who have stayed invested and understand the importance of time in the market.","content_hash":"572841b89d5ebd214f3b025d03a49481","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2908,"method_rank":0}

In the first six months of this year, transaction revenue from volume-based trades accounted for 65.5% of Gemini’s revenue.\nThe rush of crypto companies listing publicly comes as the Trump administration has embraced the industry and crypto legislation was signed into law. Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group Inc. went public in June in a $1.2 billion IPO, surging 168% on its first trading day, and crypto exchange Bullish climbed 84% in its debut after raising $1.1 billion earlier this week.\nGemini, which counts Cameron Winklevoss as its president and Tyler Winklevoss as its chief executive officer, offers a crypto exchange, a US dollar-backed stablecoin, crypto staking and a credit card that offers rewards in crypto.

The real profits are already showing up, unlike in the early days of the internet boom — so it is different this time, the thinking goes.\nBut Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett has a message for these investors: \"It better be different this time.\"\nHartnett, who has often expressed skepticism of the market's bull run over the last few years, shared a head-turning chart that highlights just how optimistic investors have become about the impact AI will have. It shows the S&P 500's price-to-book ratio, which measures the total market cap of the index's constituents compared to their total assets minus liabilities.\nThe valuation measure is at a record high of 5.3, topping the 5.1 level seen in March 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble.\nOther classic valuation measures show market froth relative to history. For instance, Hartnett also shared a chart showing the S&P 500's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio. Except for August 2020, it's at the highest level since the dot-com era.\nAnd the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which measures current prices against a 10-year rolling average of earnings, is at similar levels to 1929, 2000, and 2021.\nHigh valuations reflect high expectations for future earnings. Sometimes those expectations turn out to be too elevated, and prices correct, but they don't necessitate a bubble scenario. So far, many AI firms have continually beat earnings expectations, suggesting the optimism could be justified.\nValuations are also better predictors of average long-term returns than near-term performance, and views on Wall Street on where the market goes in the months ahead differ. Though there are calls for caution, many strategists continue to raise their year-end S&P 500 price targets.\nEarlier this week, Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said the market is in the \"best investing environment ever\" thanks to factors like strong demand for stocks, looming rate cuts, and recent boosts in productivity and earnings growth.\nIf the market does start to unwind, however, Hartnett said he sees bonds and non-US stocks benefiting.

With a federal framework in place, Citigroup said this week that it’s exploring a stablecoin, months after Bank of America signaled the same.\nLopez said that stablecoins emerged within the crypto industry primarily as a way for exchanges to overcome long settlement times that customers faced when funding accounts, but experimentation has pushed their utility far beyond that.\n“On-and-off ramps have been a large driver for some of the new use cases that we hear around stablecoins,” he said, pointing to cross-border remittances and business-to-business payments.\nEarlier this year, crypto payments service MoonPay acquired Helio and Unstoppable Finance, \"underscoring the vision for crypto payments,” according to a report from Architect Partners.\nThe move followed payment giant Stripe’s acquisition of stablecoin platform Bridge last year, one of the largest deals in the industry’s history valued at $1.1 billion.\nRipple said earlier this month that it would purchase Rail, a Toronto-based payments platform, for $200 million. Ripple highlighted the firm’s ability to offer “comprehensive stablecoin pay-ins and pay-outs” without requiring a company to hold crypto on its balance sheet.\nFed Ends Supervisory Program Overseeing Banks' Crypto Activity\nLopez noted that the licenses on-and-off ramp companies own could be a factor as well, letting companies expand into new businesses or jurisdictions than they could otherwise.\n“It's really a time-to-market value,” he said. “If there's a particular player that wants to enter a particular business, they can do so much faster they can acquire a business that's gone through all the regulatory hurdles to actually be licensed to operate.”","content_hash":"5a8fa643b1a35bf64624cdce11fc66ca","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2859,"method_rank":0}

That had been a major overhang on XRP. With the path now clear, what's next for XRP? Where will the cryptocurrency be in five years?\nLofty expectations\nDespite XRP's monstrous performance in less than a year, many investors, analysts, and stakeholders think the sky is the limit. The big use case for XRP is its potential ability to disrupt international payments. That's because XRP is highly scalable in that it can process as many as 1,500 transactions per second.\nRipple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse believes this capacity will eventually lead the token and network to take international payments market share. Specifically, Garlinghouse has said that the legacy SWIFT (Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) system has a high error rate of 6%.\nGarlinghouse has even gone as far to claim that XRP could steal 14% of SWIFT's volume. However, SWIFT is largely a messaging system that financial institutions use to send payment instructions. Garlinghouse said Ripple is more interested in changing the way money is transmitted. Ripple operates cross-border payments technology that relies on XRP to conduct international payment transfers. Garlinghouse said that Ripple's system removes the need to pre-fund accounts, which in turn lowers regulatory capital requirements for traditional banks and leads to less expensive and more efficient transactions.\nGarlinghouse has also said that more than 100 banks using SWIFT are on the RippleNet platform, and the company continues to try to bridge the gap between crypto and mainstream finance with acquisitions like the prime broker Hidden Road.\nGarlinghouse isn't the only one excited about crypto. Standard Chartered crypto analyst Geoff Kendrick is also bullish on XRP, primarily because of its ability to make payments more efficient, the eventual launch of spot-XRP exchange-traded funds, and further adoption of Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD, which XRP serves as a bridge token to. Kendrick thinks XRP could hit more than $12 by the year 2029, quadrupling from recent prices of about $3.","content_hash":"0db9af505d60c1cb17ba2ee3861eb07e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2801,"method_rank":0}

How to weather the fallout if — or when — it hits\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, raised concerns about the U.S. economy following the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ latest report on August 1st.\nIn a post on X, he warned, “the economy is on the precipice of recession. That’s the clear takeaway from last week’s economic data dump. Consumer spending has flatlined, construction and manufacturing are contracting, and employment is set to fall. And with inflation on the rise, it is tough for the Fed to come to the rescue.”\nJust days earlier, Zandi had observed that employment was the “remaining firewall between the weakening economy and recession.”\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n-\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n-\nWant an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nThat firewall appears to be weakening: revisions to May and June job gains cut a combined 258,000 positions, bringing the three-month average increase to just 35,000 — more typical of an early recession than a healthy expansion.\nThe slowdown extends beyond hiring. Consumer spending growth in Q1, housing investment has declined for several months, and manufacturing output is down year-over-year.\nWhile Q2 GDP rose 3%, much of that growth came from a drop in imports rather than strong domestic demand. Rising tariff uncertainty is also discouraging hiring and investment.\nHow a downturn ripples through the economy\nFor individuals, a recession often brings job market anxiety. Layoffs and reduced hours typically hit first in sectors sensitive to economic shifts, such as construction, manufacturing, transportation, and retail.\nHowever, any future downturn may not be limited to these industries. Advances in AI appear to be reducing demand for some white collar jobs, particularly entry-level positions. Meanwhile, government layoffs in the first half of the year could also weigh on the economy, as affected workers cut back on spending to focus on essentials.\nSmall businesses often feel the pinch just as acutely — and sometimes earlier. When consumers pull back on discretionary spending, revenues decline for restaurants, shops, and service providers.\nSlower payments from clients and operating costs can quickly create cash flow problems. Businesses without strong reserves or adaptable operating models may be forced to cut staff, delay investments, or shut down altogether.","content_hash":"e261e81d7ecae29c4515c12398b41ec8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2791,"method_rank":0}

I'm proud of my progress on these; it's taken a lot of hard work.\nSecond, the price increases on car cleaning products. I have no clue if it's because of tariffs. But I sort of understand better why shares of Advance Auto Parts (AAP) are up 20% year to date, while Autozone (AZO) has rallied 25%, compared to the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 10% advance.\nThe third shocker has been the current earnings season, which is coming to a close with results next week from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and Home Depot (HD).\nLooking for the simplest reason why the markets have seemingly gone up in a straight line this summer? It's not necessarily because of the potential for a measly 25 basis point rate cut at the Federal Reserve's September meeting.\nIs a 25 basis point rate cut really that big of a deal? I would argue no, especially when there's no indication it will be the start of up to eight rate cuts through 2026 — as some of my Wall Street sources have been talking about over $25 cocktails this month.\nThis earnings season equals rocket fuel for the stock market.\nThe stats tell the upbeat story.\nAccording to FactSet data, 81% of S&P 500 companies have reported positive earnings per share surprises. 81% of S&P 500 companies have also reported a positive revenue surprise. Sectors with above-80% earnings beat scores include industrials, healthcare, financials, consumer staples, real estate, and information technology. Companies that have issued positive guidance have trumped those issuing negative guidance.\nSecond quarter earnings growth is clocking in at 11.8%, the third straight quarter of double-digit growth for the S&P 500.\nRead more: Live coverage of corporate earnings\nWhat's more interesting is that despite all the whipsawing from the White House, companies are sounding less downbeat on the economy. At least from the standpoint of worrying about a recession.\nOverall, the term “recession” was cited on 16 earnings calls conducted by S&P 500 companies this earnings season, according to FactSet. This number is trending well below the five-year average of 74 and the 10-year average of 61.\nWhether this current earnings season will be as good as it gets for 2025 is anyone's guess. Tariff inflation lurks in the third quarter, and the bar has been set much higher. Companies will enter the third quarter earnings season with above-historical valuations and expectations of strong 2026 outlooks or directionally bullish commentary on the path forward.","content_hash":"902f99dde25d3aebdd604a0cd79b3046","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2786,"method_rank":0}

And if they were to catch even a whiff that you're building a large stake in a company, copycat traders could spark a premature price spike and make your purchase more expensive.\nBerkshire's assets may be worth over $1 trillion, but Buffett still likes a good bargain.\nSince that May filing, his mystery bet has been the talk of Wall Street.\nCould it be FedEx? UPS? Caterpillar? I bet it's Caterpillar.\nBuffett's headline move last quarter was a $1.6 billion bet on an industry that is home to something he once described as \"the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness.\" He bought more than 5 million shares in UnitedHealth.\nUnitedHealth's stock had plummeted since its CEO, Brian Thompson, was fatally shot in December. Along with other major US health insurers, the company has also been grappling with an unexpected rise in medical costs.

But that's only slightly outpaced the S&P 500 over that time, leaving some investors wondering if Amazon stock has permanently lost its luster.\nI think that sentiment fails to account for Amazon's strong position in some very big markets and how hard it will be for competitors to catch up. To that end, here are three reasons why it's still a smart move to buy Amazon stock right now.\n1. It has the third-largest digital ad business in the U.S.\nAmazon is an advertising powerhouse as the No. 3 ad platform, after Alphabet and Meta Platforms. While those are certainly big shoes to fill, Amazon has made impressive gains over the past several years. Consider that Amazon had less than 11% of the U.S. digital market in 2021 and will have an estimated 17% by next year. That's beginning to nip at the heels of Meta's 21% market share.\nAdvertising is also Amazon's fastest-growing business, with ad sales rising 23% in the second quarter to $15.7 billion. Unlike its rivals, Amazon's ad sales have a built-in advantage for the company, as advertisers spend money to sell goods on Amazon's platform, allowing the company to benefit from both the ad sales and the online purchases. And with the U.S. digital advertising market expected to grow into an estimated $220 billion market by 2030, there's still room for Amazon to benefit.\n2. It's tapping into a $2 trillion AI opportunity\nSome people have been disappointed with Amazon's cloud revenue growth lately, but I think they miss the fact that Amazon has the largest cloud computing market share, with 30% compared to Microsoft's 21% and Google's 12%.\nMicrosoft is certainly making lots of ground and shouldn't be ignored. However, the AI cloud computing market will be worth an estimated $2 trillion by 2030, so there's plenty of room for both companies to benefit.\nWhat's more, Amazon is still investing in its cloud computing business and will increase its capital expenditure spending to $118 billion this year, mostly to expand its AI infrastructure.\n3.

Now, they are making a remarkable comeback. Altria Group (NYSE: MO) has posted a 30% total return for shareholders so far in 2025 and is actually beating the market over the last five years.\nInvestors are recognizing the stable cash flows and high dividend yield of this tobacco and nicotine giant, which recently yielded close to 10% but now still has a tidy 6.25% annual payout to shareholders, significantly better than the market average.\nWhile some investors worry about falling volumes for cigarettes in the United States, Altria Group has defied these headwinds and posted consistent dividend growth for shareholders. Does that make the stock a buy today?\nDefying industry headwinds\nCigarette consumption in the United States has been falling for decades and recently worsened in the age of nicotine pouches and electronic vaping devices. This has been a major headwind for tobacco companies, with volumes for Altria's flagship Marlboro brand slipping 10% year over year last quarter.\nDespite this, Altria's smokeable products segment grew its operating earnings 4.4% year over year to $2.9 billion. How? Price increases, along with volume growth for the cigars segment.\nThe company consistently raises the price of its cigarettes sold to retailers, which counteracts volume declines and increases profit margins. These operating earnings are the key driver of consistent free cash flow generation. Even though smoking is on the outs in the U.S., there is plenty of room for the company to raise prices in the face of these volume declines to maintain cash flows.\nBuybacks and dividend optimization\nWhen buying a low-growth stock such as Altria, investors care about dividend income and dividend growth. Today, investors who buy it get a yield of 6.25%, meaning every $10,000 in the stock generates $625 in annual income. Not bad.\nAltria is optimizing its capital returns for increasing its dividend per share over the long haul. It is using cash flow not going to dividends to repurchase stock, which has brought its shares outstanding down by 14% in the last five years.\nRecently, the pace of share repurchases has accelerated, which should further help to increase the dividend per share. With fewer shares outstanding, Altria will be able to maintain a nominal dividend payout while increasing the per-share paid out to remaining shareholders.","content_hash":"bca77f50f9ceb8aa80a9344b679ed43d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2754,"method_rank":0}

Pharmacies can now enroll in the beta version of the program.\nThe system is built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), an open-source blockchain with core development led by Ripple Labs.\nWith a network of more than 6,500 pharmacies and 200 manufacturers, Wellgistics is one of the first healthcare companies to launch an XRPL payment solution at scale. The firm's CEO, Brian Norton, said pharmacy owners have embraced the initiative, calling them more forward-thinking on blockchain than many in the industry assume.\nThe program enables pharmacies to settle invoices over XRPL, though Wellgistics has not disclosed whether participants must hold XRP directly or use fiat-to-XRP conversions for settlement.\nThe program was designed to meet strict compliance standards, including HIPAA and anti-money laundering requirements. After the pharmacy roll-out, Wellgistics plans to extend the platform to manufacturers and test direct-to-patient programs, allowing medications to be shipped from drugmakers directly to patients under physician oversight.\nThe initiative builds on a May 8 announcement that Wellgistics intends to use XRP not just for payments but also as a treasury reserve asset. That plan is backed by a $50 million equity line of credit, which management said would support programmable liquidity and on-demand financial infrastructure across its healthcare network.\nFounded as Wellgistics LLC in 2016, the company was acquired by Danam Health in September 2024 before being spun off through an initial public offering in February 2025. Today, Wellgistics Health operates as a standalone Nasdaq-listed entity, providing wholesale distribution, prescription routing, and AI-powered hub services to pharmacies nationwide.\nShares have dropped more than 80% since the February debut. They closed Tuesday at $0.62, down 7%, before rising to $0.65 in after-hours trading. The company's current market cap is around $47 million.\nBy linking pharmacy payments to the XRP Ledger while preparing to hold XRP on its balance sheet, Wellgistics is aiming to position itself as both a user and financial backer of the blockchain.","content_hash":"24f275afd9b228b57529cca52729416b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2740,"method_rank":0}

The company's shares absorbed the blow by sinking nearly 5% in price, comparing unfavorably to the relatively modest 0.3% slip of the bellwether S&P 500 index.\nReduced to hold\nWell before market open that day, HSBC prognosticator Stephen Bersey lowered his recommendation on Cisco to hold from his previous buy. His price target on the shares is $69 apiece.\nBersey's new take on the tech sector mainstay comes just after the company released its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025. According to reports, the analyst expressed disappointment that Cisco didn't perform better during the quarter, given that its key networking segment had just gotten past several quarters of de-stocking.\nIn his view, the company's fairly tepid full-year fiscal 2026 guidance indicates that the effects of de-stocking might already have been playing out. Bersey did wax optimistic about Cisco's take from components required for artificial intelligence (AI) functionalities, but to him this does not sufficiently compensate for weaknesses elsewhere in the business.\nHigh expectations\nSavvy Cisco investors are well aware that the company has been making a concentrated push into AI, which is likely the reason many of them traded out of the stock post-earnings.\nAfter all, it did manage to increase revenue and non-GAAP (adjusted) profitability -- the former by 8% year over year, landing at almost $14.7 billion, and the latter by 12% to $4 billion. Both figures were higher, if only a bit, than the consensus analyst estimates.\nHowever, any company wading knee-deep in the AI segment is expected to post numbers that are significantly on the upside, and Cisco failed to achieve this.

In fact, one of the best ways to find out the pros and cons of using the artificial intelligence bot to help you plan for retirement is to ask it directly.\nConsider This: 6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early\nLearn More: 4 Affordable Car Brands You Won't Regret Buying in 2025\nHowever, from an objective human standpoint, the best way to approach ChatGPT is to know that while it’s good at compiling research and crunching numbers, it’s not truly a thinking organism. You’ll still have to ask it the right questions and feed it the right data to get a helpful response. Here’s a look at how ChatGPT can help you plan for retirement, and why you need to take its answers with a grain of salt.\nPros of Using ChatGPT for Retirement\nLike any computer- or AI-based tool, ChatGPT is helpful in that it can process information much more rapidly than human beings can. But it’s got additional skills that are helpful in the retirement planning process, as it’s happy to share. According to ChatGPT itself, here are some of its strengths in that department:\n-\nCrunching the Numbers Instantly: ChatGPT can run hypothetical scenarios in seconds. Whether you’re deciding between a Roth and traditional IRA, calculating compound growth or comparing annuity options, the tool can provide detailed projections, often faster than most human advisors.\n-\nSimplifying Complex Concepts: Pension options, tax implications, RMDs and the alphabet soup of retirement planning (IRA, 401(k), HSA, SSA…) can overwhelm even seasoned savers. ChatGPT can break these down into plain language — helping you feel more confident in your decisions.\n-\nBrainstorming Strategies: Want to retire early? Thinking about downsizing, part-time work, or geo-arbitrage? ChatGPT can outline possible paths and what you’d need to make them happen.\n-\nBudget Planning and Expense Tracking: AI tools can help you categorize your expenses, forecast future costs and even simulate inflation’s long-term impact on your lifestyle — a crucial step in retirement readiness.\n-\nStress-Testing Your Plan: ChatGPT can walk you through “what if” scenarios — like a market downturn, unexpected medical costs, or living to age 100 — so you can see if your plan holds up.\nAs you can see from the types of things listed by ChatGPT, the AI bot is excellent at performing calculations, tracking information, running simulations and offering projections. All of these things can be performed by humans, but at a much slower speed — and likely with not-as-impressive results. These are the types of things you can lean on ChatGPT to help you out with.","content_hash":"9a03611ea35a8ac186c329fa5f2dbb96","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2669,"method_rank":0}

Luckily, there are many ways to generate passive income. Some require a little money to start, but others do not require any cash at all.\nKeep reading as we look into four ways you can start generating passive income this week.\nInvesting in Dividend Stocks\nInvesting in the stock market is one of the easiest ways to make passive income quickly. Because most online brokers offer fractional share investing, you can start with very little cash.\n“If you want to generate income from investments, there’s no better way than with dividend stocks or funds,” said Uli Ebensperger, co-founder and CEO of Ziggma Analytics. “Dividend-focused investments give you a chance to earn income through price appreciation and dividend payouts.”\nIt’s important to look beyond the current dividend yield when looking for dividend investments. These can be misleading at times. Instead, look for companies continuously paying out and raising their dividend. For example, Dividend Aristocrat companies have increased their dividend to shareholders in each of the past 25 years. These are solid companies that can help you build a consistent passive income stream.\nRead Next: Passive Income Expert: Here’s How I Make $27,000 Every Week\nSell Your Jewelry\nIf you’re looking for a way to make some extra cash quickly, have you considered selling things you no longer need around your house? If you were to dig through your drawers, I bet you’d find jewelry that hasn’t been worn in years.\nWith gold prices at all-time highs, selling unworn jewelry could be an easy way to earn money. Companies like The Alloy Market make selling jewelry easy and getting paid quickly.\n“Selling gold and jewelry has been a passive income stream for folks for quite a long time,” said Brandon Aversano, founder and CEO of The Alloy Market. “In fact, selling gold has been around for thousands of years. Jewelry with high contents of gold (and silver, platinum or palladium) are worth more today than ever in history.\n“In times of uncertainty and global instability, both banks and consumers turn to gold as a stable method of investment, causing the price of gold to skyrocket and benefitting customers looking to liquidate their items,” he added.","content_hash":"f6c2ab57d6f552cd711910c350582dde","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2668,"method_rank":0}

It's that simple,\" Sumerlin said.\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield — which Trump's team has said the president is monitoring closely — is a major influence on borrowing costs for consumer loans like mortgages as well as corporate debt.\nA further rise in the 10-year would be a tough pill to swallow. The weakest part of the economy at the moment is the housing market, Sumerlin said, adding that the Fed couldn't afford to have the 10-year yield go up.\n\"You can't have the long-end go up. And that's your constraint right now,\" he added.\nIt could also spell bad news for the inflation outlook. If the 10-year yield were to climb as a result of the Fed cutting interest rates, that's a sign bond investors are expecting inflation to rise as the central bank loosens monetary policy, and are pricing in higher rates in over the long term in response.\nTrump has harangued Fed Chair Powell for months over interest rates, demanding the Fed cut despite lingering concerns about higher inflation from tariffs. In posts on Truth Social, he's called the current central bank chief \"Too Late,\" a \"major loser,\" and flirted with the idea of firing Powell, though he clarified earlier this year that he would let him ride out the rest of his term.","content_hash":"22b9af5e295ba55c4def10d4e08716f4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2663,"method_rank":0}

The program was designed to be risk-based, integrated with existing supervisory portfolios, and to ensure that “banking organizations are neither prohibited nor discouraged from providing banking services to customers of any specific class or type, as permitted by law or regulation.”\nThe immediate change aligns with moves by other regulators, such as the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which have relaxed procedural barriers to banks’ involvement in crypto, focusing instead on risk management and compliance.\nThe shift also comes under a political backdrop that has grown markedly friendlier to digital assets. President Donald Trump’s administration has pushed to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.”\nOn August 14, Treasury Secretary Scott Besson announced plans to purchase more Bitcoin and establish a formal U.S. Bitcoin reserve — a move that, alongside Friday’s Fed action, underscores Washington’s pivot toward embracing crypto in the banking sector.","content_hash":"e9d9b9515f72aab36939e10b50d1a1f2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2640,"method_rank":0}

Four tailwinds are driving this move, and they're all going to stay in play for a while, so let's examine each and understand them.\n1. Post-halving scarcity is biting\nBitcoin's fourth halving in April 2024 cut the mining reward to 3.125 coins per block, reducing net new issuance to roughly 450 bitcoins per day. That means less fresh supply is meeting the market. And, fortunately for holders, the supply crunch is taking root just as buyers are looking to make large purchases.\nIn particular, U.S. spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which hold the coin on behalf of their shareholders, have become persistent buyers. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF showed nearly $89 billion in net assets as of Aug. 12, a live proxy for the substantial coin balances held off the market. Persistent inflows across the ETF landscape have repeatedly tightened Bitcoin's floating supply available for public trading.\nThe result is more price sensitivity to each marginal dollar of demand. And, there are new players arriving to the market with plenty of demand.\n2. Corporations, financial institutions, and treasuries are accumulating it\nThe ownership base of Bitcoin is tilting toward entities that tend to buy and hold, which is another major tailwind.\nAs of Aug. 13, there were roughly 1.5 million bitcoins held in ETFs, 935,498 held by public companies, and 517,296 attributed to countries, together representing more than 14% of Bitcoin's supply cap of 21 million.\nOne type of holder stands out. Corporate accumulation is a major driver of the coin's price this year, as companies seek liquidity, collateral value, and brand alignment with a finite asset.\nWhen those long-term owners buy coins, turnover declines, and prices tend to grind higher over time.\n3. Regulatory clarity and policy support are improving rapidly\nThe third tailwind is regulatory clarity.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) for listing and trading in early 2024, establishing a mainstream wrapper with daily liquidity and standard investor protections. Now, those ETPs are quite popular, and the SEC's ongoing rulemaking regarding crypto is helping to give big organizations the confidence they need to buy and hold it, too.","content_hash":"e489d7250735de82f603ae455952c8df","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2626,"method_rank":0}

During the Biden administration, the green energy sector as a whole received something of a break in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, with a slew of tax incentives for building out alternative-energy solutions.\nIn its attempt to reverse this, President Donald Trump has tasked his administration to make the current subsidies harder to obtain. Thankfully for green energy companies, a theoretically influential lobbying group stepped in on Friday to push back against this effort. Numerous solar stocks popped on the news, including First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), which rose a sturdy 11% by market close.\nA mighty lob by a lobbying group\nThe business grouping behind Friday's pushback is the Data Center Coalition. News broke that the coalition sent a formal request to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to maintain the subsidy policy as it is, rather than changing it.\nThe organization -- which lists as members Amazon, Oracle, and CoreWeave, among other prominent tech companies -- told Bessent that any regulatory roadblock limiting green energy solutions will hamper the development of artificial intelligence (AI).\nMany data center operators are currently building out their facilities to handle the vastly increased resource demands of AI. To do so, they require more energy, hence their support of renewable sources like solar.\nDoes the silence speak volumes?\nBessent hasn't yet publicly responded to the coalition's lobbying effort, nor has anyone else in the Trump administration.

Its shares have gained a whopping 231% year-to-date, with the strong share price performance also shifting Cramer’s views about the stock. While earlier during the year, Cramer was skeptical about Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO), he now believes it is a good speculative play to have in one’s portfolio, provided other, non-speculative stocks are also present. Here are his recent thoughts about the nuclear company:\n“Well, I’ve got to tell you, I actually liked them but they were people who wished that they had more contracts. And they referenced the federal government, and you know, they didn’t, I thought it I was good. I happen to like nuke and they’ve got a very, they have a very coherent nuke thing for people who are into speculation, they’re a good spec. . .yeah it’s a very good spec.”\nPreviously, Cramer discussed Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO)’s share price performance:\n“Until this market, I found it very hard to recommend anything… because historically, parabolic moves tend to explode in your face. But you know what? I violated my rule for this market simply because the moves are too big and the opportunities too frequent to pass on all of them.

I felt that the stock’s parabolic run from $21 to $31 was just too steep for me, even as I’m a huge believer in nuclear. Finally, I switched my view and told people to buy it regardless of the parabola because it has just so much going for it. Today, Oklo announced an integrated power solution for data centers, might be worth billions to shareholders. It’s a turnkey solution no one else has. The stock has now doubled since I waived my parabola ban, doubled.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

While this is good news for high-yield savings and money market accounts, ChatGPT warned, “This would make mortgages, car loans, and credit card debt more expensive–burdens that disproportionately affect the middle class.”\nCuts to Social Spending\nAnother concern that ChatGPT pointed out is that to offset tax cuts or new spending initiatives, the Trump administration could pursue cuts to social programs such as Social Security, Medicare or education funding, “which middle-income Americans rely on more than high earners.”\nSome Medicaid “cuts” are already underway as a result of the recently signed One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), which changed eligibility criteria for Medicaid.\nJob Instability in Non-Tech Sectors\nTrump’s economic policies may benefit manufacturing and energy sectors, however, ChatGPT suggested that other sectors, “like education, healthcare, and public service–which employ millions of middle-class Americans–could face instability if funding priorities shift.”\nWhat Can Consumers Do?\nOther than voting or expressing concern to legislators, the only real control consumers have is to change their budgeting, spending and other financial habits.\nChatGPT suggested doing such things as:","content_hash":"03662e83491638b9bdd81f8f7873860a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2553,"method_rank":0}

Even more amazing is that Perplexity is only valued at around $18 billion, as of its last fundraising round. Perplexity claims to have investors that would be able to fund the deal should it get agreed to, but I don't think it will.\nEven though $34.5 billion is a large chunk of change for what appears to be just a web browser, it means far more to Google's ecosystem. I don't think $34.5 billion will be enough, and there are few sums large enough to get CEO Sundar Pichai to even consider an offer.\nAlphabet has other options than selling Google Chrome today\nThe reason why Perplexity offered to buy Google Chrome is simple: A federal court ruled that Google is operating an illegal monopoly in the advertising space, and selling off Google Chrome was one of the remedies that a federal district court is considering.\nIf the final remedy is to sell off Google Chrome, there are still a couple of courts that Alphabet can appeal to, including a federal appeals court and the Supreme Court. We're still a long way from finding out the conclusion of the Alphabet monopoly saga, and for Alphabet to sell Google Chrome this early would be giving up.\nFurthermore, CEO Sundar Pichai and Alphabet haven't shown any interest in selling Google Chrome, and its lawyers argued that forcing a Chrome sale would have potential national security implications.\nWhether that is true or not is beside the point; Google Chrome is an important part of how Alphabet gathers data for ads, and it does not want another company to have control over it. As a result, there's likely no amount of money that Alphabet will agree to sell Google Chrome for unless it has exhausted all other options.\nBut what will happen next?\nA bidding war may erupt over Google Chrome\nIf Perplexity made an offer, you can bet that other generative AI start-ups such as OpenAI will be quick to follow. An OpenAI executive has already testified to the court that it would be open to buying Chrome, and there are likely other companies in a similar position. Although it may be a meaningless bidding war for reasons laid out above, I wouldn't be surprised to see more offers flood in.\nI'd also be shocked if Alphabet actually considered any of them, but anything is possible.","content_hash":"d9140ba2efc84c1032fdb1dc180cbbc9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2552,"method_rank":0}

Traditionally, Bloom Energy had made deals with data center real estate companies, power providers, and utilities.\nHowever, the Oracle deal may be paving the way for more direct deals with other cloud AI companies. Bloom's energy servers are based on fuel cells that can convert natural gas to electricity without combustion, making them a cleaner alternative than other forms of natural gas-based power. So, it's no surprise that with demand for electricity skyrocketing due to the AI data center buildout, Bloom is seeing renewed interest.\nSpeaking with Bloomberg on Wednesday, Sridhar said, \"You have seen the announcement with Oracle -- expect to see similar things coming soon.\" Apparently, hinting at more deals with cloud companies was enough to move the stock significantly higher.\nIn addition to the Bloomberg interview, Bloom may also have benefited from the lower-than-expected inflation reading that came out on Tuesday. Following a lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, economists have greatly increased their odds of a cut to the federal funds rate in September. Usually, interest rates are good for high-growth stocks trading at high multiples, so this could have helped this week's rally as well.\nBloom Energy's rally has made the stock expensive\nBloom currently trades around 6.5 times sales and 82 times this year's earnings estimates, so it's definitely not a cheap stock, especially for a company that basically sells hardware units.\nNevertheless, the company currently finds itself in a fortuitous position amid the AI data center buildout. The question is whether the opportunity is as significant as the stock price suggests.","content_hash":"272cd1079ce11831606ccd09f3147f87","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2551,"method_rank":0}

Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nAlcoholic beverage producer Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ)’s shares have lost 24% year-to-date as they are yet to recover from a massive 17% dip in January. The shares fell at the start of the year after the firm missed analyst revenue and EPS estimates for its fiscal third quarter and cut its fiscal year guidance. Cramer’s previous remarks about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) have discussed the impact of GLP-1 drugs and dropping alcohol consumption on the stock. Here are his latest thoughts:\n“In this country we once had prohibition, I’m beginning to think we now have self-prohibition. There’s a Gallup poll, talking about American self-reported drinking down 54% after consecutive declines. Believe moderate drinking is bad for health. The Gen Zs aren’t drinking. . . .Beer remains America’s favorite booze, I’m not going to go into beer stocks, I think Constellation’s, STZ’s, a terrible stock. . . .Because this is a mocktail era. People are, I mean it really is temperance. And there are a lot of people who feel that even red wine, they finally got rid of that canard. So be careful in the liquor story because its just not getting better, it’s getting worse.”\nCramer wasn’t optimistic about Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) ahead of its latest earnings either:\n“On Tuesday, we get results from former market darling, Constellation Brands. What a fallen idol. There’s so much to unpack here because this consumer packaged goods company is a microcosm of what’s gone wrong with this now pathetic group that used to be the place to go when there’s a slowdown. First: Constellation is an alcohol company, so all their products are being hurt by the GLP-1 drugs, which can blunt your craving for booze.

The deal would partially hinge on Intel continuing with its recently abandoned plans to open a manufacturing hub in Ohio.\nIntel has real strategic importance\nDespite its struggles in artificial intelligence (AI), having lost significant ground to Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, Intel remains strategically important due to its significant domestic manufacturing capabilities, something its rivals lack. Semiconductor fabrication capacity within the U.S. is not something that Trump wants to reduce, one of the few areas in which this administration and its predecessor are in alignment.\nIntel's path to relevance in the uber-crucial AI market is unclear.

Here’s a closer look at what you might expect in benefits at age 70.\nLooking at Benefits\nAs of June 2025, the average Social Security monthly check for retired workers was $2,005.05, according to the Social Security Administration’s Monthly Statistical Snapshot. Kiplinger analyzed SSA information and found the average monthly benefit for retirees at age 70 was $2,176.76.\n“Up to 85% of Social Security benefits may be taxable, depending on income from other sources, such as IRAs or part-time work,” said Shanli Liu, founder of FreedomFolio.\nFor You: 3 Little-Known Social Security Rules That Could Save You Thousands\nWorking on Better Budgeting\nAccording to Liu, one major win when it comes to better retirement budgeting is converting pre-tax retirement funds, such as traditional IRAs and 401(k)s to Roth accounts, in the early retirement years between ages 62 and 70, when income is often at a natural low.\n“This reduces future required minimum distributions and protects Social Security from unnecessary taxation,” Liu said.\nAvoiding Common Pitfalls\nLiu said one common planning pitfall is underestimating how long retirement lasts. “Planning to age 85 is outdated. We plan to age 92 by default, and that extra decade dramatically reshapes how safe a drawdown strategy is.”\nAnother common mistake, according to Liu, is keeping all retirement assets in pre-tax buckets. “Tax diversity matters more than asset diversity once the paychecks stop,” according to Liu.\nMore From GOBankingRates\n-\n3 Luxury SUVs That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Summer 2025\n-\nProven Ways Small Business Owners Are Protecting What They've Built\n-\n7 Tax Loopholes the Rich Use To Pay Less and Build More Wealth\n-\nHere's the Minimum Salary Required To Be Considered Upper Class in 2025\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Social Security: Average Benefits at Age 70 for Middle-Class Retirees","content_hash":"1460f5e6448ae9b912fcfab52b96e0ab","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2497,"method_rank":0}

The stock rose after the firm reported 1.7% in full-year organic sales growth to beat analyst estimates of 1.4% and its operating profit dropped by 0.7% which was lower than the 1.2% drop that analysts had penciled in. Here’s what Cramer said about the movement in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)’s shares:\n“In this country we once had prohibition, I’m beginning to think we now have self-prohibition. There’s a Gallup poll, talking about American self-reported drinking down 54% after consecutive declines. Believe moderate drinking is bad for health. The Gen Zs aren’t drinking. I have to tell you that this is another reason to stay away from the stock of Diageo. Beer remains America’s favorite booze, I’m not going to go into beer stocks. . .But I do think that there has been a little bit of a bounce in Diageo. . .and that’s a good opportunity to exit. Because this is a mocktail era. People are, I mean it really is temperance. And there are a lot of people who feel that even red wine, they finally got rid of that canard. So be careful in the liquor story because its just not getting better, it’s getting worse.”\nPreviously, the CNBC TV host discussed Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO)’s shares and business environment:\n“Oh, okay, you came to the right guy because I’ve been in the bar business, the restaurant business, and the liquor business. I gotta tell you, they all stink. The problem is this: If you’re looking at the alcohol business, the GLP-1s, the new generation of people actually care about their health and wellness, and getting fat. Well, alcohol’s got all three. And don’t forget gummies. Gummies.. very heavy competition. I’d rather own gummies than… Diageo.

Eventually, it expanded onto the commercial side and experienced success there, too.\nIn the second quarter, its commercial and government revenue saw impressive growth, with commercial sales rising 47% year over year to $451 million and government sales increasing 49% to $553 million. This strength allowed the company to deliver its first quarter with $1 billion in revenue, and there's more growth ahead.\nHowever, the stock price already has a ton of growth baked into it, which could be a significant headwind.\nPalantir's stock is far from cheap\nNo matter how you look at it, the stock is expensive.\nAt 281 times forward earnings and 134 times sales, it's likely the most expensive stock on the market.

Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF)’s affordable cosmetics depend on its Chinese supply chain, making the tariff concerns self-explanatory. Cramer remarked on the firm selling cosmetics in Dollar General:\n“[On why ELF was selling its products in Dollar General] Because it’s the last one. The shorts are telling me, not that I listen to the shorts, but the shorts are saying, what’s after Dollar General? Is there anything after?”\nCopyright: antonioguillem \/ 123RF Stock Photo\nHere are his previous thoughts about e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF):\n“What the heck just happened to e.l.f. Beauty? I mean, the last time we got results from this low-cost cosmetics and skincare brand and the stock got eviscerated today, down nearly 10%. You know, we’ve long championed this one. It’s been a great growth stock over the last few years, largely because it offers its customers quality merchandise at incredibly affordable prices. Unfortunately, it can charge low prices because it makes most of its goods in China, which means most of e.l.f.’s products are about to become more expensive. So last night, even though e.l.f. delivered a nice top and bottom line beat, management declined to issue a full year forecast because they really have no idea how the tariff situation’s… going to play out. However, the limited guidance they gave did suggest that their margins are going to take a real hit… Maybe that’s why things got, well, just awry.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of ELF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)’s stock has run into trouble in 2025 as it has gained a modest 2% year-to-date. Investors are concerned about the pace at which the firm’s turnaround efforts are yielding results. In his previous comments about Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), Cramer has defended the firm and its CEO, Brian Niccol. He kept up with the defense this time as well:\n“I have been a huge believer and my charitable trust, I’m talking about this tomorrow at our monthly meeting, that Brian is being sold short. Brian Niccol, because, the throughput was what he had to cure first. It’s kind of like Lip-Bu Tan, he had to, you know, get the balance sheet first. It’s throughput that has to be, and he is fixing throughput. I don’t know when you last time went to Starbucks, but you’re gonna find that they’re four minutes. It used to be like fifteen, twenty minutes. And now it’s four minutes. The airports have been just ridiculous. He even got the service at the airports, which was something that I complained about endlessly.”\nCramer discussed Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) in detail earlier. Here is what he said:\n“Even though the headline numbers were weaker than expected, I found the overall results to be pretty encouraging. Keep in mind, Starbucks has been a long-term holding for my Charitable Trust, not always a good holding, but for the past year, ever since they poached Brian Niccol from Chipotle to take over as CEO, stock’s been doing much better…\nPhoto by nathan-dumlao-6VhPY27jdps-unsplash\nAnd that’s what I found most encouraging about the Starbucks quarter, management’s plan for improving the core business here at home. They’re already showing some really promising results… At the end of the day, nothing else matters for Starbucks if it can’t turn the US business around. Now, they’ve gotten a proven way to make that happen. There was plenty of other positive news too…","content_hash":"c736fcb172e11e41b8933476bba84a55","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2114,"method_rank":0}

And that’s Coach. And you know, wow, I mean they didn’t signal that beforehand. It was kind of, quizzical.”\nPreviously, the CNBC TV show host discussed Tapestry, Inc.

What’s driving the strength? Now, a lot of it’s because the Coach brand keeps getting better and better… Now, why is Coach winning?

Naturally, when his co-host pointed out that Morgan Stanley had added the firm to a list of stocks that would end up suffering because of AI, Cramer was surprised as he commented:\n“Expedia just had a great quarter, what are they talking about?”\nPixabay\/Public domain\nHere are Cramer’s previous thoughts about Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE):\n“Look, travel’s been the biggest engine, okay. It’s been the biggest engine of the economy in the last six months. And you can hurt it. I mean we obviously got, we also had some terrible instances with planes. But you can hurt travel and travel’s really, . . . Someone upgraded Expedia yesterday, saying things were fine. But I do think that when you take the best bull market we have and you put chinks in it, we should then scramble. We scramble. Because we are running out of places that have bull markets.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of EXPE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.
