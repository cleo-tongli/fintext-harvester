At this time, I am pleased to turn the conference over to Stefan Larsson.\nStefan Larsson: Thank you, Sheryl, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call today. I want to start by thanking our teams around the world for delivering a better-than-expected second quarter. We beat our guidance on both the top and bottom line, as we grew revenue 4% on a reported basis, achieved our 1% revenue growth guidance on a constant currency basis, and drove better-than-expected gross margin performance and EBIT margins. Total direct-to-consumer revenue was flat in constant currency, a sequential improvement compared to the first quarter, including a sequential improvement each month throughout the quarter.\nWe grew wholesale revenue by low single digits in constant currency, benefiting from the intake and relaunch of the Calvin Klein women's business in North America. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the full year and raising our reported revenue guidance despite tariff rates effectively doubling and a continued uneven global macro. And for the rest of the year, we have also increased our strategic investments in marketing to generate even higher visibility and customer impact. Since we last spoke, our focus has been to further strengthen our PVH plus execution. And for both brands, this means continuing to strengthen our brand-building consumer flywheel.\nAcross product, marketing, and marketplace execution, we drive performance by leaning into the strong consumer love for our iconic brands, focusing on our biggest product categories, then bringing innovation and newness into our most iconic product franchises, amplifying them through powerful cut-through marketing, and supporting it by next-level execution across all our channels. And we have already made significant progress. Regionally in Europe, we delivered another quarter of positive D2C growth and finalized our Spring 2026 forward-looking wholesale order books up low single digits, marking our second consecutive season of growth. In North America, we drove stronger D2C performance and again drove double-digit EBIT margins.\nAnd in APAC, we exceeded our plan and we started to stabilize the business in key markets. We are also successfully working through the transitory operational challenges we experienced as we set up the Calvin Klein global product capability in New York. Already now for Fall 2025, we are delivering the sequential improvements we set out to achieve. And for the Spring 2026 product season, we have already locked in the important going margin improvements we target, as well as got them back to on time for our deliveries. David and the Calvin team have done a great job making this happen.\nLet me now share concrete examples of the actions we took that drove our performance in the second quarter. And let me start with Calvin Klein. The biggest and most iconic product categories in Calvin Klein are underwear and denim. And this quarter, we further drove powerful growth in both these categories. When we last spoke, we had just launched our spring campaign with superstar Bad Bunny to amplify the newness and innovation in our new men's ICON Cotton Stretch hero product franchise. It's been incredibly successful. And across all regions, this franchise is driving significant commercial impact.\nThe combination of a powerful product category offense, tied to strong product innovation, connected to a cut-through campaign with globally relevant talent, is a repeatable model that we know works. The Bad Bunny campaign has increased brand awareness, driving stronger traffic and conversion. It's also creating a strong halo effect across men's underwear. Sales of our cotton stretch styles were up 14% globally in the quarter, following the 25% growth we delivered last quarter. Building on this success, for this fall, we are bringing that same next-level product innovation and newness to our largest and most successful women's underwear program with the launch of our Icon cotton modal franchise.\nIt will also be supported by a global campaign featuring one of the most exciting global superstars in music. We will again drive commercial impact by activating a full funnel approach across all regions. Next, in denim, we have continued to build on Calvin's strong spring momentum. We focused on newness through 90s styles and fashion fits to capture consumer demand for looser fit silhouettes and delivered 19% growth in fashion denim this quarter. We're also innovating with new tools to drive conversion. And we recently introduced a new lookbook style denim fit guide to make it even easier for consumers to shop their favorite denim look with styling inspiration that captures the iconic Calvin lifestyle.\nLast week, leveraging our proven combination of hero product amplified by mega talent, we launched the denim-focused collection featuring K-Pop Mega Star Menu. Already, we have seen more than doubling of our engagement rate on social media from this campaign with the key denim products featured rising to the number one and two best-selling products in their categories and markets. This is just the beginning of what we believe will be the strongest Calvin Klein fall campaign so far. With a combination of strong product innovation, amplified with a lineup of global mega talent from the world of music and sports, we build relevance and desirability when we connect Calvin's brand DNA to the global cultural conversation.\nAnd this quarter, we have repeatedly done that. We connected the inspirational halo of our Calvin Klein collection to key cultural moments with talent including Dua Lipa, Pedro Pascal, and Aesop Rocky. And we took this to another level when Beyonce wore custom Calvin Klein Collection underwear in her Cowboy Carter show, a moment she shared with her over 300 million followers on Instagram. We are building strong connectivity between collection and our main line to extend the halo that Veronica Leone is creating. You will see this next at our upcoming runway show at New York Fashion Week on September 12.\nFinally, in the marketplace, we are making key investments in stores around the world to bring the full Calvin vision to life for the consumer. Tomorrow, we'll open our newest flagship store in Tokyo, in the center of Harajuku, a hub for youth culture, fashion, and high traffic from both local and international shoppers. The new flagship marks the next chapter in our global retail expansion, in major markets around the world. And later this year, we look forward to opening our next flagship in the heart of Soho, New York, one of the most iconic retail destinations globally. Turning to Tommy.\nThroughout the quarter, we continued to take Tommy's iconic DNA of classic American style with Tommy's unique twist and connecting it to culture and driving strong commercial impact. In the world of sport, Tommy was twenty years ahead of his time in building early partnerships with Formula One. Our latest partnership with Apple Studios took this to the next level with Tommy the brand playing a key part in the global summer blockbuster film, Ep one, the movie. It's already become the highest-grossing sports film in history. And it's also Brad Pitt's highest-grossing film to date. And for those who have seen it, you know that Tommy is impossible to miss.\nTo support this major brand moment, we launched a full funnel global campaign. The movie premiered at the landmark Radio City Music Hall in New York City. And it was incredible to see the iconic Tommy Hilfiger brand on the big screen, embodying the fearless drive and effortless style that define both the sport and the brand. This continued in London, where Tommy was featured on the 3D screen in Piccadilly Circus ahead of the global premiere, contributing to double-digit lifts in both brand perception and net promoter scores in that market. Globally, we have seen an incredible consumer response to our limited edition A Pax GP collection of key Formula One styles, with strong sell-through around the world.\nWe'll continue building on this momentum with Cadillac, as the official apparel sponsor of the Cadillac Formula One racing team, where two of the biggest American icons are coming together to support the first US team on the grid. And staying in the world of sport, as the official lifestyle partner of the US sale GP team, Tommy recently launched a capsule collection which blends high-performance sport and modern style. The partnership is at the heart of Tommy's unique DNA and opens up a new consumer and commercial opportunity for the brand around the world. Throughout the quarter, we executed across the full funnel.\nThis included celebrating the Tommy summer lifestyle through the Hill Figure Resort campaign where our iconic hero product and strong category offense was amplified with top-tier talent including Madeline Klein and Patrick Schwarzenegger. This led to strong sell-throughs across channels for spring and summer 2025 seasons in featured key product categories. Within our summer shop styles, we drove women's wear up 10% globally and men's wear up 3%. We continue to focus on the full Tommy lifestyle by expanding both our core men's and women's business. In men's, we recently expanded into dress casual, an important category in the consumer's wardrobe.\nWe previewed the collection in Milan to more than 350 wholesale partners at PT Ormo, one of the biggest men's fashion events in the world. And we are encouraged by the strong initial selling for spring 2026. Category expansion is an important strength of the Tommy brand. And we are excited for this new category to launch early next year with key wholesale partners globally as well as in premium stores and on tommy.com. In women's, building on the recent collaboration with Sofia Richie Grange, this quarter we launched the TOMMY GIRL capsule, which drove strong sell-through across regions and attracted a younger consumer.\nTommy Girl has been an important feature in pop culture since the nineties, and we are tapping into that deep consumer love for the Tommy DNA. In North America, over half of our capsule purchases were new consumers to the site, and one-third became repeat purchases within thirty days. Looking to the fall season, yesterday, we launched a global lifestyle campaign featuring a cast led by supermodel Claudia Schiffer and Nicholas Hoult, the star of the summer hit film Superman. To maximize amplification, we have increased our marketing investments, which includes a global activation of the full funnel, with multiple high-impact brand moments and sustained product storytelling.\nNow let me turn to our regional performance where we also continue to make strong progress. Starting with Europe, we drove another quarter of total D2C growth, and we delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of store revenue growth. D2C growth was offset by a decline in wholesale, from shipment timing that we mentioned last quarter which benefited the first quarter. While overall revenue was down low single digits in constant currency for the quarter, importantly, we ended the first half with revenue up slightly versus last year. I'm also pleased to share that we drove growth in our wholesale order book for spring 2026, up low single digits compared to the prior year, building on our growth in fall 2025.\nThis performance reflects our ability to further strengthen our product offering season by season, combined with our strong sales teams and wholesale partnerships in the region. Importantly, across the region, our stepped-up execution and product improvements drove growth in our largest category businesses in the quarter. In Tommy, we grew menswear up 3% versus last year, and in Calvin, we grew underwear up 6% versus last year. Turning to The Americas. We grew revenue by low double digits, including above-planned B2C performance across both brands. Our disciplined execution again drove double-digit EBIT margins.\nWe delivered strong growth in our digital channels, supported by a double-digit increase in traffic, fueled by our product strength and cut-through campaigns, and driven by our investments that continue to further elevate the online shopping experience. This quarter, both brands had positive consumer growth across new, retained, and reactivated consumers across our digital platforms. The consumer is choosing iconic products with newness and is showing up in our performance with strong trend improvement across both brands and across our D2C channels as we deliver products that are iconic to our brands with the innovation and relevant newness. We also saw higher sell-throughs of newness with our key wholesale partners.\nWhile there is still uncertainty in the back half of the year tied to tariffs, we are focused on continuing to deliver iconic fashion with newness to our consumers. Moving on to Asia Pacific. For the second quarter, we drove better-than-expected top-line performance, with revenues declining low single digits in constant currency, representing a significant sequential improvement. This was driven by performance in our own channels, high-quality consumer engagement across the full funnel, and strong execution of key holidays. We again won in the big consumer moments such as six eighteen, where we delivered high single-digit GMV growth outperforming our expectations adding to our double-digit GMV growth last year.\nDuring six eighteen, both Calvin and Tommy ranked among the top five international brands on Tmall. The macro remains choppy, through our strong execution, we have started to stabilize performance. This summer, I visited our teams in Japan and Korea and it was incredible to see the brand love we have in these markets. Whether it's Calvin's presence at Hyundai sales Gen C store, or the strength of Tommy's flagship store in Tokyo. Each quarter, we continue to build out the strength of our brands leveraging the combination of our category offense and iconic hero product, amplified with locally relevant talent. We still have significant untapped opportunity to grow our brands in APAC.\nAnd also here, we are increasing our investments in marketing, to activate the full funnel and drive new store expansion. Reflecting our long-term commitment to the region which remains an important growth driver for our global business. Now turning to global licensing. Our licensing revenue, excluding the licenses that we are transitioning, continues to grow. As we have shared before, our large and diversified global licensing business is a key competitive advantage. Our licensing partners help bring our vision to life across multiple complementary categories. And are critically important to how we drive sustainable, profitable growth through the PVH plus plan.\nIn collaboration with our licensing partner, Cody, we are deep into preparations for our biggest fragrance launch since CK one. While we are preparing for the big launch next year, we have already had early success in recent new product launches especially with younger Gen C consumers. In closing, the second quarter marked another step forward on our multiyear journey to unlock the full potential of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and step by step building them into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world. In a choppy macro environment, we delivered by intensifying and expanding the impact of our PVH plus execution. And we are making significant progress.\nWe continue to demonstrate that where we lean in to execute, we deliver. And I'm proud of how the team stepped up execution again this quarter to drive the business forward. The areas we said we were going to lean into last quarter delivered on. While the global macro landscape continues to evolve and remain uncertain, we are focused on what's within our own hands. Is building our brands and business for the long term. We continue to take concrete action to build on the momentum we created in the first half, to drive our performance in the back half. Continuously learning and improving to become stronger and stronger over time.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Zac.\nZac Coughlin: Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, this quarter we took another step forward on our multiyear journey to build Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger into the most desirable lifestyle brands in the world, delivering or exceeding expectations across all key financial metrics for the second quarter. In Q2, we delivered another quarter of revenue growth. We drove a sequential improvement in year-over-year gross margin percent and continued our strong SG&A discipline. And while our EPS for the quarter was lower than last year, it was better than expected.\nAs we look forward, we are reaffirming our full-year guidance for constant currency revenue, operating margin, and EPS in spite of new tariff rates, which have effectively doubled since our last call. I will now discuss our second quarter results in more detail and then move on to our outlook. Revenue for the second quarter was up 4% on a reported basis, and up 1% on a constant currency basis. Starting from a regional perspective, our EMEA business was up 3% on a reported basis, and down 3% in constant currency for the quarter. In constant currency, we delivered growth in the direct-to-consumer business, which was up slightly, and notably, sales in our retail stores were up mid-single digits.\nThe fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our wholesale business was lower by mid-single digits reflecting the timing shift to Q1 of this year, that I discussed last quarter. And looking at the first half overall for EMEA, which normalizes for the wholesale timing effect, our total EMEA business was up slightly in constant currency driven by growth in the direct-to-consumer business, and wholesale revenue in line with the prior year. In our Americas business, revenue was up 11% driven by double-digit growth in wholesale, which includes the impact of Calvin Klein women's sportswear and jeans wholesale transition in-house.\nAs I discussed last quarter, the wholesale shipments this year were planned to reflect a more balanced first half-second half weighting versus last year when shipments were more heavily weighted to the back half. Direct-to-consumer revenue in The Americas was flat, a sequential improvement versus Q1. We delivered double-digit growth in our digital commerce business, which marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, fueled by the investments we've made to elevate the online consumer experience. And while stores were down low single digits for the quarter, we delivered a sequential improvement compared to Q1 exited the quarter with modest sales growth in July.\nRevenue in our Asia Pacific business was down 3% on a currency basis, a significant sequential improvement compared to the first quarter. Growth in our owned and operated digital commerce business was more than offset by declines in the wholesale business and in our stores, reflecting the choppy consumer environment in the region particularly in China. And while direct-to-consumer revenue in China was down compared to last year, we saw a sequential improvement in our bricks and mortar stores compared to the first quarter and drove growth in our digital commerce business. Revenue for Asia Pacific business was down 1% on a reported basis.\nIn our licensing business, revenue was down 3% versus last year, more than explained by the previously mentioned transition of Calvin Klein women's sportswear and jeans in-house. Turning to our global brands, Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 4% as reported and flat in constant currency, Calvin Klein revenues were up 5% as reported and up 3% in constant currency. From an overall PVH channel perspective, our direct-to-consumer revenue was up 4% as reported and flat in constant currency. A sequential improvement over the prior quarter. Sales in our retail stores were up 4% as reported and flat on a constant currency basis, driven by mid-single-digit growth in EMEA, offset by low single-digit declines in each of Americas and APAC.\nSales in our owned and operated e-commerce business were up 3% as reported and flat in constant currency, as strong growth in Americas and APAC was offset by a decline in EMEA. Total wholesale revenue was up 6% as reported and 2% in constant currency, which reflects the previously mentioned transition of Calvin Klein women's sportswear and jeans in-house. In the second quarter, our gross margin was 57.7%, a decrease of 240 basis points compared to last year, but better than planned, largely due to a delayed impact of tariffs.\nAs we have discussed previously, approximately 50 basis points of the decrease was the impact of our North America license transitions, and in Q2, gross margin reflected the initial early impact of tariffs of approximately 20 basis points. The remaining 170 basis point decrease was largely a continuation of the three main factors we felt in Q1, including higher promotions, the mix of shipments and wholesale, has a negative impact on gross margin, but not our overall profitability, and the impact of Calvin Klein product shipment delays.\nSG&A spending was down in constant currency and SG&A as a percent of revenue improved 140 basis points versus last year, to 49.5%, reflecting our strong cost discipline and our growth driver five actions. EBIT for the quarter was $178 million and operating margin was 8.2%. Earnings per share was $2.52 reflecting a negative impact of 6¢ related to tariffs, and a positive impact of 16¢ related to exchange. Interest expense was $22 million and our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%.\nAs a reminder, our earnings per share of $3.01 in the second quarter last year included a benefit of approximately $0.55 related to the favorable settlement of a multiyear international tax audit, which drove our tax rate to 0% for last year's quarter. Absent this benefit, Q2 2024 EPS would have been $2.46. Inventory at quarter-end was up 13% compared to Q2 last year, including a 1% increase due to tariffs, and reflects a planned improvement compared to up 19% in Q1. The rest of the increase in the current quarter was primarily due to a purposeful investment in best-selling core product categories, and an increase to support our projected sales in the third quarter.\nAvailability also improved across all regions and channels, as we make strategic investments in the most essential styles. Our inventory is fresh and current, and we remain on track to land the year with inventory aligned to our sales plan, excluding tariffs. And now moving on to our outlook. We are encouraged by our Q2 results, which we also recognize there continues to be significant uncertainty around global trade policy and the impact on the broader macroeconomic environment and consumer spending behavior. Our outlook is based on our best assessment of current conditions and currently announced tariff levels.\nStarting with the third quarter, we are projecting revenue to be flat to a slight increase on a reported basis and down slightly on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Our revenue outlook for the third quarter reflects the impact of wholesale shipment timing in The Americas I spoke of earlier with this year reflecting a more balanced first half, second half weighting versus last year when shipments were more heavily weighted to the back half. Overall for The Americas, we are planning revenue up low single digits with growth in wholesale and DTC sales approximately flat. In EMEA, we expect continued growth in DTC and wholesale approximately flat.\nAnd in Asia Pacific, expect revenue to decline by low single digits in line with the second quarter. We are expecting third quarter gross margin to decline approximately 175 basis points versus the prior year, a sequential improvement compared to the first half trend as we begin to stabilize the Calvin Klein operational challenges we have discussed previously. Our gross margin guidance includes an unmitigated tariff impact of approximately 80 basis points, partially offset by the impact of planned mitigation actions. The impact of tariffs, we felt much more heavily in the fourth quarter given when new rates take effect and the timing of sell-through.\nWe expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be up approximately 75 basis points compared to last year. As Stefan mentioned, we are investing more into marketing in the third quarter to capitalize on key consumer moments, and to support our brand-building cut-through campaigns amplified by mega talent. And at the same time, our growth driver five actions will continue to deliver efficiencies. Overall, we are projecting third quarter operating margin to be approximately 8% down approximately 250 basis points compared to last year. Earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $2.35 to $2.50.\nOur tax rate for the third quarter is estimated at approximately 25%, higher than our tax rate projection for the full year due to timing items, and interest expense is projected to be approximately $22 million. And now moving on to the full year. We remain on track to deliver the overall business outlook we shared last quarter, despite the recently announced incremental tariffs on goods coming into The US. We are reaffirming our full-year constant currency revenue guidance of flat to increase slightly, our operating margin outlook of approximately 8.5%, and our EPS outlook in the range of $10.75 to $11.\nOur guidance reflects an incremental tariff impact compared to our prior outlook and increased marketing investments, which are being offset by the impact of favorable exchange. We expect the tariffs currently in place will have an overall net negative impact on our earnings in 2025, including an approximately $70 million unmitigated impact to EBIT, or approximately $1.15 per share, compared to previous guidance of $65 million and $1.05 per share. We expect to mitigate some of these costs through strategic actions in the second half of the year and fully mitigate the impact over time, but for this year, some we will need to absorb. The net impact of the tariffs and these mitigation actions are embedded within our guidance.\nWe are confident that we are well-positioned to navigate the fluid tariff situation. We have a strong, globally diversified revenue base, with 70% of our revenues coming from outside The US. We work closely with an established network of global sourcing partners across more than 30 countries, and we continue to leverage our deep long-standing relationships to further optimize our sourcing and production costs. We are evaluating and actioning a variety of steps looking at every point along our value chain to mitigate the impact over time.\nOn the top line, while we are reaffirming our constant currency revenue guidance, we are now projecting reported revenue to increase slightly to low single digits reflecting the favorable impact of exchange compared to our previous guidance of flat to a slight increase. Regionally, our revenue outlook remains unchanged. Europe is planned to return to growth, in The Americas, we are planning revenue up mid-single digits, including the positive impact of the Calvin Klein women's sportswear and jeans wholesale transition in-house. And in Asia Pacific, revenue is planned down mid-single digits in constant currency.\nWe continue to expect gross margin to decrease approximately 250 basis points versus last year with the incremental headwind from increased tariff rates offset by the improvements we realized in the second quarter. On SG&A, we continue to expect expense to be lower in constant currency in 2025 compared to 2024, our SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease approximately 100 basis points reflecting significant cost savings connected to our growth driver five actions. These actions will simplify our operating model to drive more efficient ways of working, focus on our global technology stack, our global distribution network, our operating model in Europe, and our support functions.\nAnd through the end of the second quarter, we have already made meaningful progress in each of these areas. We continue to expect these actions to deliver 200 to 300 basis points of operating margin expansion over time with nearly 200 basis points of that benefit expected to be realized in the fourth quarter by the actions we have completed to date. Interest expense is now projected to be approximately $80 million, and our tax rate for 2025 continues to be estimated at approximately 22%.\nBefore we open up for questions, I just want to conclude by saying that while we are navigating a dynamic and uncertain macroeconomic environment, within that backdrop, we continue to focus on taking proactive measures on what is within our control, and making progress in all dimensions of the business through our execution of the PVH plus plan. Building momentum into 2026 to deliver sustainable and increasingly profitable growth for the long term. And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, if you would like to ask a question, once again, to ask a question, please press the star and one on your telephone keypad. We'll take our first question from Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you so much. Stefan, just interesting to hear you talk about, you know, marketing investments. What are you seeing that drove that? And Zac, one for you. How do you think about marketing investments in the shape of the P&L? Thank you.\nStefan Larsson: Thanks, Jay. And yes, as I shared in my prepared remarks, the step up in execution in Q2 combined with our increased strength in product where we were able to lean into our biggest categories, most iconic categories, and then drive product innovation within our biggest franchise within those categories and then amplify that with our unique approach to market. And that's why you see our investments, we come up in the back half. Because we are, for the back half, continue to build on the momentum you saw in Q2.\nSo you will see in Calvin Klein, you will see us leaning into the iconic strength of two of the biggest categories underwear, denim, build immense on the Bad Bunny, positive Bad Bunny product innovation, Bad Bunny amplified effect we had in the spring. Will continue in the fall. I believe we have the biggest and strongest lineup of global mega talent to do that in men's and in women's. So what you will see also is the same approach as we took with men's underwear and put innovation in our biggest franchise. We do the same in women's. And if you look at Tommy, you have there are two ways we do it.\nOne is strengthening the seasonal campaigns full funnel. And you saw yesterday we just launched our fall campaign. And then for Tommy, we also have the lifestyle collaborations with Formula One. So very successful on the F1 movie collaboration. And then now building into the F1 with Cadillac. And then we have the sale GPs like Formula One racing on water. So but it's leveraging the strength of the product with the strength of the cut-through marketing and doing that full funnel. And that gives us the confidence to invest more than what we had planned.\nZac Coughlin: Yeah. Hi, Jay. Thanks for the question. You know, on the second half in terms of SG&A continue to make significant progress. On our value driver five actions we've previously talked about. We've committed to delivering two to 300 basis points of improvement over time with 200 basis points of that exiting this year. That's all on track. And including in Q2, we saw significant SG&A leverage with over 100 basis points coming from these actions. As we then look into Q3, those savings continue, but as Stefan mentioned, we are also investing in marketing to build that momentum for the second half and for holiday.\nSo we will see deleverage in SG&A in Q3, but that's more than by that increased marketing spending. Then by the time we get to Q4, we back leveraging the SG&A, as we finish up delivering that 200 basis points on the value driver five that we had committed earlier this year by the end of the year.\nJay Sole: Got it. Super helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Binetti: Thanks for taking our question. Let me ask on tariffs. So I'm curious, it seems like your guidance in the third quarter lets us get to about 280 basis points of pressure in gross margin. In the fourth quarter, Zac, you said that's the tariffs start the timing of tariffs starting to show up. And you gave us a sense of the unmitigated tariff pressure. I'm curious how we should think about that rolling into 2026. Or is the tariff impact to grosses continuing to accelerate and then you have some more time to think about mitigation efforts maybe how you balance that, what levers you can pull as you roll into 2026.\nOr a reasonable time to get to neutral you said you plan to offset them over time. And then just a quick update on the outlets. I think you said you know, the outlet traffic was down double digits earlier in the year. Usually, when we see the dollar weekend like this, it helps with tourism. Obviously, there's some political things going on right now that might disrupt normal flows. Maybe just help us think about how you're looking at the outlets as we think about the back half.\nStefan Larsson: Yes. Thanks, Michael. So let me start on the on let me start where you ended on the on the outlet traffic. So we saw traffic sequentially improve. From Q1 to Q2, including the outlet traffic. So that's encouraging. When it comes to the tariffs, before I hand it over to Zac for more of the technical answer, on the highest level, tariffs are impacting everyone in our sector. But we have 70% of our revenues coming from our international business. So that's with a very large diversified supply chain coming with that. Also have the strength of being Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. So we have two of the most iconic beloved premium brands in the market.\nAnd through the PVH plus plan, that we have for a number of years now executed very disciplined on, we are driving relevance into our iconic beloved brands. Product strength, consumer engagement strength, strength in the marketplace execution. So that is all to drive increasingly profitable growth, like growth with pricing power. So that's from a strategic perspective on how to navigate the tariffs really important to have that kind of brand strength and deliver that value, increased value to the consumer. When it comes to tactically here and now, just like all of our competitors, we are working through how to best mitigate the tariffs in a way that keeps our competitive positioning.\nAnd in doing that, we assess and you will hear Zac share more details, but we assess every part of the value chain. And it's still early, but we are well positioned to work through this in a competitive way. So, Zac, do you mind taking it one step?\nZac Coughlin: Absolutely. Thanks, Michael, for the question. You know, with a diverse and resilient supply chain, we've successfully navigated through many disruptive times before. And so we're confident in our ability to manage to this very dynamic environment also. We'd previously communicated that we'd mitigate approximately 50% of the cost of the prior cost in 2025 with more over time. With the newly announced rates coming in for Q4 for us around two times higher than we previously had talked about, we do see that mitigation cost being percentage being a little bit lower for 2025. But most importantly, we expect to continue to expand on our mitigation efforts through the strategic actions throughout 2026.\nYou know, Stefan mentioned we feel really good about the premium positioning of our brands, and we'll continue to look at all levers across the entire value chain to mitigate the impact. This includes continuing to prioritize supply chain internal efficiencies first. And any pricing actions we take will be targeted. Based on where we have pricing power. That's really important and always being sure to balance that price value for the consumer.\nMichael Binetti: Thanks a lot for the help, guys.\nStefan Larsson: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrooke Roach: Good morning, and thank you for taking our question. Stefan, can you give us an operational update on your transformation within Calvin Klein? As you look ahead into 2026, what are the opportunities for improved execution in North America and globally?\nStefan Larsson: Yeah. Thanks, Brooke. So pleased to share this quarter as a follow-up to last quarter when we flagged the operational challenges we had in the first season of setting up the Calvin Klein global product capabilities in New York. So I'm pleased to share that what we set out how we set out to get through that. Is what we have delivered on during this quarter. So if you look at Fall 2025, we have made the sequential improvements from spring that we set out to do. If you look at Spring 2026, we have already secured the go-in margin improvements we targeted to get back. And we are on time for the deliveries.\nSo from there, we are back fully back on track. So David and the Calvin team have done a really, really good job working through that and coming back why we're setting up these capabilities and why it was worth it is because it will pay off for many years to come. We now have the a strong global product engine for both Calvin and Tommy for each of the global brands. Serving our regions. So feel very good about how we work through it.\nBrooke Roach: Great. Thanks so much. Best of luck going forward.\nStefan Larsson: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So, Stefan, maybe in The Americas, could you break down the drivers of the sequential improvement at direct to consumer? Relative to trends that you've embedded for the back half? And then in Europe, could you just elaborate on the composition of your fall '25 order book and initial indications for spring 2026?\nStefan Larsson: Yes. So thanks, Matt. So encouraging to see the improved D2C trends in North America. Both they would they were driven both they were both significant and sequentially improved from Q1. And three main drivers behind that. So first, we were able to leverage the increased strength in product across both Tommy and Calvin. And then we were able to amplify that product strength with the improved marketing. And the way that we improved marketing in North America and each of the regions play a really important role is yes, you need to have the culture campaigns from each of the brands, which we now have.\nBut then what North America did and the other regions also did in the quarter was they expanded the mid-funnel in the marketing. So if you look at marketing from top of funnel where you have Bad Bunny, and awareness driving, and then you have mid-funnel, which is the product storytelling, the increased consideration. You take the aspirational strength, that you create with a product innovation and Bad Bunny and then you make it shoppable. And that part was really expanded and really drove engagement with the consumer. So the third part was how we then drove new consumers at a growth rate we haven't seen before.\nWhich drove retained consumers up and we reactivate more consumers than we did prior. So it's a combination of the strength of the product, strength of the marketing, full funnel expansion, and then an increase consumer and end customer focus. So really well done and that is something that's repeatable and systematic that we will continue to build out. Yes. And then Europe. Thanks, Zach. Europe, when it comes to the order books, really exciting to see. So you look at fall, we started to grow the order books in Europe. Again, after our quality of sales initiatives. And we do that because of the strength in products across the board in both Calvin and Tommy.\nAnd in Calvin, it's, of course, driven by the strength of underwear and denim. And in Tommy, it's more across the lifestyle. You see the polos, the cable knits, the outerwear, so strength in order books across the board in Tommy. And for spring, we were able to continue to build on that strength. And it's the reason why we are able to drive growth in the forward-looking order books for Spring is same reason as we drove it for fall. That is a continuation of strengthening the product based on our key growth categories, based on putting more innovation into the product, and our partners seeing and recognizing that.\nSo very well done by Fredrik and the team in Europe.\nMatthew Boss: It's great color. Best of luck.\nStefan Larsson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Group. Dana, your line is open.\nDana Telsey: Good morning, everyone. Sorry. I the mute button was on. Morning, everyone. So thank you for taking the question. As you think about your business, 70% international versus domestic, what are you seeing in the different promotional trends overseas versus here in The US? And then, Stefan, you noted the new store in Tokyo. What l we've heard about other enhancements being made to the store portfolio. What should we be looking forward to with SoHo and perhaps other stores beyond outlets? Thank you.\nStefan Larsson: Yeah. Thanks, Dana. And let's start with your question around a consumer across the world. So as everyone else in North America, we have the uncertainty in the back half of tariffs. We don't yet know how the consumer will respond. What we do know is every improvement we put into the desirability of the iconic strength of our brands, will resonate with the consumer. And in Europe, we see the backdrop and the consumer remains stable. We have seen that for a number of quarters.\nAnd in APAC, we continue to see a choppy backdrop but exciting to see in Q2 that us leaning into the relevance, the strength of the brand, product, marketing, very strong execution in the channels in APAC, we have stabilized our performance there and sequentially significantly improved it. Second question was relating to stores. So very exciting today and tomorrow we open our Harajuku flagship store in Tokyo. So it's one of the most important brand building locations for APAC and for us globally. And for anyone in our sector globally. We have the biggest store the most exciting brand expression of Calvin Klein. So David is there with the team.\nOperator: And we are back in session.\nDana Telsey: And ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain on the line.\nStefan Larsson: Can you hear us?\nOperator: And I can hear you loud and clear. Please resume with your presentation.\nStefan Larsson: Good question. Dana, are you still there?\nDana Telsey: I'm still here. Yes. It was about the stores you were getting to.\nStefan Larsson: Yeah. Where Yeah. Where did they cut off on us there anyway? You cut off about Harajuku that the team is over there now.\nZac Coughlin: Alright. Alright. I think even though I'm excited about Harajuku and our flagship stores, I wanna make sure I don't take you through it twice. But yeah, Harajuku opens tomorrow. It's our biggest and best flagship expression for Calvin so far. It's a really important location. Not only for Japan, but for APAC and for us globally to build the brand relevance. So what to your point opens at the end of the year, and same there, really important shopping destination also for our global consumers coming into New York to experience the brand. Very exciting. And then in parallel to the flagships, what we really lean into is the renovations of our fleet.\nSo we are getting everything set up to over the next three years. Renovate and upgrade the majority of our fleet. Globally. So more on that later.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nStefan Larsson: Thanks, Dana. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Guys, us. Sounds like it may have cut off again. And, Tom, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. And once again, Tom, can you please unmute your phone? Your line is open. Please proceed with your question.\nTom: Hey. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hope hopefully, you can hear me. Yes. I want to ask about the North American wholesale environment. You know, think a lot of brands have talked about a lot of caution for the second half. From their wholesale partners. Have you know, seen any incremental, caution from your wholesale partners in North America? And, you know, is there any impact on the insourcing of the of the G3 license you know, based on the on the wholesale environment. Thanks.\nStefan Larsson: Yeah, thank you. So let's start with first half or second quarter in Wholesale North America. We had a benefit of the intake and relaunch of the Calvin Klein women's sportswear and jeans businesses. As you mentioned, then what you also see from the second quarter is that we grow with our most important full price partners. And then thirdly, there is a normalization of wholesale shipment across first half second half. So Zac, do you want to say a few words around?\nZac Coughlin: Yes, of course. The last year we had a lighter weighting of shipments in the first half in wholesale than normal. A little bit heavier in the second half. As we moved into 2025, we've normalized that to a historical trend. So first half and second half are relatively normal. So what we see is in the first half of the year, a little bit of a stronger amount of growth in the front end. We'll see that normalize in second half a little bit lower, in third quarter.\nStefan Larsson: Alright. So with that, apologize for any tech difficulties. Hope you heard most of the call. We are on a multiyear journey to build Calvin and Tommy into their full potential. Quarter by quarter, step by step, you'll see us add strength, desirability, and engaging our consumer and leaning into that brand love and expanding our PVHX. So Q2 was an example of that. We continue heads down executing on the plan and look forward to update you next quarter.\nZac Coughlin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

With that, let me now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. Huazhi Hu. Please go ahead, Mr. Hu.\nHuazhi Hu: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report on our strong performance this quarter. We successfully delivered 68 units of our EH216 series, generating total revenues of RMB147 million, representing 44.2% year-over-year growth and a 4.6 times rebound from last quarter, clearly demonstrating the continuous market demand and our robust operational momentum. Our order book in this quarter also reflected strong momentum with new orders of over 150 units for the EH216 series, again demonstrating robust market interest and confidence in our products. These orders will be fulfilled in batches in the coming quarters.\nToday, there are more than 40 dedicated operation sites across China of the EH216 S, with coverage continuing to grow, highlighting our expanding commercial momentum. In 2025, the EH216 S completed over 10,000 safe flights without a single incident, underscoring its proven safety and reliability. This exceptional safety record not only reinforces our reputation but also establishes a solid foundation for scaling up commercial operations in the future. Two certified operators, Guangzhou EHang General Aviation and Hefei Hei Aviation, have already commenced a trial commercial operation of human-carrying flights in Guangzhou and Hefei. They aim to officially open the service to the public within the year, offering more people the opportunity to experience pilotless eVTOL flights.\n2025 marks a landmark year at the beginning of commercial eVTOL operations in China. As the industry pioneer and first operator of pilotless human-carrying eVTOL, we understand that building a commercial aviation operation goes beyond technology. It demands a robust safety framework, seasoned operational teams, and comprehensive expertise. That's our focus for this year, setting standards, building operational models, and cultivating talent. We are confident that this foundational approach will drive the company's long-term sustainable growth. Turning to our supply chain, as a leading participant in the low-altitude economy of the eVTOL ecosystem, EHang Holdings Limited has adopted a strategy of multi-channel collaboration and diversified deployment.\nWe continue deepening joint R&D with top-tier upstream partners to consistently enhance the performance and reliability of our aircraft. For instance, with respect to our propulsion system, we deepen our partnership with Goshen, Hitec, and Jueen, teaming up to develop a customized cylindrical battery solution leveraging their advanced 46 series cells. These batteries are known for their high energy density, robust power output, and versatility. This new system is designed to improve the EH216 series with longer range, better power output, and greater safety. Going forward, we plan to extend this partnership to more of our eVTOL models, working with Goshen High-tech to build power solutions that are more reliable, efficient, and eco-friendly.\nIn the area of airframe systems, in July, we entered a strategic partnership with Mint Group, a global leader in automotive exterior and structural components. Mint serves over 70 major auto brands worldwide with a strong supply chain and exceptional R&D and manufacturing capabilities. Together, we will co-develop high-safety airframe solutions for EHang Holdings Limited's eVTOL products. These include scalable production of lightweight cabin components and advanced human-machine interface systems. Through these collaborations, we can streamline airframe production at scale and build a more integrated, efficient supply chain for the low-altitude aviation ecosystem. On the product front, we continue ramping up our R&D and innovation efforts, enriching our product lineup and upgrading performance.\nOur VT35, a long-range lift and cruise pilotless passenger eVTOL, is a key focus this year. Flight tests are progressing very well, and we plan to debut the VT35 in September. While the EH216 is ideal for intercity operations, the VT35 is designed specifically for intercity travel. Both aircraft are essential elements in delivering a holistic air mobility ecosystem. We are also accelerating the path to industrializing VT35 through deepened collaboration with the local government. Recently, we expanded our collaboration with the Hefei municipal government, signing a strategic cooperation agreement to establish the VT35 series product hub in Hefei. This hub will integrate R&D, manufacturing, airworthiness certification, supply chain management, sales and operations, and training.\nThe Hefei government plans to support EHang Holdings Limited with approximately RMB500 million through aircraft orders, investments, and industry ecosystem development, all aimed at building out a robust low-altitude economic ecosystem. On the R&D front, we remain committed to collaborating with leading academic institutions to advance critical technologies in the low-altitude economy. In July, we established the Tsinghua University EHang Joint Institute for Low Altitude Aviation Technology with Tsinghua University. This follows the February launch of the Aerospace and Intelligent Manufacturing Committee of the Tsinghua University Guangzhou Alumni Association.\nBy combining Tsinghua's academic research capabilities with our practical expertise in developing and commercializing low-altitude aircraft, the joint institution is designed to accelerate innovation, foster emerging talent, and expedite the industrial transformation of this emerging sector. As a pioneer in this industry, we not only focus on product and technology innovation but also actively participate in shaping regulatory and safety standards. We have contributed to CAAC's eVTOL airworthiness standards, led the drafting of the Vertiport technical requirements, and helped to promote low-altitude data security guidelines. Our deep involvement spans multiple key areas, including airworthiness certification for civil unmanned aerial vehicles and propulsion systems, Vertiport technology requirements, operational safety regulations, training systems, and operational service standards.\nThese efforts not only underscore our leadership in technology and application but also reinforce our deep commitment to building a safe, standard-driven, and sustainable commercial development of the low-altitude economy industry. In the second half of this year, we have refined our strategy. Instead of accelerating order deliveries, we are placing top priority on providing support services to our existing customers, ensuring that the eVTOL aircraft they have purchased can enter safe, orderly, and regular commercial operations. It's not that we lack orders or production capability. In fact, we have both. In aviation, haste can undermine safety and sustainability. We believe in displaying long-term value creation rather than chasing short-term gains.\nOur goal is to establish a proven, scalable business model, one that defines a new chapter for pilotless eVTOL and sets the foundation for enduring success. We firmly believe that safety, regulatory compliance, and innovation are the cornerstones of leadership in this rapidly developing market. We will continue to advance steadily and lead the industry towards scalable, sustainable commercialization. I will now hand it over to our COO, Zhao Wang, for operational updates. Thank you, Mr. Hu. We were able to quickly turn the backlog of customer demand in Q1 into actual deliveries in Q2.\nWhile Q1 presented headwinds, our performance rebounded strongly in Q2, both in terms of our orders fulfilled and revenue, bringing us back on a healthy growth trajectory. We are also seeing our customer base continue to expand. This quarter, we delivered aircraft to 13 enterprise clients across China from Guizhou, Jilin, Jiangxi, Hainan, Gansu, and Yunnan, and more areas, as well as to an international client in Japan. This growing global confidence in our pilotless eVTOL solutions continues to broaden our market presence and strengthen our operational footprint. In the second quarter, new orders also picked up significantly.\nWe received new orders for more than 150 units of the EH216 series, including from Ansheng City, Guizhou Tourism Group, Jilin Zichengchun, Jingyie High-tech Zone, Ansheng City, and Jiangxi Air, Gangpo Low Altitude Economy Company, and the Fuma Group in Lingao, Hainan. These orders will be fulfilled in planned and phased deliveries. This strong demand highlights the rapid expansion of China's low-altitude economy and demonstrates EHang Holdings Limited's growing competitive edge. At the same time, we are supporting our regional clients to prepare eVTOL operations that are tailored to their local environments, whether it's in scenic areas, urban centers, islands, high altitude, or cold weather regions, helping design deployment plans that reflect each location's unique climate and terrain.\nOur goal is to enable diverse use cases such as low-altitude sightseeing, urban air transport, and emergency response across a wide range of real-world scenarios. In 2025, we completed over 10,000 flights across multiple scenarios in different regional settings, further validating our operational readiness. With the deployment of China's economy, eVTOL applications are becoming increasingly diversified. In particular, the demand for emergency management use cases and smart city management, such as firefighting, rescue, logistics, and surveying, is growing gradually. Local emergency authorities across China at all levels have begun conducting tests and drills using low-altitude aircraft. To address this emerging low-altitude emergency rescue market, we are accelerating product upgrades and commercialization of emergency rescue aircraft.\nOn June 27, we showcased a new model of the EH216 series for high-rise firefighting in Beijing's Fengshan District, which received strong recognition from government and fire authorities. Further aircraft refinement and flight testing are currently underway. On the operational front, following the issuance of ROC in late March, the operators in Guangzhou and Hefei, EHang General Aviation and Hefei Hei Aviation, have adopted a safety-first, steady expansion approach, gradually transitioning from trial commercial operation of human-carrying flights to safe, stable, and regular commercial operations. To date, both operators have completed over 700 pilotless flights without any incidents or regulatory violations. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our commercial service capabilities.\nWe have begun internal testing of our ticketing system, optimizing the boarding process to improve passenger experience, and are exploring ways to improve efficiency, particularly through dual-body port operations and running an operator training program for EH216S conducted under a CAAC-authorized trial program for large civil unmanned aerial vehicles. In Q3, our two operators will continue increasing flights to collect valuable operational data. Meanwhile, we will remain in close dialogue with the NDRC's Low Altitude Bureau and related regulators. Our goal is to officially launch commercial eVTOL services to the public within this year. Going forward, both operators will add more verticals to build up capabilities for cross-regional and managed operations.\nMeanwhile, route operations from point A to point B are also progressing steadily, with both ferry flights and blast test flights already underway. Simultaneously, we are supporting more of our customers with their operator certificate applications, helping with route design, port planning, and personnel training to build a robust customer service system. Our team has completed the operator training needs assessment, and the training outline has been approved by the regulator. Course development is now fully underway. Once the teaching materials are finalized and submitted for review, operator training and assessment will officially begin. This operator qualification will help address the shortage of skilled personnel and enable more applicants to meet their OC personnel requirements. As Mr.\nHu just mentioned, the key focus for our business this year is the launch of commercial operations. Following a prudent assessment, we have adjusted our 2025 full-year revenue guidance to approximately RMB500 million, up from RMB446.2 million in 2024, reflecting modest growth. This adjustment isn't due to weak demand. It reflects our unwavering commitment to safety and strict alignment with civil aviation protocols. We are investing in the necessary time and effort needed to optimize our commercial operation processes and manage risks effectively, ensuring that our demonstration flights are high quality and scalable.\nFor customers who have already purchased our aircraft, we are dedicating significant resources to offer comprehensive operation solutions tailored to their diverse operating environments, ensuring safe deployment and gradual transition into regular commercial operations. This phased guidance adjustment isn't a step back. It's designed to enable more efficient, sustainable commercial expansion down the line. By building a solid foundation now, we have positioned the company for medium to long-term growth and are preparing to elevate both product sales and revenues to new heights. Meanwhile, we are accelerating our market expansion by partnering with top-tier ecosystem allies.\nIn May, we extended our strategic collaboration with the China Communications Information and Technology Group to include CCCC FHDI Engineering Company, forming a powerful multi-party alliance. We will jointly launch demonstration projects in low-altitude tourism, urban air mobility, and emergency response, aimed at building a three-dimensional infrastructure network to support scalable demonstration models. Our partnership also extends into international markets by delivering CCCC FHDI's exceptional expertise in infrastructure development within complex environments such as coastlines, rivers, and islands. We are co-developing integrated land, water, and air mobility solutions. These solutions are designed to be deployed across Southeast Asia and South Asia.\nIn May and June, we formed strategic partnerships with China Mobile and China Unicom to jointly advance R&D, data platform services, UAV communication technologies, and related application expansion in the low-altitude economy. By combining resources and leveraging complementary strengths, a new UAV management service platform has been deployed, which will significantly enhance safety for low-altitude flights by leveraging real-time data from telecom operator base stations. This quarter, we have made significant progress in logistic applications, partnering with 1E Tianxia, Zhuhai Aviation Company. Our VT20 series logistic eVTOL completed the first long-range intercity cargo flight in the Greater Bay Area, covering 83 kilometers between Zhuhai and Guangzhou in about 55 minutes.\nThe route reduced transport time by up to an hour compared to road transportation, demonstrating a significant improvement in logistic efficiency. The VT20 series has now operated safely for over a year in the Wanchan Archipelago, gradually establishing a comprehensive land-to-island and inter-island drone logistics network across the region. On the manufacturing front, while expanding the Yunzhou production base, EHang Holdings Limited is also planning new facilities in Fangshan, Hefei, and Weihai to serve different regional functions, including assembly and production of passenger, logistics, and emergency response aircraft to cover different regions across China. This layout will enable localized production and delivery based on the product type and customer location. Internationally, we continue to extend our global presence.\nIn the second quarter, the EH216 has completed demo flights in Mexico, Indonesia, and The Dominican Republic. These bring our global eVTOL flight footprints to 20 countries. After this year's Paris Air Show, our flagship EH216 has captured global attention not only from aviation professionals but also from ICAO council members. During the show, EHang Holdings Limited signed strategic MOUs with two partners, ANRA Technologies and FADEA, Argentina's national aerospace manufacturer. We will jointly advance digital aerospace infrastructure development and localized certification across Europe and Latin America.\nIn Q2, we completed the test flights for the EU's U-SAVE project at our European UAM center and renewed our flight permit for our Spain UAM operation center, ensuring continued progress of trial operations in Europe. In Latin America, we joined the region's largest aerospace expedition in Mexico, where we also showcased successful demo flights. We also held a tri-party meeting with the CAAC and the Mexican Civil Aviation Authority to advance validation of type certification for the EH216S. Meanwhile, we are pursuing type certification in Brazil and a special flight permit in Chile. In The Middle East, the EH216S has received a human-carrying flight approval in Qatar, and we are now preparing routes and aircraft deployment.\nWe also signed a strategic partnership agreement with Turk Telekom and are planning the first demo flight in Turkey. In Southeast Asia, we made significant progress with the Thai regulators advancing commercial operations. We plan to run trial flights in Bangkok and Pattaya area under a regulatory sandbox program while preparing for future trial commercial operations in the designated airspace. Looking ahead, we will continue to advance commercialization with safety as our top priority. Supported by our increasingly competitive product, strong industry collaboration, and expanding global footprint, we are confident in EHang Holdings Limited's potential for sustained long-term growth. Now, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Conor Chia-hung Yang, to walk us through the financial results. Hello everyone.\nBefore I go into the details, please note that all numbers presented are in RMB unless otherwise stated. A detailed analysis is available in our earnings press release on the IR site. Now I will present some key financial data. Total revenues were RMB147.2 million in Q2 2025, an increase of 44% compared with Q2 last year and a significant sequential increase of 4.6x compared with Q1 2025. These year-over-year and sequential increases are primarily driven by increased sales volume of EH216 series products. As our COO mentioned earlier, OC issuance has significantly boosted customers' interest in our products, which resulted in more active order conversion in the second quarter.\nGross profit was RMB91.9 million in Q2, showing both year-over-year and sequential growth driven by increased revenues in the quarter. The gross margin in Q2 was 62.6%, remaining stable compared with the 62.4% in both Q2 2024 and Q1 2025. This indicates that our products maintain sustained market competitiveness and stable pricing power. Turning to expenses, total operating expenses in Q2 were RMB173 million, representing increases on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. This was primarily due to our continued business expansion and increased R&D investment, which translated into higher staff compensation. The adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter, which excluded share-based compensation expenses, were RMB137.5 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 37.2% and a quarter-over-quarter increase of 52.3%.\nThis increase was mainly due to the company's accelerated pace of commercial expansion with the corresponding workforce growth resulting in an overall increase in staff compensation. Additionally, our continued investment in new aircraft models and technologies also contributed to higher R&D expenses. Adjusted net income was RMB9.4 million, excluding share-based compensation expenses and the one-off non-operating provisions made for the settlement fee of legal proceedings related to the U.S. Securities Class Action filed in 2023, making a remarkable 19.9% increase from RMB1.2 million in 2024 and a turnaround from the adjusted net loss of RMB31.1 million in 2025. Since Q2, the company raised over $23 million through at-the-market offerings.\nThe proceeds will mainly be used for the company's research and development of next-generation technologies and products, team and production expansion, establishment of new headquarters, commercial operations, working capital, and general corporate purposes. The company continues to have strong capital reserves as of 06\/30\/2025. Our cash and cash equivalents, restricted to short-term deposits and short-term investments, totaled RMB1.2 billion. This solid financial foundation gives us the flexibility to support future R&D investments, expand production, and grow our commercial operations. Given our strategic focus for the second half of the year is on operational execution and supporting customers in achieving safe, regular operations, we have made a prudent decision to moderate the pace of order deliveries.\nAs a result, we have adjusted our full-year 2025 revenue guidance to approximately RMB500 million. By focusing on strengthening our commercial operations foundation, we are strategically transitioning our revenue model to a dual-engine approach combining eVTOL manufacturing and operational services. With steadily expanding and a more diverse product portfolio, we expect our revenue mix to become increasingly balanced, supporting EHang Holdings Limited's long-term sustainable growth and delivering enduring value for our shareholders. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Tim Yao from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTim Yao: Thank you, management, for taking my question. This is Tim from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions. One is on the material cuts to the revenue guidance for next year. So I would like to know more about the reasons behind this. Why? Because the management has talked a little bit about that. I wonder why do we choose at this time point to adjust our growth strategy? Is it because of the external factors or is it because of the market or any challenges that we're facing on the operational level? So why is the company taking this prudent approach when it comes to deliveries?\nAnd as you revised down the revenue guidance as well as the delivery pace, I was wondering whether we have a lot more visibility into the deliveries in the second half of the year because we have delivered a lot more in the first half as the current data suggests. So I would like to know more about that. Thank you.\nZhao Wang: You're right. In the second half of the year, we have made strategic adjustments to our overall company strategy. That's because we have obtained the OC. That's when we started to focus more on the operations. So the focus is to shift on providing more support services to existing clients to help them establish regular operations for the products they have already purchased safely and systematically. And I would like to emphasize that the adjustment is not due to insufficient market demand, but rather because we want to maintain safety as our core principle and adopt a more prudent development strategy. We are not blindly pursuing rapid short-term expansion, but instead focusing on safe and sustainable commercial operations.\nTherefore, we have cautiously lowered our full-year revenue guidance based on our current order. So that's that. And based on the current order backlog at hand, we are confident in achieving the full-year revenue target of RMB500 million. And the second question is on OC because the two EH216s operators have obtained the operating certificates from the CAAC in Q1. So I was wondering if management could share more color or give us an update on the progress as well as the process in terms of the OC application on the client side. So could management give us an update on that? Thank you.\nZhao Wang: After the two operators obtained the certificates, they are now adopting a phased operational approach and are currently in the second phase of passenger trial operations. They are continuously optimizing the processes and services. They are exploring the dual helipad operation model. So this is to increase the commercial value. I would like to emphasize that the existing customers saw that our operators have obtained the OCs. And so they have shown significant interest in this. Also, we are now widely recognized by the market. So there's a lot of attention on us. So I would say that the OC has a very strong confidence in the current customers as well as the potential customers.\nRight now, our clients have two options in front of them. One of them is that they can put together a dedicated team, put together all the information required for the OC application process. And during this process, we would provide full technical support in their OC application. And the other model for the client is to go through the hosting for agent approach where we would apply the OC on their behalf. Both models are progressing fairly well at the moment.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yong Lin from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nFiona Liang: This is Fiona from Bank of America Securities. I've got two questions. One is on the order backlog. So what is the breakdown for the orders that are currently at hand? I mean, in terms of how many of them are from domestic customers and how many of them are from overseas customers? And whether that provides any visibility in terms of the conversion rate for the orders from the year after and the year after next? Thank you.\nConor Chia-hung Yang: In Q2, we obtained 150 new orders. I want to emphasize that these are not framework agreements. These are purchase agreements that we have signed with these customers. And these orders, so the clients will purchase these, so we'll take the order with us in batches and that will convert into actual sales and revenue. To give you a rough breakdown, 90% of the sales are with domestic clients and 10% of them are with overseas customers. Thank you. There is a trend that we have spotted that there is significantly more demand for our pilotless vehicles from the overseas market.\nThere are several orders of significant volume that are in negotiation, we will disclose them whenever we finalize the purchase agreements. However, we want to emphasize that there's a lot more demand for our pilotless vehicles from the overseas market. So that's the trend that we have spotted. Thank you.\nFiona Liang: My second question is on the VT20 model, because we saw that we debuted some model in the Zhuhai Expedition in July. And we are aware that this model has been under flight testing for roughly a year. We also noticed that particularly the test flights have been conducted in the Greater Bay Area. Do we have any plans for airworthiness certification and commercialization of this model? Thank you.\nZhao Wang: The VT20 series logistic aircraft currently operating regularly in Zhuhai are small UAVs that do not require airworthiness certification. The large logistic aircraft models that are still being refined do require airworthiness certification. But given the experience that we have in the application of airworthiness certification application, I think the progress will be much faster than the previous formats. Thank you. In the progress of developing any new models, we're rolling out any new model. We always place our top priority on safety. And we aim to achieve sustainable long-term commercial operations for all of these models that we have rolled out.\nSo our approach is to start with these smaller-sized logistic models and gradually transfer or transition or shift to those large logistic models. And we do have commercial plans for these large commercial pilotless vehicles in the future. Thank you. Yes, that concludes my questions. Thank you, management, for answering my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Lau from Jefferies.\nAlan Lau: This is Alan from Jefferies. Notice that we've made a strategic adjustment in terms of the revenue guidance. I'm wondering will we notice a notable or material increase in the revenue growth for next year? So that's the first question.\nConor Chia-hung Yang: We have mentioned that we are going to place a lot more of our focus on safety and we're going to put more efforts into preparing some of these projects and build them into demonstration projects across the nation. So that's the strategic adjustment to that. Based on that, we have made a strategic adjustment of slowing down the deliveries for the second half of the year. But however, we are confident that we are going to have significantly faster growth for next year. I think it would have been about half a year time, that would be sufficient for us to make the adjustments.\nAlan Lau: Next question is on orders from the overseas market. Recently, your competitors have signed many overseas markets. We also noticed that EHang Holdings Limited had signed an order with a Japanese client. So I was wondering, could the management share the company's overseas business progress, such as any progress sales breakthroughs in Thailand or Japan? On the order volume level, what would that be? Can management give an update on that? Thank you.\nConor Chia-hung Yang: We did notice a stronger demand from the overseas market. And our goal is to obtain commercial operations within six months. Our collaboration with the Thailand regulators has been progressing fairly well in terms of moving into commercial operation. So right now, our approach is to deepen the sandbox testing model. So in the first phase, we will conduct many test flights along the Pattaya and the Bangkok area. So our hope is to achieve commercial operation after obtaining the certification from the Thailand regulators. So once that has been proven successful, we can replicate and bring this model, expand our commercial operations into many other islands, tourism islands in Thailand, for example, Koh Samui Island.\nSo I believe this would serve as a role model for many potential markets in Southeast Asia. So one thing to notice is that this sandbox-based test is from point A to point B. So once we obtain the certification for this commercial operation, this would also provide a lot more experience in terms of helping to secure commercial operations in China. Thank you. Another similar project or test flights we are advancing is the sandbox test area in UAE, Abu Dhabi. So we are partnering with a local partner. So we are conducting test flights to obtain the certificate from the local regulators. So again, like I said, this is a point A to point B.\nThank you, management, for your answers. That's pretty clear. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rongyan Zhou from Citi. Your line is open.\nRongyan Zhou: This is Rongyan Zhou from Citi. I was wondering, in the previous strategic model, our production is actually based on our sales. I was wondering if we, after making the adjustment on the revenue reduction, I was wondering if we would still pursue the production base expansion plan with an annual production capacity of 1,000 units. And with that, will that feed into any changes in terms of the 2025 CapEx? Thank you.\nConor Chia-hung Yang: We would continue to pursue our production base expansion in Yunfu. So the annual production capacity according to plan is 1,000 units per year. That would guarantee our future deliveries. And in terms of the production expansion, I think that will reflect some changes based on the estimates of deliveries, but it will continue to expand for two reasons. One is to prepare for the long-term demand of different customers. Second, this expansion is to prepare for deliveries of diverse models, including the VT35 model as well as many fire rescue or firefighting models.\nAnd in terms of the 2025 CapEx, that would remain consistent with our disclosure that is at $14 million remains unchanged in terms of the 2025 capital expenditure guidance. Thank you, management.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laura Lee from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLaura Lee: Hey, thank you for taking my question. So I'd like to ask how should we think about your business model as a eVTOL service provider as you mentioned earlier? So basically what's your role and how the revenue generation will be like? And also will this be a long-term strategy or mostly just for the initial stage of operations?\nZhao Wang: I think that our adjustment is in time adjustment to the development phase of the UAV sector. Previously in a couple of years, we put most of our efforts in pursuing the EAC, making sure that we can produce an order that can fly and that can be sold. And the strategic target for this year is to make sure that we will pursue commercial operations for these existing clients. I think it's very hard to start any new business or a new initiative. I think our success in obtaining the airworthiness for our very first UAV model has proven the success. And at this moment, our goal is to pursue sustainable long-term commercial operation for this model.\nWe admit there are going to be a lot of challenges and obstacles along the way. However, we are confident in overcoming them. Every time we made a breakthrough in terms of the challenges that we made, it instills a sense of confidence into the market. So going forward, our business model will be positioned as an eVTOL producer plus an operation service provider. We will be providing supporting services for all of our clients ensuring that they can fly their eVTOLs safely.\nAll of our efforts, for example, in conducting the test or trainings and etcetera are positioned to address all the challenges encountered by our clients and we are confident that advancing the industry along the way with our customers together. So with all these hurdles cleared, we are able and going to deliver more UAVs to our clients going forward. Thank you.\nLaura Lee: Okay. Thank you for the color. So my second question is actually about the VT35. I think you mentioned the support from the state government of that RMB500 million. So any breakdown on this number? I mean, is this mainly the eVTOL orders, like mainly the infrastructure build-out or some shared costs or R&D?\nZhao Wang: Yes, on the VT35, to give an overview, this is a new model rolled out by EHang Holdings Limited and we have submitted the model, the type certification. We have actually informed the CAAC about this model in February. Now we are advancing the airworthiness application process. And today, we made the announcement of signing the strategic partnership with the Hefei government and we are going to bring these new models into Hefei and make it our base for this new model. The RMB500 million support from the Hefei government comes in the formats of orders, investments, as well as the supply chain support. Support from the government will definitely push the development of the VT35 model. Thank you.\nLaura Lee: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yu Chen from Guangfa Securities. Your line is open.\nYu Chen: This is Yu Chen from Guangfa Securities. I got two questions. The first question is whether management could you give us a breakdown in terms of the 68 units sold in Q2? How many of them are from domestic customers and how many of them are from Japanese customers? And as well as the breakdown for the 150 new orders that we've signed, what's the breakdown between overseas and domestic markets? And the second question is on the solid-state battery initiative. Are there any updates on that?\nConor Chia-hung Yang: In terms of the 68 units that were delivered in Q2, they are the EH216 series. And to give you a breakdown, 67 of them are EH216S models and one of them is an EH216L model, the logistic version. They are delivered to 13 customers, 12 of them are from domestic customers and one from Japan. And in terms of the 150 units, these are firm orders with a signed purchase agreement. And to give you a breakdown, 90% of them are from domestic customers and 10% of them are from overseas markets.\nZhao Wang: I'll take your second question on the solid-state battery initiative. So currently, the company is adopting a multi-battery R&D strategy. That means we are pursuing multi-channel cooperation plus multi-directional deployment. We are exploring optimization opportunities for power systems. At the moment, we have established partnerships with battery manufacturers including Q1, Goshen Hitech, and Xinji Energy to explore different battery solution development directions. So to elaborate on the question, just to make a quick add. So there are several directions that we're exploring with the battery R&D. Firstly, we are working to resolve the challenges of battery fast charging and discharging and lifespan issues to increase the daily flight operations.\nAnd then the second direction is to develop universal low-cyclical batteries to reduce the adaptation costs. And the third one is to do research on the semi-solid-state batteries. And the last direction we are working on the battery R&D is the solid-state battery development, which has achieved significant results. EHang Holdings Limited is the world's first to install solid-state batteries on eVTOL aircraft and conduct actual flights as we have demonstrated last year. So we have successfully increased the flight duration from 48 minutes. And last year, we have successfully brought it to 66 minutes now. So currently, our firefighting and logistic aircraft can exceed one hour of flight time.\nAnd one thing to note is that we are actively applying for the airworthiness for the solid-state battery on the eVTOL model. We are estimating to have the application reviewed and successfully granted by the end of the year. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Seeing no more questions in the queue, let me turn the call back to Ms. Anne for closing remarks. Thank you all again. This concludes the call.

Email pr@fool.com\nFull Conference Call Transcript\nKen Seipel: Thank you. Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report another quarter of consistent performance, demonstrating disciplined execution and progress across every area of our business. Our transformation remains guided by a clear three-phase framework designed to deliver sustainable profitable growth. First, Phase One is Repair, that's restoring our fundamentals and establishing a strong foundation. Phase Two is our Execute phase, embedding consistent best practices and driving reliable performance. And we are going to be entering in the future Phase Three, which is Optimize, leveraging new systems and expansion capabilities to accelerate our growth.\nThese three phases create the foundation for a disciplined approach to capture the near-term and long-term opportunity of growth for Citi Trends. Now turning to our results. In the second quarter, we generated strong comparable sales growth of 9.2%, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of mid to high single-digit comp sales growth. Year to date, we delivered year-over-year comp growth of 9.6%. And I'm happy to report that sales momentum consistent with our first half top-line trends has continued into the back-to-school season. This August, we'll be representing thirteen consecutive months of comparable store sales growth. Gross margin dollars have increased meaningfully, achieving our highest rate performance in the last several years.\nAs our buying teams have fine-tuned assortments for our core customers, we've experienced faster sell-throughs of regular-priced product, reduced markdowns, and improved operational controls for shrinkage and transportation rates. Our SG&A was slightly deleveraged in the quarter due to the inclusion of incentive compensation for the consistent financial performance of our employees. It's been quite a few years since the company achieved its bonus targets. So I'm excited to add performance-based bonus back to our financial profile. Excluding the new performance bonus incentive compensation, our SG&A leveraged in the quarter and leveraged year to date consistent with our guidance. Our top line continues to grow to be broad-based and healthy.\nTransaction growth has consistently accounted for the majority of our sales gain, which validates the strategic advantage of our neighborhood locations. And additionally, we saw growth in units per transaction while maintaining stable average unit retails. Also, our performance was consistent across climate zones, regions, and store volume deciles, which underscores the breadth of improvement across the business. Our turnaround is rooted in a clear and unwavering focus on the needs of our African American customer, who is at the center of everything we do. Neighborhood-based locations remain a differentiated advantage with proximity and word-of-mouth serving as powerful traffic drivers.\nWe continue to strengthen this connection by elevating the cultural relevance of our assortments, refreshing the shopping experience to better align with our brand voice, and investing in customer engagement. Work is underway to design and implement a CRM and loyalty platform that will deepen interaction with our most frequent shoppers, thus enhancing long-term customer value. Our product performance in Q2 was broad-based and balanced across apparel, non-apparel, family basics, home and lifestyle, and children's categories. In all categories, customers responded well to elevated fashions and expansion of brand name apparel. Women's plus and big men's apparel had strong performance and both remain early-stage businesses with significant runway ahead.\nMen's delivered improved results as trend-relevant assortments and improved in-stocks on basics resonated with customers. In Children's, a cornerstone of our business has continued strong year-over-year performance. And our customers continue to respond to extreme value deals on well-known brands at exceptional prices as we continue to build capabilities to expand this important segment of our strategy. Looking ahead in product, we've made good progress in improving our three-tiered good, better, and best product assortments, but we are still in early stages.\nThe majority of our initial initiatives, which include better in-stocks on basic product, accelerated growth of women's plus and big men's sizes, expansion of the consumables category, and the addition of extreme value products have had good early success. We see significant growth runway ahead though as we continue to fulfill consumer demand in all of these categories. In addition, our merchants have identified several growth opportunities through assortment refinement as we learn more about our customers. For example, our men's team is working to develop an expanded and more refined assortment for young men. We believe we are under-serving this trendy value-oriented consumer. Young men's will complement the already strong men's classic and core business.\nIn our women's apparel, customers are responding to the increased offering of trendy Missy-sized product. Missy product broadens the availability of style and size for women and complements the strong offering of junior product. Customer reaction to our best trendy product has been strong, giving us confidence there's more demand to address. This has led us to add a trend director to identify emerging trends and guide curation of product assortment. We were fortunate to find an accomplished trend director with a successful track record of trend curation at well-known brands in the industry.\nI believe the elevation of trend in our men's and women's assortments will be additive and supportive to our merchant teams and resonate strongly with our customers. From an operational standpoint, we made continued progress on our initiatives in the second quarter. Foundational improvements in preseason product planning, in-season allocation execution, and supply chain speed have enabled us to support a 9.2% comp growth while operating with 5.7% less in-store inventory than last year. Working capital optimization provides liquidity and flexibility to react quickly to emerging trends and deal opportunities, while also enhancing gross margin. Our stores continue to make strides in improving neat, clean, and organized shopping experiences for customers.\nWe've implemented improved in-store navigation signing and updated presentation standards to make shopping experience easier. Our supply chain remains stable with progress against productivity and steam goals. And looking ahead, we're in the process of implementing improved work processes throughout the DCs and implementing special handling areas to assist us in overall processing speed and capacity to grow extreme value products and family footwear. I look forward to sharing more on this initiative on future calls. Looking ahead in operations, test results for our new AI-based allocation system have been well above expectations allowing us to more accurately allocate products based on individual store demand, which has in turn increased sales and improved inventory turns.\nWe are in the process of implementing AI-based allocations to all categories with expected completion in mid-September in time to impact holiday. And currently, we're in the early stages of developing a complementary AI-based merchandise planning system that we hope to have ready for early 2026. Here again, we'll keep you updated on our progress. As we all know, retail is detailed and execution without measurement is just simply guesswork, which is why our use of KPIs and dashboards for all key functions is critical. The visibility provided helps our team stay on track, identifying where we're hitting the plans and where we need more attention.\nThe combination of simple repeatable processes supported by operating procedures plus KPIs makes us confident that we'll be able to drive continual operational improvement for years to come. And a few comments on tariffs. As evidenced in our results, we are successfully navigating the ever-changing tariff landscape. In fact, we've actually found the off-price products deal-making environment to be very robust and advantageous. My direction to the team is be aggressive, remain flexible with ample liquidity. Our strategy is working. We intend to play our game and win at our game. Now I'll turn the call over to Heather to discuss the financial performance. Heather?\nHeather Plutino: Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to have the opportunity to walk you through the details of our second quarter and first half results as well as our improved outlook for the year. Before I do that, let me echo some themes from Ken's comments. The transformation of Citi Trends is underway and is driving significant improvement in both top and bottom line results. As I've said in previous calls, there's a new energy at Citi Trends and the results we get to share with you today are proof that our team's hard work is paying off. Turning to the specifics of second quarter results.\nStarting with the top line, Q2 sales were $190.8 million, up 8% compared to Q2 2024 with comp store sales growth of 9.2%, our fourth consecutive quarter of mid or high single-digit comps. We delivered high single-digit comps in each month of the quarter and saw growth to last year in each of our retail metrics, traffic, basket, and conversion as the impact of our revised merchandise assortment, including off-price deals and more branded extreme value products continues to resonate strongly. As Ken mentioned in his remarks and similar to our first quarter results, second quarter top-line improvement to last year is a story of consistency.\nWe saw consistent results across climate zones and across store volumes, and we drove consistent broad-based strength across most product categories. We produced a 40% gross margin rate in the quarter as planned, our highest Q2 rate since fiscal 2021 and an 890 basis point expansion versus Q2 last year. Recall that in the second quarter of last year, we incurred significant markdowns from our strategic inventory reset, allowing us to exit aged and slow-moving products while freeing up open to buy for our revised product strategy. The effect of lapping that event, net of the in-season markdown cadence established last year, significantly improved year-over-year markdown expense.\nWe also drove decreased shrink expense in the quarter as a result of ongoing cross-functional efforts plus the lap of an accrual adjustment last year. Our broad-based Q2 margin rate improvement was also impacted by higher selling margins due to increased full-price selling and a favorable mix of higher margin products, all while maintaining our sharp price value equation throughout the store. And finally, we saw improvement in cost of freight from favorable contract rates put in place last fall. Second quarter adjusted SG&A expense totaled $78.9 million compared to $72.1 million in the prior period.\nThe increase to last year was driven by higher incentive compensation accrual on improved business performance and store and DC expense to process higher sales. As we shared with you in our last call, we reinstated incentive compensation accruals in 2025 after incurring very minimal bonus and equity expense in the last three quarters of fiscal 2024, causing a bonus to no bonus comparison in the second quarter. On a rate basis, Q2 adjusted SG&A was 41.3% of revenue, 50 basis points higher than the 40.8 rate in Q2 last year. The rate increase was driven entirely by this year's incentive compensation accruals.\nAll other SG&A levered by approximately 150 basis points in the quarter, reflecting continued disciplined cost controls and the impact of improved top-line results. And it's important to note that for the first half of the year, total adjusted SG&A, including incentive comp levered about 90 basis points to last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a loss of $2.6 million in line with management expectations and an increase of $14.6 million versus Q2 2024 results. In the quarter, we sold our 72,000 square foot building in Savannah, Georgia, realizing a gain on the sale of approximately $11 million which is included in reported net income and reported EBITDA, but is excluded from adjusted results.\nWe will maintain our presence in Savannah, having leased a new smaller office space not far from the building we sold, giving our teams a fresh new space for continued collaboration. During Q2, we remodeled 19 stores, ending the quarter with 28% of the fleet in an updated format. We also closed one store in the quarter, bringing our total store count to 590 locations. Before turning to the balance sheet, let me provide a few details on our performance in 2025. First half comparable store sales were 9.6% with a two-year comp stack of 10.3%. First half comps were driven by approximately 6% increase in transactions.\nAdjusted first half EBITDA was $2.8 million an increase of about $21 million to last year. EBITDA growth was driven by $29 million of incremental sales, 480 basis points of gross margin rate expansion and 90 basis points of SG&A leverage. Now turning to the balance sheet. Total inventory dollars at quarter end decreased 12.9% compared to last year, with average in-store inventory down 5.7%. Our success in driving high single-digit increases, sales increases with less inventory reflects our focus on improved inventory efficiency through higher churn, plus improvements in supply chain speed. We remain pleased with our inventory level, composition, and freshness.\nAt the end of the quarter, we remained in a healthy financial position with a strong balance sheet, including no debt, no drawings on our $75 million revolver and $50 million in cash. Now turning to our fiscal 2025 outlook. Based on our first half results, our confidence in the continued effectiveness of our turnaround plan plus recognition that the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, we are pleased to update our outlook for 2025 as follows. With the strength of sales in the first half of the year, we now expect full year comp store sales growth of mid to high single digits above our previous outlook of mid single digit growth.\nWe now expect full year gross margin expansion of approximately 210 basis to 230 basis points versus 2024, slightly above previous outlook due to improved inventory efficiency and initial progress on our planned supply chain improvement. SG&A is expected to leverage in the range of 60 to 90 basis points versus 2024, consistent with our first half trend and an improvement to our previous outlook. Note that this is inclusive of the build of the incentive comp accrual. To be clear, we now expect full year SG&A expense of approximately $310 million an increase in EPS guidance due to cost to process and support higher sales and a higher bonus accrual on better business performance.\nWith these updates, we now expect full year EBITDA to be in the range of $7 million to $11 million an increase to previous outlook. This revised guidance is $21 million to $25 million above fiscal 2024 results. There is no change to our expected effective tax rate of approximately 0% for the year. We now expect to open three new stores, close three stores and to remodel approximately 60 locations in the year. And finally, full year capital expenditures are now expected to be in the range of $22 million to $25 million.\nBefore I turn the call back to Ken, I'll reiterate that we are very proud of our Q2 and first half results and the meaningful progress we've achieved so far. Our teams remain focused on continuous improvement with full recognition that there are still significant opportunities ahead of us. We still have processes to refine and areas to optimize as we continue the transformation of our business. The consistency of our performance over the past four quarters gives me confidence that we're building something durable and that our disciplined approach to driving shareholder value will continue to deliver results. With that, I'll turn the call back to Ken. Ken?\nKen Seipel: Thank you, Heather. Before we open the call to Q&A, I do want to share a few thoughts about our longer range of growth for Citi Trends. So looking forward, we are preparing for store expansion growth. We expect to remodel approximately 50 stores per year and expand square footage in the mid single digit range. We have engaged a third-party analytics team to assist us with dissecting the demographics, psychographics, and geo proximity location of our current customers right down to the individual household level. These insights, coupled with a robust financial pro forma, will greatly improve our accuracy and real estate site selection, leading to improved new store return on investment performance.\nWe've identified several MSAs that are attractive expansion opportunities for Citi Trends in 2026 and beyond. Long range, our goal at Citi Trends is to achieve $40 million or more of EBITDA in 2027. This will be driven by consistent single-digit sales growth, gross margin dollar expansion, leveraged SG&A, and new store expansion. Each initiative within our value creation plan is supported by clear accountability, key performance indicators, and execution rigor. Our leadership team is highly engaged in building out the detailed plans to execute and is fully committed to making these plans a reality. In summary, Citi Trends has delivered four consecutive quarters of comp growth underpinned by transaction increases, broad-based product strength, and disciplined execution.\nOur strategy is working, our operational capabilities are advancing, and our customer connection is strengthening. But there's still a lot of work to do. We have processes to refine, we have categories to optimize, and more systems to build, but the path forward is clear. We are confident in our ability to deliver continued transformation, drive shareholder value, and expand our role as a leading neighborhood retailer for African American families. I'll say thank you to our Citi Trends team for their discipline, their dedication, and great results, and thank you to our shareholders for your continued confidence and support. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, for questions. Donna?\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Our first question today is coming from Michael Baker of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nMichael Baker: Okay, great. Thanks. Hopefully, you can hear me. I wanted to ask great quarter. Thanks. Two one question, one follow-up. Let's first just talk about the expenses and the incentive comp and how that plays out going forward? And just sort of how should we think about expenses on a quarterly basis? I think the math implies about $78 million in SG&A for each quarter in the back half on average. Is that the right run rate going forward as we think about 2026 and 2027?\nHeather Plutino: Hey, Mike. Heather, hear you loud and clear. A question on SG&A, sure. 78 per quarter, I think that's exactly right. The thing that I will remind you of though, that's a good average per quarter, but Q4 ticks up about 3% versus Q3 because of holiday sales. So just kind of think about that as you calendarize. And as we go forward into 2026, we haven't conveyed that yet broadly. I can help you with modeling in our follow-up call.\nMichael Baker: Well, I guess I don't want to waste my follow-up on this, but let me ask two more if I could. One, just thinking about that and the gross margin outlook, what's the right sort of incremental margin flow through on incremental sales? I understand there's a lot of noise this year, particularly as you cycled some things last year, but more about 2026 and 2027. How do we think about incremental margins?\nHeather Plutino: Yes. So we've mentioned before that our goal is 20% to 25% EBITDA flow through, which we define as the change in EBITDA over the change of sales versus the prior year. This particular fiscal year is a little choppy because of some odd compares in the last year period and the build of the incentive comp this year. So if you try to normalize that, then you end up at about 25% certainly in the back half of the year of 2025. But that's what we're looking at going forward is 20% to 25% profit flow through.\nMichael Baker: Got it. All right. If I could sneak in one more. I'm intrigued by the trend director, I think you called her, or fashion creative director or him. I guess I don't know if it's her. Any examples of what you're learning from that new hire? How we think that might show up in terms of what the merchandise looks like?\nKen Seipel: Yeah, a couple of things on that, Mike. Thanks for the question. Since she's joined, she's really been acutely focused on really interpreting and understanding the consumer voice. But more importantly, the current landscape around the consumer. And what we've been able to gain from her insights is really taking what I call the voice of the consumer and starting to translate that into tangible style and tangible trends. So looking at obviously all the emerging things that are happening culturally around, on the landscape, it's pretty difficult to sift through all But she's done a nice job of sifting through all the things, all the noise out there, and distilling it into a handful of key focus trends.\nAnd what that has allowed our merchants to do then is to go to market with very specific filters on curating against this trend. And so we're starting to see some of that show up. Gave props to our men's team earlier. They've done a nice job of embracing, the concept right out the gate, they're getting good results in addition to the work that they're doing in their core programs, which has been good work. So these two things kind of coming together give us a sense that we're onto something. And I believe that, you'll start to see the results of better, more accurate, and more thoughtful curation as we get into Q4.\nI'm really excited about where we're headed there.\nMichael Baker: Awesome. Great. Appreciate the time.\nKen Seipel: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeremy Hamblin of Craig Hallum. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thanks and congrats on the impressive results. I wanted to get into the commentary about, it sounds like the momentum has really continued here in Q3 even as you're lapping much, much tougher compares. Wanted to see if you can provide a bit more color on what's driving that sustained momentum? I know you talked about broad-based execution in Q2. But are you seeing more branded deals potentially driving the sustained strength for more well-rounded assortment? Any color you might be able to share on that would be helpful.\nKen Seipel: Yes. Sure, Jeremy. Thanks for the question. And it literally is all of the above. What's happened I think in the course of the last year is we've continued to refine starting first with I mentioned on the call earlier our preseason planning capabilities where we've really been thoughtful about how do we go in and attack the season, as we call it. So we really we put a good roadmap out there for winning in Q3 and what do we need to do to get Q3 off to a good start from a back-to-school perspective. And then that was supported with very thoughtful plans from all of our merchant teams.\nWe do something in a category review process where we're trying put stakes in the ground on what categories can grow. And then behind that, when we back that up with the finances, right, and the open to buy and the amount of receipts required to support those ideas. And it's a very basic program, to be honest with you. Most retailers do it, but I think we're doing it better than ever and very disciplined and very thoughtful about it. And then the bottom line is you can put a good plan together, but then it comes down to execution. So that's where our teams have been out, in the market, finding the better product, finding the better styles.\nSo I'd give you a combination, and you can see this in our store. But to give you one example, the team really embraced the brand True Religion, which has been around for a while, but it's actually resonated across the board with our consumers. And it was shared against multiple categories. And it's showing up across the store in all lines versus just in one category where we might have approached that in the past. And those ideas like that, there are many more that our teams are building on each other's ideas, and we're starting to see a much better curated product assortment for the total consumer.\nAnd then I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our teams in the field and the execution that's going on there, where they've really stepped up their game considerably when it comes to moving freight from the backroom to the floor in a more expedient way. Presentation standards have improved. NRDC as well is moving things through. So it literally is from my desk. It's a combination of all things kinda coming together quite well.\nAnd I guess I would also, share with you that as we sit around as leadership team and think about what's working and what opportunities we have ahead, frankly, come up with more things on the to do list than we do on the done list. Right? And, it's a little bit humbling to realize, how far we've come and how far we really have to go. But anyway, sorry about the rambling answer there, but the point is, is it really truly is, it's a combination of all of the detailed execution of the strategy kind of coming together.\nJeremy Hamblin: Very helpful. I wanted to shift gears then and talk a little bit about the store base. So you've increased the number of remodels, from 50 to 60 that you planned for this year and I think it sounds like 50 on an ongoing basis. And then as you plan to get back into a unit growth mode, should we be thinking that FY 2026 is a mid single digit type unit growth. And then if you could just share some of the economics behind how much the remodels cost, what type of lift you're getting from them and then what you expect kind of the new store economics to be on new openings on a go forward basis?\nKen Seipel: For sure. I'll give you some of the strategy then and have Heather fill in some of the color on the results there for you. Yes, a couple of things. So this year, we did adjust. We actually added a few more remodels. I think we previously announced 50 and we had line of sight to add 10 more for strategic reasons. Actually, to let you know what we're up to, we added some stores in our Jacksonville market and Columbia, South Carolina market to complement a couple of new store openings we have in those markets. We're going to try to go in and revitalize those markets and refresh the brand on an entire MSA basis.\nI'm excited about what that might do. We're going to learn a little bit more about that. Our new stores open up in October, and all of those remodels will be completed there. So the reason we added 10 more stores was just to accomplish a full remodel in both of those marketplaces. Going forward on a new store growth perspective, we are going get into mid single digits. We have line of sight to a number of sites already for 2026. We don't have an exact number of where we're going to be in there, but there'll be some number between twenty five and forty new stores in 2026.\nI would expect at least 25 in that mix and then maybe more, we'll see. We'll have I'll be able to announce that on future calls more specifically, but it'll be in that range. And then the out years after that, we'll have the flywheel built. So we're still kind of building our pipeline. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, we're looking very specifically at opportunistic MSAs across the nation. We've identified many of those already as places to go. And now we have the hard work of trying to get in and find the right site inside of the market. So that work is underway as we speak as well in a lot of key markets.\nThe final thing that I'll say in terms of return on investment at a high level, our new stores, we're putting them under a financial rigor. And I want you to think about our new store growth going forward as a triangle, right? There's on one side of the triangle is, the rigor and discipline around making sure that we have the right site selection, consumer demographics, and so forth. The other part of the triangle is the actual end market site itself, being an attractive center and so forth. And then the third part of the triangle, is financial rigor, which is making sure that we hold ourselves to a high standard of return on investment.\nAnd so with that, I'll turn that over to Heather to let her fill in a little bit of color on that as well as the remodel question you had.\nHeather Plutino: Yes. I'm going to start with a remodel, if you don't mind, Jeremy. Good morning, by the way. You asked about remodel expense and results. So remodel expense, you'll remember, I think it was 2023. We cut the expense of a remodel in about half, right? So on average, we're at somewhere between $85,000 per location to $130,000 I can tell you that the remaining remodels for this year are averaging at $100,000 per store. And these are high volume stores, like $1.9 million per. And then from a results perspective, we continue to see sales lift when we remodel stores. It varies by market, but we're still very comfortable that we're getting return.\nI think it's important though that on a store by store basis that amount is going to change store by store. So in some locations, it's really a matter of refreshing the fleet and doing a market presentation, right? So Ken just talked about Jacksonville, talked about Columbia, South Carolina. We're going to touch stores in that market to make sure that we are doing a full market press on here's the new iteration of Citi Trends. We want excitement in every door. We want excitement with our associates. We don't want anybody to feel left behind.\nSo we're thinking about remodels maybe a little bit differently in that it's about fleet maintenance as much as it is about driving incremental sales. For new stores, the financial rigor that Ken spoke of, yes, We are applying financial metrics, making sure we've got the right return on investment. We've got the right payback period. We've got the right with the right, the right. We're looking at it very closely in partnership with our real estate team. Top line, you've heard Ken talk about this before. Ideally, we want our per store average at about 1.45, not to put too fine a point on it, but $1.45 million per door. Are we going get that every time?\nNo, but that's what we're striving for, right? And rent at 10%. We've got control payroll, all of that, right? So from a four wall flow through, we look for mid teens and up to make sure that we're supporting the financial performance of the full chain. So that's kind of a look behind the curtain there.\nJeremy Hamblin: That's great color. If I could sneak in just one more. Ken, on the last call you had mentioned some supply chain initiatives that you're working on trying to reduce, I think, the number of days in supply chain and that would allow you to save some money and cost. And I wanted to just understand where are you on that initiative? I know it sounds like as you make progress, you realize you have more progress to make. But I was hoping for a quick update on where that initiative stands. Thank you.\nKen Seipel: Yes, for sure, Jeremy. We are in, again, use the term early stages, but I think it's fair to say early stages there. We've, what I would call taking out the low hanging fruit. Obviously, we're much faster now. And so think about the supply chain in three big parts, okay? Part number one is vendor to DC. And we're better at managing that in our transportation routing and speed of picking up. From there, we've taken out a few days of that moment. Then you have your in DC processing. And then the third part is DC to store. And we've actually sped up the DC to store considerably. That we've changed, our routing, to, actually UPS carrier.\nAnd it's taken three or four days out of supply chain from DC to store. So the team did that really at the beginning of the year. We learned how to optimize that, and so we're significantly faster there. The area that we're really focused on right now is what I would call the NDC portion. And some of the work that is underway is in our receiving characteristics. I mentioned earlier Invent Analytics, the AI-based system, when we throw the switch on that in September, that will save two days out of our receiving process, a day and a half right there.\nAnd then we're gonna be adding to that better ticketing standards, which are already being worked on and getting in place right now. That will speed up our ticketing portion. And then there's a processing portion which will speed up as well. So those things have been designed now. We understand what we need to do. Now it's a matter of getting them implemented. And so we're at different stages of implementation. But I would expect over the third quarter that the majority of these ideas will at least be implemented in our DC. And then we'll start to kind of see and feel better optimization as we get into Q4.\nSo it definitely is a work in progress, but we've made good steps forward with a lot more to do there in the DC.\nJeremy Hamblin: Thank you so much for all the color. Appreciate it.\nKen Seipel: Karen. Thanks for the question, Jeremy. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Seipel for closing comments.\nKen Seipel: All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event.

Mr. Xu, please go ahead.\nAnita Xu: Thank you, Mr. Xu. Hello, everyone. This is Anita, and I'll now deliver our CEO, Mr. Xu's remarks. So the solar PV industry faced continuous challenges in 2025 with market prices across the solar value chain declining due to industry overcapacity and high inventory levels, remaining below cash cost levels. As a result, Daqo New Energy Corp. recorded quarterly operating and net losses. Nevertheless, we maintained a strong and healthy balance sheet with no financial debt. As of June 30, 2025, the company had a cash balance of CNY599 million, short-term investments of CNY490 million, bank notes receivable of $49 million, and total fixed-term bank deposit balance of $994 million.\nIn total, our financial bank deposits and investment assets readily convertible into cash as needed stood at $2.06 billion, providing us with ample financial liquidity. With no financial debt, our solid financial position brings us confidence and strategic resilience to navigate conditions and weak selling prices. Total production volume at our two hot water facilities for the quarter was 29,012 metric tons, within our guidance range of 25,000 metric tons to 28,000 metric tons. Towards the end of the quarter, our Chinese authorities intensified efforts to curb disorderly competition. We proactively scaled back new sales orders in anticipation of future price recovery.\nAccordingly, our sales volume for the quarter decreased to 18,126 metric tons from 28,008 metric tons in the first quarter. Due to lower utilization across our factories, idle facility-related costs for the quarter were approximately $1.3 per kilogram, primarily reflecting noncash depreciation expenses. On a positive note, a decline in the cost of silicon metal and reduced energy consumption drove our cash cost lower by 4% to $5.12 per kilogram sequentially, including approximately $0.18 per kilogram related to idle facility maintenance. Overall, polysilicon unit production cost decreased by 4% sequentially to an average of $7.26 per kilogram, with lower unit depreciation costs resulting from higher production.\nIn light of the current market conditions, we expect our total polysilicon production volume in 2025 to be approximately 27,000 to 30,000 metric tons. As a result, we anticipate our full-year 2025 production volume to be in a range of 110,000 metric tons to 130,000 metric tons. During the second quarter, the solar PV industry remained in a cyclical trough, although proactive initiatives started to emerge towards the end of the quarter. On the demand side, China experienced a surge in installations under market-based reform policies and set a new global record with a staggering 93 gigawatts of new solar power capacity added in May.\nHowever, installations plummeted to 14 gigawatts in June, following front-loading earlier this month, ahead of the May 31, 2025 cutoff date for new projects. Poly market prices trended downward during the quarter, falling from RMB39 to 45 per kilogram in April to RMB32 to RMB35 per kilogram by June. According to industry statistics, overall industry poly production for 2025 year-to-date has been running below overall demand and consumption, with monthly supply of approximately 100,000 to 110,000 metric tons. As a result, energy inventory decreased by approximately 30,000 to 40,000 tons between January and July, leaving overall industry polysilicon inventory lower than at the beginning of the year.\nHeading into the third quarter, Chinese authorities have demonstrated increased determination to address irrational competition and energy overcapacity, with the anti-evolution initiative taking a lead role in sectors such as solar PV. On June 29, an article from China's official newspaper People's Daily highlighted the issue of oversupply and disruptive competition in the solar PV industry, calling for measures to curb business competition and promote high-quality development. On June 1, President Xi emphasized the need to regulate disorderly low-price competition and phase out outdated capacity at the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission meeting.\nThe following day, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology convened a symposium with four key solar PV companies to accelerate the industry's transition toward high-quality growth. Most recently, on July 24, government authorities released a draft amendment to the price law, representing a significant step towards strengthening market supervision and deterring unfair pricing practices. The draft clarifies criteria for identifying unfair pricing behavior, such as low-price dumping, and strengthens legal accountability for price-related violations. As a result, polysilicon sales prices have rebounded in July, and polysilicon future prices surged significantly, supported by favorable factors such as expected higher spot pool and simultaneous increases in downstream product prices.\nFor reference, the 2,500 six-nine contract rose sharply from a low of RMB30 per kilogram in June 2025 to a record high of RMB55 per kilogram in July 2025, the strongest level since 2020. The solar PV industry continues to shift strong long-term prospects. In the medium term, we believe that the combined effect of industry self-discipline and government anti-evolution regulations will foster healthier and more sustainable industry. In the long run, as one of the most effective and sustainable energy sources globally, solar power is expected to remain a key driver of the global energy transition and sustainable development.\nLooking ahead, Daqo New Energy Corp. is well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth in the global solar PV industry and strengthen its competitive edge by enhancing its higher efficiency in touch technology and optimizing its cost structure through digital transformation and AI adoption. As one of the world's lowest-cost producers with the highest quality in touch products, a strong balance sheet with no financial debt, we are confident in our ability to weather the current market downturn, capitalize on market recovery, and emerge as a leader in the industry positioned to capture further growth. So now I'll turn the call to our CFO, Mr. Ming Yang, who will discuss the company's financial performance for the quarter.\nMing, please go ahead.\nMing Yang: Thank you, Anita, and hello, everyone. This is Ming Yang, CFO of Daqo New Energy Corp. We appreciate you joining our earnings conference call today. I will now go over the company's second quarter 2025 financial performance. Revenues were $75.2 million compared to $123.9 million in the first quarter of 2025 and $219.9 million in the same quarter of 2024. The decrease in revenue compared to the first quarter of 2025 was primarily due to a decrease in sales volume. Gross loss was $81.4 million compared to $81.5 million in the first quarter of 2025 and $159 million in the second quarter of 2024.\nGross margin was negative 108% compared to negative 65.8% in the first quarter of 2025 and negative 72% in the same quarter of 2024. The decrease in gross margin compared to the first quarter of 2025 was primarily because sales volume decreased while idle facility costs remained relatively fixed. SG&A expenses were $32.1 million compared to $35.1 million in the first quarter of 2025 and $37.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. SG&A expenses during the second quarter included $18.6 million in non-cash share-based compensation costs related to the company's share incentive plan compared to $18.6 million in the first quarter of 2025.\nThe decline in SG&A expenses in the second quarter compared to the first quarter is a result of lower staffing costs as well as lower sales expenses. R&D expenses were $800,000 compared to $500,000 in the first quarter of 2025 and $1.8 million in the same quarter of 2024. R&D expenses can vary from period to period and reflect R&D activities that take place during the quarter. As a result, the foregoing loss from operations was $115 million compared to $114 million in the first quarter of 2025 and $195.6 million in the same quarter of 2024.\nOperating margin was negative 153% compared to negative 92% in the first quarter of 2025 and negative 89% in the same quarter of 2024. Net loss attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders was $76.5 million compared to $71.8 million in the first quarter of 2025 and $119.8 million in the second quarter of 2024. Loss per basic ADS was $1.14 compared to $1.07 in the first quarter of 2025 and $1.81 in the second quarter of 2024. Adjusted net loss attributable to Daqo New Energy Corp. shareholders, excluding non-cash share-based compensation costs, was $57.9 million compared to $53.2 million in the first quarter of 2025 and $98.8 million in the same quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted loss per basic ADS was $0.86 compared to $0.80 in the first quarter of 2025 and $0.50 in the same quarter of 2024. EBITDA was negative $48 million compared to negative $48.4 million in the first quarter of 2025 and negative $145 million in the second quarter of 2024. EBITDA margin was negative 64% compared to negative 39% in the first quarter of 2025 and negative 66% in the second quarter of 2024. Now on the company's financial condition. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $599 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash compared to $792 million as of March 31, 2025, and $998 million as of June 30, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2025, short-term investments were $418.8 million compared to $168 million as of March 31, 2025, and $219.5 million as of June 30, 2024. And as of June 30, 2025, notes receivable balance was $49 million compared to $62.7 million as of March 31, 2025, and $80.7 million as of June 30, 2024. Notes receivable balance represents bank notes with maturity within six months. And as of June 30, 2025, the balance of fixed-term deposits within one year was $960.7 million compared to $1.12 billion as of March 31, 2025, and $1.17 billion as of June 30, 2024. Now on the company's cash flows.\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2025, net cash used in operating activities was $105.4 million compared to $278.6 million in the same period of 2024. And for the six months ended June 30, 2025, net cash used in investing activities was $342.7 million compared to $1.7 billion in the same period of 2024. The net cash used in investing activities in 2025 includes $87.8 million in the purchase of GP&E and $255 million related to the purchase of short-term investments and fixed-term deposits. And for the six months ended June 30, 2025, net cash used in financing activities was $32,000 compared to $43 million in the same period of 2024. And that concludes our prepared remarks.\nWe will now open the call to Q&A from the audience. Operator, please begin.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question today will come from Alan Hon of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAlan Hon: Thank you for letting me ask questions, management. I have two questions. The first one is on the policy development. Can you share some color on the latest development on the discussions on the consolidation fund or other policy development right now? And number two is on product prices. I understand like due to the pricing law, I mean the product prices increased towards the 45 to 50% level. But at the same time, I mean the sequential demand supply and channel inventory is also increasing. So how should we think about like the product price in the next three months? Thank you.\nAnita Xu: So regarding the latest development in the industry, on August 19, the MIT, also the NDRC, along with the Ministry of Social Affairs and State Administration for Market Regulation and National Energy Administration, jointly held a symposium on the solar PV industry. During that meeting, a number of government officials together with a number of solar PV manufacturers and lower power companies as well as the CPRA and relevant local industrial and information technologies departments attended the meeting. Basically, during the meeting, they reinforced that we have to curb the irrational competition of selling below cost.\nFirst, we have to strengthen the industry regulation through strengthening the management of investment in the PV projects and promote the gradual phasing out of outdated production capacity through market-oriented and law-based approaches. Second, they aim to curb low prices in the quarterly competition through improving the price monitoring and also the product pricing mechanism to track down irregular practices such as selling below cost. Lastly, to standardize the product quality, combat processes such as reducing the quality control or things like infringing IP rights. During the meeting, the essence is to support the industry self-regulation and to gradually work towards forming this buyout SPV for acquiring outdated capacity in the industry.\nRegarding prices, it will really depend on how this buyout SPV will roll out because we're still in the process of working out the details of such SPV. So it's hard for us right now to say exactly how prices will develop in the coming months. But as we can see recently, prices have increased, especially in the futures market and the expectation of rising prices. Also, if we look at the latest solar projects, that could work as a sign of the industry development. The China Huadian Corporation had a 20 gigawatt project, and from that, the module price was around RMB71 per watt to RMB75 per watt.\nSo it has really increased, and it's way above the floor prices for modules right now. We believe that has passed through to the upstream poly sector. So I hope that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Philip Shen of ROTH Capital Partners. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ingraham: Hi, this is Matt Ingraham on for Phil. Thank you for taking our questions. Kind of following up on the past question is, how sustainable do you think that higher pricing can be with the anti-involution initiatives? And secondly, what's your outlook for industry production volumes? And when would you expect to see the inventory levels be healthy again?\nMing Yang: Give us a minute. We're going to translate for Mr. Xu.\nAnita Xu: Okay. So first of all, I think one thing that's clear is that there has been consensus that selling below cash cost is unsustainable and very detrimental to the overall industry development. In our view, that's disruptive to the healthy development of the industry and hence, poses legal risks. We will be enforcing the regulations and the laws, and we think that all the industry players are on the same page regarding that. In terms of production volume, I think going forward in the next couple of months, it will be around 100,000 metric tons to around 110,000 metric tons, relatively balanced with demand per month.\nMatt Ingraham: Okay. And then you kind of talked about potentially in the past, like acquiring surplus production capacity. Is there an update on that strategy? And do you think we could see anything in the near term?\nAnita Xu: Yes. I think we're still in progress for the SPV. The whole picture will become more clear in the coming weeks or the coming months. But all the energy players as well as the power companies and the relevant regulators are all working hard toward coming to a consensus because that would be very remarkable for the industry and could set the tone for similar industries in China, such as EV and also lithium batteries. I think they're starting with solar PV, which is why they are mentioned about solar PV in the news article by People's Daily on June 30. So we are all working very hard towards coming to a result.\nWe are quite optimistic about that because that's what the industry should be, and that's good for the overall development of the industry because right now, selling lower cash cost, first of all, none of the companies is making a profit. Secondly, internationally, they have been viewing China or accusing China of antidumping, and that's not something that we want to see as a whole.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Alan Yong of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAlan Yong: Thanks a lot for taking my question. My question is about the buyback the company just announced. So I saw that the company has approved $100 million of share repurchase program. Wonder what's the thinking behind that? And also, what's the timeline in the buyback?\nAnita Xu: Yes. Thank you, Alan. So we actually just authorized this new share repurchase program today in the amount of $100 million until the end of next year. The logic behind this is that we are optimistic about the future of the industry, and we believe we could see a turning point soon. I believe previously, our valuable shareholders have been wondering when we will want to start the share repurchase. The reason why we were hesitant about it is because we believe that relying on the market to rebalance supply and demand will take a relatively long time of approximately two to three years given how strong and all the companies who have expanded their capacity this round are.\nHowever, we believe that because we are on the same page towards promoting the healthy development of the industry, we are more optimistic about the future or the outlook of the entire industry. We believe that we want to strengthen the confidence of our shareholders as well, and that's aligned with our overall strategy. In terms of the overall pace of the share repurchase program, I think that would also be contingent upon the market development, but that's definitely the first move we're working towards, strengthening the confidence in the market.\nAlan Yong: Given that the stock price of Asia is actually up off IPO price already. So will share price or shareholding reduction on the Asia to fund further buyback in USD back on the table again?\nAnita Xu: Yes. I think that's definitely a consideration given that we have been trading above the IPO issue price, right now, it should be around €30. Yes, that's definitely on the table, and we'll consider that. But I think how we want to start this program versus remaining cash on our books right now because previously, we still have a meaningful amount on the list goes. So we will start with that allocation first. But selling on Asia to repurchase on the U.S. is definitely back on the table.\nAlan Yong: That's very clear. And following the question from Alan and also Philip on the consolidation initiative. So how do you see yourself in terms of the end game like the amount of volume you will be able to produce? For example, now your guidance is around 110,000 to 130,000 metric tons for the production volume of this year. If the consolidation effort is successful, what do you think will be your production volume going forward?\nAnita Xu: I think that depends on a couple of things. If we calculate the amount of overall capacity that's built or in the process of being built, that will be around 3,500,000 metric tons at least. The production volume of how much we have produced per year will really depend on how much capacity is still remaining in the market and the overall demand per year, right? Because I think the fundamentals behind this action are that the supply would meet the demand per year from now on. So I believe that going forward, all the companies will reduce their utilization rates or operate at a utilization rate that would match the demand.\nSo it won't be 100%, at least in the coming years.\nMing Yang: Great. Thanks, Alan.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Mengwen Wang of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMengwen Wang: Hi. Thank you, management, for taking my question. I have two questions mainly related to the Polyprice outlook. So first, do we have any color on the benchmark production costs to derive the policy regulated pricing? Because I know there's a lot of news coming in to talk about selling price should not be under the production cost, but do we have any more colors on the definition of the production cost? Secondly, as we mentioned, we have been doing well in terms of sustaining the poly price hike. As a result, our shipment volume declined a bit. So going forward, how do we see how do we balance the price and inventory dynamic? Yes, that's my question. Thanks.\nMing Yang: Okay. Thanks, Mengwen, for your question. Our view is that the industry will need to sell at a price above the industry production costs. Our understanding is the industry overall, I would say the average production cost is probably in the mid-forty-ish range. Our view is that because of the Chinese law and the government policy, that will be the minimum poly pricing that industry players will be required to sell to its customers. If you look at the most recent, both transactional pricing as well as futures pricing, in the high kind of the high-40s to the low-50s, that is reflective of this new government policy that requires the industry players to sell above production costs.\nSo that is our poly price outlook going forward.\nMengwen Wang: Yes. To follow-up the question, if the poly price stays at around RMB50 per kilo and if we don't our product doesn't sell, like we keep piling up our inventory. So how do we see how to like what's our strategy in terms of this kind of situations?\nMing Yang: I think there will be industry policies and perhaps government policies supported by the government, and that will require industry supply to balance with industry demand, right? Let's say, just making assumptions, if industry demand is 1,200,000 tons per year in 100,000 tons per month, then the industry sales and the annual production will be consistent with that demand levels. So it will be adjusted so that poly pricing can be maintained at the production costs or above level.\nAnita Xu: And to follow-up on your question on inventory, I think for the big picture is people want to manage their inventory. I think the direction is to manage the utilization rates of the company so that we'll not be over demand going forward. For us, we will really have to wait to see how the regulation unfolds in the next coming weeks or the next coming months before we can decide what our strategy will be. Also, to add on, I know there are companies who are participating in the futures market. We've also participated a meaningful amount in the futures market just to hedge against risk and to arbitrage as a strategy.\nMengwen Wang: Yes. Thanks, Ming, and thanks, Anita. That's really clear. So to sum up, we are expecting some kind of policy to help the industry cut production into September. We have actively engaged in the polysilicon future market in order to mitigate the volatility of the polysilicon price, right?\nAnita Xu: We were registered as the first batch of the companies who are allowed to sell in the futures market. But strategy-wise, it will really depend on the regulations that will come out and yes, and how the spot prices will move.\nMengwen Wang: Yes. Sure. How about the policy timeline? Should we expect any meaningful policy kicking into September?\nAnita Xu: We are working towards or all of the related parties, including the CPRA, the manufacturers, and the related regulators are working very diligently toward a result coming out from the continuous meetings. However, we cannot guarantee, but we believe that because everyone is on the same page, we are working towards a result or a proposal coming out.\nOperator: The next question today will come from Shiwa Xu of CICC. Please go ahead with your question.\nShiwa Xu: Thanks, management. This is Shiwa Xu from CICC. My first question is, I thought you lowered the sales volume for the second quarter. So how's the plan on it? What's the plan for utilization rate in the future? My second question is, I saw you keep reducing the production cost. Besides the reduced cash cost, what other ways are there to reduce the cost? Thank you.\nAnita Xu: Thank you, Shiwa. So I think for the first question, the reason why the sales volume is meaningfully below the production volume is because prices are really trading at a very low level and below cash cost level. As we are working towards or working out a proposal since the first meeting that was hosted by MIT and NDRC happened in the second quarter, we were waiting to see how the policies will shift or how much capacity will phase out in the future so that we can adjust our sales strategy accordingly. We believe that once the regulations come out, if any, then we will try to maintain our inventory at a healthy level.\nMing Yang: Look, I'll follow-up. Regarding utilization rates, I think we're maintaining this 30% to 35% utilization rate. It will be subject to, for example, demand environment and pricing as well as the industry consensus or industry self-discipline in terms of supply and production. It will be a balance of those decisions. But I think currently we're maintaining the 30% to 35% utilization rate for now in the monitoring industry status and progress. In terms of production costs, I think for Q2, it is slightly lower than Q1. It's helped by both improvements in manufacturing efficiency and, for example, lower energy usage, lower metal costs. Currently, we're expecting the cost trend to continue to improve for Q3 as well.\nFor example, our current cash cost is approximately, say, $5 per kilogram right now, I think, on the current supplemental cost, which is already lower than our Q2 2025 cost. So that's the current cost status for the company.\nShiwa Xu: Thank you.\nMing Yang: Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research. Please go ahead.\nGordon Johnson: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So I guess my first question is, it seems like you guys explicitly said you intentionally held back polysilicon sales in the second quarter. Can we conclude from that you'll sell more in the third quarter, if you can provide some color there? From my calculations, it seems like you're guiding production to increase from 26,000 metric tons at the midpoint in Q2 to 28,500 in Q3 and then 40,700 in Q4. Should we take from that you intend to sell significantly more polysilicon in Q4? And then I have a follow-up. Okay.\nAnita Xu: Thank you, Gordon. First of all, I think the reason why we held back or sold relatively a lot lower than our actual production volume was because it was trading at below cash cost. As we don't want to disrupt the overall industry dynamics or I should say, as the industry has guided out, we should not be selling below the production cost. We have adjusted our sales strategy accordingly. Going forward, in the third quarter, you might have seen recently that prices have ticked up. We believe if it's not cutting below our cost, then it makes sense for us to start selling.\nLike I said before, I think it will really depend on when and how the regulations will come out, then we would adjust our sales strategies accordingly in the remaining days in the third quarter as well as going forward into the fourth quarter.\nGordon Johnson: Okay, that's helpful. Then if I think about you guys said that transactions and the futures market is around the high 40s, low 50s. Based on my calculation, that would suggest the price of around $7.7 for polysilicon USD. Yet your ASP in Q2 was $4.19. So I understand you don't have great visibility, it seems like on what you're going to sell in Q3 until policy is decided. But are you transacting at that price that you highlighted the high 40s, low 50s levels right now? Thank you for the questions.\nMing Yang: Gordon, so I think that there's two specific goals that the company is trying to achieve, right? One is based on the government policies and the new law. So I think we will sell at above our production cost for sure. I think the levels indicated are representative of the market current transactional cost. Also, another of our company's sales operations goal is to significantly reduce our inventory at hand as well given the current market dynamic environment where there's opportunity to do that. So we will try our best to do that. I guess one clarification regarding pricing is RMB price that we call actually includes a 13% VAT, okay?\nSo I think you have to divide by 1.13 to get to the actual selling price ex VAT. So that's roughly maybe 5.8 range something like that.\nGordon Johnson: Right. So I mean does that mean you guys will be gross margin positive in Q3? Thank you.\nMing Yang: Let just conclude that we expect to be generating cash from our sales. Because there's a lot of, I guess, noncash depreciation costs related to our idle facility because we're only running at one-third utilization. But I think if you remove the noncash depreciation, I think we're going to generate positive cash margin from sales.\nGordon Johnson: Very helpful. Thank you. Thank you.\nMing Yang: Okay. Good. Thanks, Gordon. Thank you.\nOperator: This will conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jessie Zhao for any closing remarks.\nJessie Zhao: Thank you, everyone, again for participating in today's conference call.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During the quarter, we continued to build up the strong momentum achieved throughout 2024 and early 2025. Despite seasonal headwinds, we made solid progress securing key new projects, expanding partnerships, and strengthening the foundation for future growth. Our results this quarter reflect the distinct execution of our lean operating strategy and reinforced our path towards growth and EBITDA breakeven in each of the remaining quarters and full year 2025. In quarter two, we shipped 532,000 units bringing the total number of vehicles on the road with ECARX Holdings, Inc. technology to over 9,300,000 as of June 2025.\nThese achievements testify to the sustained operational excellence and reliability that have become hallmarks of our execution even during these challenging times. As is typical for our industry, Q2 was impacted by seasonality and the timing of certain contracts with revenue reaching $156 million on the back of strategic investments and pricing initiatives to drive future growth. The distinct execution of our lean operating strategy helped lower operating expenses by 20% to $57.2 million with several significant new projects expected to launch in the second half. We remain on track to reach EBITDA breakeven and generate close to 20% revenue growth. The breadth of our global partnerships with automakers continues to anchor our position as a core technology provider.\nBy quarter two, I'm excited to share our current contract win already secured over $1 billion of lifetime revenue for overseas revenue. Besides our strong position in the China market, we are very confident in our strong position in the global market as well. Shipments of Antora series solution surged 112% year over year to 135,000 units during the quarter, providing ample fuel to sustain growth momentum going forward. Our broad portfolio of solutions, especially the flagship Antora platform integrated with Flyme Auto, are driving the success of several Geely best-selling models, including the Galaxy brand, which has a positive 1,000,000 accumulated sales milestone this year. This is the fastest NEV brand has ever achieved this.\nFollowing our first project award from Volkswagen Group in March 2025, I had the pleasure of accepting Volkswagen Brazil's technical development and innovation award on behalf of ECARX Holdings, Inc. at their partnership celebration in Brazil earlier this month. This award reflects Volkswagen's confidence in our technological innovation capabilities and the growing impact our innovative solutions are having on the global automotive industry. Notably, we also began monetizing our automotive R&D investments across new high-growth sectors with a leading developer of robotic lawnmowers selecting our LiDAR technology during the quarter.\nWith mass production planned for 2026, this partnership will broaden our horizon beyond the automotive sector, validate the application of our cutting-edge technologies, and help pave the way for future opportunities in the vast robotics market. As part of our global expansion strategy, our new global headquarters in Singapore is set to open in 2025 where it will accelerate our global IP management, R&D collaboration, and supply chain optimizations, enabling us to better serve our maker across global markets. In summary, despite the impact of seasonality, our results this quarter underscore the strength and momentum we are building through operational discipline and expanding pipeline of projects, growing global presence, diversified applications, and investment in technology and infrastructure.\nWe are well-positioned to drive the industry's transition to software-defined intelligent vehicles and also to hit our breakeven target. I will now pass the call over to Peter, who will go through the operating results of the quarter in more detail.\nPeter W. Cirino: Thank you, Ziyu, and good day to everyone. As Ziyu outlined, we carefully navigated typical industry seasonality and ongoing market uncertainties during the quarter and made solid progress executing our strategic priorities. We secured several major new project wins, broadened our partnerships, developed strong and innovative products, and expanded our footprint. In the second quarter, we shipped 532,000 units, bringing in the cumulative total of vehicles equipped with our technologies to over 9,300,000 as of June 30. This growing installed base is a direct reflection of the trust we have built with automakers globally and the reliability and scalability of our solutions. We currently serve 18 OEMs across 28 brands globally.\nThis is a testament to our ability to meet the diverse technology and integration requirements of leading automakers across the globe. Our partnership with Geely remains foundational. And this quarter, the momentum continued. We secured 14 new project wins from Geely alone, each slated to integrate our Antora family of solutions, further embedding our technology into Geely's best-selling lineup. Notably, our solutions enabled Geely's Galaxy brand to surpass 1,000,000 units in sales, the fastest NEV brand has achieved this milestone to date. Geely Xinghua, powered by our Venato platform and Flyme Auto Lite, also led Geely's sales in the first half of the year, highlighting both the competitive edge and the value our stack provides automakers.\nAs we deepen our core relationships, we are also diversifying and extending our technological reach. Building on the Venato platform's success in the Geely Xinghua, we formalized the partnership to provide our Venato platform to a top five Chinese automaker for their next-generation global model. Shipments are expected to begin in 2026. We are also building a customized intelligent cockpit operating system based on Flyme Auto for a leading premium global automotive brand. This represents a major milestone in our expansion into the premium global intelligent cockpit sector and reflects the growing influence and expanding market share of Flyme Auto.\nOur technical leadership is now being validated beyond the automotive sector as well, with a leading global developer of robotic lawnmowers integrating our proprietary solid-state 3D LiDAR into their products. With mass production targeted for 2026, this win demonstrates how our deep automotive R&D investments have also positioned us to capitalize on the vast potential of the robotics and AI markets, supporting our strategy of long-term multi-industry applications. Our technology was pivotal in several Geely model launches during the quarter, directly supporting and deepening partnership and further elevating our brand's market presence and technology leadership.\nIn April, the fourth generation 2025 Beau L was launched across China, built on Geely's GEEA 3.0 architecture and equipped with our Antora 1,000 computing platform, Cloud Peak cross-domain software stack, and Flyme Auto. The Beau L delivers a modern SUV experience with advanced AI integration. In May, the flagship Geely Galaxy M9 made its debut in Milan, where it immediately had an outsized impact with its groundbreaking combination of cutting-edge NEV technology, AI features, and luxury. Built on the GEA EVO native architecture, this is the first vehicle program to integrate our Pikes computing platform based on Qualcomm 8,295 with Flyme Auto.\nIn June, the Geely Galaxy A7 debuted with the Antora 1,000 platform and the custom Flyme OS offering an intuitive user interface with features such as multi-zone voice recognition and seamless voice command capabilities. Launched earlier this year, the Galaxy 8 and Xinyao 8 PHEV sedans also continue to drive strong demand. Both have our Skyland Pro ADAS solution integrated into Geely's G Pilot H1 Unified Intelligent Driving System, which provides highway and elevated road NOA functionalities. Additionally, we powered the launch of the Geely Galaxy EX5 across 26 countries, where it became one of the top-selling vehicles in Australia after just three months and the top-selling vehicle in Malaysia.\nMonthly overseas sales continue to exceed 12,000 units, reflecting the value our stack drives for automakers and the differentiated experience it offers to customers. Our business development activity during the Shanghai Auto Show in Q2 included meaningful engagements with Dongfeng Nissan, the GAC R&D center, and Renault, further expanding our pipeline. In the EU market, we now have 14 active projects we are working on with eight different global automakers and we have four wins to date. Ziyu had the pleasure of accepting Volkswagen Brazil's Technical Development and Innovation Award on behalf of ECARX Holdings, Inc. at their The One Partnership celebration in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil earlier this month.\nThis award further underscores the momentum our international business is picking up with project wins from large and globally respected brands such as Volkswagen, reflecting the growing confidence in our innovative and mature solutions and the growing impact they are having on the sector. Our global technological thought leadership was also highlighted with the release of a Google Automotive Services integration white paper showcasing the best practices and proprietary tools we use to cut GAS certification time by over 50%. This solution can be applied to GAS on our Qualcomm-based Antora computing platforms, validated by recent launches such as the PULSAR 4. Our commitment to cutting time to market for our partners continues to strengthen.\nWe showcased technological achievements in generative AI and multimodal interaction at the 2025 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai last month. Our AI-driven intelligent cockpit and driving solutions were on display at the event, reinforcing our innovation leadership. Supported by our robust hardware-software integration development capabilities, the Hongqi Tiangong-5 also recently received a major update to our ECARX Holdings, Inc. Auto GPT in-vehicle AI solution. Auto GPT now integrates DeepSeek and offers a wide array of daily high-frequency services, setting a new benchmark for user experience.\nOur extensive implementation of AI goes beyond our solutions and is also significantly improving our engineering efficiency, driving a 20% reduction in OpEx and directly contributing to our breakeven target in each of the remaining quarters and full year 2025. Following the integration of intelligent cockpit, driving, and parking capabilities into the Antora 1,000 SPB platform and the completion of the road testing on the Galaxy E5 last quarter, we recently completed system software development for our five-in-one Antora solution. This is a very exciting iteration on Antora and has already secured its first commercial project win. This solution will enable automakers to accelerate the deployment of next-generation vehicles with enhanced safety and improved user experience.\nAs a result of these efforts, we continue to expand our IP portfolio with 724 registered patents and 825 pending applications globally as of June 30, underscoring the depth and sustainability of our innovation. Supply chain resilience is critical for global scaling. Our Fujian plant now operates at 80% utilization, hitting its 1,000,000 unit annual capacity ahead of schedule. We also deepened our partnership with Samsung to accelerate the commercialization of cutting-edge technologies across automotive intelligence, terminal devices, and smart hardware. Together, we will build a sustainable open technology ecosystem, which will also capitalize on opportunities in the rapidly growing robotics and AI application markets.\nWe are also collaborating with Monolithic Power Systems on automotive intelligence, robotics, and AI applications to establish a global supply chain and intelligent ecosystem spanning system integration, platform adoption, and delivery. These initiatives are being widely appreciated across the industry with our excellence in manufacturing, procurement, and delivery recognized with inclusion in the 2025 China automotive supply chain top 100 ranking. Foundational to our global expansion is our robust compliant infrastructure. Our new global headquarters in Singapore is expected to become operational in the second half of the year. This will act as a critical hub for our global IP, R&D, supply chain, procurement, and treasury activities and allow us to support automakers across global markets.\nWe also received three ISO certifications for quality management, environmental stewardship, and occupational health and safety last month, prerequisites for collaboration with leading automakers. Together, these achievements enhance our competitive positioning and provide a robust foundation for us to extend our technology stack into AI, robotics, and embodied intelligent applications globally. In summary, our results this quarter demonstrate the disciplined execution, global expansion, and technological leadership at the heart of our growth strategy. Despite external headwinds, we are delivering on the key enablers: innovation, operational scale, global compliance, and ecosystem collaboration that position us to accelerate the industry's transformation to software-defined intelligent mobility. With that, I will now turn the call over to Phil, who will review our financial results.\nPhil Zhou: Thank you, Peter, and hello, everyone. While Q2 brought expected seasonal softness and macroeconomic uncertainty, our team's disciplined execution on strategic initiatives partially mitigated late headwinds. Total revenue for the quarter landed at $156 million. Sales of goods revenue was $131 million, a 1% year-over-year increase. The growth was primarily driven by a double-digit increase in customer demand, which was partially offset by strategic price reductions to accelerate market penetration. Our in-house development strategy is gaining significant traction. Our Antora, Venato, and the Skyland platforms now contribute a remarkable 56% to total sales of goods revenue, more than doubling from 28% in the prior year period.\nSoftware license revenue decreased 85% year over year to $1.2 million, primarily from a decline in per vehicle software license revenue coupled with lower intellectual property licenses revenue. Intellectual property licenses contributed $3.9 million revenue in the same period last year. Service revenue came in at $23 million, down 34% year over year, mainly due to lower revenue from non-recurring engineering services contracts for automotive computing platforms compared to the same period last year, which was partially offset by growth in overseas connectivity service revenue. Gross profit for the quarter was $70 million, a decline of 58% year over year with a gross margin of 11%, a 12% decrease compared with the prior year period.\nThis was chiefly attributable to strategic pricing initiatives to accelerate computing platform market penetration combined with the lower software license service revenue mix and the higher cost for the completed and non-recurring engineering projects in the current quarter. We achieved significant progress in operating expense management, reducing costs by 20% year over year to $57 million, reflecting our strong execution on operational and R&D efficiency improvements. Adjusted EBITDA loss landed at $30 million, a slight decline compared to the loss of $29 million in the same period last year. This was primarily attributable to decreased gross profit partially offset by a lower level of operating expenses and equity investment losses alongside higher other income.\nMoving on to our balance sheet, as of the end of the quarter, we had $99 million cash and restricted cash, which provides ample liquidity to fund the global expansion and next-generation technology development. We continue to strengthen working capital and profitability alongside these strategic investments. In summary, our second quarter financial results faced temporary market headwinds. They demonstrate the effectiveness of our product strategy, cost discipline, and operational execution. With several significant vehicle programs scheduled for SOP in the second half, we expect to see full-year revenue recover strongly and grow by close to 20% year over year, driven by volume growth and improved product mix.\nWith our scale growing significant pipeline and disciplined operating expense controls, we remain confident in achieving adjusted EBITDA breakeven in each of the remaining quarters and the full year 2025, a significantly improved full-year financial performance. We have full confidence in our ability to deliver on these targets through our focused execution and operational excellence. That concludes our remarks today. I would now like to hand the call back to the operator to begin the Q&A section.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now go to our first question. One moment, please. And your first question today comes from the line of Danlin Ren from CICC. Please go ahead.\nDanlin Ren: Hello? Can you hear me?\nPeter W. Cirino: Yes. Hello, Danlin. We can hear you well.\nDanlin Ren: Okay. Good evening, everyone. This is Danlin Ren from CICC Auto team. Thanks for the presentation and congrats on your results and all improvements in the first half. Now I have like three follow-up questions for you. My first question is about your non-automotive business layout, because we found that you secured a design win for robotic lawnmowers in the LiDAR domain before, right? How do you expect the development of non-automotive applications in the future? And my second question is about your progress in overseas expansion, because since we secured VW design win, what advancements have been made in acquiring international clients or establishing overseas R&D or production facilities?\nAnd my last question is could you please update on the progress of your in-house chip development? That's all my questions. Thank you.\nPeter W. Cirino: Hey, Danlin, thank you for the question. This is Peter W. Cirino. Let me try to address some answers here. I'll take them one by one. With the non-automotive business, we secured this win in the past quarter to bring our LiDAR forward on the robotics solution. So we're quite excited about that. Fundamentally at the technology level, I think that the capabilities that we're bringing into vehicles can be similarly leveraged in the industrial space, especially as automation increases there. So whether it's SoC sensors and software, we think if they get applied to a wider range of smart devices that there is potential to further expand our business in that space.\nLiDAR was a technology that we've been developing for some time and it was at a point that it could be quickly developed for the application and we're very optimistic about the potential in the future in the robotics space. Your second question was about our growth on a global level. So as you know, ECARX Holdings, Inc. has been building our capabilities throughout Europe and other international markets for many years now, starting with our efforts with Volvo Car in Sweden as early as 2021. So earlier this year, we were super excited to be able to announce the Volkswagen program as our next milestone in that space.\nAs we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have a broad set of pipeline and portfolio that we're pursuing that has more than $1 billion worth of lifetime revenue on programs we've already won. In total, we've got about 14 active programs with eight different carmakers and four wins to date, obviously VW being the one that we won. And then you can look at the announcements that we made this quarter as continued significant milestones in that space. Ziyu mentioned the award that we won from the Volkswagen team in Brazil. We were quite honored to be recognized with that award.\nI think that's a demonstration of the company's technology robustness and program delivery capability that soon after winning the Geely program were recognized on our innovation capabilities. And then the Google white paper that we announced continues to demonstrate our ability for high-quality, extremely fast software development in the automotive space. So we've I think we continue to progress on the global business and we'll anticipate seeing additional activities as the year goes on. And we also mentioned the software program in China with a leading global luxury OEM that I think is another key milestone that we'll build on with that organization as well.\nAnd then relative to our internal capabilities on SoCs, we announced many times the continued growth of our Antora platform, which is built on that capability. And we continue to find applications and opportunities to grow the Antora platform both in building additional market share as that product grows quite substantially across a number of different OEMs and then also growing the capabilities of that platform as we continue to develop software-defined vehicle applications.\nIn addition to that, we're continuing in this quarter or in this year, we'll be launching the Qualcomm A295 product into the market and we continue to have a broad set of products both on Qualcomm and other industry solutions as well as our own development solution with Cyanogen. So hope that answers your questions.\nDanlin Ren: Thank you, Peter. That's all my questions. Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now go to the next question. And your next question today comes from the line of Wei Huang from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nWei Huang: Hi. This is Wei from DB. Can you hear me?\nPeter W. Cirino: Yes, Wei. We hear you very clearly.\nWei Huang: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is, in the first half, we saw roughly 1.2 million new vehicles equipped with our solutions. Can you give us a volume guidance for the second half of the year?\nPhil Zhou: Hey, Wei, this is Phil speaking. Thank you for your question. So let me address your question. Yes, it has we keep making traction in volume and the market share growing. And in the second in the first half, we already achieved the 20% year-over-year growth in terms of volume and the momentum will continue. So as Peter just mentioned in his session, we have so many progress for the SOP in the second half of the year in 2025. So I'd love to see the volume in the second half. In the second half, we'll continue to grow. It's like 1,400,000 to 1,500,000 vehicles. That is pretty under our confidence level.\nAnd in terms of where we are able to deliver nearly 2.5 to 2,600,000 vehicles. That is also about 30% year-over-year growth.\nWei Huang: Understood. That is very clear. My second question is regarding pricing. You talked a bit about the pressure in pricing in the first half. So for some calculations in the second quarter, the content per car actually improved quarter over quarter. Can you just talk a bit about that? Is it that the impact from the government's anti-dilution policy against all the competition in the auto space? Thank you.\nPhil Zhou: Yes, sure. Thank you. So yes, we appreciate the government's confirmation on the so-called anti-dilution moves. But we also have a bit of lack of the entire industry has realized the challenge caused by the dilution and we expect this pattern will continue in the near term. So I mean, in the industry pricing cost and productivity actions will mitigate the impact and give us some room in terms of margin and recovery. So our pricing strategy is very clear. We always provide flexibility in terms of volume and market share acquisition. We always would like to maintain a share, stabilize the business, and boost up the volume, which drives our revenue growth.\nAnd to support the profitability improving, we now are taking several actions. Number one, we will keep driving our cost optimization activity. So our relentless efforts in recent quarters, we already achieved cost reduction about 20%. And then that is really helpful for us to mitigate the so-called pricing erosion due to the fierce price the market competition. And the second thing is, we really need to manage a good portfolio of solution selling. So the software is really key, all right? And which is a very good enablement to our OEM customers, including global OEM customers. So for example, you already have won a nomination of one famous OEMs regarding the Flyme Auto Corporation.\nAnd I do believe that the loss of corporation can put us in incremental software business and such kind of a recurring business will continue to improve our gross margin. Okay. So, yes, and the other thing is we are expanding our footprint into the global business aggressively and by building the operations over there and by continuously enhancing operating efficiency and productivity improvement, we certainly can drive margin recovery and profitable growth from all those sectors.\nWei Huang: Thank you. That's very clear. And my last question is regarding the ADCU business. Can you maybe update us on your store-based computing platform? And would you also maybe work with Qualcomm's flex SoCs like 8,775? Thank you.\nPeter W. Cirino: Maybe I can take that question, Wei. Thank you. I think when we look across our ECARX Holdings, Inc. SoC platform for the ADCUs, we definitely have the 8,775 on our roadmap. So we're exploring a few different opportunities with that platform both in the China market and in the global market. I think we see that trend of Fusion certainly happening within the marketplace. We're also, as we mentioned, actively on our Antora platform, in our Antora 1,000 SPP platform, also launching a somewhat of a Fusion platform in 2026 that will include parking and some Level 2 ADAS safety features on the vehicle. So we definitely see that fusion technology will come into the automotive space.\nAnd we believe with our capabilities that we will we've already prototyped and we'll shortly launch on our Antora platform where we're in an extremely good position as the Qualcomm SoCs and other additional SoCs enter the marketplace.\nWei Huang: Thank you. Very clear. That's all from me.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now take the next question. And your next question comes from the line of Yifei Lu from UOB. Please go ahead.\nYifei Lu: Hello, management. I'm Yifei Lu from UOB Kay Hian. I'd like to ask about the growth driver for the second half and next year. For example, the progress of new products, new business, and new orders intake. And my second question is about the customer cooperation and the expansion of overseas customers. Those are my questions.\nPhil Zhou: Okay. Thank you, Yifei. This is Phil speaking. So let me address your second question first and Peter probably you can also jump into your address, customer expansion, especially from the overseas expansion perspective. So let me emphasize that we keep optimizing our business portfolio proactively. And one of our strategies is to drive a diversified customer base. So we in the second quarter, we already achieved that the business mix the business portfolio in a relatively healthy way. For example, the Geely Auto business occupied nearly 40% to 50% of our total business and the Geely Ecosystem brands occupy nearly 30% to 40% and the rest of our business came from non-Geely business, which is about 15%, all right?\nAnd in terms of the customer structure, China versus overseas, now in the second quarter, our business already has been optimized to 60% and this just came from China OEMs and the rest of 40% came from global OEMs. Of course, those global OEMs include Volvo, Polestar, Smart, Proton, and other Geely ecosystem. Meanwhile, we are adding new names, new global OEMs into our portfolio for sure. Volkswagen, that is the one we won the nomination in Q1 2025 and we foresee more revenue, more business from the international brands will be in our portfolio. Okay.\nPeter W. Cirino: Yes, I would just Phil, that's a great summary. I would just add to that. Our global activity is very robust at this stage. We're seeing activities across, as I mentioned, eight different carmakers in the global marketplace and many RFQ and RFI processes that we see having the potential to close later this year and can even start to generate revenue in late 2026. So we're very excited about the potential we continue to build in the global marketplace. And I think that we'll continue to see, I would say, more exciting announcements as the year goes on as we're able to share more of that with the investor community.\nSo I think the customer diversification is continuing to be very much on track and broadening and even picking up momentum.\nYifei Lu: Thank you very much. It's very clear.\nOperator: Thank you. There are currently no further questions. I will hand the call back to Phil for closing remarks.\nPhil Zhou: Okay. Thank you everyone for your attention to our earnings call. Look, we continue to build upon the strong momentum achieved in past several quarters and this momentum will continue for sure. And while our financial performance was impacted by typical seasonal trends, we continue to make significant progress across our business, securing key wins, broadening our partnerships, and strengthening our foundation for the future. So with the solid business foundation, disciplined execution as well as new business acquisitions, we will realize adjusted EBITDA breakeven in each quarter of the remaining year. And that concludes our earnings call today. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

It is now my pleasure to introduce our Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, Larry Chen. Larry, please.\nLarry Chen: Good evening and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on Gaotu's second quarter of fiscal year 2025 earnings conference call. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to each of you for your interest in and support of Gaotu. Before I start, I would like to remind everyone that all financial figures discussed today are quoted in RMB unless stated otherwise. Over the past quarter, we maintained solid growth momentum in our core business while harnessing the power of AI to enhance our service models, bolster product innovation, and strengthen our organizational capabilities. Together, these efforts are shaping a clear growth trajectory and sustainable competitive advantages.\nUpholding our user-centric approach, we consistently upgraded our educational products, improved teaching quality, and refined service delivery. Our strategic prioritization and efficient resource allocation have significantly increased per capita productivity. As we progress through 2025, we are steadily enriching our scale of reaching efficiency and user satisfaction, underscoring the resilience and disciplined execution driving our business' high-quality growth. In the second quarter, our revenue increased by 37.6% year over year to nearly RMB 1.4 billion, with gross billings up by 36.2% to approximately RMB 2.3 billion. Thanks to our refined operational execution and improved organizational efficiency, we narrowed our net loss by 50.5% year over year on a non-GAAP basis.\nWe achieved a net operating cash inflow of RMB 588.8 million this quarter, an increase of RMB 202.6 million from the same period last year. These results reflect our ability to sustain solid growth momentum while strengthening operational quality and sharpening our competitive edge. Now I would like to elaborate on this quarter's operating highlights on four fronts. First and foremost, we are deepening our investment in AI, advancing our Always strategy to upgrade both our teaching models and technology infrastructure. These efforts aim to empower personalized learning at scale and create long-term value.\nInnovation is part of our DNA and has been a core growth driver since day one, preparing our consistent exploration and the development of emerging technologies, particularly forward-looking AI initiatives. We believe AI-driven education solutions can make personalized, adaptive learning scalable, allowing every learner to enjoy a more efficient, individualized, and high-quality learning experience. Guided by this strategic vision, we have reshaped our previous dual teacher model into an advanced tri-teacher model, integrating instructors, tutors, and AI companions. This new model deeply embeds AI throughout the teaching and the course content development process, transforming how education is delivered. For instructors, AI offers data-driven feedback and pedagogical insight to enhance teaching precision and course quality.\nFor tutors, AI tracks individual student progress and pinpoints knowledge gaps, increasing teachers' efficiency and enabling them to deliver more professional personalized learning solutions. For curriculum developers, AI accelerates analysis of learning pathways, optimizing course design and content innovation. We continue to increase our investment in AI, centering technology for innovation and our engine bolstered by a strong talent base and a robust ecosystem. More specifically, we will further advance AI innovations in educational use cases, cultivate cross-disciplinary teams between both education and AI experts, and integrate our content base and partner resources to create a highly efficient, effective, and sustainable AI-empowered learning paradigm.\nThis strategy will also lay the groundwork for high-quality long-term growth and reinforce our commitment to delivering lasting value. While preparing educational innovation, we are also embedding AI technology across our entire corporate operations and management processes as our core engine for boosting organizational productivity. By streamlining procedures and unlocking data-driven insights, we are maximizing operational efficiency and enhancing strategic decision-making. Furthermore, AI empowers every Gaotu employee to transcend the boundaries, fostering both professional growth and personal fulfillment. Together, we are building long-term market advantages and a more dynamic organization positioned for sustainable growth.\nSecond, with our user-centric approach firmly in mind, we continue to explore new products and develop innovative models to meet a wide range of learning scenarios and individual needs. We have successfully introduced a series of novel products such as the Gaotu Reading App, The Legend of Gao Xiaotu, and Maodo Love Learning, all designed to spark interest in learning, enhance the learning experience, and boost student engagement. Through ongoing exploration and market validation, we continually strive to find the optimal product market fit, driving expansion across our business. We also launched our AI flash learning model, which uses advanced algorithms to break down knowledge into granular units connected by dynamic knowledge breadth.\nThis approach enables scenario-based, bite-sized, and interactive learning that may improve efficiency and create more flexible personalized learning experiences. Third, we remain laser-focused on building a lifelong learning services platform that is accessible and enjoyable for all. Our comprehensive product portfolio spans non-academic tutoring services, traditional learning services, educational services for college students and adults, and overseas study programs both online and offline. We also offer students a selection of large class, small class, and one-on-one sessions for maximum flexibility. Our broad user coverage and robust product matrix comprehensively address diverse learning needs, strengthening Gaotu's brand awareness and reputation through word-of-mouth referrals while also driving cross-category conversions.\nBy consistently amplifying user engagement and long-term educational value, we are steadily building an enduring competitive moat in the education industry. Fourth, we remain committed to fulfilling our social responsibilities, aligning long-term shareholder value with a broader societal impact. To enhance shareholder returns as of 08\/25\/2025, we have allocated a total of nearly RMB 557 million to repurchase approximately 25 million ADS, a strong testament to our persistent focus on the long-term competence in creating shareholder value. Moreover, through the Gaotu Foundation, we have partnered with top-tier universities to establish career dream bases for college students, a one-stop career support system encompassing curated internship opportunities, employment grants, career mentorship programs, and professional development workshops.\nThis end-to-end career accelerator not only empowers young talent but also demonstrates our commitment to creating both commercial and social value with a focus on healthy growth at the heart of everything we do. I remain confident in Gaotu's future trajectory. Our diverse educational product portfolio, rapidly evolving AI technology capabilities, solid financial foundation, and highly cohesive and effective team position us for continued innovation and success. Our goal is to deliver a best-in-class learning experience to our users while creating long-term shareholder value and advancing both our social impact and commercial success. Thank you very much, everyone. This concludes my prepared remarks.\nI will now pass the call over to our CFO, Shannon Shen, to walk you through this quarter's financial and operational details.\nShannon Shen: Thank you, Larry, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I will now walk you through our operating and financial performance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. In this quarter, we remained focused on advancing our healthy growth strategy, creating solid, high-quality growth momentum. Net revenues reached nearly RMB 1.4 billion, exceeding the upper end of our guidance by 5.4%. Gross billings grew by 36.2% year over year, outpacing last quarter's growth rate by 14.4 percentage points. In addition to our top-line growth, loss from operations and net loss narrowed by 48.9% and 49.7%, respectively, reflecting continued gains in operational efficiency and outstanding resource allocation.\nDeferred revenue increased by 38.9% year over year to about RMB 2.2 billion, providing a solid foundation for sustained future growth. We maintained our ample cash position with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term and long-term investments totaling over RMB 3.8 billion as of 06\/30\/2025. Excluding the impact of share buybacks, our cash position increased by RMB 1.1 billion compared to a year ago, supported by consistent investments in enhancing user experience, course and service quality, and organizational capabilities. The profitability and operational quality of our core established business continued to strengthen.\nIn our ongoing efforts to boost operating leverage and efficiency, AI and other cutting-edge technologies are increasingly playing a crucial role in the refinement of operations, reducing operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue by 31.6 percentage points compared to the same period last year. To capitalize on the peak student demand during the summer period, we typically allocate key resources such as teacher recruitment, team training, and customer acquisition channels well in advance. Given the approximately three to six months gap between marketing investment and revenue recognition, we recommend using the ratio of gross billings to marketing investment as a more accurate indicator of customer acquisition efficiency for the online business.\nThis quarter, we not only effectively captured and converted high student demand to drive gross billings growth but also achieved a 1.7% year over year reduction in selling expenses and an increase of 38.6% in selling expenses ROI, bringing ROI to its highest level over the past four years. Simultaneously, G&A expenses and R&D expenses decreased year over year for the second consecutive quarter as a percentage of net revenues. The ratio fell by 8.0 percentage points year over year this quarter, reflecting effective and growing economies of scale. Through process optimization and data-driven decision-making, we have further enhanced group overhead efficiency, laying a strong groundwork for sustained profitability improvements going forward.\nNext, an overview of this quarter's progress by business segment. Learning services contributed over 95% of net revenues. Breaking it down, over 85% of total revenues came from academic tutoring services and other traditional learning services, representing an increase of 50% year over year. Combined gross billings from these two segments grew by over 40% year over year. Our new initiatives focused on non-academic tutoring services in both online and offline settings delivered strong growth this quarter. Gross billings were up by over 100% year over year, while net revenues from this segment recorded three-digit growth, contributing nearly 40% of total revenues. This also marked the fifth consecutive quarter of this three-digit achievement.\nBy further optimizing operational processes and teaching services quality, we boosted student retention rate for the spring semester with new enrollment student retention rate in a climbing trend year over year. In addition, we actively expanded into emerging traffic platforms and introduced innovative products to optimize our customer acquisition mechanisms, enhancing acquisition efficiency. Our traditional learning services maintained its healthy growth trajectory. While the early timing of the Spring Festival led to a year over year decline in the number of class sessions delivered this quarter, higher enrollment resulted in a 12.1% year over year increase in net revenues for the quarter, contributing to nearly 25% growth in total revenues for 2025.\nWe remain focused on localizing our curricula to better align course content and services, a strategy that has already been validated by positive outcomes from user acquisition through service delivery. Building on this early success, we plan to duplicate this model across multiple cities and regions. According to primary statistics, the number of students from Gaotu's class of 2025 admitted to the top two universities in China reached 267, marking five consecutive years of growth. To date, 1,118 Gaotu students have been admitted to the top two leading universities, a strong testament to our competitiveness across educational products, teaching quality, and learning services. Additionally, our referral rate for the second quarter surged by 75% compared to a year ago.\nThe other crucial component of our learning services is educational services for college students and adults. In the second quarter, this segment contributed over 10% of total revenues. Loss from operations from this segment significantly narrowed year over year with operating cash flow turning positive, demonstrating our strong strategic execution, effective resource planning, and increasing team productivity. Cost base from educational services for college students increased by more than 50% year over year, with operating cash flow growing over 4x. On top of ongoing improvements in our online products quality and operating efficiency, we steadily expanded our offline product portfolio and our online merge offline modules to cover a wider range of learning scenarios and means.\nIt is worth noting that Gaotu Jing Center, our flagship offline service platform for college students, reached full enrollment capacity within just three months of its launch, affirming both our regional brand's influence and this business model's commercial viability. I will now present our financials in more detail. Our cost of revenue this quarter was RMB 472.8 million. Gross profit increased 31.6% year over year to RMB 915.5 million with a gross margin of 66%. The year over year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to changes in our product mix. Total operating expenses during the quarter decreased 0.2% year over year to approximately RMB 1.4 billion.\nBreaking it down, selling expenses decreased 1.7% year over year this quarter to RMB 828.9 million, accounting for 59.1% of net revenues. Research and development expenses decreased 8.6% year over year to approximately RMB 148.2 million, accounting for 10.7% of net revenues. General and administrative expenses increased 15.7% year over year to approximately RMB 190.4 million, accounting for 13.6% of net revenues. Loss from operations was RMB 241.9 million, and operating loss margin was 17.4%. Non-GAAP operating net loss margin was 16.7%. Net loss was RMB 217.1 million and net loss margin was 15.5%. Non-GAAP net loss was RMB 206.8 million and non-GAAP net loss margin was 14.9%. Our net operating cash inflow was RMB 588.8 million.\nNow turning to our balance sheet. As of 06\/30\/2025, we held RMB 841.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, along with RMB 2.6 billion in short-term investments and RMB 387.5 million in long-term investments. This comes to a total of over RMB 3.8 billion. As of 06\/30\/2025, our deferred revenue balance was around RMB 2.2 billion, primarily consisting of tuition received in advance. As of 08\/26\/2025, we repurchased an aggregate of around 25 million ADS on the open market for approximately RMB 557 million.\nBefore I provide our business outlook for the next quarter, please allow me to remind everyone that this contains forward-looking statements, which include risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause the actual results to differ materially from our predictions. Based on our current estimates, total net revenues for the third quarter of 2025 are expected to be between RMB 1.5 billion and RMB 1.578 billion, representing an increase of 28.9% to 30.6% on a year over year basis. This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A session. Thank you, everyone, for listening.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question comes from Elsie Chang with CLSA. Please go ahead.\nElsie Chang: Thank you, management, for taking my question and also congratulations on continuing to deliver strong growth. I have a question on the offline centers development because although right now the offline is a relatively small portion of our revenue, there is potential room to grow in the future. So I would like to know our latest update, especially on the offline business, and do you have any operating metrics or indicators to share like the ramp-up and the future growth target? Thank you.\nShannon Shen: Thanks, Elsie, for your question and for your interest in our offline new initiatives. Our offline business is experiencing strong momentum and has quickly become a new growth engine for us. In the second quarter, offline learning center revenue grew by more than 20% on a year over year basis and has already contributed over 5% of gross billings this quarter. The reason behind that is, first, on the customer side, we are leveraging the unique advantage of in-person interaction to build deeper trust with students and parents in a more direct way. By precisely matching localized and personalized learning needs and fostering high-frequency engagement, we are significantly strengthening our customer loyalty.\nSecondly, from the educational product perspective, leveraging the meticulously refined online content, there is no need for the offline learning centers to build up the content from scratch. The offline learning centers are able to extend vertically our localization and personalization, speed up iteration, and improve their content quality quickly. Third, on brand awareness and headquarter support, Gaotu has strong brand recognition, enhances customer trust, and attracts high-quality talent. We have the ability to provide critical faculty support for our online operations in their early stages. We are also integrating some online private traffic with offline channels to meet diverse student needs, and it is also a strong support for our offline business to grow at the beginning stage.\nIn addition, our headquarters has been able to invest in digital infrastructure to improve the quality and efficiency of our offline operations. We already saw the trend that in certain cities, especially for those cities and regions we already entered after two to three years of operations, we are seeing a virtuous cycle where if we have strong teachers and high-quality new factories and companies there, they all drive positive word-of-mouth referrals and are able to lead to steadily improving retention rates. That is one of the reasons that in the second quarter, the growth gains in our offline learning initiative grew so fast.\nLastly, a highly efficient and professional team was assembled in the past two years, providing a strong foundation for the advancement of our offline operations. Leaders in each city are highly sophisticated, senior in experience, innovative, and proactive. This gives us strong confidence in the scalability and sustainability of their business. The cities we already entered and the learning centers we already opened have all been performing well in the past quarter. Overall, our offline business is continuously validating this business model. At the same time, its development enriches our product mix and enables us to serve increasingly diverse learning needs of our students. This means if students have a demand for online learning, they can choose our online services.\nIf a student wants a more personalized or in-person interaction, they can also choose an offline learning option. It enriches our product matrix. We look forward to the future where our offline business will bring more students and more customer satisfaction to the group. Thanks, Elsie. Hope that addressed your question.\nElsie Chang: Yes, it is very clear and congratulations again. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Crystal Li with CMS. Please go ahead.\nCrystal Li: Okay. Thanks, Larry, Shannon, and Catherine. Congratulations on the strong results. I have two questions here. One is for the summer enrollment. Could you share more color on that and maybe the industry insight? And my second question is how should we look at the full year growth outlook given your strong first half and third quarter guidance? Thank you.\nShannon Shen: Thanks, Crystal. Summer is very important for the whole academic year. As the summer enrollment season draws to a close, I mean, it is almost closed by the end of this month, we are very glad to share that our overall performance has successfully exceeded expectations, and probably you can tell from the guidance we provided for the next quarter. The biggest contributor is the improvement of teaching quality. The retention rate, a core indicator that directly reflects customer recognition and product satisfaction, delivered an outstanding performance this summer. As I just mentioned in my prepared remarks, compared to both our own historical levels and industry average, retention has been continuously improved.\nWhat surprises us more is that we saw the new student retention rate keep improving, which also helped with our customer acquisition efficiencies. From the perspective of operational efficiencies, specifically, our ROI in the second quarter improved from 1.99% in the same period last year to 2.75% this year. This means an increase of 38.6%, reflecting our significant step-up in efficiency. As I just mentioned in my prepared remarks, the absolute number of our sales and marketing expenses actually decreased on a year over year basis, but our gross billings still show over 36% year on year increase. That suggests the positive trend will continue.\nWe also have confidence in Q3 that our ROIs for sales and marketing will further improve on a year over year basis. Beyond the refinement of teaching quality, ROI gains also reflect our multiple prolonged efforts on customer acquisition, ongoing explorations of diversified channels, our long-term investment in referrals and private traffic, and systematic enhancement of organizational capabilities. Both of these efforts are inseparable from the deep empowerment of our AI technology. Our AI strategy is crystal clear, as Larry just mentioned, Always AI and Always AI. We have been patient and focused on the value chain of the whole customer journey.\nOn the student side, we are able to build up a three-teacher model adding to the dual teacher model. We have a leading instructor, a supporting tutor, and an AI instructor. The three combined can deliver comprehensive full-cycle learning support. On the teacher support side, AI takes on repetitive tasks, freeing our teachers from those repetitive tasks so they can focus more on their core educational value like sparking curiosity and shaping characters of students. This, in turn, continuously enhances our teachers' professional well-being and personal satisfaction. Actually, in the summer and in the peak season, they can actually reduce their working hours in the peak season. That is a big step.\nOn the operational side, AI is optimizing efficiency across the entire value chain. This includes faster customer service response through AI assistant interactions like automatic Q&As, more precise user profiling for targeted operations, and intelligent optimization of operational processes. All these initiatives not only drive cost reduction and efficiency gains but also provide a solid technology foundation for sustainable business growth. Leveraging all these efforts, we are able to lay a solid foundation for the whole year's growth. We set an initial goal at the beginning of this year to target around 30% year over year revenue growth.\nIf we look at the total numbers we have gathered, our total revenue growth rate for the first half of this year stood at around 47.3%. The upper limit of the Q3 revenue guidance we just provided is 30.6%. From this perspective, our year over year revenue growth for the first nine months will exceed 40%, a figure that significantly surpasses the upper limit we set for the full year goal at the beginning of the year. Therefore, we will also accordingly raise our expectations for the same revenues. I hope that addresses your question, Crystal. Thanks.\nCrystal Li: Very clear.\nOperator: As there are no further questions now, I would like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks.\nCatherine Chen: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.

This is Motley Fool Money.\nWelcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Tyler Crowe, joined by longtime Fool contributors, Lou Whiteman and Rachel Warren. Second quarter earnings are coming to a close, but we still have some big companies reporting earnings and making some big management moves. Today, we're going to cover management shakeups at Target and Estée Lauder and also some mergers and acquisitions activity in an arms race between Lowe's and Home Depot. But before we begin with that, we're going to start with everyone's favorite family dinner conversation, which is, are we in an AI bubble? It's been a driving force the AI story for much of the market in 2025. We've seen a lot of companies, more than double and post some incredible numbers so far this year, but it hasn't been without hiccups. We had the DeepSeek crash, I guess, if you will, back in January, that sent markets into a tizzy. Then this week, I think it was actually over the weekend, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman actually said to reporters, and I quote, \"Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are over excited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.\" Pretty bold and evocative statement from Sam Altman. In addition to those comments, we've seen some pretty sharp stock declines with some AI companies reporting earnings, and some of these darlings are down pretty considerably. Palantir is down almost 18% over the past week as of our recording, and CoreWeave the AI Data Center company is down 40% its reported earnings last week. Rachel and Lou, I want to toss this to you. Rachel, you can go first. What do you make of Sam Altman's statement about AI and is the AI market looking bubbly to you?\nRachel Warren: I do think this was a really interesting comment from Mr. Altman, particularly given that OpenAI remains one of the most public and prominent players in the AI race. You remember many fears of an AI bubble hit a fever pitch earlier this year back when the Chinese start-up DeepSeek released their competitive reasoning model. They claimed that one version of their advanced large language models had been trained for under $6 million, and that's compared to billions like OpenAI has spent. Then earlier this month, Altman said that OpenAI's annual recurring revenue is on track to pass $20 billion this year, but they're still unprofitable. Then the release of their latest GPT-5 AI model earlier this month, it wasn't so great either, so much so that the company restored access to Legacy GPT-4 models for paying customers. I do think that we can trace some similarities to the dot-com bubble when you're looking at the current AI boom. You have rapid surges in investment companies receiving massive funding rounds based on the potential of the underlying tech. Sometimes there isn't a clear path to profitability. I do think that some companies might be getting a bit ahead of their skis in terms of valuation. But I think it's important to underscore. AI is not just a blanket catch all term, even though it tends to be used that way. AI is everything from AI algorithms that are analyzing medical images to assisting doctors in faster and more accurate diagnoses to the AI that we see being used to control and automate robots and manufacturing, logistics and other industries. Major companies like Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Amazon, and others are incorporating AI into their everyday operations. The technology is real. It's rapidly evolving, and it is here to stay. I think that's the important point to remember.\nLou Whiteman: I think it's so interesting because there's what Altman said and the way the headlines have taken off with it the idea, we're in a bubble, everything's trouble. That's not really what he said. We sometimes think of the word bubble and we think of worthless and think the same thing. We know that isn't true. Some stocks can be in a bubble, but yet, there's also something going on that's creating something profoundly profitable, profoundly society changing over time. I think what Altman was trying to say is that, yes, some valuations are getting frothy, but, hey, investors, workers who might be getting poached by other companies, if things are frothy, if there could be winners and losers here, why don't you want to just stay with one of the big winners, one of the big guns? I think he was talking to a specific crowd. I don't think he was predicting gloom and doom.\nTyler Crowe: Certainly my take is, and I've said this before in other spaces, but the idea that the winner of AI has emerged, I think, is a little early. The best example I can give is Google, which emerged many years after Internet search had been a big thing with Yahoo, Netscape, Ask Jeeves, all these other options that have pretty much gone the way of the dinosaur, and I think we could see something relatively similar with late emerging opportunities, as well. Lou, when we think about opportunities and maybe a little bit from the lens I just mentioned, where are you seeing the opportunities for AI right now?\nLou Whiteman: Well, for one, back on the bubble thing, let's just point out that we both had a dot-com bubble, and companies like Amazon emerged. Even if there is a bubble, valuations may be stretched, but there still will be long-term winners among the companies we're talking about. For me, right now, it's all about diversification, whether it's Amazon or if it's Apple or Microsoft and Alphabet, these are companies with a lot of ways to win, and AI is part of that. But take that versus a Palantir or CoreWeave where all of your eggs are in the AI basket. I would much rather be with a diversified company. I don't really like the picks and shovels, though. I think these have gotten just as over valued or maybe even more so than some of the main players. I love the idea that we're going to need energy, we're going to need data centers. I think that's all true, but I also think that that's very priced in. If there is a bubble, I almost think it's there and not just the big companies that are using it.\nTyler Crowe: Rachel, for investors who are trying to identify, like things with durable growth stories, durable advantages versus an AI hype play, how do you think investors should look at it as separating between the two?\nRachel Warren: I think, fundamentally, there needs to be a real business that's underpinning that technology. Looking for companies that are solving tangible real world problems or maybe is being used to optimize existing processes, not just a company using AI for the sake of using AI. Then also when you're looking at some of these businesses, are these AI applications providing clear value? How does a company plan to generate revenue from its AI business? Is this a sustainable model with potential for growth? Ultimately, I think, especially amid the AI boom where you're trying to really separate the wheat from the chaff, so to speak, you need to be looking for companies with sustained revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and positive free cash flow, which suggests they're generating enough cash to fund their operations and invest in their future AI growth. I think that's why we get back to a lot of these major players like the Amazons and Alphabets, because there is a real business there, and they are incorporating massive revolutionary AI elements into their businesses which have remained the crux of their respective industries for decades.\nTyler Crowe: The AI story, I feel like we could go in so many different angles, but we are still in the midst of earning season. We're going to move on, and coming up next, we're going to look at two retailers who are looking to new leadership right now to turn their prospects around.\nTarget reported earnings earlier today that were well, less than great. Before we recorded this episode, we were planning on discussing Target's earnings through the lens of tariffs because it's been such a hot topic of lately. But then the company threw us a little bit of a curveball and announced that current chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke will be taking over the CEO spot from Brian Cornell, starting in February of 2026. Now, Target's earnings did beat Wall Street's expectations, but they were pretty low expectations to begin with, and it maintained its guidance for the rest of the year, and its stock was down 7% today as of this taping. What stood out to you in the earnings or the announcement of the CEO change? What can Fiddelke do to actually turn things around here?\nRachel Warren: I do think it's important to highlight it. Target has a range of issues it's facing right now, and they do predate the tariff environment. Some of these problems are related to the consumer, but a lot of Targets issues also go back to the waning days of the pandemic. We saw consumers pull back on expenditures as inflation increased, and they focused more on needs-based categories. There has been this real significant shift to value. In many cases, that has led consumers to competitors like Walmart. Targets also faced criticism and boycotts in recent years that have severely impacted sales, and it has yielded ground to competitors in key areas where it used to lead, HomeGoods being one vital category. As you noted, they just reported their Q2 sales and earnings. Net sales in the quarter were down 0.9% from a year ago, comparable sales fell 1.9%, operating income fell by 19.4%. They did see a 14% increase in non-merchandise sales. Their digital sales grew about 4%. Tariffs, of course, are likely to erode some of their profit margins. There's also a very likely reality that they're going to need to raise some prices, and that could impact consumer expenditures. Cornell will remain executive chairman, but I do think it's clear that management is looking to right the ship, and they think that a new leader at the CEO helm is an important step. I do think Target can come back from this, but it's going to require time and patience. Again, a lot of these issues predate what we've seen in its industry the last several months. One thing I'll note, this is still a major dividend payer for investors, 54 consecutive years of dividend increases and counting. That might be one reason to look at Target on the dip right now.\nLou Whiteman: Can come back from it, but a big emphasis on can for me. I'm not ready to make a call, and I don't want to be too scared here, but retail is full of seemingly just powerhouse brands that just suddenly disappear or lose their mojo. Again, I don't know if that's what's going to happen to Target, but I think target investors have to be a bit worried here. Ask Cole's investors, ask Sears investors, ask JCPenney's investors. Big, well established brands can go from all as well to things go terribly wrong and not recover. I think, as Rachel said, this has been a long time coming. On the back end, you talk to Target suppliers, and they'll say, we get dealing with two or three people a year. It's just chaos. I'll say this, I think Michael Fiddelke has a big task up ahead just to stabilize a business that doesn't feel stable to me. I'm hopeful, but I don't think it's a slam dunk because guys, honestly, what does Target bring to the retail table that you can't get somewhere else? What is their go to thing? I can't answer that question, and if I was thinking of investing, that would really scare me.\nTyler Crowe: It is a tough question to ask, and at the same time, I don't think it's a coincidence that a lot of the retailers and brands and a lot of the companies we've been talking about have been struggling is coming in a pretty volatile post COVID world. I think a lot of companies have been shaken to their core and haven't quite found their way out of the woods yet. In that same vein of new leadership, Estée Lauder reported its fiscal fourth quarter earnings today, as well. Sales were down 8% for the year. Net income swung to a huge loss, but a lot of that came from significant impairment and restructuring charges because new management came in and is looking to make significant changes. CEO Stéphane de La Faverie came in in January and took over for longtime serving CEO, as well as displacing the Lauder family a little bit, who have been tied to the C-suite, tied to the board. There was a little bit of corporate drama. I know the Wall Street Journal covered it pretty extensively coming up to that. But Rachel, I'm going to toss this to you. Do you think that this corporate shakeup that de La Faverie is proposing is going to really work, and will it allow Estée Lauder to get back on track to being a winning company that it was for as long as it was?\nRachel Warren: You're right. This does have such an extensive history of being a winning company as one of the legacy players in the beauty space. I think the jury's still out as to whether this turnaround will be effective. I do think that they still have a place in the industry, but it's going to be an uphill battle. They are seeing sales declines across pretty much all of their core segments, and there are some very practical reasons for that. One being that Estée Lauder heavily and historically had relied on the Chinese market for growth, especially through tourist spending as well, and in European markets. But China in particular, their luxury market has experienced a significant slowdown, and that's really impacted Estée Lauder sales, and a lot of their strategies through the years, which had been really successful in the past, have failed to resonate with the latest and youngest generation of beauty consumers, and it has become an increasingly competitive space in the years since Estée Lauder's heyday. This is also a company that was slow to adapt to the shift toward online beauty sales and online shopping. We saw even competitors like L'Oréal that invested more heavily in online channels. Estée Lauder continues to face really fierce competition from other emerging beauty and skincare brands. One obvious example is e.l.f. which just acquired Haley Bieber's brand Rhode and also owns many other key brands in the modern beauty space. Of course, now there's the tariff factor that is compressing margins across the industry. Estée Lauder, they have had significant workforce reductions. They've been shifting their marketing strategy. They've been reevaluating some of their supplier relationships. But time will tell the environment they're operating in now is very different than that of 15 or 20 years ago.\nTyler Crowe: In the age of TikTok, airport duty free seems a little outdated in terms of your dedicated sales model. Next up, we're going to talk about Home Depot's and Lowe's who are taking a very different approach to slugged growth in the past couple of years. Does it ever feel like you're a marketing professional just speaking into the void? Well, with LinkedIn ads, you can know you're reaching the right decision makers.

Terms and conditions apply. We just discussed two retailers looking to new leadership to shake things up, but home improvement retail has also been moving and shaking quite a bit in the past couple of years. But instead of fresh faces in the front of the C-suite, they're actually looking to acquire their way out of a slump. Just today, when Lowe's announced their earnings for the quarter, it was also announced it was buying building products distributor foundation building materials from a private equity company for about $8.8 billion. Now, this just comes a few months after Home Depot announced it was acquiring GMS, its second specialty building products distribution company in as many years. Now, Home Improvement retail has been in the dumps for a myriad of reasons of interest rates, COVID. You name your crisis over the past five years. I want to start with Lou this time. What do you make of these moves of moving into professional contracting specialty product distribution?\nLou Whiteman: Tyler, I can't answer this without bringing up a third company, QXO, which is also trying to consolidate this industry. They, of course, are run by Brad Jacobs, who has consolidated the tool rental industry, has consolidated trucking, has consolidated waste. Whether or not QXO ends up being a success, I do believe Brad Jacobs knows how to identify a market ripe for a roll up. I have no idea if he assumed Home Depot and Lowe's will goes aggressively in when he started QXO or if this is turning into a problem. But I do think if you look at there's 75,000 very small little companies here. It's fragmented the logic of a roll up and a logic for a Home Depot or Lowe's to go in and try to roll up this industry. It's there, and I think on paper, at least, it makes sense, whether it works for Lowe's, whether it works for Home Depot, that we'll have to see.\nRachel Warren: I think if you take a step back, this makes a lot of sense. First of all, it's worth pointing out that Home Depot commands a much larger market share and significantly higher revenue than Lowe's, and it has a more extensive store network. It's historically really focused on serving professional contractors. Those represent something like half or about 45% of its sales, and Lowe's needs to gain ground here. Its recent moves make sense. They also recently acquired a company called Artisan Design Group for $1.3 billion as they're really trying to strengthen their presence in the new home construction market, expand their pro services. They have rolled out their total home strategy, where they're looking to be a one stop shop for DIY as well as pro customers. But the reality of the environment in which Home Depot and Lowe's are operating in remains, we know that high interest and mortgage rates have discouraged home buying and selling. Consumers are allocating their spending to other areas. I think that these are both, solid value driven businesses. Focusing on the pro market, I think is a right move for them. But I do think we're going to continue to see sluggish growth figures unless and until the environment in which they're operating starts to relax and we start to see growth again.\nTyler Crowe: It feels like the building products industry specifically has been a little bit of a small fish, or bigger fish eat smaller fish until another bigger fish comes along. Lou, I'm going to ask this last question. Is there enough room in this market for basically three giant sharks? I'm including three because you really pitched QXO so well. If Home Depot's, Lowe's, and QXO are all simultaneously looking at major roll ups, is there enough room for them to eat?\nLou Whiteman: There is enough in theory. My fear is what this does to pricing. Not all assets are created equal. I think I'd be surprised if Home Depot or Lowe's wants to put too much more capital work here with these big deals they've done. I think that does provide a lane for QXO, but there's a lot of work to be done. Not all assets are created equal, and it will be curious to see who makes the right decisions as far as capital allocation and who ends up with the right fortress asset at the end of the day when everything's cobbled together.\nTyler Crowe: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stock they talk about, and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The omission underscores the uncertainty hanging over US chipmakers amid Washington's trade tensions with Beijing.\nThe US has allowed Nvidia to send China its H20 chips, which are less powerful next-generation Blackwell technology, in exchange for a cut of the company's revenue. However, China's government has advised domestic companies to use alternative chipmakers.\nNvidia stock has rallied roughly 35% year to date to lead the AI tech trade.\n- Laura Bratton\nWall Street watches for 'near term speed bumps' in Nvidia's China results\nGoing into Nvidia’s (NVDA) earnings after the bell, Wall Street will be closely watching the chipmaker’s performance in one of its key markets: China.\nNvidia was hit with a surprise export ban on sales of its H20 chips to China in April — a move that was set to cost the chipmaker $8 billion in lost sales in its second quarter. In yet another unexpected move, the Trump administration said in July it would grant Nvidia export licenses for its H20 chips in exchange for 15% of the revenue from those sales — an agreement likely to face legal challenges due to the US Constitution’s ban on export taxes.\nThe reversal of the ban could help Nvidia recoup as much as $15 billion in revenue from China in the second half of the year to hit around $20 billion from the region for its 2026 fiscal year, which ends next January. That would be an uptick from its roughly $17 billion in sales from China in 2025.\nBut analysts have moderated their optimism over any uplift from Nvidia’s sales to China headed into Wednesday’s report, with Stifel analyst Ruben Roy noting their could be “near-term speed bumps” related to Nvidia’s position in that market.\nThat’s because Nvidia has reportedly asked its suppliers to halt production of components for its H20 chips. The news came after conflicting reports over whether China is ordering companies to stop buying Nvidia’s H20 chips. The Information reported earlier this month that China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, issued a directive to tech companies to suspend their purchases of Nvidia’s chips. But the same day, a Reuters report said authorities were questioning Chinese companies over their orders of H20 chips, not ordering them to stop those purchases.\nMore will be revealed in short order.\n- Ines Ferré\nNvidia steady as investors await AI giant's earnings\nNvidia (NVDA) stock was steady with less than one hour of trading before the close as investors awaited the AI chip giant's highly anticipated earnings.\nNvidia has been the poster child of the artificial intelligence trade.

In New York City, however, a family of four could earn as much as $129,600 and still be at 80% of AMI.\nRead more: What is down payment assistance?\nMortgage lenders typically base income-based loans on HUD's definition. You can find the AMI in your area by typing your ZIP code into Fannie Mae's AMI lookup tool.\nSome lenders reserve certain products for people with \"very low\" (up to 50% of AMI) or \"extremely low\" (up to 30%) income, while others accept applicants making up to 100% of AMI, which HUD considers \"moderate income.\"\nSome financing isn't based on income at all. Lenders may consider census tract information to target historically underserved communities.\nHow much house can I afford?\nYou can determine how much you can spend on a house by looking at your monthly housing budget, which HUD says should be no more than 30% of your gross monthly income. (That includes mortgage or rent payments, property taxes, home insurance and utilities.)\nSomeone earning $100,000 a year — or roughly $8,333 a month — should spend no more than about $2,500 a month on housing.\nTo see if a house is within your budget, plug the list price into our mortgage calculator below. If the monthly payments on it are less than 30% of your income, it's probably affordable. If they're more, it's likely beyond your budget.\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

When possible, we noted if a lender had lower fees, discounts or waived certain fees.\nCustomer service: We gave more weight to lenders that scored highly on J.D. Power's mortgage origination and servicing surveys. We also noted if they had robust customer service phone hours and a website with an online chat feature and educational resources.\nWe also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools.\nCatch up on CNBC Select's in-depth coverage of credit cards, banking and money, and follow us on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date.","content_hash":"399215ee863fe7930a5f64406744099f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":11919,"method_rank":0}

","published_at":"2025-08-27T20:45:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"After saving for her two children’s college educations, financial planner Betsy Hutchins expected her household finances to ease up a bit when they left for school.\nHer daughter, who recently graduated from college, required mental healthcare during her second year, resulting in unexpected medical costs. Hutchins also said she traveled back and forth between home and her daughter’s school “to spend time with her and make sure everything was OK.” As a result, she estimates, she accrued an additional $5,000 to $6,000 in expenses that year.\nWith her son now in college, Hutchins no longer has children living at home — but she is still giving him a $200 monthly allowance to cover some necessary expenses, like gas, and give him some experience managing money for entertainment, she said. While the allowance is roughly half what she gave him for food and activities when he was home, she realizes that the costs of having a kid in college will likely fluctuate, including when unforeseen expenses come up.\nWith classes back in session around the country, parents who had saved for years and are sending their teens to college for the first time “may be expecting that there’s going to be a little more breathing room at home” now that the kids are out, Hutchins, the owner of Forward Financial Planning, told MarketWatch. But based on her experience, “I don’t know that necessarily that would be the case.”\nJust as college marks a transition for young adults, it is also a transition for parents, who reach a crossroads that requires re-evaluating — among many other things — their household finances as they settle into a new normal. For many parents, it is a period during which their kids still require some financial support, albeit in different ways from when they were younger, and new scenarios arise that require a financial cushion.\nOmen Quelvog, a financial planner and founder of Formynder Wealth Management, has one adult child in the military and will soon have another in college. “I thought that our finances would just kind of naturally free up and we’d be spending less money,” he said. “I think what I didn’t realize, what I didn’t see coming, was that your kids are always your kids.”\nMarketWatch asked financial planners how parents of college kids can prepare for these financial shifts. They said that while some household bills like groceries, utilities and subscriptions tend to go down, others go up — particularly if some share of parents’ salaries starts going to tuition and other school expenses. While parents may have ideas about how they’d like to save or spend their extra cash, they added, it is wise to take stock before making any major changes.\n“When there’s a big change like this, it really requires a full review,” Alanna Morey, a financial planner and private wealth advisor at Ameriprise, told MarketWatch. “What are your expenses now? How have things changed? And have any goals changed now that you’re out of this period of life?”\nHow families pay for college\nFor the 2024-25 school year, the average annual total cost to attend a four-year college ranged from about $30,000 at a public, in-state university to $63,000 at private colleges, according to data from the College Board.\nFor the typical family with a kid in college, who pay about $30,800 per year for their education, the largest source of funding (38%) comes from parents’ income and savings — which includes their current income, 529 college savings and other savings accounts, and retirement-savings withdrawals — according to Sallie Mae’s “How America Pays for College 2025” report. This is followed by scholarships and grants (27%), student loans (12%) and parent loans (11%).\nMore than half (58%) of parents rely on their current income to cover some share of these expenses; they spent $9,550 of their income on average during the last academic year, Sallie Mae data show. This averages out to about $800 each month, which can significantly impact a household’s budget.\nHutchins said that while she was able to put away enough to cover two-and-a-half years of college costs for her son, “from a budgeting perspective, our expenses will go back up” to pay for tuition and fees when those savings run out in his junior year.\nSome parents also continue to deal with college costs well after their children graduate. While federal student loans are the most common form of college debt, it’s not uncommon for parents to borrow as well: 11% of families took out a Parent PLUS loan; 11% put expenses on parent credit cards; 9% took out a private loan; 7% took a loan from their retirement account; and 6% took out a home-equity line of credit, according to Sallie Mae.\nFinancial planners generally advise parents against prioritizing their children’s college costs over their own retirements.\nOnce college is done, parents should “look to see if there are any holes anywhere,” Morey said. “Have you accumulated debt while your children have been in school? Is there anything that we should pay down? Do you have a good cash cushion in the bank for yourselves? We know you’ve been focused on getting your child through school, but what about you?”\nHopefully, parents in this position will “be able to increase some savings that have been neglected” for years, Morey added.\nHow to prepare for the financial transition of having kids in college — beyond tuition\nCreate a separate $5,000 college emergency fund.\n“There will be expenses you did not anticipate, no matter how careful you are with your student’s budget. Consider setting aside $5,000 extra in your emergency fund for the college years,” Cynthia Meyer, a financial planner with Real Life Planning, told MarketWatch.\nThis would be in addition to a parent’s standard emergency fund worth six months of living expenses in case of unemployment.\n“I made all kinds of financial mistakes while I was in my 20s,” Quelvog told MarketWatch. It is rewarding to have the money available to continue to support them when they need it — “because they will need it,” he said — and it also provides an opportunity to teach financial lessons.\nRebudget to account for hidden college costs — and come to an agreement with your child about how to cover them.\nAlong with your child, budget for miscellaneous expenses like entertainment, transportation and travel back home, which can add up to anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars, and reach an understanding about who will take responsibility for these costs.\n“Talk with the student about financial responsibility and what kind of financial help you will or won’t provide,” Betty Wang, a financial planner with BW Financial Planning, told MarketWatch.\nSome parents continue to pay for these expenses in college, while others start to shift some financial responsibilities to their children.\nIn October 2024, about 41.4% of full-time college students and 76.5% of part-time college students were employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nEstablish boundaries if your child takes longer than four years to graduate.\nMore than 1 in 5 bachelor’s degree holders took longer than four years to graduate in 2023. But it’s important not to let your child’s college costs derail your own retirement goals.\n“Make sure your student is planning their classes carefully every semester,” Meyer said. “Let your student know if they will need to borrow more for any classes beyond four years.”\nGive yourself three months to understand your new normal before making huge spending changes.\nWith their teens out of the house, parents may have lots of plans for their money, but it is wise to “move slowly with any budget changes,” Quelvog said. “Take a few months and watch where the changes occur. It’s not just in the grocery budget; there are little areas that add up, such as electricity usage, water usage or maybe a subscription you had that only your teen used.”\nFor instance, Quelvog noted, when his child left for the military, the household grocery budget fell by $300 per month. His son got his own auto insurance, which lowered the household insurance premium by more than $100 each month, and the family spent about $30 less each month on gas for the car.\n(For parents sending their kids to college without a car, Wang said that even listing your child as a “student away” or “occasional” driver may drop your auto-insurance premiums, depending on the company and the child’s driving record.)\nOnce you’re dialed into your new normal, you’ll know how much you can safely change in your budget — “whether that be more dates, more travel or even more savings,” Quelvog said.\nCreate a plan for any newfound cash\n“Extra money finds its way into cracks and crevices here and there, and if people aren’t careful, it could wind up just getting spent needlessly” instead of going toward more impactful goals, Quelvog said.\n“You absolutely can reduce expenses when your kids leave the house,” he added, so make a plan for what to do with that extra money when you identify how much there is.\nFor instance, Quelvog said he and his wife are putting more money toward their IRAs. “You can really name your goals. If you want to go on cruises or whatever the case might be, it’s really a great time to re-evaluate what is important to you,” he said.\nCalculate the financial impact of downsizing your home\nPerhaps not immediately after a child leaves for college, but eventually, many parents seek to downsize their home to reduce the money spent on housing and the time spent on upkeep.\nHowever, home-affordability issues today have eroded the incentives typically associated with downsizing; 1 in 3 baby boomers in a Redfin RKT survey this year said they never plan to sell, with many citing financial reasons. Some said their home is paid off, others noted that home prices are too high right now to trade down, and some didn’t want to give up their low mortgage rate.\n“Even if they downsized, they may have a nearly identical monthly payment,” the real-estate brokerage noted in a separate report.\nYour home “is one of your largest assets,” Ameriprise’s Morey said. With the kids out of the house, “you may need to sell it at some point to continue living the lifestyle that you want to live in retirement.”\nWhat’s important is understanding whether the trade-off is worth it in today’s housing market.","content_hash":"d8cf9ed73c435cd116c3188d13ce90ae","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":10308,"method_rank":0}

Nvidia’s stock tore through Wall Street expectations and crowned the company more valuable than Microsoft and Apple. Microsoft pledged to spend like a sovereign wealth fund to bulk up Azure. Google rewired its entire roadmap around Gemini. Meta, never shy about a grand narrative, promised that “superintelligence” was within reach — and CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent like it . The numbers matched the rhetoric: a trillion of market cap here, a trillion there, tens of billions in quarterly capital expenditures.\nThe refrain was simple and contagious: inevitability.\nBut inevitability can have a short shelf life in the world of technology. Over the past month, three jolts in particular have rattled the story. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has made a career out of selling a version of the future, said the quiet part out loud : Asked if he thinks we’re in an AI bubble, he said, “Yes.” Meta, after months of splashy AI hiring and rhetoric, has reportedly frozen recruitment and chopped up its “super” lab. And MIT published research that went viral on LinkedIn, estimating that 95% of enterprise AI pilots return no business value . That trifecta — a prophet hedging, a zealot pausing, and academics bringing receipts — turned inevitability into a question.\nMarkets noticed.\nNvidia, the totem of the AI boom, will be treated less like a stock and more like a stress test for the entire economy when it reports its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Its earnings call isn’t just another quarterly update — it’s the hinge on which the hype rests. Wall Street expects another record, roughly $46 billion in revenue. But at a $4 trillion valuation, “better than expected” may not be good enough. If the golden child stumbles, even slightly, the talk on whether the tide is turning on AI gets louder. Already, cracks have shown. After a mid-August surge, tech stocks, including Nvidia and other AI-heavy firms, pulled back by about 1.6%, even as energy and real estate rose. Analysts warn that the Nasdaq’s 41% gain since April may have inflated valuations — a frothiness that makes every earnings print feel like a cliffhanger.\nAnd that’s why Nvidia’s earnings call has been elevated into a kind of secular rite.\nAI’s signs of strain aren’t confined to trading screens. They’re everywhere.\nTake Humane’s AI Pin. The $700 wearable was hyped as the next iPhone — an AI-native device to liberate us from screens. It lasted less than a year before its assets were offloaded to HP in what amounted to a mercy sale. Or, take Microsoft’s Recall, the feature billed as a photographic memory for your PC. Privacy watchdogs called it a surveillance nightmare, and the company had to walk back its rollout plans. For an industry that loves to declare “this changes everything,” the first wave of consumer products has changed very little, except investor patience.\nThe corporate numbers don’t look much better. MIT’s study put hard math on what many CIOs already suspected: Nearly all of those shiny AI pilots amount to little more than slideware. That finding rippled through boardrooms and social media feeds because it finally gave executives cover to say what they’d been whispering: AI demos are impressive, but they’re not showing up in the P&L.\nEven among developers, the ground feels shaky. Stack Overflow’s 2025 survey found that while 84% of coders now use AI tools, only 3% say they “highly trust” the outputs. Adoption is skyrocketing, but confidence is collapsing. The result is a paradox: AI is everywhere, and yet no one quite depends on it.\nMeta’s reported recent pivot has only added to the sense of recalibration. After a year of Zuckerberg touting “superintelligence” and stuffing its payroll with AI hires for mind-boggling sums, the company suddenly froze recruitment, restricted transfers, and broke its mega-lab into four groups. The official line was focus. Some analysts called it discipline. But to most people watching, it looked like fatigue. For an industry that treats “more” as a strategy, a pause from one of the biggest spenders was its own kind of confession.\nWall Street hasn’t pulled the plug. Wedbush analyst (and raging tech bull) Dan Ives insists this is still “the second inning” of an AI bull market.\nBut the market’s edginess shows up in the tape: Palantir shares plunged more than 9% in a single session amid bubble chatter, while Nvidia dropped about 3.5% the same week. And Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan professor known for his bubble calls, warned Business Insider that the AI bust could prove even uglier than the dot-com collapse — pointing to CoreWeave’s stunning 33% valuation plunge , a $24 billion wipeout in just 48 hours, as a canary in the coal mine.\nIf sentiment is wobbling, the spending machine hasn’t slowed. In fact, it’s accelerating. Microsoft just guided to roughly $30 billion in capex for the current quarter — the largest quarterly spending in corporate U.S. history. Google parent company Alphabet raised its 2025 budget to $85 billion. Meta, freeze notwithstanding, bumped its capex range to between $66 and $72 billion. These aren’t cautious checks. And the trend extends far beyond those companies. The Financial Times estimates that global AI infrastructure spending could hit $3 trillion by 2029, with nearly $750 billion pouring into data centers in just the next two years. It’s an arms race built on concrete and servers, not just rhetoric.\nWhy? Because the infrastructure race is the only part of the AI boom that still feels like a sure thing. Nvidia’s GPUs are the scarcest resource in tech. CoreWeave, a cloud startup that barely existed three years ago, is now buying up data centers as if they’re beachfront property. Analysts may debate the future of copilots and chatbots, but no one questions the future of compute.\nThe line from Big Tech is consistent: The returns are there in cloud, ads, and developer services; the spending is the bottleneck. That’s why the market can wobble on sentiment and still finance another data center. But there’s also concentration risk baked in. Tech giants now make up roughly 40% of the S&P 500. If AI sentiment turns, it’s not just a few stocks at stake — the entire market could feel it.\nThere’s a macro-version of this paradox, too. A John Thornhill column in the Financial Times argues that we’re in Carlota Perez’s “installation” phase — manic investment, messy results — before a “golden age” can materialize. Deutsche Bank analysts have echoed the concern, warning that the AI buildout mirrors past bubbles from 18th-century canals to the 1990s dot-com and telecom frenzies: vast overbuilding justified by the promise of transformation, only to pop when belief thinned. The New Yorker made a similar case this week , saying we’re in an AI profit drought: vast spending, thin P&L evidence, long J-curve. All three narratives map cleanly onto what operators are saying privately.\nBut the physical costs are coming due. AI workloads demand so much power that Google signed a deal with the Tennessee Valley Authority and a nuclear startup just to keep its Southeast data centers running. Researchers have quantified the water consumption of model training, showing that every breakthrough comes with an invisible utility bill. The “cloud,” it turns out, is built of concrete, copper, and cooling towers.\nRegulators have woken up, too. On Aug. 2, the EU’s AI Act began applying obligations to general-purpose models: transparency about training data, mandatory risk assessments, and new safety disclosures. The stricter rules will come in 2026, but the first bite is already here. In the U.S., agencies are circling corporate filings, probing whether companies are “AI-washing” their earnings calls. Copyright fights rage in the courts — The New York Times is suing OpenAI — even as other media groups cut licensing deals.\nAnd then there’s China. After Washington’s on-again-off-again export bans, Beijing has reportedly discouraged domestic firms from buying Nvidia’s China-compliant H20 chip. That’s not trivial; Nvidia makes roughly a quarter of its revenue in China. That’s the kind of geopolitical tremor that could ripple through Wednesday’s earnings call.\nSo has the tide turned?\nIn sentiment, maybe. Altman’s bubble line broke the spell of inevitability. MIT’s study turned hype into numbers, and the numbers were ugly. Meta’s reported reorganization suggests that even the loudest boosters know when to pause. Developers are adopting but not trusting. Artists are suing. Regulators are writing (and rewriting) the rules. The “AI will change everything” pitch no longer lands as gospel.\nBut in capital, not yet. The hyperscalers are still writing historic checks. NVDA is still the most important ticker in the market. If Wednesday’s earnings blow past expectations again, the spending spree will look vindicated. But if they disappoint — even slightly — the bubble chorus will likely grow louder.\nSilicon Valley has always run on myth as much as math. The myth of inevitability allowed companies to raise obscene sums, to spend like nation-states, to paper over the fact that 95% of AI pilots go nowhere. The myth was strong enough to make a $4 trillion company out of Nvidia, to have Microsoft reimagine itself as an infrastructure empire, to send Zuckerberg chasing “superintelligence” like it’s a Marvel subplot. But myths don’t last forever. Eventually, someone reads the balance sheet.\nA year ago, AI was destiny. Chatbots were oracles, GPUs were holy relics, and anyone questioning the frenzy was accused of missing the future. Now? Its prophet mutters “bubble,” and its supposed killer apps are retreating under the weight of their own demos. The question isn’t whether or not AI is important — it obviously is. The question is whether or not importance is enough to sustain trillion-dollar valuations and multitrillion-dollar infrastructure bets. If inevitability is gone, then AI, like every industry before it, will have to survive the harder test: proving it.","content_hash":"ce168a6b819ab308e27da20d28545bdd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":10074,"method_rank":0}

Cook said Trump had no authority to fire her, and she would not resign. Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said they intend to take “whatever actions are needed to prevent” Trump’s “illegal action.” Analysts said the episode sounded alarm bells over the central bank’s independence.\nTrump also threatened new tariffs and export restrictions on advanced technology and semiconductors in retaliation against digital services taxes abroad. In addition, Trump told reporters on Monday that China must supply the United States with magnets or “we have to charge them 200% tariffs or something.”\nInvestors now await a fresh batch of U.S. economic data.\nIn yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s main stock indexes ended lower. Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) plunged over -11% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after it agreed to buy Dutch coffee firm JDE Peet’s for $18.4 billion. Also, furniture stocks slumped after President Trump announced last Friday that the U.S. would launch an investigation into tariffs on furniture imports, with Wayfair (W) and RH (RH) sliding more than -5%. In addition, CSX Corp. (CSX) fell over -5% after CNBC’s Becky Quick reported that Warren Buffett told her Berkshire Hathaway has no interest in acquiring another railroad. On the bullish side, chip stocks gained ground, with Nvidia (NVDA) rising more than +1% to lead gainers in the Dow and Lam Research (LRCX) advancing over +1%.\nEconomic data released on Monday showed that U.S. new home sales unexpectedly fell -0.6% m\/m to 652K in July from 656K in June (revised from 627K), though the figure was still stronger than expectations of 635K.\nToday, all eyes are focused on the U.S. Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that the August CB Consumer Confidence index will stand at 96.4, compared to last month’s figure of 97.2.\nInvestors will also focus on U.S. Durable Goods Orders and Core Durable Goods Orders data. Economists expect July Durable Goods Orders to drop -3.8% m\/m and Core Durable Goods Orders to rise +0.2% m\/m, compared to the prior figures of -9.4% m\/m and +0.2% m\/m, respectively.\nThe U.S. S&P\/CS HPI Composite - 20 n.s.a. will be reported today. Economists expect the June figure to ease to +2.1% y\/y from +2.8% y\/y in May.\nThe U.S. Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index will be released today as well. Economists foresee this figure coming in at -11 in August, compared to the previous value of -20.\nIn addition, market participants will be anticipating a speech from Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin.\nOn the earnings front, notable companies like MongoDB (MDB), Okta (OKTA), and Box (BOX) are slated to release their quarterly results today.\nU.S. rate futures have priced in an 84.3% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 15.7% chance of no rate change at the next central bank meeting in September.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.302%, up +0.63%.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.73% this morning as sentiment took a hit amid a political crisis in France. French stocks tumbled on Tuesday after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called a confidence vote that could topple France’s government as early as next month. The far-right National Rally party, the leftist France Unbowed, and the Greens all said they would vote against the September 8th motion, while the Socialists said they would not support the government. Also weighing on sentiment were growing concerns over the Fed’s independence following U.S. President Trump’s move to oust Fed official Lisa Cook. Bank stocks, whose performance closely follows the economy, led the declines on Tuesday. Semiconductor stocks also lost ground after Trump threatened to raise tariffs and impose export restrictions on countries that tax or regulate U.S. tech firms. On the economic front, a survey released on Tuesday showed that consumer confidence in France fell to a 2-year low in August. In corporate news, Commerzbank AG (CBK.D.DX) slid over -5% after Bank of America downgraded the stock to Underperform from Neutral.\nFrance’s Consumer Confidence data was released today.\nThe French August Consumer Confidence came in at 87, weaker than expectations of 90.\nAsian stock markets today closed in the red. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.39%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -0.97%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index closed lower today, retreating from a 10-year high as sentiment turned cautious amid renewed trade worries. Rare earth stocks slumped on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday that China must supply the United States with magnets or “we have to charge them 200% tariffs or something.” Trump added that Washington might use restrictions on airplane parts as leverage to counter Beijing’s dominance in the sector. Also, real estate stocks slid, giving up some of the gains sparked by Shanghai’s latest efforts to support the housing market. Limiting losses, consumer stocks climbed. Meanwhile, senior Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang is traveling to Washington this week to meet with U.S. officials, as the U.S. and China seek to chart a course beyond their current tariff truce. In other news, HSBC said on Tuesday that it remains Overweight on Chinese equities, citing rising earnings, reasonable valuations, policy support, and a large cash pile as supportive factors. In corporate news, Wasion Holdings surged over +11% in Hong Kong after the smart power meters manufacturer and system solutions provider posted strong first-half results. Investors are awaiting China’s industrial profits data for July, scheduled for release on Wednesday, for fresh insights into the health of the world’s second-largest economy. Attention will then shift to official PMI readings due on the final day of August.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index ended lower today, snapping a two-session winning streak as domestic equities tracked overnight weakness on Wall Street. Automobile and pharmaceutical stocks led the declines on Tuesday. Also weighing on sentiment was U.S. President Trump’s move to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Shuutarou Yasuda, a market analyst at Tokai Tokyo Intelligence Laboratory, said, “The market was surprised with the news about Cook and reacted accordingly.” The yen climbed as much as 0.4% against the U.S. dollar following the news before erasing its gains. Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said that the country remains concerned about foreign exchange movements. Meanwhile, Kyodo News reported on Tuesday that Japan’s finance ministry is planning to request a record 32.3865 trillion yen ($219.82 billion) for debt-servicing costs in the next fiscal year’s budget. On the economic front, Bank of Japan data released on Tuesday showed that a key gauge of Japan’s service-sector inflation unexpectedly slowed in July but remained elevated. In corporate news, Nissan Motor slumped over -6% after its second-largest shareholder, Mercedes-Benz, announced it would sell its 3.8% stake in the struggling Japanese automaker. Investor attention this week is on a series of Japan’s economic data releases, including Tokyo core CPI, industrial production, and retail sales.

It marked the public advent of generative AI models, and AI tech has been booming ever since. More and more, companies in fields from semiconductor chip manufacturing to software to cloud computing are moving to support or adopt the new technology.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nDaniel Ives, a well-known tech analyst from Wedbush, has been watching the AI boom with deep interest. He sees clearly how we are only at the beginning of an epochal change in our technological landscape, and he explains how it will impact the stock markets. “As we have discussed often over the last few years this tech bull market in our view is being fueled by the biggest transformational tech spending cycle in the last 40 years…the AI Revolution,” Ives said. “We are still in the early days of the AI Revolution as the use cases are just starting to massively expand as more companies recognize the value creation being driven by a handful of tech companies… In our view the tech bull cycle will be well intact at least for another 2-3 years given the trillions being spent on AI infrastructure\/software\/chips\/power\/apps looking ahead. This remains our tech playbook and investor road map.”\nIves follows the general outline by suggesting specific tech stocks to buy, and his choices may surprise you – he’s picked out Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) as long-term winners. We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to see the Street’s broader view of both stocks and to see how Ives’ outlook measures up. Let’s dive in.\nTesla\nWe’ll look at Tesla first, the leading US electric vehicle (EV) maker. Tesla is notable for being the only US EV company to move from bootstrap start-up to profitability entirely within the 2000s; the company was founded in 2003, launched its Model S sedan in 2012, and saw its first consistently profitable year in 2020. The company currently sees annual revenues of $90-billion-plus, although the year-to-year revenue growth has been slowing down.\nWhile Tesla’s chief business, and its primary revenue source, is electric cars, the company has its hands in plenty of other pots, including AI. Not all of these pots are revenue drivers – that title belongs to the electric generation & storage segment, as well as services & other – but Tesla’s AI work deserves a closer look.\nThe company is making a concerted push to develop autonomous AI technology, for use in a variety of applications. Probably the most prominent of these is Tesla’s work on self-driving vehicles. The company is working on FSD software for cars – that is, full self-driving – and has equipped its Robotaxi program with the system. The Robotaxi was launched in Austin, Texas in June of this year, using Tesla’s Model Y car as a platform. The program includes a human monitor in the front seat, while software and control problems are identified and corrected, but for the long-term the company hopes to eventually remove the human and offer a fully automated, on-call ride-share service. Tesla is actively pursuing expansion of the Robotaxi, and is testing the system in the San Francisco Bay area.\nTesla has also applied its work with autonomous AI tech to its Optimus robot program. Optimus is a bipedal humanoid robot, designed to perform manual labor that humans would find difficult or impossible – for example, boring or repetitive tasks over long periods of time, or heavy lifting in unsafe environments. In addition to AI tech, the program involves deep computer learning, motion planning, and advanced sensor systems to bring it to life, all of which are active in Tesla’s research and development departments.\nTurning to Tesla’s financials, in its last quarterly release, covering 2Q25, the company’s total revenue came to $22.5 billion, for a decline of 12% year-over-year – although it beat the forecast by $360 million. The decline was driven by a 16% y\/y drop in automotive revenues (that is, car sales), which came in at $16.7 billion. A 17% gain in ‘services and other revenue,’ pushing that segment to $3.05 billion for the quarter, partially compensated for the drop in auto sales. At the bottom line, Tesla reported a non-GAAP EPS of 40 cents; this figure met expectations, but was down 12 cents per share, or 23%, year-over-year.\nDespite Tesla’s current difficulties – slowing car sales and lower year-over-year revenue growth – Daniel Ives still sees the stock as a solid investment in AI. He writes, “We continue to believe that TSLA will begin launching its Robotaxi capabilities across multiple cities (~25 cities over the next year) in the US & abroad over the next 12-18 months as the company goes all in on the AI vision…we believe the autonomous opportunity is worth $1 trillion alone for Tesla. As we have discussed, there are still headwinds, tariffs, and clear growth challenges for Tesla over the coming 3-6 months…but Musk now entering the picture as a wartime CEO to put TSLA on an aggressive AI-focused strategy represents the biggest and best possible news for Tesla investors. AI Future is the focus for long term investors.”\nThis upbeat long-term stance backs Ives’ Outperform (Buy) rating on the shares, while his $500 price target points toward a one-year upside potential of 44%. (To watch Ives’ track record, click here.)\nThis is the bullish take. Overall, the Street is more cautious. Shares in Tesla are currently selling for $346.6, and the $305.37 average price target implies a one-year depreciation of 12%. The recommendations on file, 36 of them currently, include 13 to Buy, 15 to Hold, and 8 to Sell, for a Hold consensus rating. (See TSLA stock forecast.)\nInternational Business Machines\nThe next stock on our list is one of the nation’s venerable names in business technology, and a long-time fixture of the stock indexes. IBM was founded in 1911, making mechanical business machines such as calculators and time clocks. Later, the company moved into electronic computing and was an early innovator in the age of punch-card computers and magnetic tape memory before moving on to floppy disks. The company stayed at the leading edge of tech in the 1970s and provided some of the early PC operating systems, before staking out a place in the world of computer hardware and business software. In the early 2000s, IBM shifted toward cloud computing and high-tech consulting.\nIn short, IBM has exemplified two features that keep a company relevant in an ever-changing world: an ability to adapt to new conditions, and a clear view of the next frontier of technology. Today, IBM has its hands in several of the tech world’s vital segments: cloud computing, quantum computing, and AI.\nIBM’s AI solutions are designed to work across the full extent of the end-use customer’s organization. The company’s platform, watsonx, provides a portfolio of AI products that are designed to drive business processes, automating such segments as regulatory compliance and data management. The platform includes generative AI models and is scalable for use by customers at any level.\nIBM’s AI systems are used in everything from HR to IT, with customer service, marketing, and app development in between. The company’s management is upbeat about its AI business and reported an expansion of the ‘generative AI book’ in 2Q25, the last quarter reported.\nWhen we look at the quarter’s financial results, we find that IBM had $17 billion in total revenues, up 7.6% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $410 million. The company reported a bottom line of $2.80 per share by non-GAAP measures, beating the forecast by 15 cents per share. IBM’s free cash flow in the quarter came to $2.85 billion, up 9% year-over-year. The company expects to generate $13.5 billion or more in free cash flow for the full year 2025.\nTurning again to Daniel Ives, and the Wedbush view, the tech expert bases a bullish take on IBM mainly on the company’s rapidly growing AI business. He says of the business\/tech giant, “The company continues to see strength for its software and infrastructure services despite the current shifts in the operating environment with over 10% of revenue coming from GenAI while seeing its GenAI book of business accelerate to $7.5 billion, above the prior quarter of ~$6.0 billion… We believe that IBM is well-positioned to capitalize on the current demand shift for hybrid and AI applications with more enterprises looking to implement AI for productivity gains and drive long-term profitable growth.”\nIves goes on to rate IBM shares as Outperform (Buy), along with a price target of $325 to suggest an upside of 36% in the next 12 months.\nOverall, IBM gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 13 recent reviews that break down to 7 Buys, 5 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock is selling for $239.43, and its average price target, now at $297.33, implies an upside potential of 24% by this time next year.

The stock market is now closed for the day.\nThe Russell 2000 (+0.86%)stayed out front, overwhelmingly in the green. It hit a 9-month high today. It's still only up 5.8% year-to-date.\nThe index was trailed by the Nasdaq Composite (+0.44%), S&P 500 (+0.43%), and Dow (+0.32%).\nMore updates will be coming in short order.\nUpdate: 3:54 p.m. ET\nMain Street thinks the stock market is going down\nWe've heard enough from what Wall Street thinks the stock market will do. How about Main Street?\nThey're not betting on black, at least if you take the Conference Board's newly-released Consumer Confidence Index data at face.\nBets Against Volatility Hit Levels Not Seen Since Sept. 2022\nPer Bloomberg's Jess Menton, hedge funds and institutions are now shorting the CBOE Volatility Index at levels not seen since Sept. 2022. That move might rouse new concerns about a market already at record highs and generationally-high valuations.\nMidday Movers: Eli Lilly, EchoStar, Keurig Dr Pepper, Brown-Forman, NYT\nWe're officially approaching midday on the market. Three U.S. indexes are now in the green. The Russell 2000 (+0.65%) is still out in front, trailed by the narrow gains in the Nasdaq (+0.16%), the S&P 500 (+0.07%) and the Dow (-0.01%).\nHere's the Russell 3000 index, which tells a lot about investors' indecisiveness today. While there are pockets of green and red, the market seems to be a very stale grey across the board:\nThere are some stocks that are greener and redder, though. In fact, some of them are stars in our midday movers. Here are the five we're watching today:\nEli Lilly\nPharma giant Eli Lilly (LLY) (+4.5%) might have a new blockbuster on their hands in orforglipron, an oral weight loss pill that just met the primary endpoint in its phase 3 trial, setting up a submission for approval by the Food & Drug Administration in 2026. Patients reduced A1C by 1.3% to 1.6%, while patients lost an average of 27.3 pounds in the first of two studies. That will give Lilly a new option in their weight loss drug portfolio, which already includes Mounjaro and Zepbound.\nEchoStar\nDish Network and Boost Mobile parent EchoStar (SATS) (+75.6%) is soaring today after announcing a $23 billion deal to sell its spectrum licenses to AT&T (T) . The deal comes after months of pressure from U.S. regulators, who grew increasingly frustrated with the pace of the company's network build-out. The proceeds will help the company stave off a bankruptcy filing by paying off debt and funding new growth ventures.\nKeurig Dr Pepper\nKeurig Dr Pepper (KDP) (-5%) is still plummeting after announcing a plan to purchase JDE Peet's for $18 billion. At the close of the deal, the company plans to \"separate\" into two businesses; one dedicated to coffee, another for soft drinks. While cost-savings have been touted from the deal, many investors are still nervous; KDP has fallen 16% over the last two trading days.\nBrown-Forman\nThe Kentucky-based spirits giant behind Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve, Brown-Forman (BF.B) (-2.8%), announced Tuesday morning that CFO Leanne Cunningham would retire next May. Cunningham has served in the role since mid-2021. The company says it would start the search for a new financial leader.\nNew York Times\nNew York Times Co NYT (+0.17%) fell intraday after a report that activist investor Fivespan took a stake in the paper, which has seen near-double digit revenue growth in recent quarters. The company is urging the company to use AI to increase the number of subscribers, comparing the opportunity to tech-focused firms like Netflix (NFLX) and Spotify (SPOT) , which are not terribly similar as businesses.\nThe Russell 2000 (+0.65%) is still standing high and mighty, while the Nasdaq (+0.15%) has added to its modest gains. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (+0.01%) and the Dow (-0.13%) have not come along with.\nHowever, we've gotten the last major economic datapoints of the day in the last few hours. Among them are the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, the Richmond Fed's Manufacturing Index, and the Dallas Fed Services Index. All three rose month-over-month, a welcome sign.\nZooming in on the Consumer Confidence data, there was a small dip in August, but ultimately little change.\nThe decline was primarily led by consumers under 35, while economic outlooks remained stable for consumers 35-55 and rose for those over 55.\nAlthough not included in the actual calculation, the share of consumers who expect a recession in the next 12 months rose to their highest level since April.\nUpdate: 9:55 a.m. ET\nMarket Open: Stocks Little Changed\nThe market is finally open. The Russell 2000 (+0.50%) is standing above the crowd this morning, while the Nasdaq (+0.09%), S&P 500 (+0.02%) and Dow (+0.00%) are all lagging behind. Still, it's better than the alternative; at one point this morning, all four stock indexes were looking red to start the day.\nUpdate: 9:03 a.m. ET\nData Drop: Durable Goods, Redbook, Home Prices\nMany of the biggest economic data reports of the day have dropped in the last 30 minutes. Among them are Durable Goods orders, Redbook, and the S&P\/Case-Shiller Home Price Index.\nHere are those reports:\nDurable Goods (Jul): -2.8% MoM (vs. -9.4% MoM in June)\nRedbook: +6.5% YoY\nS&P\/Case-Shiller Home Price (Jun): +2.6% YoY; -0% MoM (vs. +2.9% YoY, +0.4% MoM in May)\nIn the S&P\/Case-Shiller report, home price growth in the 20-City Home Price Index rose slower, +2.1% YoY (vs. +2.8% in June). Prices declined -0.2% MoM.\nOur next big data drop will be at 10 a.m. ET, which will include the CB Consumer Confidence Index and Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index. We'll update this thread with that, and the Dallas Fed Services Index, a little after 10:30 a.m. ET.\nUpdate: 8:08 a.m. ET\nMorning Headlines: AT&T and EchoStar make 5G deal; Eli Lilly's weight loss drug wins out; IBM and AMD partnership\nAside from the Trump news that's stirring the pot this morning, here are a few other headlines that are crossing the wire this morning (and bound to make an impact on early trading):\nAT&T (T) will spend $23 billion to buy 5G spectrum licenses from Dish Network parent EchoStar (SATS) , which has been under pressure to sell its 5G spectrum after failing to build a 5G network of its own.\nEli Lilly's oral weight loss pill, orforglipron, cleared its primary endpoint in a crucial phase 3 trial, a move which will clear its way for approval next year.\nInternational Business Machines IBM and Advanced Micro Devices have announced a partnership to \"develop quantum-centric supercomputing\", per Axios.\nSpotify is reportedly considering raising prices in new markets after launching a new direct messaging (DM) feature to the platform, per FT.\nTrump Media will add the Crypto.com wallet to the company's social media platforms as part of a \"strategic partnership.\"\nNew research from Stanford University economists has found \"clear, evident change\" from the impact of AI on entry-level hiring, per WSJ.\nUpdate: 7:56 a.m. ET\nCatching Up: Here's Why Trump Is Moving Markets\nIn case you're just joining us this morning...\nU.S. equities are down in futures trading, led lower by the Nasdaq (-0.22%)\nGold is up, rising 0.27%\nThe 30Y Treasury yield jumped 2.8 basis points to 4.917%\nThe U.S. Dollar Index is down 0.27%\nThe early morning movements are a product of jitters kicked up by two posts that President Trump made last night. One took aim at the Fed, the other at countries floating possible ways to offset the impact of American tech.\nThe first of the two took aim at the Fed's Lisa Cook, who Trump and allies have been trying to push out of the central bank's top governing board on allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. Trump attempted to fire Cook, but she said she isn't going, claiming he has \"no authority.\"\nNot long after, Trump sounded off about countries seeking to tax, regulate, or legislate \"incredible American tech companies,\" likely taking aim at policies by the European Union and other countries, which have created legislation that allows the bloc to levy significant fines against conglomerates acting in ways they consider anticompetitive.\nBoth developments are creating waves this morning. At the same time, the President and team have indicated a desire to expand investments in key domestic industries, building a sovereign wealth fund-like investment vehicle to make strategic investments.\nTrump has also signaled a willingness to expand the U.S. military and national guard's presence from Washington, D.C. to Chicago, expanding a federal crackdown his administration says is about taking on crime.\nUpdate: 7:34 a.m. ET\nEarnings Today: BMO Bank, Prudential, MongoDB\nToday, there are 36 earnings calls slated, per data from Nasdaq.

Last week, Mr. Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect last Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump on August 13 extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November.

Each Wednesday, Ian King brings you expert insights on the most important business stories from the U.K. and other key developments you won't want to miss. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\nThe dispatch\nFew institutions in Britain over the last decade and a half have avoided losing public confidence. Parliament, the Royal Family, the National Health Service, the BBC, the Church of England, the police service and the media have all been rocked by scandals.\nOne institution that has remained largely above criticism, though, is the Office for Budget Responsibility. This non-departmental public body, answerable to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, has by and large come through the last 15 years with its reputation intact.\nBut now things are changing and, for the first time in its existence, the OBR is under fire like never before.\nFirst, some history. The OBR was born in May 2010 when the coalition government formed by the center-right Conservatives and the centrist Liberal Democrats succeeded Gordon Brown's Labour government.\nGeorge Osborne, the incoming chancellor, called for the fiscal framework to be reformed as the new government — which had inherited a deficit to GDP ratio of 10% deficit — battled to maintain the confidence of the bond markets in the wake of the global financial crisis.\nFleshing out the proposals earlier that year in the annual Mais lecture, Osborne argued Brown's fiscal rules had failed because \"they were backwards looking, so that past surpluses could be used to justify present deficits\" and were \"adjudicated by the Treasury with no independent oversight, undermining their credibility.\"\nHe said credibility could be restored by a fiscal council bringing \"independent and forward-looking scrutiny to bear on governments\" along the lines of bodies in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.\nThe OBR chair for its first three months was the respected economist Alan Budd — who had also been a founding member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee — and he was succeeded by the no-less distinguished Robert Chote, who held the role for a decade before handing over in 2020 to the current incumbent, Richard Hughes.\nCriticism from the left and right\nThe OBR has largely done the job it was mandated to do: its economic and fiscal forecasts are seen as credible and independent to the extent they now shape both budget decisions and public debate on the nation's finances.\nThat hard-earned reputation is currently under attack from politicians on both the left and right.\nAmong the latter, its sternest critics include former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose short-lived administration famously sidelined the OBR before embarking on a disastrous 'mini Budget' in September 2022.\nShe has demanded the OBR be abolished, telling The Spectator magazine in February 2023: \"The OBR and its position is taken very seriously by the market, so it effectively constrains what the government can do.\n\"It's very important that forecasts are honest, but I think we have ended up in a place where they're done so separately of government that it ends up driving fiscal policy.\"\nThat analysis is shared by many on the left, particularly following the announcement by current Chancellor Rachel Reeves in March on extra welfare cuts after the OBR questioned whether a previous package of cuts would save as much as Reeves was claiming.\nThat angered many of the government's own MPs, among them Debbie Abrahams, chair of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, who said the cuts — later watered down — was a \"dog's breakfast… driven by the need to get four points to the OBR to enable it to be scored for the budget.\"\nOther influential voices on the left agree. Paul Nowak, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, the federation of Britain's unions, said in March this year it was time to review the OBR's role, telling the website PoliticsHome: \"Short-term changes in forecasts should not be driving long-term government decision-making. Decisions that affect millions of people's lives must be made with care - not as a last-minute response to changed fiscal forecasts.\"\nAnd The New Statesman, a house magazine of the British left, recently accused British governments of recasting \"difficult choices as necessities required by the spreadsheet — and forced the OBR to be… a de facto Department for Austerity.\"\nFor its part, an external reviewer appointed by the OBR, concluded in February that it had \"successfully navigated a series of unprecedented economic and fiscal challenges\" and \"that it emerges stronger from the period.\" It also highlighted that since 2020 the OBR has \"worked to broaden and deepen its credibility with partner institutions, academics, and across different parts of the economic, fiscal and political landscape.\"\nThis debate is likely to intensify in coming months as Reeves prepares her autumn Budget, amid signs the OBR is set to downgrade its economic forecasts, forcing the Chancellor to raise taxes again to meet her fiscal rules.\nThe big question for the OBR's critics is how they would replace the current arrangement. One regular barb leveled at the OBR is that it has been poor at predicting U.K. productivity — a key element of its forecasts — but, in fairness, so have most economists.\nRupert Harrison, a former Osborne advisor who helped design the OBR, has argued the problem is not the organization itself but politicians who \"only have to respond to small forecast changes because they choose to give themselves so little headroom.\"\nYet it would be an odd move from a chancellor, particularly one expecting to lose the next election, to leave their successor plenty of scope for either raising spending or cutting taxes.\nAnother alternative was floated last week by The New Economics Foundation, a left-leaning think tank whose former chief executive, Miatta Fahnbulleh, is now a Labour minister. It suggested replacing the OBR with a new Office for Fiscal Transparency that would publish its own forecasts alongside the Treasury. Arguing the OBR currently enjoys \"an effective veto on fiscal policy decisions\" and has \"a power that has received little democratic scrutiny,\" it said a new fiscal policy committee of nine economists could assess differences in the Treasury's forecasts and the new body.\nThere are attractions to these proposals and, in particular, the way they seek to address concerns about unelected officials having too big a say over important tax and spending decisions.\nBut with markets still extremely nervous about the U.K.'s fiscal position — yields on 30-year inflation-linked gilts last week hit their highest level since 1998 — it would be a brave chancellor that would tamper with the current arrangement.\nTop TV picks on CNBC\nJames Sproule, chief U.K. economist at Handelsbanken, discusses the latest British inflation data and its impact on the Bank of England's rate cut trajectory.\nCNBC's Ritika Gupta explores whether there is enough data to determine if the wealthy are leaving London en masse due to non-dom tax rules.\nFlorian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, discuss sticky inflation in the U.K. and why the situation is different on the European continent.\n— Holly Ellyatt\nNeed to know\nUK inflation picks up to hotter-than-expected 3.8% in July. The main driver was a hefty increase in air fares, as well as the rise in fuel and food prices.\nAnother UK interest rate cut this year looks increasingly unlikely. Higher inflation and geopolitical uncertainty have led markets to price in a less than 50% chance of another Bank of England interest rate cut this year.\nHow tourists are weathering geopolitical uncertainty, currency moves and extreme heat. Tourists are currently having to factor in a broad range of issues when trying to pick a holiday destination.\n— Holly Ellyatt\nQuote of the week\n\"The U.K. is still living with some of the remnants of what happened during the post-Covid period [when it comes to inflation]. Europe seems to be out of it and the U.K. still seems to have one foot in it.\"\nFlorian Ielpo, Head of Macro, Lombard Odier Investment Managers\nIn the markets\nThe FTSE 100 shed gains from the record high reached last week as global bond yields rose after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to oust a Fed governor over the weekend.\nThe index is up about 0.8% over the last week.\nThe 10-year U.K. government bond yield has risen to 4.75%, taking it back to levels last seen in the aftermath of the U.S. tariffs announcement in April.

There's much debate about what's driving the gains, but there are signs of a deeper change afoot in what's long been considered a more speculative market.\nEnjoy!\nThis report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\nThe big story\nChange doesn't happen overnight, least of all in the mainland Chinese stock market that's been compared to a casino due to its wild swings.\nIt is, after all, a little over 30 years old — a juvenile compared with Western bourses such as the New York Stock Exchange, established in 1792, and the London Stock Exchange, founded in 1801.\nBut China's retail investors are getting savvier, thanks in part to hard lessons and a surge of online information.\n\"I think the real market is the best teacher. Real losses,\" said Jin Xin, author of a Chinese investment book that translates as \"Wealth Snowball: 10 years, 10-fold, the Essentials of Value Investing.\"\nAbout a decade ago, locals sought annual returns of 30% to 50%, dismissing single-digit gains, he said. By contrast, the S&P500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have delivered less than 15% annualized returns over the past decade.\nBut mainland Chinese investors have matured since then. The 2015 Chinese stock bubble burst, the 2020 property sector crisis and scandals in financial products such as peer-to-peer lending — which promised double-digit returns — wiped out many portfolios.\nNow, investors in China are less likely to chase single-stock stories, while holding shares longer and aiming for steady 5% to 10% returns, Jin said. However, Jin noted that listed companies in China still have a long way to go in prioritizing shareholder returns through incentives such as dividends or share buybacks, unlike the West.\nThe Shanghai Composite Index hit a 10-year high recently, while the CSI300, which tracks the 300 largest and most liquid shares listed in Shenzhen and Shanghai, is at a three-year high. Part of the increase is attributed to retail investors starting to allocate some of their savings, amid apparent easing in U.S.-China trade tensions and hopes of an economic recovery.\nUnlike major markets such as the New York Stock Exchange, where retail investors account for about 20%-25% of trade volumes, China's retail investors drive 90% of daily trading, according to data provided by HSBC.\nHowever, a push to rebalance the market away from the dominance of retail investors and encourage the growth of long-term institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance funds, and other long-term institutional investors, has helped reduce volatility, said Aaron Costello, head of Asia at Cambridge Associates.\nThe mainland stock market, known as A shares, has historically seen price swings of 30%, he said, noting it's now closer to 20%. But that's still higher than 15% in the U.S. and Europe, he said.\nAn annual study by the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance and Charles Schwab found that financial literacy among Chinese households improved in 2024. Women scored higher than men in financial planning for the first time, the report showed.\nInvestors in China are moving beyond simply looking for high returns. They are more concerned with the underlying logic as well as the track record of a fund and its manager, according to Chinese financial services company Noah, which manages assets for high-net-worth clients.\nInformation explosion\nThe proliferation of financial apps and social media has also helped to broaden investor education.\nFive years ago, former J.P. Morgan associate Lindsay Zou started releasing videos about finance and macroeconomics on YouTube and its Chinese equivalent, Bilibili. She now has more than 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube, over 6 million on Bilibili — and more than 10 million on Douyin.\nShe became so popular that she was flocked by fans this summer after moderating a panel in Beijing at China AMC's annual event for promoting its index funds. Another speaker was also a finance influencer with 36,000 followers on Douyin.\nAnd there's \"Red Rocket,\" a \"mini\" app available within the popular Chinese messaging and social media app WeChat, which gained 10 million users since launching last year. The app, which allows users to analyze indexes and stocks, was developed by fund management firm China AMC.\n\"Access to financial information increases stock investment, enhances portfolio diversification, and improves risk-adjusted returns, even among older, less educated and less affluent users,\" according to a study published Monday by a team led by Bernard Yeung, a finance professor at the National University of Singapore Business School.\nTheir research, which uses data from an anonymous major Chinese online investment platform with 711 million monthly active users, established a causal link between exposure to digital financial knowledge and improved investment behavior. It also found that visual content had a \"significantly greater impact\" on users than other formats.\n\"The emergence of professional platforms has filtered out market noise,\" Wang Wei, a researcher at Tianjin University of Commerce, said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. But he warned that speculation still exists in the market, even if it's now more concentrated in micro themes such as electric vehicles or chips.\nIt has been debated whether Beijing's history of intervening in the markets to ensure stability — especially during times of turmoil — has distorted share prices from their fundamentals and dampened long-term returns, while affecting investor sentiment.\nThe stock market's recent run higher comes ahead of two key events, Wang pointed out: the multilateral Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin from Aug. 31 to Sept. 1, and China's military parade in Beijing on Sept. 3.\nStocks saw a similar surge in October last year — after a rare government meeting signaled stimulus plans — and ahead of a weeklong October holiday commemorating the 75th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.\nTop TV picks on CNBC\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing CEO Bonnie Chan discussed why soft fundamentals in the Chinese economy are not weighing on the market.\nMarcos Chan, head of research at CBRE Hong Kong, said that the vacancy rate in Hong Kong's commercial property market is high – but things are slowly improving.\nArthur Chen, CFO of Futu Holdings, discussed how the online brokerage business is affected by current geopolitical and market uncertainty, Hong Kong's strong IPO pipeline, as well as the integration of AI and crypto trading on the platform.\nNeed to know\nChina's industrial profits fell 1.5% in July. But that's the slowest year-on-year pace of decline in five months. Profits at major industrial firms fell 1.7% in the first seven months this year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday.\nNvidia in talks with U.S. to ship more advanced chip to China. According to a Reuters report, the chipmaker is developing a new artificial intelligence chip, named the B30A, that will supersede the H20 that it's allowed to export to Beijing.\nEvergrande, China's property giant, was delisted on Monday. In 2017, the company's valuation peaked at $51.7 billion — before plunging precipitously by January 2024, when Evergrande received a liquidation order because of its billions in debt. The episode's a symbol of the rise and fall of China's property sector.\nQuote of the week\nWhat's being underappreciated is China's continued move away from an old economic model that was heavily dependent on property and infrastructure, to a much more dynamic model looking at areas such as robotics, EVs.\n— Peter Alexander, managing director at Z-Ben Advisors\nIn the markets\nChina and Hong Kong stocks inched higher amid mixed trading in the region on Wednesday as investors assessed China's industrial profits data, which slipped 1.5% from a year earlier in July, marking a notable recovery following months of steeper declines.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng index was flat, while the mainland's CSI 300 added 0.72%. The CSI 300 has been surging recently, with some economists and banks such as Nomura pointing to \"irrational exuberance.\"\nThe mainland Chinese index has climbed over 13% so far this year.\nComing up\nAug. 29: Eric Trump to speak at bitcoin conference in Hong Kong\nAug. 31: Official Manufacturing PMI\nAug. 31-Sept. 1: Shanghai Cooperation Organization meets in Tianjin\nSept. 1: RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI\nSept. 3: China military parade; RatingDog China General Services PMI","content_hash":"a75092eb449ea0a556c84b8a66084715","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8756,"method_rank":0}

Most ELDs you install has the ability to track miles, engine hours, and time. Yet some small fleets never connect those two together. Instead, they leave maintenance up to memory, paperwork, or worse—driver recall. That’s how critical service intervals get skipped, warranties get voided, and roadside breakdowns drain your bank account. When you’re chasing loads day to day, it’s easy to push off scheduled service, but the costs of neglect always show up later, usually in the form of downtime you can’t afford.\nHere’s the truth: your ELD is more than just a compliance box. It’s a digital hub that can track and trigger your maintenance schedule with precision. If you take the time to input your OEM intervals into your ELD and train your team to respond to alerts, you’ll never miss another critical service. Your trucks will run longer, your CSA scores will stay cleaner, and your cash flow will be easier to predict.\nThis isn’t a business extra—it’s about building a system. And in trucking, systems protect margins.\nStep 1 – Start With the OEM Manual\nBefore you ever log into your ELD, pull the OEM manual out of your truck’s glovebox (if you don’t have it, download it). Every manufacturer lays out exact service intervals for each system—engine, transmission, aftertreatment, cooling, electrical. They don’t create those intervals just to fill pages. They base them on engineering data, warranty requirements, and real-world wear patterns.\nFor example, a Freightliner Cascadia with a Detroit engine may call for oil changes every 35,000 miles, while a Volvo with a D13 may require 25,000. A Cummins engine may require aftertreatment cleaning at a different mileage than a Paccar. If you’ve got a mixed fleet, you cannot assume one size fits all. Each truck has its own roadmap, and ignoring it is like skipping the directions on a prescription.\nTake time to build a master list of OEM service intervals for each truck in your fleet. Don’t just copy oil changes—dig into coolant flushes, transmission service, axle lube intervals, DEF filter replacements, and more. That list is your foundation. Without it, you’re just guessing.\nAnd in trucking, guessing leads to breakdowns you could’ve prevented.\nStep 2 – Translate OEM Intervals Into ELD Triggers\nOnce you’ve got the list, the next move is matching it against what your ELD actually tracks. Most ELDs log three primary data points that matter for maintenance:\nMileage – exact odometer readings by VIN\nEngine hours – useful for idling-heavy operations\nCalendar time – service cycles that reset on months, not miles\nThe OEM manual will tell you whether each interval is based on miles, hours, or time. Your job is to translate that into the right trigger inside the ELD. For example:\nOil changes – typically by mileage, sometimes by hours for local delivery or high-idle trucks\nDPF cleaning – by mileage or time (200,000 miles or 5,000 hours)\nTransmission service – strictly mileage (250,000 or 500,000 depending on transmission type)\nCoolant system checks – every 12 months regardless of miles\nDEF filter replacement – often mileage plus time-based\nThe goal is simple: align the OEM’s rules with your ELD’s tracking capabilities. Once you get that alignment, you no longer rely on sticky notes, spreadsheets, or driver memory. The ELD becomes the enforcer.\n(Photo: Motive. This is what protecting uptime looks like — syncing your OEM maintenance intervals directly into your ELD platform helps you catch service deadlines before they cost you a breakdown.)\nStep 3 – Set Up the ELD Maintenance Module\nSome carriers don’t even realize their ELD has a built-in maintenance module. They pay the monthly subscription, but only use it for compliance logs. That’s like buying a smartphone and never setting up your calendar.\nLog into your ELD dashboard and find the “maintenance,” “alerts,” or “reminders” section. From there, enter the interval rules you pulled from your OEM manual. Don’t cut corners—if it says 35,000 miles, enter 35,000 miles. If it says 12 months, enter 12 months.\nHere’s the play:\nFor mileage-based intervals, set the ELD to trigger an alert a few hundred miles before the OEM threshold. That gives you time to plan.\nFor time-based intervals, set calendar alerts that auto-reset once complete.\nFor engine hours, treat them just like miles—schedule the reminder to fire a bit early.\nNow, when a truck hits 34,000 miles, the ELD sends an alert to dispatch, the driver app, or the fleet manager dashboard. That alert is timestamped, documented, and archived. If you ever need to prove compliance for a warranty claim, DOT inspection, or insurance audit, you can pull up clean digital records with zero guesswork.\nStep 4 – Layer Preventive Maintenance On Top\nOEM intervals are the bare minimum. They protect warranties, but they don’t always fit the realities of your operation. That’s why smart fleets build their own preventive maintenance (PM) schedules and load them into the ELD on top of OEM requirements.\nExamples of common preventive intervals you should consider adding:\nTire inspections every 10,000 miles\nBrake adjustments and checks every 15,000 miles\nReefer unit service every 90 days\nAlignment checks twice per year\nBattery load tests before winter season\nThink of it like this: the OEM manual tells you what you must do to avoid voiding coverage. Your PM program tells you what you should do to avoid breakdowns. Both live inside the same ELD system, giving you one digital calendar that tracks everything.\nStep 5 – Train Your Team To Trust the Alerts\nThe biggest failure point isn’t the ELD—it’s your people. Alerts are worthless if dispatch ignores them, drivers push through them, or the back office treats them as suggestions. You have to build a culture where maintenance alerts are non-negotiable.\nThat means:\nDispatchers must schedule service the moment an alert fires.\nDrivers must report trucks for service without pushback.\nThe back office must log completions so alerts reset correctly.\nA good practice is to make maintenance review part of your weekly operations meeting. Look at which trucks are approaching thresholds and slot them into service windows proactively. Don’t wait until a truck is overdue—that’s when breakdown risk spikes and warranty coverage weakens.\nStep 6 – Use Data to Build Predictability\nHere’s where the payoff really shows up. When your ELD captures every service event, you’re building a record that turns into a powerful history over time. Patterns start to emerge—like which trucks are burning more oil, which drivers are idling too much, or which units are going through brakes quicker than the rest. That insight gives you control over your budget. Instead of scrambling when unexpected repairs pop up, you can forecast costs well in advance. It also makes you look stronger to lenders and insurers. A clean, well-documented maintenance record with OEM intervals logged shows lenders you’re serious about protecting your equipment, which can open the door to better financing terms. To insurers, that same record proves you’re a lower risk, which can reduce your costs.\nThe Payoff of Doing It Right\nWhen you implement your OEM schedule into your ELD properly, you create an automated system that pays for itself over and over. Here’s what happens:\nYou protect warranties – No manufacturer will cover an engine failure without proof of service. Your ELD creates that proof.\nYou cut downtime – Planned service costs a fraction of roadside breakdowns. You get trucks back faster and cheaper.\nYou extend truck life – Well-maintained assets run longer and sell for more when it’s time to upgrade.\nYou strengthen compliance – DOT officers and auditors respect timestamped records more than handwritten logs.\nYou stabilize cash flow – Predictable maintenance costs let you budget instead of bleed.\nThat’s not just about trucks—it’s about running a fleet that doesn’t live in survival mode.\nFinal Word\nSome small carriers treat maintenance like an afterthought. They run trucks until something breaks, then complain about bad luck or bad equipment. But the truth is, the OEM already gave you the roadmap. The ELD already gave you the tool. The only thing missing is the discipline to connect the two.\nIf you take the time to pull the OEM schedule, load every interval into your ELD, and train your team to follow alerts, you’ll build a maintenance system that never misses. You’ll cut breakdowns, keep your warranties intact, and build a stronger reputation with lenders, insurers, and shippers.\nMaintenance doesn’t have to be chaos. With the right setup, it becomes predictable. And predictability is what separates carriers who survive from carriers who scale.","content_hash":"3562d9c08a98a537228552d8a004d60c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8750,"method_rank":0}

Whether your drivers are at the warehouse, at a rest area or on the road, mobility insights can be instrumental for safer, more streamlined operations and supply chains at every turn.\nTruckers are the backbone of the North American economy, but these vital workers often face operational challenges that impact their day-to-day safety and efficiency. The issues they encounter can range from a lack of truck parking to frequent bottlenecks on their routes. Let’s dive into some of the difficulties commercial drivers face and how commercial mobility insights can help optimize staging, streamline traffic flow and boost transportation safety.\nThe dwell time dilemma: How long are trucks truly waiting?\nThe time a truck spends at a warehouse for loading and unloading can have a lasting impact on both safety and efficiency. Staging, the process of organizing and loading or unloading commercial vehicles, is a critical step in the transportation lifecycle. Delays during this process can create a ripple effect throughout the entire supply chain.\nCommon challenges from unoptimized staging and truck parking shortages\nSafety concerns: Inadequate space for staging can cause trucks to overflow into city streets, turn lanes or road shoulders, creating traffic congestion and safety hazards. Similarly, a lack of designated truck parking can force drivers to park in less-than-ideal locations like road shoulders or retail parking lots. Parking in these areas is especially dangerous overnight, when higher numbers of impaired drivers are on the road. In last-resort parking areas with inadequate security, there is also a greater potential for theft or harassment. Furthermore, if drivers are searching for a designated rest area but can’t find one nearby, they risk exceeding their Hours of Service (HOS) driving limits, potentially endangering themselves and others.\nLost productivity and earning potential: Commercial drivers are paid for their time on the road. If delays occur during staging, both drivers and companies can lose money. Drivers may wait in long lines at warehouses with little direction, resulting in wasted time and lost productivity.\nDriver frustration: Inefficient staging can lead to driver frustration. When drivers feel like their time is being wasted, it can lead to increased turnover, costing logistics companies more money and time to acquire new drivers.\nDissatisfied customers: Staging inefficiencies can also damage a company’s reputation. Lengthened staging times delay deliveries, which can lead to lost business and a dismal reputation among customers.\nGiven these complex problems, there is a strong need for optimized staging processes and more overnight commercial parking. Asking critical questions can help you identify where to start:\nAre staging locations or parking shortages impeding the flow of traffic?\nWhere are drivers sleeping if they’re parked overnight waiting for cargo?\nWhether a truck is parked overnight waiting to receive cargo or a driver is taking their required rest hours, mobility insights can shed light on dwell times and overall movement tendencies.\nDecoding truck movement patterns with mobility insights\nBefore a warehouse facility opens, trucks often try to be first in line for staging to get on the road sooner and make faster progress toward their destinations. Mobility insights can help you understand the entire process, from staging to where commercial vehicles are headed, showing how drayage trucks typically move products. Transportation analytics provide vital insights into how supply chains disperse from central ports or distribution centers and flow throughout a region. Warehousing and logistics companies can use these insights to pinpoint staging and parking inefficiencies and develop effective solutions.\nThe Altitude advantage: Insights that power better warehousing operations\nMobility insights from Altitude by Geotab provide logistics companies with a targeted approach to solve truck parking and staging deficiencies. The Altitude platform surfaces valuable insights on where trucks are coming from, where they are going and where they are stopping, enabling transportation leaders to pinpoint problem areas and measure the results of new strategies over time.\nOrigin & Destination (O&D): Altitude’s O&D module shows the most common routes commercial vehicles take in a region and provides deeper insight into overall truck travel times. You can identify the most common routes taken by trucks and how long it generally takes them to reach their destinations.\nStop Analytics: The Stop Analytics module helps highlight commercial vehicle parking tendencies, including the most frequented dwelling areas and how long vehicles are at rest. Truck parking insights can also be broken down by vehicle class, industry, vocation and fuel type.\nRegional Domicile Analytics (RDA): Where do trucks reside when a job is complete? RDA answers this critical question and more with comprehensive insights into travel distances, duty cycle stops and domicile stop lengths.\nStreamlining logistics safety and efficiency with Altitude’s mobility insights\nHaving these rich insights from the Altitude platform is one thing, but how can they be used to improve operations for both logistics companies and their drivers? Four key use cases demonstrate how our data can help solve safety and efficiency challenges at all levels.\nData-driven freight parking planning: Effective truck parking site selection requires a balance between maximizing available space and maintaining easy accessibility for drivers. Studying insights on the most heavily traveled routes by commercial vehicles and where they are currently stopping enables organizations to identify the most needed or most feasible locations for new parking options. Supporting parking construction and planning with data ultimately makes drivers’ lives easier and their daily commutes safer.\nOptimized staging: Altitude helps surface the staging inefficiencies currently facing commercial drivers. By observing traffic bottlenecks and truck backups at warehouses, logistics companies can better diagnose operational issues. Use transportation insights to develop targeted strategies that streamline truck staging, from optimizing times to preventing overcrowding.\nReduced congestion: Promoting equitable and efficient transportation for all is core to Altitude by Geotab’s mission. By providing transportation agencies and logistics companies with access to contextual transportation data, we help these organizations identify and solve key traffic problems in their regions. As a result, everyone benefits from easier access to smoother roads, with reduced travel times for all motorists.\nImproved safety for all drivers: Reducing congestion and expanding freight parking helps to protect both commercial drivers and regular motorists.

Industry experts say each retailer's plans reflects the categories they are in and the customers they serve. This means not all retailers will be rushing to import goods, or front-loading, at the same time, from the same countries.\nAll three companies were contacted by CNBC, but were in a quiet period because of this week's earnings.\nGlobal trade data provider Panjiva said the diversification of Abercrombie & Fitch's supply chain is apparent in its container data. The apparel retailer imports from Bangladesh (27%), followed by Guatemala (14%), Vietnam (10%) and China (9%). Other countries in its supply chain include Sri Lanka (7%), Italy (6.2%), Philippines (6.0%), Cambodia (4.7%), Indonesia (3.8%) and India (2.8%). This means the tariffs the company is subject to range from 15% to 34%, with levies on select goods from India rising to 50%.\nThe benefits of a diverse supply chain\nDuring Abercrombie's fiscal second-quarter conference call, Chief Executive Fran Horowitz said the company was bringing its \"proven playbook\" to alleviate the higher costs associated with the tariffs.\n\"As our teams have demonstrated before, they have a variety of options in our playbook, including shifting global production, enhancing supplier contracts and relationships, managing operating expenses and determining ways to increase [average unit retail] through lower promotions and lower clearance selling,\" Horowitz told investors on the call.\nAccording to data from ImportGenius, Abercrombie pulled forward the majority of its U.S.-bound freight during January, with a smaller front-loading period in April when China tariffs were lowered.\nHorowitz said Wednesday that the company doesn't expect to make any broad-based price increases in the back half of the year. Still, tariffs are dealing a heavier blow than expected earlier this year, despite its attempts to source from lower tariff regions. Abercrombie tightened its annual profit forecast, saying it now anticipates a $90 million hit to its margins, up from an expectation of $50 million in levies three months ago. This is primarily due to higher tariffs in Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia than it anticipated as well as the tariffs on goods from India spiking to 50%.\nDana Telsey, CEO of Telsey Group said most retailers have avoided the new tariffs so far this year because they had enough inventory in stock or pulled it forward to avoid the higher levies.\nBest Buy, which has been vocal on the tariff impact on electronics, pulled forward its freight in June. But compared with the 2024 peak season, the front-loading was more than 50% less in 2025. Best Buy's peak season was in the spring of 2024 as the company navigated the threat of the International Longshoremen Association strike, which occurred Oct. 1-3, 2024.\nThe company is less reliant on China, with just 8% of products sourced from there, according to Panjiva. South Korea is its biggest supplier (60%), followed by Vietnam (11%) and Thailand (9%), it said.\nWhat lies ahead\n\"We expect tariffs to be a bigger headwind in the second half of the year, likely around late 3Q to 4Q, and into next year,\" said Telsey. \"Discretionary companies have taken actions to mitigate the impact while continuing to deliver the compelling value, quality, and innovation that is essential to brands. The big unknown is the price sensitivity and how the consumer reacts to the pricing environment, and how sensitive the consumer is.\"\nBill Simon, former CEO of Walmart U.S., told CNBC that the impact on retailers will vary.\n\"I feel very confident, retailers like [Walmart, Costco] and Amazon with their large scale and heavy food\/consumable business will be able to mitigate, or absorb most or all of the tariff,\" he wrote in an email. \"Meaning, consumers will not notice the impact.\"\n\"On the other hand, general merchandise heavy retailers, [Best Buy, Target] and others will have a more difficult time managing the impact in the short run,\" he said. \"They will not be able to absorb the entirety of it. It will take time for them to adjust their sourcing models to mitigate the tariff expenses.\"\nBest Buy, for example, pulled forward shipments of Samsung gas ovens, microwaves and washing machines as well as LG refrigerators into January, according to ImportGenius, which examined the bills of lading, which are the digital receipts detailing the contents of containers and shippers.\nA flexible assortment\nDiscount retailer Five Below is highly exposed to Chinese tariffs, with 72% of its shipments from this year coming from that country, according to Panjiva. However, it also exports from Mexico (8%), South Korea (7.3%), Vietnam (5%), India (2%), and Singapore (1.4%).\nJerry Storch, former Target vice chairman and CEO of Storch Advisors, told CNBC that Five Below may have an advantage because it can be more flexible with its inventory than Best Buy or Abercrombie, which need to have certain products in its stores.\n\"Best Buy does not have as much flexibility to adjust its assortment,\" said Storch. \"They have to have the TV that you want by brand or size. Abercrombie has to have certain jeans. With Five Below, there's nothing they need to have. They can change their assortment and be opportunistic on what they purchase.\"\nEven with the majority of products imported from China, the company can shop for the best prices, he said.\n\"So if the product is a great deal, they feature that product instead,\" said Storch. \"They can also change their product origin assortment.\"\nReviewing the bills of lading for this year, ImportGenius showed Five Below imported more than 168 containers filled with old antique floor mirrors from China into the U.S. There were also iron drums of filtered pure honey from Vietnam, Tonka dump trucks and Littlest Pet Shop Surprise Trio playsets, both from China, as well as Hershey-branded Smores makers, women's sleep tops and bath sets that contained face cream, cleanser, face mask and pimple patches, as well as holiday decor.\n\"Retailers are focused on mitigating the impact of tariffs by 1) diversifying sourcing; 2) sharing the cost with suppliers, and 3) raising prices to the consumer,\" said Telsey. \"Walmart has seen less impact than expected at this point in the year, but noted it anticipates more pressure ahead as it replenishes goods with the new tariffs attached. Tapestry expects to sell through its lower-cost goods in the first half of its fiscal year, and then higher tariff goods will hit in the second half of the fiscal year.\"\nStorch expects the second half will be better.\n\"Companies have had more time to adjust,\" said Storch. \"They're bringing goods in windows where tariffs are less; they've found different sources of supply in some cases, or they've been able to negotiate with the vendors and have been able to change order sizes. So while there are certain categories which are heavily impacted by tariffs, all in all, I think we're going to be just fine.\"\nThe impact of the tariffs will ultimately rest with the consumer, according to Simon.\n\"The reason we are not seeing much inflation (yet) is that consumers remain in control,\" said Simon. \"For example, if there is a tariff on bananas, and the retail price goes up 10 cents a pound, and the consumer buys fewer bananas and more oranges (from [Florida] and [California]), there would be no inflation, just a price increase on bananas. Retailers and suppliers would then react to the consumers' decisions. They have too many bananas and are ready to spoil, so they lower the price of bananas to a level that will sell the stock. This has a long way to play out.\"","content_hash":"7f429753c5d17bcff255c761bc9f7b1a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7822,"method_rank":0}

(Nasdaq: LWAY) scratched and clawed its way from humble beginnings 40 years ago to become the leading U.S. producer of U.S. kefir, a probiotic dairy beverage that’s become a favorite for the health-conscious set with an overwhelming market share. Along the way, the company teamed up with Danone S.A. (Paris: BN.PA) in the late 90s, giving the French consumer giant an equity stake, now at about 23%, in exchange for a strategic partnership that should have been mutually beneficial.\nBut over time, Danone arguably became more predator than partner. For the last several years, CEO Julie Smolyansky reportedly has grown frustrated as Danone apparently failed to use its global footprint to help Lifeway with goals like international expansion and cheaper sourcing of key ingredients.\nThe milk came to a boil last year, when the French company surprised Ms. Smolyansky by making a public announcement of a $25-a-share takeover offer with virtually no notice. The board rejected that offer, prompting Danone to bump it to $27 a share, which also was rebuffed.\nFrustrated with the lack of a deal, Mr. Smolyansky has spearheaded a co-called consent solicitation, asking shareholders to vote to remove his sister as CEO and replace the entire board. That effort has so far not succeeded and Mr. Smolyansky has had to extend it.\nFast forward several months and the stock has trended higher in the absence of a deal – especially in recent weeks. Earlier in August, the company reported a 10% rise in second-quarter sales, reaching a new record as margins increased.\n“We are just getting started,” Ms. Smolyansky said at the time. “With record sales, expanding margins, category-leading innovation, and a production platform ready to scale, Lifeway is positioned for sustained, profitable growth.” The stock has risen about 12% since the report, now at $31 – far above Danone’s takeover bid prices from last year. In the absence of other significant news, the stock’s latest run is arguably due to the company’s operating performance.\nMeanwhile, Danone and Lifeway have entered a fresh period of negotiations over a possible sale. That discussion is scheduled to last until September 15, though it can be extended if both parties agree to continue in good faith.\nBut Danone, advised by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, which typically works on the defense rather than the offense, has issued an ultimatum – raising questions about whether proper corporate governance will prevail or minority shareholders face risk. In an SEC filing, Danone said that if Lifeway won’t sell willingly, it will vote in favor of Mr. Smolyansky’s consent to “replace the entire Lifeway Board of Directors.”\nSpokespeople for Danone and Lifeway both declined to comment while a public-relations firm representing Edward and Ludmila Smolyanksy didn’t reply to requests for comment from CorpGov.\nIf acted upon, Danone’s threat would seem to clear the way to finally get what it wants: a board that will swiftly approve a clean takeover of the company. However, corporate governance and activism experts say there are a host of legal and practical hurdles that remain in the way.\n“Danone sounds a bit coercive,” Charles Elson, Founding Director, Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware told CorpGov. “It would not be an easy road for Danone.”\nAssuming Danone did support the consent solicitation, it would appear be close to tipping the scales in Mr. Smolyansky’s favor. With Danone’s 23% stake and a combined 26% stake between Mr. Smolyansky and his mother, they’d be just shy of 50% support.\nBut that’s just the beginning of the process. Presumably, Mr. Smolyansky’s slate of directors is very supportive of a deal. Yet they still have obligations that cannot be shirked – no matter what their biases may be.\n“As a general rule, boards are supposed to seek to maximize value for all shareholders,” said Kenneth Mantel, Partner, Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP who isn’t involved in the situation. “A brand-new set of directors elected in a proxy contest has the same legal obligations from the moment they are elected.”\nAnd Danone may want to be careful about its actions – even behind closed doors. That’s because there is a serious likelihood that many details of the negotiation will be public for all to see. In such a going-private style transaction, the SEC may require extensive disclosure under rule 13e-3, according to Francisco J. Morales Barrón, Partner, Mergers & Acquisitions and Private Equity, Vinson & Elkins LLP, an attorney who also is not involved in the situation.\nProfessor Elson added that the key question will be “did you exercise your fiduciary duty to get the highest price?” He said that if the board failed to do so, it could even face a fiduciary duty lawsuit.\nAnd at the end of the day, extensive shareholder support will be needed to get a deal done. Under law in Illinois, a takeover of this kind requires a 2\/3 supermajority shareholder vote. That’s a quirk of Illinois: The law in Delaware, the most popular state where companies incorporate, only requires a simple majority.\nAt the end of the day, Danone will likely need to come up with a number that impresses minority shareholders if it wants to own Lifeway. That raises the question of what the company is truly worth.\nThere is only one analyst who covers Lifeway full time, and he’s bullish on its fundamentals. We “believe Danone’s unsolicited $27\/sh offer is increasingly divergent from the fair value of this high-growth, on-trend, category-defining brand,” Ben Klieve, Senior Research Analyst at Lake Street Capital Markest said in a note to clients Aug. 12, the day after Lifeway reported earnings. He also raised his price target to $33 a share, up from $30 a share.\nMr. Klieve underscored the company’s “on-trend nature, its exceptional financial performance, and overwhelming market share within the kefir category” to justify his target. He added that his target is well below the 20x EV\/EBITDA peers command, with his target reflecting a multiple of just 14x.\nWhile the agitating Smolyansky family – and assuredly Danone – were thrilled by a $25-a-share takeout, the company has proven it is worth more. And while Danone can flex its muscles, it’s bound to stumble if it tries to bully minority shareholders.","content_hash":"972f8c347ad5ae11b94f95525c2eada7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7744,"method_rank":0}

The convenience services industry is attracting an increasing number of new operators every year. Naturals2Go, a company that has helped many new operators get started since 2009, has certainly played a big part in the industry’s growth.\nAn operator since 1988\nNaturals2Go has been in business since 1988, when the company operated “U-Turn” vending machines (put in a quarter, turn the crank and the item pops out). By 2009, already an established vending operator, Naturals2Go started the business opportunity side of the company, helping new operators get into the vending business. According to Natali Pupovac-Peters, head of global operations, 2,500 operators have started in the Naturals2Go network, accounting for 20,000 pieces of equipment and representing a 14% industry market share.\nThe TikTok message gets it wrong\nWith all the TikTok and YouTube videos promoting the vending business as passive income — an easy way to make fistfuls of cash — Pupovac-Peters said that dispelling the misconception that the vending business is about “little work and passive income″ is a big part of their messaging to prospective operators.\n“It is a hot business now. Everybody is curious about vending. It is also a very rewarding business because so much goes into it, and there is something for everyone,” Pupovac- Peters said. “If you are into technology, there’s that piece to it. If you are into customer service, there’s that piece to it. If you are into AI, there’s that piece to it. If you are into business development, there’s that piece to it.”\n“The biggest message that we tell operators is that vending is a simple business, but you still have to work hard and dedicate your time, energy and money, just like any other business. It is not going to be an overnight success. Nothing is. But if you stay in it, if you can get through those tough times of finding the best locations, selling the right products, finding the best staff, it is going to be a very fruitful business that you can enjoy for a long time,” she said. “But it’s not a passive business in any way. I don’t believe in passive businesses. If a passive business really existed, everybody would be in it.”\nThe VendTech connection and the new operator experience\nWhile Naturals2Go paves the way for operators to enter the convenience services business and provides ongoing support along the way, their affiliated company, VendTech, led by president and owner Heath Falzarano.\nVendTech is the engineering and innovation force behind Naturals2Go, delivering everything their operators need to get started, including smart vending machines, and then helping them grow once established into AI coolers, office coffee service equipment and micro market fixtures. All this is backed by what Pupovac-Peters called, “The best in payment processing and vending management systems.”\nPupovac-Peters said there is a consistent and proven process in place at Naturals2Go that is designed to maximize operator success.\n“New operators purchase anywhere from six to 20 machines — a package that includes the equipment, shipping, financing options and a lot of support. There is an onboarding process that they complete in a few weeks. We host an operator training session every six weeks with anywhere from 30 to 45 new operator groups. It is a two-day, very hands-on training session in Savannah, Georgia. They get to touch the machine, fix the machine, break the machine, fill the machine and experience what it is like to work with the equipment prior to getting their own machines on location,” she explained, adding that there is also an extensive online training program.\nBusiness development services and a focus on people\nAccording to Pupovac-Peters, a major differentiator between Naturals2Go and its competition is its strong business development team, which finds qualified locations for operators.\n“We have boots on the ground that go and find locations for our operators. If you buy 20 machines, we will find you places for those 20 machines. That is one of the biggest reasons people do come to Naturals2Go, because it really is like a business in a box. Ongoing repair and technical support are also part of our program,” she said.\n“Our focus on the operator has taken us where we are today,” Pupovac-Peters said. “We’ve had some amazing hockey stick growth, as we call it, over the last several years. It’s happening because of our focus on people, both from us caring about our operators and teaching our operators to care about their customers. One of the things that Heath likes to do in training, is ask the operators, ‘Who here is now in the vending business?’\"\n“After they put their hands up,” Pupovac-Peters continued, “he reminds them that they are in the people business, but they just happen to be selling snacks and beverages.”\nThe importance of NAMA\nAs Naturals2Go continues to grow, Pupovac-Peters said the company recognizes the necessity of being “all in” on NAMA involvement, which includes a huge exhibitor presence at the 2025 show in May and participation in advocacy efforts.\n“We have 160 employees now,” she noted. “Anyone who is a serious player in the business needs to get behind NAMA and support what they do for the industry.”\nTullio’s take: Does Naturals2Go make sense for new operators?\nHere are five reasons why I believe their program is a good choice for new operators who are just starting out in the business.\n- Financing options. Lack of capital is a business killer for every size company. A little financial backing can go a long way.\n- A turnkey solution. Naturals2Go is offering a clearly defined package: a specific number of machines that work, business development support and technical support after the installation.\n- Training. There is a clear emphasis on industry-related training, formalized and framed by a clear message: “This business is hard work – not passive income.”\n- Track record. The people I have interacted with on the management side are experienced in business, and the company has plenty of convenience services industry people on board as well. Plus, Naturals2Go is a long-time operator with an ever-expanding footprint of their own.\n- Flexibility. According to Pupovac-Peters, operators are not restricted from purchasing software and equipment from other sources as they grow, but since equipment is an important profit center for Naturals2Go, they are motivated to make sure the equipment and software are state-of-the-art and workable for an expanding operation.\nFor more information about Naturals2Go, visit naturals2go.com\nAbout the Author\nBob Tullio\nBob Tullio is a content specialist, speaker, sales trainer, consultant and contributing editor of Automatic Merchandiser and VendingMarketWatch.com.

They’re down 7.5% and 6%, now trading at $187.85 and $0.2097, respectively.\nThe smallest fall in this category is BNB’s 1.2%, now changing hands at $862.\nAs for the top 100 coins, three coins appreciated, but only one above 1%. Cronos (CRO) is up 1.9% to the price of $0.1598.\nThe others are up below 0.5% each, meaning that they are practically unchanged.\nOn the other hand, Chainlink (LINK) dropped the most: 9.8% to $23.08.\nIt’s followed by OKB (OKB), which fell 8.4%, now trading at $172.\nMeanwhile, economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff argued that BTC would slip to about $75,000, maybe more.\nHe advised BTC holders to “sell now and buy back later.” He wrote that “given all the hype and corporate buying, this weakness should be cause for concern.”\nAccording to Schiff’s prediction, Bitcoin could plunge to the level last seen on April 2025. “At a minimum, a decline to about $75K is in play, just below $MSTR’s average cost.”\nSean Dawson, head of research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz, commented that chances of BTC falling to $100,000 by end of September increased from 20% to 35%, while the chances for ETH retesting $4,000 in the same period surpassed 55%.\nHe stated that: “With macro pressure building and volatility spiking, markets are resetting fast, and the path ahead could be bumpier than many were positioned for.”\nNotably, “it’s been a bloody start to the week for the majors,” said Dawson. There was over $900 million in liquidations across the market, with ETH and BTC seeing the most of that amount: $324 million and $209 million, respectively. Also, “nearly all were long positions forced underwater after a broad-based correction.”\nSource: Derive.xyz, Coinglass\n“This sharp move appears to be the result of overleveraged positioning, particularly following ETH’s recent run-up, and an overnight dip in the S&P 500, which weighed on risk assets more broadly,” Dawson writes.\nSubsequently, short-dated volatility has surged. Daily BTC volatility jumped from 15% to 38%, and ETH volatility went from 41% to 70%.\n“These moves reflect rising trader anxiety ahead of key macroeconomic catalysts, notably US GDP figures due to be released August 28 and the unemployment rate to be released early September,” Dawson says.\nSource: Derive.xyz, Amberdata\nFinally, there was also a shift in sentiment. As an example, Dawson gave the 25-delta skew turning negative for BTC and ETH, showing a preference for puts over calls. “This is the strongest demand for downside protection we’ve seen in two weeks. Traders appear to be bracing for potential retests of $4K for ETH and $100K for BTC,” he concluded.\nAt the time of writing on Tuesday morning, BTC trades at $109,971. The coin saw another sharp plunge for the second day in a row. It went down from $112,815 to $109,214.\nIt’s now 11.4% away from its all-time high of $124,128.\nMoreover, it’s possible that the price will continue to move towards the $105,000 level.\nBitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView\nEthereum is currently trading at $4,414. It too recorded a sharp decline today, from the intra-day high of $4,667 to the low of $4,342, before recovering very slightly.\nMuch like the general market, ETH still has room to drop further, at least for now. We’re now looking at a possibility of $4,300 and lower.\nMoreover, the crypto market sentiment decreased further, barely staying within the neutral zone. The crypto fear and greed index fell from 50 yesterday to 43 today. This is the lowest point it’s been since late June.\nThe current level signals increasing fear moving into the market, as well as an increase in bearish sentiment.\nSource: CoinMarketCap\nMeanwhile, as of 25 August, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke the latest streak of outflows, with positive flows of $219 million.\nSix funds saw flows, and all of them inflows.

To view the entire series, click here.\nAs construction companies increasingly rely on subcontractors and temporary workers to meet project demands, the concept of “borrowed employees” has become central to workplace liability discussions.\nThis issue has only grown sharper in 2025. With labor shortages continuing and immigration status scrutiny making hiring more complex, many contractors are turning to subcontractors and staffing agencies to fill gaps. That reliance means a much higher percentage of temporary or “borrowed” employees on jobsites than in the past, and with that comes added liability risk.\nA borrowed employee is someone who works for one employer but is temporarily lent to another, with consent. While working for the borrowing employer, that employer generally assumes responsibility.\nThe complication comes when one of these workers is injured. Deciding who is liable depends on contract language, state law and above all, the actual control exercised over the employee.\nAssigning responsibility\nAttorney Jerry Lehocky, founding partner of Pond Lehocky Giordano in Philadelphia, said the extent of liability depends on whether the injured worker is deemed a borrowed employee of the general contractor or remains an employee of the supplying business. That determination hinges on the amount of control the contractor has.\nIf there is insufficient control by the general contractor over the work performed by the employee, then the subcontractor or labor-supplying group remains the employer of that employee, he said.\n“If the borrowed employee is not an employee of the general contractor, then that general contractor could face exposure under a negligence action brought by the employee in addition to a workers’ compensation action against the subcontractor,” Lehocky said. “The amount of monetary exposure to the general contractor is multiples of what the workers’ compensation exposure is.”\nLehocky said that contracts may address some of these issues, but language is not controlling if the facts show otherwise.\n“For example, the contract could state very specifically that the supplying employer remains the ‘employer’ for purposes of workers’ compensation; however, if the actual facts are that the general contractor is in actuality controlling the work performed by the employee, the contract language can be easily voided,” he said.\nMaria Moffatt, an attorney with GerstleSnelson in Dallas, noted that liability for the prime contractor depends on several factors: state statutes, contract terms, the parameters of the employment agreement and most importantly, the authority exercised on the jobsite.\n“Therefore, the provisions of the contract as to supervision of workers, safety meetings and general control of the jobsite become very important,” she said. “And then if there are contracts or employment agreements governing the borrowed employee, those provisions have to be read in conjunction with the prime contract’s provisions.”\nIn general, though, an owner or general contractor is responsible for the safety of the workplace or jobsite for all workers on site and the contractor who is supervising, using or directing the work of the borrowed employee would most likely have responsibility for their safety unless contractually stated otherwise, she said.\nAttorney Carol Sigmond, a partner at Greenspoon Marder in New York, pointed to the “borrowed employee doctrine,” which makes the borrower liable.\n“Sometimes, the employee is deemed a ‘special employee,’ which is a matter of state law, so the rules will vary from state to state somewhat,” she said. “This is often used to shift liability to a basically judgment-proof single-purpose entity away from the ‘real’ company for financial reasons.”\nFor that reason, when this doctrine is invoked to protect the real employer, courts will look at the degree of control the lending employer has over the borrower, she said. They will also look at the oversight by the lending employer, the relationship between the borrower and the lender, decision making by the lending employer, who is actually controlling the work site and the borrowed employee.\nImportant contract provisions\nContractors should require their subs to disclose if borrowed employees are used. Moffatt said contracts should clearly state who is responsible for oversight, payroll, wage determination, insurance or workers’ compensation, employee status, provision of tools and materials and scope of work.\n“The best practice is to include a provision that outlines the responsibilities of the company that is the owner or general contractor — who is in charge by contract of the construction site — and the company that supplies the labor or workers,” she said.\nMatthew Koskinen, a construction attorney at Dickinson Wright in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said that in states such as Florida, courts presume general employment. Contractors must rebut that presumption and show that the borrowed employee relationship exists.\n“Factors that the courts utilize in determining whether this relationship exists revolve around the existence of a contract, the work being performed at the time of injury being that of the special employer, along with the special employer’s control over the borrowed employee’s work,” he said. “Accordingly, having an agreement in place that touches upon each of these elements is critical and agreements can and should be executed at each layer for optimal protection.”\nHe added that provisions addressing insurance coverage and limits, proof of coverage, remedies if coverage is cancelled and indemnity obligations are also key.\nAttorney Adam Richards, also with Dickinson Wright, said that whenever analyzing liability in connection with construction site injuries, the starting and ending point is often workers’ compensation coverage.\n“Throughout the country, an employer is typically immune from liability in exchange for providing such insurance coverage, unless an exception applies, such as intentional misconduct or gross negligence,” he said. “Therefore, if and when dealing with borrowed employees on a jobsite, it is first critical for the general or prime contractor to ensure that workers’ compensation coverage is indeed being provided by the initial employer or the borrowing employer\/subcontractor, and if not, that the contractor has adequate coverage that would cover those borrowed employees in the absence of any other coverage downstream.”\nIn all cases, contractors must be able to show that the borrowed employee relationship exists in order to claim immunity under state workers’ compensation laws.\n“A contractor should always consult with an attorney first if they are going to be using workers or employees that belong to another employer or contractor,” Moffatt said.\nBorrowed employees help fill vital gaps on construction projects, but they create layers of liability that can be costly if left unaddressed. Contracts, insurance coverage and a realistic look at who is actually directing the work are what determine responsibility.\nFor general contractors, the safest approach is transparency, strong agreements and early legal guidance before workers ever step on site","content_hash":"7a681feaa098aa8ab4da9b1d7be62948","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7330,"method_rank":0}

That’s $200,000 less than they said they needed last year, and nearly the same as the figure quoted in 2022.\nThe fact that the target hasn’t moved much in the last three years hasn’t made retirement any more accessible, however. The vast majority of U.S. adults are still falling short of this benchmark and could be hurtling towards a challenging retirement.\nHere’s why, and what you can do to help yourself reach that goalpost figure.\nLack of savings and investments\nAlthough most Americans agree that they need to enter the seven-figure club to retire comfortably, only a small fraction of the population has actually achieved this target.\nAs of 2024, the U.S. was home to 7.9 million millionaires, according to Capgemini Research. That’s roughly 2.3% of the country’s total adult population, which means that almost 97% of Americans haven’t yet reached millionaire status. Keep in mind, that figure includes people of all ages and wealth levels, not just those nearing retirement.\nSeveral factors contribute to this shortfall. While some Americans may not prioritize retirement savings, many face barriers that make it difficult to set aside money, including rising housing costs, student loan debt and inflation. The average American saved only 4.5% of their disposable personal income in June, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\nTo counteract these factors, starting with small, daily habits can make a big difference over time.\nWith Acorns, every purchase you make with a linked debit or credit card is automatically rounded up to the nearest dollar. The excess — coins that would otherwise wind up in your pocket if you were paying cash — goes into a smart investment portfolio tailored to your appetite for risk.\nHere’s an example of how that pans out. If you purchased a doughnut for $2.30, Acorns would round it up to $3.00 before you’ve even licked the sugar off your fingers, while automatically investing the 70-cent difference on your behalf.\nThat can add up fast. $2.50 worth of daily round-ups amounts to $900 per year — and that’s before your savings earn money and compound returns in the stock market.\nBut saving your spare change is just the beginning. Acorns will also give you a $20 bonus investment if you set up a monthly recurring contribution.\nOnce you’ve started bolstering your investment portfolio, you may also wish to consider alternative assets like real estate. This can help build long-term wealth and protect your portfolio from stock market volatility.\nHomeshares allows accredited investors to gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.\nTheir approach can provide an effective, hands-off way to invest in high-quality residential properties, with the added benefit of diversification across regional markets — with a minimum investment of $25,000.\nWith risk-adjusted target returns ranging from 14% to 17%, the Homeshares’ U.S. Home Equity Fund could unlock lucrative real estate opportunities, offering accredited investors a low-maintenance alternative to traditional property ownership.\nAlthough 97% of people aren’t yet millionaires, many could eventually meet that target if they start investing sooner rather than later.\nA 20-year-old, for instance, needs to invest just $330 a month into an asset class that delivers a 7% to 8% annual return to reach $1.26 million by the time they turn 65. The luxury of time significantly boosts your chances of becoming a millionaire.\nThis doesn’t mean it’s too late for middle-aged savers to reach that millionaire milestone, but it will take a significantly greater investment. If a 50-year-old hasn’t started saving for retirement, they’d need to invest $3,958 a month at a steady 7% return to reach $1.26 million by retirement.\nHowever, according to one Goldman Sachs report, investors could expect the S&P 500 to deliver just 3% annualized nominal returns over the next 10 years. After an average 13% yearly return for the past decade, a new strategy outside of the stock market may be needed for that level of outsized gain, especially if you’re late to investing.\nEarning a higher return, like those that some alternative asset classes are known for, can help you reach your financial goals faster. For example, over 80% of young, wealthy American investors surveyed by Bank of America report they’re interested in, or already invested in, fine art for a portion of their portfolios.\nMasterworks’ art investing platform makes it easy to join them. They handle every step, from authentication and acquisition, to storage and sale — no art expertise or billionaire’s checkbook needed.\nMasterworks has already distributed over $60 million in total proceeds, including the principal, to investors across 23 exits, including the profitable return from selling a Basquiat painting for $8 million in 2024.\nGold is another asset class that has outperformed the stock market in recent years. For instance, from 2020 to 2024, the spot price of gold has achieved better annual returns than the S&P 500. Gold is also often seen as a safe-haven investment, providing some insulation from market shifts – tariff-driven or otherwise.\nPriority Gold is an industry leader in precious metals, offering physical delivery of gold and silver.\nThey also offer retirement accounts and the ability to convert an existing IRA into a gold IRA. Priority Gold provides 100% free rollover, as well as free shipping and free storage for up to five years. Qualifying purchases can also receive up to $10,000 in free silver.\nTo learn more about how Priority Gold can help you reduce inflation’s impact on your nest egg, you can download their free 2025 gold investor bundle.\nThe real ‘retire comfortably’ number will be unique to your situation\nSaving $1.26 million doesn’t guarantee a comfortable retirement for everyone. For example, if your net worth is $1 million but your annual living expenses are $200,000 or $300,000, you would need much more than $1 million in savings to continue living the same lifestyle in retirement.\nIn fact, two-thirds of millionaires don’t consider themselves “wealthy” and half of them say their financial planning needs improvement, according to another study by Northwestern Mutual.\nIn short, being a millionaire doesn’t mean you’re automatically ready for retirement.\nIf you live in a state or another country with a lower cost of living, your target might be smaller. According to Empower's calculations on tax burdens and costs of living, states like Alaska and New Hampshire could be ideal for retirees looking to minimize their expenses.\nTry using a retirement calculator or consulting a financial advisor to determine your personal target.\nAdvisor.com can help connect you with a local financial advisor suited to your needs.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"The rapid surge in Cambricon's valuation reflects not just its recent growth but also heavy anticipation of future potential,\" said Ray Wang, research director with a focus on the global semiconductor industry at Futurum Group. \"This optimism is largely driven by regulatory and geopolitical shifts, strong domestic AI demand, and the latest DeepSeek optimisations for local hardware.\"\nThe company's core business is the development and design of AI chips for cloud servers, edge devices and terminals, as well as data-centre clusters. Cambricon is reportedly developing its flagship Siyuan 690, set to succeed the Siyuan 590 series launched in 2023. The new chip is expected to approach the capabilities of Nvidia's H100.\nAn undated photo of Cambricon founders Chen Tianjin (left) and Chen Tianshi.

Photo: Handout>\nCambricon was founded in 2016 by two brothers, Chen Yunji and Chen Tianshi, who are now 42 and 40 years old, respectively. Born in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi province, they both went on to work at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the country's top science research agency.\nThe Chen brothers were students in the academy's elite \"genius youth class\", a special education programme designed to train top local talent, before they joined the academy's Institute of Computing Technology. The elder brother focused on semiconductors while the younger turned to AI.\nBoth shared a passion for chip design. According to an interview with the elder Chen published by official media China Science Daily in September 2024, the brothers shared \"laughter and tears\" in jointly working on deep-learning processors, also known as AI accelerators.\nOne time, they argued about a research issue so fervently that they ended up in a physical fight, according to the older Chen. \"As brothers, we can put aside all pretence and honestly face all kinds of problems,\" he was quoted as saying by the newspaper. \"Perhaps that's the reason we can rapidly advance our cross-disciplinary research into chip design and AI algorithms.\"\nThe pair began exploring the idea of \"AI plus chip\" around 2010, in which they studied the use of chips to accelerate deep learning algorithms.\nCambricon chairman Chen Tianshi speaks at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai in 2021.

With support from CAS, they taped out a prototype deep learning processor the following year, calling it Cambricon, after the Cambrian era of rapid evolutionary expansion.\nThe younger Chen is now Cambricon's chairman and largest individual shareholder, directly owning a 28.6 per cent stake, making him one of the richest people in China with a personal net worth of US$20 billion. The company's second-largest shareholder is a CAS-affiliated asset manager, with 15.7 per cent. The elder Chen returned to academia shortly after the company's founding and is now the head of the CAS Laboratory of Processors, the top Chinese lab in the field.\nRecent financial data shows that Cambricon's business is starting to take off.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company recorded its first quarterly profit of 272 million yuan (US$38 million), reversing years of losses, while revenue rose 75.5 per cent year on year to 989 million yuan.\nIn the first quarter of this year, revenue surged 42 times compared with a year earlier, according to a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, while income was 355 million yuan compared with a loss of 226 million yuan a year ago.\nChen Tianshi (far left) at the ceremony for Cambricon's public listing in Shanghai in 2020.

Photo: Handout>\nThe China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, a think tank affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, listed the firm as one of eight hardware suppliers with DeepSeek-compatible products.\nChina's AI momentum picked up last week, when DeepSeek said its latest V3.1 model was trained using a novel FP8 data format, which was \"suitable for home-grown chips soon to be released\", without naming suppliers.\nThe comments came after reports that Nvidia paused production of China-specific H20 chips, which Beijing has flagged as a security concern, further fuelling local enthusiasm for Cambricon.\nLike Nvidia, Cambricon designs chips and outsources the wafer manufacturing to foundries. Nvidia's AI chips are exclusively made by the world's No 1 foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).\nCambricon was added to Washington's trade blacklist in December 2022, restricting it from acquiring US core technology, including using foundry services offered by TSMC.\nThere is no public information about what foundry Cambricon uses for its chips, but since it cannot access TSMC, it is likely that it relies on mainland foundries such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation or Hua Hong Semiconductor.\nCambricon's market value is now US$70 billion, about 70 per cent of Intel's US$107 billion. It took Intel 28 years to reach the market cap of what Cambricon did in nine years.\nGoldman Sachs over the weekend reiterated its \"buy\" rating on Cambricon, lifting its 12-month price target by 50 per cent to 1,835 yuan from 1,223 yuan. The bank cited China's cloud providers stepping up capital expenditure, customers diversifying away from US chips, and Cambricon's pledge to invest 4.5 billion yuan in AI chips and software over the next three years.\nBrokerages have followed with bullish calls. Guosen Securities expects revenues of 5.0 billion yuan for 2025, 7.3 billion yuan for 2026 and 10.2 billion yuan 2027. \"The company's rapid revenue growth reflects its success in expanding markets and enabling AI deployment,\" Guosen wrote in a June research note, highlighting robust demand for domestic computing power.","content_hash":"437101e0cc8b08d18cbb14088fd53a66","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7200,"method_rank":0}

Unsurprisingly, companies building digital infrastructure or offering breakthrough digital innovations are seeing demand compound rapidly. Some of these technology companies are exceptionally well positioned to capture these massive tailwinds.\nHere's why the share prices of these two technology stocks could grow dramatically in the coming years.\nNvidia\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) positioned itself as a major AI infrastructure player and continues to demonstrate strong growth momentum. The company expects revenues to be $45 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending July 27, 2025) despite an estimated $8 billion headwind from halted H20 shipments (a China-compliant alternative to Nvidia's high-end AI chips) to China.\nManagement also expects generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margins to be 71.8%, plus or minus 50 basis points, in the second quarter, which is getting closer to its target of the mid-70% range by the end of fiscal 2026.\nLoop Capital's analyst John Donovan projects spending on graphics processing units (GPUs) and custom AI accelerators could reach roughly $2 trillion by 2028, representing 50% to 60% of global computation infrastructure spend, up from just 15% in 2025. Nvidia stands to be a key beneficiary of this shift with its Blackwell GPUs launched in the fourth quarter of 2024 and optimized for inference workloads that power real-world AI applications.\nThe Blackwell platform is already ramping at the fastest pace in Nvidia's history, underscoring its dominant position in this expanding market. Nvidia's Blackwell systems are also in demand in the sovereign AI infrastructure projects across the Middle East and Europe.\nChina also remains a potential growth catalyst for Nvidia. Although restrictions on H20 exports negatively affected performance in the past few quarters, Nvidia is rumored to be developing a powerful AI chip (the B30A) specifically for China that is based on the advanced Blackwell architecture. U.S. President Donald Trump seems inclined to allow the company to sell a less advanced version of the Blackwell chip to China. Hence, even with a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the U.S., Nvidia stands to benefit from the robust demand trends in China.\nIn addition to GPUs, Nvidia is strengthening its software ecosystem, which has helped build a sticky customer base. The company's Omniverse platform is gaining traction with industrial customers for design and robotics, while enterprises are increasingly adopting Nvidia AI Enterprise to scale AI workloads across cloud and on-premise environments.\nNvidia trades at around 36 times forward earnings -- a premium valuation that seems justified, considering the company's solid and well-entrenched advantages in the AI market. Considering the strong financial guidance, accelerating adoption of Blackwell systems across enterprise and sovereign AI markets, and expanding software ecosystem, Nvidia's shares could continue to rise rapidly in the coming months.\nMicron Technology\nMicron Technology(NASDAQ: MU) has become a key memory supplier to the AI industry and continues to show strong momentum. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended May 29, 2025), the company saw revenues jump 37% year over year to $9.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.91, beating Wall Street expectations.\nSales to data centers more than doubled, driven by robust demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and DRAM on the back of AI infrastructure growth. Micron also reported free cash flow of over $1.9 billion -- the highest quarterly performance in the past six years, reflecting the strength of its product mix and demand environment. Micron now expects revenue of $10.7 billion and improved profitability in the fourth quarter.\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that by 2028, over 75% of global spending on AI infrastructure will go toward accelerated servers (GPUs and custom AI chips). Since this shift will require massive amounts of advanced memory, Micron will continue to benefit from this trend.\nThe company's high-bandwidth memory 3rd-generation extended (HBM3E), an advanced technology generation offering improved performance and speed, continues to witness strong demand. The company's HBM chip capacity is already booked for the calendar year 2025.\nMicron expects its global HBM market share to be nearly equal to its DRAM share, which is between 20% and 25%, in the second half of 2025. With the company estimating HBM's target addressable market to be nearly $35 billion in 2025 and over $100 billion by 2030, this tailwind could dramatically drive up the company's top and bottom lines in the coming years.\nMicron is also expanding its product base beyond traditional memory and storage solutions. It recently introduced AI-optimized storage solutions (SSDs, or solid-state drives) for data centers and specialized radiation-tolerant memory products for space applications. These moves are helping the company diversify into new verticals. The company also announced a $200 billion investment plan for the U.S., with $150 billion allotted for manufacturing and $50 billion for research and development.\nMicron trades at 11.8 times forward earnings, lower than its historical five-year average of 17.5. Considering its AI-driven growth potential, there seems to be significant upside for this stock.\nWith record financial performance, a fully booked HBM pipeline, and rapid expansion in new markets, Micron is positioned to benefit disproportionately from the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Then CEO Jensen Huang and the rest of Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) management team will hold a conference call with investors to discuss the results, take questions from Wall Street analysts, and provide some commentary on the red-hot artificial intelligence sector.\nIt could prove to be a big moment for the stock.\nNvidia, the ultimate pick-and-shovels play for artificial intelligence, has now been the ultimate darling on Wall Street for the past several years. The business flourished, the margins are incredible, and Huang is arguably the most closely followed CEO on Wall Street. Here's why Aug. 27 could be a catalyst-driven day for the stock.\nWhat Wall Street is expecting\nWhenever investors go into an earnings call, the most basic -- and also one of the most important -- things they look at are the numbers. How much earnings per share and revenue did the company generate in the quarter and how does that stack up compared to consensus estimates? Consensus numbers compile an average of all the estimates from Wall Street analysts covering a stock.\nIn the second quarter, Nvidia is expected to post $0.95 of diluted earnings per share (EPS) or adjusted EPS of $1.01, according to data from Visible Alpha, which compiled estimates from 24 analysts. Meanwhile, revenue is projected to come in at $46.38 billion. These estimates are calling for a significant increase in EPS and revenue from the same quarter a year ago, in which the company posted $0.67 diluted EPS on revenue of just over $30 billion.\nHowever, gross margins will likely be lower than the 75.1% the company posted last year. On a full-year basis, Wall Street is expecting the company to post $4.17 diluted EPS, or $4.42 operating EPS, with total revenue of over $204 billion, up roughly 56% year over year. Most analysts are optimistic going into the call. Wedbush analysts Matt Bryson and Antoine Legault recently reiterated an outperform on the stock and hiked their price target from $175 to $210.\n\"We continue to believe growth in announced hyperscale spend is largely going to build out AI capabilities and in particular ends up flowing to NVDA which supplies a disproportionate amount of the AI server value,\" the two wrote in a research note. \"As such, we view CQ2 CSP (cloud service providers) capex results as supportive of this thesis, with hyperscale spend up 67% Y\/Y (+23% Q\/Q), marking an acceleration from CQ1.\"\nWhat's going on with China?\nOne of the big stories for Nvidia right now has to do with its business in China. Not only have tariffs made things more difficult, but President Donald Trump's administration temporarily restricted Nvidia from selling chips to China, a market that previously made up a significant amount of revenue for the company, requiring Nvidia to first obtain export licenses. As a result, Nvidia took a $5.5 billion charge earlier this year \"associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves.\"\nEarlier this month, media outlets reported that Nvidia and other players in the microchip sector had come to an agreement with the Trump administration that would allow them to sell chips in China, but would also require them to give 15% of their Chinese chip sales to the U.S. government. Reuters also recently reported that Nvidia is working on a scaled-back Blackwell chip that Trump may allow the company to sell in China. This chip would be more powerful than the less-advanced H20 chips Nvidia has been selling to China under previous government restrictions. Interestingly, media outlets also recently reported that Nvidia has instructed some of its suppliers to stop production on its H20 chips as China raised questions about the chips' security. That only adds to the confusion, so some clarity on what's going on with its business in China could be helpful.\n\"If NVDA were to include China in its guidance, we believe it would contribute an incremental $2-3 billion in revenue,\" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said in a recent research note.\nCatalysts can be positive or negative, but focus on the long term\nIt's important for investors to understand that catalysts can go both ways. If Nvidia misses estimates or provides guidance that is lower than analysts were expecting, the stock could struggle. Additionally, if Nvidia's management team doesn't discuss China or mentions it very little, the stock could also struggle. That's why investors should focus on a longer-term horizon -- investing based on quarterly results is extremely difficult.\nTrading at about 40 times forward earnings, Nvidia's stock isn't cheap. However, viewed as the ultimate play for AI, a technology expected to change everything, valuation may be less important to the market right now. Long-term believers in AI can certainly continue to hold the stock long term. However, understanding what could potentially move a stock will help investors make better, more rational decisions on their investing journey.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

There's still going to be one sooner or later, though. That's just the market's cyclical nature.\nSo what (if anything) do investors need to do about this inevitable setback whenever it materializes? It largely depends on their particular situation. Younger people with time to ride out the rough patch should do so. But older investors who are near or already in retirement? That's a different story.\nWith that as the backdrop, here are four specific things retirees will want to consider about bear markets in order to minimize their overall long-term impact on retirement plans.\n1. They're far more dangerous early in your retirement than later\nLiving on your retirement savings is something of a balancing act. You're still trying to grow your money -- or at least preserve as much of it as is feasibly possible -- while at the same time you're withdrawing money from this very same retirement account. If you end up doing too much of the latter, it becomes very difficult do the former.\nThe so-called 4% rule of thumb is a way of maintaining this balance. This rule simply says that withdrawing 4% of a 50\/50 portfolio (50% stocks\/50% bonds) in your first year of retirement and then increasing your withdrawal every year by the prior year's inflation rate should allow your portfolio to last 30 years -- assuming the market's long-term historical performance persists into the future.\nSome number-crunching done by Morningstar as well as brokerage firm Charles Schwab, however, adds some important context to the 4% rule. That is, suffering sizable losses early in retirement dramatically raises the odds of not getting a full 30 years out of your retirement savings. Namely, Morningstar noted that 70% of its portfolio simulations that ended in failure were linked to losses taken in the first five years of a 30-year stretch. Similarly, Schwab's math indicates that a 15% (or more) setback during the first two years of retirement would likely completely deplete the account by the 18th year of retirement.\nThe issue is the cascading effect of having less money left in the account early on to achieve some growth. It just doesn't become evident until several years later, when there's far less you can do about it.\n2. You should be comfortable enough with your holdings to not care (much)\nThe trick, therefore, is building a portfolio that's incapable of suffering such a major setback. Ensuring you're at a 50\/50 allocation will significantly help, but you'll also want to make sure that the half of your portfolio consisting of stocks are the right ones to hold in retirement. If you're holding a bunch of risky technology stocks that are overly vulnerable to bear markets, you're still taking on more risk than retirees arguably should.\nIn this vein, it's also worth mentioning that trying to predict a bear market and adjusting your portfolio accordingly can be just as problematic. Plenty of feared bear markets never actually take shape, leaving too many investors underinvested at the worst possible time. You really want to assume you can't predict anything, and therefore remain as prepared as possible for every potential outcome.\n3. Adjust your spending before you start selling stocks just to fund withdrawals\nBut what if the bear market has gone on for too long or done too much damage to continue supporting the retirement income you need? It could happen.\nBefore you start selling stocks just to continue making predetermined withdrawals, do everything in your power not to. You'd be better served in the long run by finding a way -- any way -- of reducing the size of your annual distribution for even just a couple of years rather than selling beaten-down stocks that may be on the verge of a rebound.\nThis might help encourage you to hang on: Statistics say a recovery is likely to be closer than you think. The average bear market only lasts a little less than 10 months, according to data from mutual fund company Hartford Funds. If you can avoid selling anything in the middle of one, it's well worth it.\nOf course, this is also why it's smart to have up to a couple years' worth of cash needs tucked away in a retirement account. It doesn't feel all that productive, but the less flexible your spending is, the more you need to plan on the worst-case scenario. Two years' worth of cash needs should do the trick.\n4. The market will eventually recover, and you want to be fully invested when it starts\nFinally, most everyone understands that stocks will eventually bounce back from a bear market. They always do. The hard part is not knowing exactly when. If you think you're going to know when a recovery starts taking shape, however, think again. Not only is it impossible to know exactly when a rebound is starting, waiting even just a little while to know for sure can dramatically crimp your long-term returns.\nAs Hartford Funds also points out, the first half of a bull market typically outperforms the second half. But even then, waiting for absolute certainty can prove costly. Stocks gain an average of 13.6% in just the first month of a new bull market, and gain 25.3% -- again, on average -- during a new bull market's first three months. You don't want to miss out on any of that.\nSo, as difficult as it may be to do so, you'll want to remain as fully invested as you feasibly can into and through a bear market -- even if that means picking stocks very differently than you did before you retired.\nThe $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income.\nOne easy trick could pay you as much as $23,760 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump's attacks on Federal Reserve policymakers are emerging as the biggest threat in decades to central bank independence, which is widely seen as key to keeping down inflation and maintaining stability in the global financial system.\nTrump's unprecedented threat to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over alleged mortgage-related improprieties and his relentless pressure on Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates are already testing the boundaries of presidential power over the U.S. central bank.\nThey are also leading central bankers worldwide to worry about their independence from governments and calling into question a principle that has helped them keep inflation lower and more stable since the mid-1980s.\nThat was when Fed chair Paul Volcker established the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility and independence from the Treasury, reining in price growth with high interest rates and setting an example that would be followed by scores of central banks in subsequent decades.\n\"People don't realize how different the world has been in the past 30 years from what it was before in terms of inflation stability,\" Jordi Galí, a professor at the Barcelona School of Economics, said.\nThe world's biggest central banks such as the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan are unique institutions in that they are typically led by political appointees and yet they don't take orders from their governments.\nThis is because they have a very specific mandate, which is typically to keep inflation around 2% although some central banks like the Fed are also tasked with taking employment into account.\nThis set-up leaves them free to set interest rates at the levels they see fit to achieve that goal.\nBut independence is a relatively new concept and some central banks, like those of China, Turkey and other developing countries, are still influenced by their governments when setting policy.\nThe Fed itself has been formally independent since 1951 but it only established its reputation in the 1980s when Volcker raised interest rates to double digits to stop runaway prices, which had been the result of energy shocks and Fed mismanagement of the supply of money.\nSince then, more than a hundred central banks, including the Bank of England in 1998, have been granted increasing degrees of formal independence, such as the ability to make decisions irrespective of government wishes and a prohibition to lend to the government.\nThe results have been striking.\nCentral banks that went all the way from being part of the government to fully independent saw a long-run reduction in annual inflation of approximately 3.7 percentage points in rich countries, according to a study published earlier this year by the Centre for Economic Policy Research.\nThat reduction is even greater in poorer countries at 10.3 percentage points.\nThese results account for the fact that inflation was falling anyway as a result of structural trends such as globalisation, weaker labour power and technological advances.\nIn the latest example, most independent central banks have brought the post-pandemic surge in inflation under control in two or three years.\nBy contrast, the Great Inflation period of the 20th century lasted from 1965 to 1982, with increasingly vicious relapses.\n\"Even the recent inflationary surge was dealt with very well,\" professor Gali added. \"The proof is that inflation has come down -- not fully, in some places more than others -- but to me, it's been the clearest demonstration up to now of the success of the frameworks that central banks all over the world have been adopting.\"\nOther studies show that inflation tends to be more stable and commercial banks less risky where the central bank is independent.\nThis is because the public and investors have faith in the central bank keeping inflation in check and therefore they don't raise their demands in terms of wages, prices and returns.\nBy contrast, investors have started demanding a greater premium for owning U.S. government bonds since Trump said he planned to sack Cook, with the 10-year debt rising 2.5 basis points to 4.30% on Tuesday.\nPRINTING MONEY\nCentral banks also have the power to print money, particularly at times of financial turmoil or when prices risk falling into a downward spiral, known as deflation.\nAt such times, some degree of coordination with governments over crisis-fighting measures tends to take place, whether publicly or behind the scenes.\nThese coordinated efforts helped bring the global financial crises of the late-2000s to an end and allowed European Central Bank President Mario Draghi to quash speculation on a demise of the euro in 2012, when he pledged to do \"whatever it takes\" to preserve the euro.\n\"During crises in particular, the independence and the credibility of the central bank is the most valuable asset,\" Frederik Ducrozet, head of macroeconomic research at Pictet Wealth Management, said. \"It would be a very serious issue if the Fed, or any central bank, were to be given orders by the president.\"\nIn the last decade as the economy was recovering from the financial crisis, inflation was too low and rates were already at zero, central banks collectively bought several trillion dollars' worth of government debt and other assets.\nThis had a number of effects, from juicing up returns on stocks, bonds and real estate to breaking a taboo about central banks financing -- albeit indirectly -- their governments.\nCentral bankers were criticised for worsening economic inequality by enriching the owners of those assets, who tend to be wealthy.\nAnd that display of financial power may also have whetted politicians' appetite for more direct control.\n\"In some sense, the central banks revealed themselves as the mega powers that they really are, and that raises more questions about control, independence, the legitimacy of technocrats who operate in a sort of insulated bubble of political process,\" said Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute.\n(Additional reporting by Yoruk Bahceli and Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Hugh

The 450-mile Eiger Express Pipeline will transport up to 2.5 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Katy area near Houston. The partners anticipate completing this large-scale gas pipeline by mid-2028.\nThe project adds another visible growth driver for these high-yielding pipeline stocks. Here's a quick look at this new natural gas pipeline project and how it will benefit these energy stocks.\nIntroducing the Eiger Express Pipeline\nThe Eiger Express Pipeline will enable producers in the Permian Basin to ship more gas out of the region to higher-value markets along the Gulf Coast. The pipeline will receive gas sourced from processing facilities throughout the Permian Basin, including those owned by ONEOK and MPLX. It will ship the gas toward the coast to support growing demand from gas-fired power plants and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals.\nFirm transportation contracts with terms of 10 years or more will support the pipeline. As a result, Eiger will provide stable income to its owners when it enters commercial service in the middle of 2028. WhiteWater will construct and operate the pipeline, which will be 70% owned by the Matterhorn JV, a partnership that owns other long-haul pipelines transporting gas from the Permian to the Gulf Coast. WhiteWater (65%), ONEOK (15%), MPLX (10%), and Enbridge (10%) co-own Matterhorn. ONEOK and MPLX will each own separate 15% interests in the Eiger Express Pipeline JV.\nEnhancing its 2028 growth wave\nONEOK will be the biggest beneficiary among the publicly traded pipeline companies with a 25.5% interest in Eiger. It adds to what's becoming a major growth wave for ONOEK in 2028. The pipeline company formed a JV with MPLX earlier this year to build the Texas City Logistics LPG export terminal (50-50 ownership) and associated MBTC pipeline (80% owned by ONEOK and 20% by MPLX). ONEOK will invest about $1 billion into that JV, with both projects expected to be online in early 2028.\nThe pipeline company has a few other growth projects on track for completion in the interim. It expects to complete the expansion of its refined projects system in Denver by the middle of next year, rebuild its Medford Fractionator (fourth quarter of 2026 and first quarter of 2027), and construct the Bighorn processing plant (middle of 2027). Additionally, ONEOK expects to continue benefiting from merger synergies after closing several acquisitions in recent years. These growth catalysts should provide ONEOK with the fuel to increase its 5.5%-yielding dividend by 3% to 4% per year over the next several years.\nAdding more fuel to its high-octane income stream\nMPLX will hold a 15% direct interest in Eiger, in addition to its stake in Matterhorn. The investment further enhances its long-term growth outlook. The master limited partnership (MLP) has several expansion projects in its backlog, including its JVs with ONEOK, its interests in the Blackcomb (target in-service date: second half of 2026), Rio Bravo (second half of 2026), and Traverse (2027) pipelines, and two new Gulf Coast NGL Fractionators (2028 and 2029). This pipeline of projects gives MLPX clear growth visibility through the end of the decade. The MLP also recently enhanced its near-term growth profile by agreeing to acquire Northwind Midstream in a $2.4 billion deal.\nThose investments support MPLX's strategy of growing its earnings at a mid-single-digit annual rate. That should support distribution growth at or above this level (MPLX has increased its payout at a more than 10% compound annual rate since 2021). With its distribution already yielding more than 7.5%, MPLX is a very attractive income stock (as long as investors are comfortable receiving the Schedule K-1 federal tax form the MLP sends them each year).\nLots of fuel to continue growing its high-yielding payout\nEnbridge will get the smallest bump from Eiger, given that it only holds a 10% interest in the Matterhorn JV. However, the Canadian pipeline and utility company has a massive expansion project backlog at over 32 billion Canadian dollars ($23 billion). Its growth projects run the gamut, from oil pipeline expansions and new gas pipelines to natural gas utility growth projects and solar power plants. Enbridge expects its current slate of capital projects to enter commercial service through 2029.\nThe company expects these projects to fuel 3% compound annual cash flow per-share growth through 2026, accelerating to around 5% annually thereafter. That should support dividend growth of up to 5% per year. Enbridge has increased its dividend, which currently yields 5.7%, for 30 straight years.\nExcellent income growth stocks\nONOEK, MPLX, and Enbridge already had lots of visible growth coming down the pipeline. They're now adding another growth driver in Eiger. This project will further enhance their ability to grow their high-yielding dividends in the coming years, making them excellent stocks to buy and hold for a steadily rising stream of passive income.\nShould you invest $1,000 in MPLX right now?\nBefore you buy stock in MPLX, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MPLX wasn’t one of them.

While attending college in Indiana, he worked a few jobs, including delivering pizza for restaurant chain Papa John's, where he made $4.25 an hour.\nToday, the 58-year-old has a fast food empire. Bajwa is now a major franchisee of Papa Johns in North America, with more than 270 locations across the country.\nHe is also the CEO of Bajco Group, which he co-founded with his two brothers, and holds a diverse portfolio of companies spanning construction, technology, accounting, his Papa Johns portfolio and more.\nImmigrant success\nBajwa's path to success wasn't an easy one. In his early twenties, he was the first in his family to move to the United States, where he encountered many challenges upon arrival.\n\"Coming to the U.S., actually, that was my first flight [ever.] I'd never flown before,\" Bajwa said. \"Just getting into the plane, it was a full flight coming here by myself, [there was] a lot of anxiety ... but I was determined to make it.\"\nHe said he experienced some culture shock and struggled with communication because he wasn't fluent in English at the time. \"Sometimes, when you are away from family, and you're alone ... it was very, very difficult,\" Bajwa said.\nTo help fund his university expenses, Bajwa picked up some side gigs.\n\"My first summer, I did three jobs ... washing dishes [during] breakfast time, and then delivering pizzas in the afternoon, and late night, working at Taco Bell,\" Bajwa told CNBC Make It.\n\"I was living in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and ... I just started delivering for Papa John's when they came in town and from there, just started loving it, and tips were good, so that helped,\" he said.\nBajwa quickly moved up the ranks at Papa John's. By the time he graduated from university in 1996, he had already transitioned from being a delivery driver to area manager. After graduating, Bajwa applied to a few corporate roles because that's what he always expected to do after his studies.\n\"I applied for some jobs, and on back of my mind, I was sort of hoping that I don't get a corporate job, but I wanted to try it because that was one of the ... check marks I had to check,\" he said. \"I just did not want to have that regret that I never applied, because all of life, I thought I would go corporate sector.\"\n\"But when I went to find a [corporate] job, I couldn't get [a] job that would pay me ... more than what I was already making [at Papa John's],\" Bajwa said. For that reason, he decided to stay in the pizza business, and ended up running multiple pizza stores before becoming a franchisee himself.\nIn July 2002, with the help of family support and bank loans, Bajwa opened his first Papa John's store in East Liverpool, Ohio.\n\"I bought used equipment for very low price, and at that time, I built the store for half [of] what I would have [paid], because I did a lot of [the labor] myself,\" he added. \"My whole thought was to open with as little money as possible, and spend the money towards marketing.\"\nThe cost for the buildout of his first store was about $150,000, he said.\nHard-won lessons\nBajwa learned a few lessons early on, thanks to some key mistakes.\nBefore opening his first restaurant location, Bajwa focused heavily on getting the word out about the store's grand opening.\n\"I did too much marketing, and the first day [that the store opened], half of the crew walked out because it was chaos,\" said Bajwa. \"Too many people showed up because I advertised too much, and I focused more on advertising than training people to make pizzas ... Then I learned how important it is to be ready before [opening].\"\nThen, within six months of this first location opening, Bajwa saw that the store's revenue was ahead of forecasts, so he quickly went on to open a few more locations.\n\"After two stores, I thought, no problem. We opened three more immediately after that, and guess what, I did not have [the best people] around me, and [then we] started struggling,\" he said. So, he and his team had to take a step back and give it some time before trying to expand again.\n\"There was a time that we grew too fast and hit the pump.

Since then, six people have died and over 100 residents have been diagnosed with the disease in more than one zip code in the area.\nOn Tuesday, health officials announced an investigation on an apartment complex in the Bronx following two positive cases of Legionnaires' disease.\nA deadly outbreak of the disease was also detected in London, Ontario, resulting in four deaths and almost 90 hospitalizations this July. Health experts worry that as the planet gets warmer, cases of the infection will multiply.\n\"Legionnaires' disease is a pneumonia that is caused by a bacteria called Legionella,\" says Dr. Roy Gulick, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Weill Cornell Medicine and attending physician at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.\nLegionella lives in dirt and water, and typically likes still, warm water like the water in cooling towers for air conditioning systems, Gulick explains.\n\"If there's water that's been sitting there for a while, it's a prime place for this bacteria to be,\" he says.\n\"Then, when you turn on your air conditioner and the fan, it can aerosolize the water, meaning it can throw particles of water into the air. So a person who's walking by the air conditioner, and breathes in those particles, will be exposed to Legionella.\"\nIf you're wondering how concerned you should be about the spread of Legionnaires' disease, we asked Gulick and Dr. Michael Phillips, chief hospital epidemiologist for NYU Langone Health, about symptoms to look out for and how to stay protected.\nHere's what you need to know about Legionnaires' disease\nThankfully, Legionnaires' disease can not be spread from person to person, according to both experts. In addition to air conditioning systems, Legionella can live in hot tubs and even fountains that people have outside of their homes, Gulick says.\nNot everyone who is exposed to Legionella develops symptoms. Reactions to exposure can range from no symptoms at all to needing to receive intensive care in the hospital, depending on the person, Gulick says.\n\"People walking around their neighborhoods could be exposed just from breathing in the air and not know that they've been exposed to Legionella,\" he adds.\n\"Most people who are exposed don't actually develop disease. There are certain groups that are at greater risk.\"\nPeople who have a higher chance of developing Legionnaires' disease from exposure to Legionella are:\n- Those with compromised immune systems, or who take medicines that can suppress their immune system\n- People over the age of 65\n- Smokers\n- People with lung disease\nLegionella causes between 1% to 10% of all pneumonias, Gulick says. Typically, health professionals see an increase in cases between mid-summer and early fall, he notes, when people are using air conditioners more.\nSymptoms and treatments of Legionnaires' disease\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms of Legionnaires' disease can include:\n- Fever\n- Cough\n- Muscle aches\n- Headaches\n- Shortness of breath\n\"There are no vaccines for Legionella. There are no medications that would be prescribed to prevent Legionella [exposure],\" Gulick says.\nBut once contracted, Legionnaires' disease can be detected through multiple tests like laboratory swab tests or urine tests, the CDC states.\nThere are also very effective antibiotics that can cure the disease. The challenge is that \"the most common antibiotics we often use for pneumonia are not effective against Legionella,\" Gulick says. Specific antibiotics are needed to treat Legionnaires' disease which is why community awareness is important to detect outbreaks.\n\"In the summer, there's a greater risk of this infection, and there are specific antibiotics and ways of detecting it,\" Phillips says. \"It's well known in the medical community what to do, but I also feel that patients need to understand that.\"\nHow to be proactive during a Legionnaires' disease outbreak\nAs a first step, detecting where Legionella exists is important to decrease the chances of it spreading.\n\"Building owners and managers can use a water management program to help control Legionella,\" according to the CDC.\nFor at-risk individuals, Phillips suggests being aware of any symptoms like shortness of breath or fever and seeking medical attention as soon as possible. Be sure to ask for appropriate testing for Legionella detection.\n\"There's no formal recommendation to mask, but people who are at higher risk, so older people or those with underlying conditions, may want to consider it. Particularly if you live in Central Harlem right now and you're going out just walking on the street,\" Gulick says.\n\"There's no downside to it, and potentially there's an upside to avoid this.\"\nPhillips says that only a respirator like a KN95 or N95 mask would be able to prevent infection, but says it may not be necessary to wear one because the average risk of developing Legionnaires' disease is pretty low.\nRegardless of medical history, \"if people develop a fever or a cough and things are persistent for more than a day or two, they should seek medical attention,\" Gulick says.\n\"And if someone develops shortness of breath, that is a warning sign that they need medical attention.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The stock gained 8% on Wednesday.\nThe Cracker Barrel saga is just the latest example of a consumer-facing company making big branding decisions, then pulling back after alienating its customer base.\n\"It's very tricky to be a brand for everyone today,\" Carreen Winters, president of reputation at the global public relations firm MikeWorldWide, said in an interview. \"Legacy brands are particularly tricky, because you have to figure out what is cherished and authentic from the old and marry it with the new.\n\"In Cracker Barrel's case, they're trying to attract a new, younger customer [which] is no longer sufficient,\" she continued. \"You need to actually think about all of your stakeholders and how they will react, respond, feel about what you're doing or the direction you're taking. And you need to be sure that what you're doing is consistent with shared values.\"\nSocial media lighting the fire\nRebranding failures are not a new phenomenon. One of the most famous marketing blunders of all time happened in 1985 when the Coca-Cola company introduced \"New Coke\" with a new formula. After a firestorm of outrage from its customers, the company returned to its classic formula a few months later.\nBut social media has made backlash from consumers faster and more widespread, meaning businesses are usually quicker to walk back on their branding failures.\nIn 2010, retailer Gap ditched its decades-old blue box logo for a more minimalist design. It faced intense backlash on social media through thousands of engagements and, within less than a week, the company said it was reverting to its original logo.\nMore recently in May, Warner Bros. Discovery announced its streaming platform would undergo another name change, after switching from HBO to HBO Max to Max and then back again to HBO Max.\nMajor rebrands don't always go awry. For example, Kentucky Fried Chicken successfully rebranded to KFC in 1991. Its customers already used the acronym and the rebrand signified that the restaurant chain offers more than just fried chicken.\nDunkin' Donuts also successfully underwent its name change to Dunkin' in 2019. It did face some criticism from its loyal customers at the time, but Winters said today the \"Dunkin'\" name and branding are widely accepted over its original name.\n\"Dunkin' rebranded in accordance with the behavior that the customer created,\" she said. \"It aligned with their strategy of being more than Donuts and really building their coffee business.\"\nShe also mentioned IHOP as an example of a brand that has been able to freshen up its look and stay relevant in culture. She said IHOP's change has been an \"evolution, not a revolution.\"\nBeth LaGuardia Cooper, chief marketing officer at Advantage, The Authority Company, added during an interview that Starbucks had subtle changes to its logo over time, which allowed it to hold the base of its identity close.\n'Woke' rebrands?\nWhile some social media users disliked Cracker Barrel's new branding simply because they said it lacked substance and was too \"sterile\" or \"soulless,\" others, especially conservatives, claimed the new logo leaned into \"wokeness\" and diversity efforts.\nCracker Barrel is widely considered a classic American restaurant chain. It began in Tennessee in 1969 and its branding evokes Southern charm and nostalgia for its consumer base.\nEric Schiffer, chairman of the firm Reputation Management Consultants, said the new branding, without the iconic \"Uncle Herschel\" figure, suggested to conservatives that having a white man featured on the logo was wrong or politically incorrect.\nHe said that pushback represents a larger trend where conservatives are feeling under attack by diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\"I think the perspective of conservatives is, don't ruin Cracker Barrel with the Bud Light meets Jaguar marketing playbook,\" said Schiffer, adding that those brands \"attempted to disrupt positively and what they did was they nuked brand sentiment and shareholder confidence.\"\nIn November, Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover announced a rebrand that removed its \"leaper\" big cat imagery from its logo and changed the brand's font. Its new promotional materials included brightly dressed models, but no cars. The brand faced significant pushback, including tens of thousands of responses on social media.\nElon Musk criticized the company on X at the time, asking Jaguar's official account: \"Do you sell cars?\"\nEarlier this month, Trump piped in with his insults, calling Jaguar's ad campaign \"stupid\" and \"seriously WOKE.\"\nThe Telegraph reported in May that Jaguar was searching for a new advertising agency after the public backlash.\nSimilarly, Anheuser-Busch InBev's Bud Light faced heavy criticism from conservatives in 2023 after a collaboration between the beer brand and social influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who is transgender.\n\"If you're trying to be a tough, male-focused, football fan-oriented beer, the last thing you want to do is put the wrong spokesperson in front of the brand,\" Schiffer said. \"It will turn off that audience and it allows competitors to capture that market share.\"\n\"The throughline in all of this is, don't rip apart and disrespect audiences that brought you to the dance,\" Schiffer said. \"Find a way, if you're going to want to expand, do it in a way that doesn't cut at the core of what the brand stands for — and in the process, create cognitive dissonance and blow up market cap.\"\nBranding experts told CNBC that at the end of the day, people are talking about Cracker Barrel, which is a win for the company by itself.\n\"Everybody loves a comeback in America,\" LaGuardia Cooper said. \"So I would root for them to make this happen, make something good out of it.\"","content_hash":"fd1e3de3120da5128660d6ed2159f3c9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6124,"method_rank":0}

","published_at":"2025-08-27T11:15:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"BYD Company ADR(OTC: BYDDY) is suddenly everywhere in investor conversations -- and for good reason.\nThe Chinese automaker just crossed the $100 billion revenue mark, kept profits growing through a bruising price war, and is pushing hard into overseas markets. That combination -- scale, vertical integration, and global ambition -- has BYD squarely on the radar for growth-minded investors.\nLet's explore some important things investors should know about the company.\nBYD's economic machine\nBYD might not be a household name like Tesla, but the auto conglomerate is quietly becoming a major force in the industrial sector. Think of BYD as an energy-to-wheels platform company. It builds passenger cars (battery-electric and plug-in hybrid), commercial vehicles, batteries (including the LFP \"Blade\" battery), power, electronics\/semiconductors, and energy‑storage systems.\nUnlike most automakers who prefer to outsource most of their parts manufacturing, the Chinese company maintains an unusually deep vertical integration. It designs and manufactures critical components -- such as batteries, electronics, and more -- in-house to keep costs low and supply secure. While heavy, this integrated strategy provides more control to the company, making sure that its fate remains in its hands rather than external suppliers.\nFinancially, the engine is automobiles. In 2024, BYD reported roughly RMB 777 billion ($106 billion)in revenue and RMB 40 billion ($5.5 billion) in net profit. About 80% came from \"automobiles and related products,\" with the balance from other products such as mobile handset components and other services.\nWhy are investors excited about the company?\nLike Tesla, BYD has a deep interest in many future-proof verticals. The most obvious is its leadership in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, thanks to its close to two decades of investment in this area. It is the clear leader in China in terms of EV sales volume, and is increasingly expanding into overseas markets.\nFor instance, BYD opened its first Southeast Asia factory in Thailand (planned 150,000‑unit annual capacity) in 2024, which will be the export hub into the 10 Southeast Asian countries. It is also ramping up its production in Brazil, with an initial 150,000 annual production, with plans to scale up to 300,000 in the second phase. In Europe, the automaker already has a factory in Hungary, and it is expecting its second site in Turkey to come online in 2026. Combined, the two factories have a total production capacity of half a million cars a year .\nHaving local production plants in different regions offers plenty of benefits, which include improving logistics and bottlenecks, lower tariffs and currency risks, and, more importantly, bringing the BYD brand closer to consumers. It also demonstrates the company's long-term vision for becoming a global automaker, just like the Japanese did earlier.\nBut car manufacturing is just one part of the story. BYD is also a major player in battery technology, known for its Blade battery. As a supplier of batteries to the EV industry, BYD will benefit from EV sales of other manufacturers beyond its sales. Its expertise in making car batteries also extends to energy storage, as the giant provides a complete set of new energy solutions for the generation, storage, and utilization of electricity . And let's not forget that the car maker is also actively investing in autonomous driving technology , offering its advanced driver assistance system for free in a wide range of EV models in China.\nIn short, BYD has multiple levers to grow in the coming years.\nBut there are risks to note, though\nWhile BYD's prospects look bright, investors should not overlook the risks involved. One thing is that the EV competition is intense, especially in the Chinese markets. Aggressive price discounts and the ongoing introduction of new models from new-age car makers like Xiaomi will challenge BYD's market leadership.\nMoreover, the ongoing geopolitical tension between China and the U.S. will likely make BYD's overseas expansion trickier, let alone the issue of accessing the latest technology in areas like semiconductors, software, etc., which could slow down BYD's movement toward intelligent driving.\nBesides, BYD is still building its brand image among consumers to close the gap with high-end brands like Tesla. It is still too early to know whether this effort will be successful over time.\nAbove all, BYD is a Chinese company, so investing in the stock will require investors to accept risks related to international stocks, something that not all investors can stomach.\nWhat does it mean for investors?\nBYD has proven it can thrive in China's cutthroat EV market while quietly expanding its global footprint. Its vertical integration and scale give it real staying power, but competition and geopolitics remain serious hurdles.\nFor long-term investors, the key question is whether BYD can establish itself as a global brand rather than just a Chinese powerhouse. If it can, it will be a solid growth stock for many years to come.\nShould you invest $1,000 in BYD Company right now?\nBefore you buy stock in BYD Company, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and BYD Company wasn’t one of them.

One name that has been quietly climbing the ranks is BigBear.ai (BBAI), a data analytics and defense-focused AI player whose stock has surged triple digits over the past year. Known for helping government and defense agencies make sense of complex data, the company is now stepping into a much bigger spotlight.\nOn Aug. 20, BigBear.ai announced a multi-year partnership with the Washington Commanders team, instantly grabbing the market’s attention. As part of the deal, the team’s training facility has been rebranded the BigBear.ai Performance Center, and the company’s logo will now be splashed across stadium suites, practice jerseys, and other high-visibility assets. For an AI company that has been operating largely behind the scenes, this NFL tie-up marks a bold play to boost its national profile.\nCEO Kevin McAleenan called the deal a sign that BigBear.ai is “going on offense,” using the NFL stage to chase broader growth opportunities and even leverage its AI expertise to enhance the fan experience. So, with this new development in play, should investors buy BBAI stock now?\nAbout BigBear.ai Stock\nVirginia-based BigBear.ai focuses on AI solutions that serve the defense, national security, and critical infrastructure sectors. Its technology applies predictive analytics and data-driven insights to help organizations manage the demands of complex, distributed, and mission-critical environments. The company’s market capitalization currently stands at approximately $2 billion.\nThis AI stock has been on a tear, grabbing Wall Street’s attention with a jaw-dropping 240% surge over the past year, far outpacing the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) modest 16% gain. Even in 2025, despite cooling momentum, BBAI stock has climbed 24%, still well ahead of the broader index’s 10% rise.\nRecently, though, sentiment has wavered as investors soured over its less-than-stellar latest earnings report earlier this month. Yet, on Aug. 20, the stock managed to score a 2% bump after announcing the high-profile NFL partnership, putting the spotlight back on its growth story.\nA Look Inside BigBear.ai’s Q2 Performance\nOn Aug. 11, BigBear.ai dropped its fiscal 2025 second-quarter results, and investors clearly didn’t like what they saw. Shares tumbled more than 15% the next trading session as headline numbers missed expectations and revealed deeper challenges in the business. Revenue came in at $32.5 million, marking an 18% year-over-year (YOY) decline, largely due to disruptions in U.S. Army programs that weighed heavily on the top line. That figure also fell well short of Wall Street’s $40.9 million forecast, adding to investor disappointment.\nProfitability also came under pressure. Gross margin narrowed to 25% compared with 27.8% a year ago, reflecting challenges in operating efficiency. At the same time, the company ramped up research and development spending to advance its core AI products, which pushed adjusted EBITDA losses deeper into the red. The company reported a loss of $8.5 million on this metric, more than double the $3.7 million loss posted in the same quarter last year.\nOn the bottom line, BigBear.ai’s losses widened significantly. Net loss ballooned to $228.6 million, dramatically higher from $14.4 million a year earlier. The steep decline was due in part to non-cash derivative remeasurement charges and a hefty $71 million goodwill impairment. Meanwhile, EPS came in at a loss of $0.71, far worse than both the prior-year loss of $0.06 and the $0.06 per-share loss anticipated by analysts.\nIt wasn’t all bad news, though. The company highlighted sequential improvements to its balance sheet, ending the quarter with a record $390.8 million in cash balance as of June 30, 2025, compared with just $50.1 million at the end of 2024. BigBear.ai also reported a healthy backlog of $380 million, offering some visibility into future demand.\nStill, guidance cast a shadow over the outlook. Management slashed its full-year 2025 revenue forecast to between $125 million and $140 million, down sharply from the prior range of $160 million to $180 million. Additionally, due to uncertainty surrounding key Army programs and anticipated new growth investments in the second half, the company entirely withdrew its previously issued adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About BigBear.ai Stock?\nDespite a lackluster Q2 showing, analysts aren't writing off BBAI stock just yet. On Aug. 12, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Jonathan Ruykhaver bumped up his price target to $6 from $5 while reiterating an “Overweight” rating. While BigBear.ai continues to grapple with “near-term execution issues,” the maintained bullish stance highlights expectations around “secular tailwinds and improved financial flexibility.”\nWhile the coverage is limited, Wall Street remains optimistic, with a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the five analysts offering recommendations, two advocate a “Strong Buy,” and the remaining three urge investors to “Hold.” The average analyst price target of $5.83 represents potential upside of 6% from current market prices. However, the Street-high target of $8 suggests an impressive 45% rally from current levels.\nBigBear.ai’s latest quarter highlighted ongoing financial headwinds, sparking a sharp pullback in BBAI stock. Still, the company’s substantial cash reserves, sizable backlog, and recent NFL partnership offer potential catalysts ahead. That said, execution risks remain a sticking point, and the company must show it can turn these opportunities into sustainable growth before investor sentiment shifts back in its favor.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

And BYD as a company has pretty severe problems in their home turf in China. I think their focus is, and rightly should be, on making sure they don't die in China.\"\nBYD seems to have had the last word. The company has been at the forefront of China's aggressive EV push, rapidly expanding its domestic market and overtaking Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer by revenue in 2024.\nChinese start-ups such as Nio and Li Auto, alongside more established automakers including Geely and SAIC Motor, are also leading manufacturers in this space. Battery giant CATL has meanwhile been a key player in powering these vehicles.\nIt's so saturated in China that they have to look elsewhere. And we're at the point now where exports to the rest of the world is only really just starting.Rella SuskinEquity analyst at Morningstar\nHenner Lehne, vice president of competitive intelligence, market analysis, forecasting at S&P Global Mobility, said China's EV industry has become a \"significant force\" in reshaping the global car market.\n\"Just a couple years ago the domestic car makers in China were not seen as true competitors to the established global car industry. But that changed quickly within just a couple of years,\" Lehne told CNBC by email.\n\"BYD alone was growing about 1 [million] units per year for the last three years straight, wiping out the smile in the faces of many product managers from the legacy car makers. And the competition is not only staying in China,\" he added.\nFeeling the pressure\nNotably, in 2023, China surpassed Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter. It's domestic car sales then ballooned to a record 31.4 million units last year, with brand-new EVs accounting for roughly 41% of the total vehicles produced.\nThe Asian giant's auto sector growth has been attributed to subsidies, tax incentives and, between 2009 and 2023, an estimated $230 billion in EV development costs. Analysts also cited lower labor costs, the weaker yuan, innovative technological developments and a robust battery supply chain among Beijing's key advantages.\nChina's ascent has since led to regulatory scrutiny in Western markets, amid allegations of anti-competitive practices. Both the U.S. and European Union have slapped duties on Chinese-made EVs to protect traditionally dominant American and European brands.\nMichael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights and a China auto market researcher, said he expects China to cement its dominance in auto manufacturing, \"just as it has done for solar panels. ship-building, drones and steel in recent years.\"\nBy 2030, Dunne told CNBC that he expects China will manufacture 36 million vehicles per year, or four out of every 10 cars built globally at the time. He also anticipates that Beijing will export an estimated 9 million vehicles a year, from just 1 million in 2020.\n\"Countries with smaller manufacturing industries like Thailand, [South] Africa and Spain are already feeling the pressure from Chinese imports,\" Dunne told CNBC by email.\nAn industry shake-out?\nIn the U.K., for one, Chinese EV sales have soared. Chinese-owned car brands accounted for roughly 10% of all new car sales in June, up significantly from previous years.\nChinese EV brands have also rapidly made inroads in EV-friendly Norway. From the first delivery of an MG car to the Nordic country in January 2020, Chinese EV brands have gone on to capture a combined market share of roughly 10%.\nRella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar, said the growing competitiveness of Chinese vehicles in many parts of the world is only just beginning.\n\"It's so saturated in China that they have to look elsewhere. And we're at the point now where exports to the rest of the world is only really just starting. We haven't even begun to see the start of it,\" Suskin told CNBC by video call.\nIn that vein, China's EV industry was recently found to have spent more on factories abroad than at home for the first time on record, during 2024.\nThe story for Chinese EV players is perhaps not so rosy in their domestic market, however. Analysts told CNBC they expect an industry shake-out before too long, with many startups struggling to turn a profit in an increasingly crowded field.\nHow can Europe respond?\nSigrid de Vries, director general of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), a car lobby group, described China as a \"fierce competitor\" in the global market.\n\"I think we as the European auto industry have a legacy of being great competitors as well. So, I certainly wouldn't want to give up on European players, or Japanese, Korean or American for that matter.\"\nACEA represents 16 major Europe-based automobile manufacturers, including the likes of Volkswagen, BMW, Stellantis, Renault and Volvo. It has frequently called on the EU to take action to ensure the bloc's competitiveness on the road to full electrification.\nTo help European carmakers compete with China's EV behemoth, ACEA's de Vries said a leveling of the policy playing field would make a meaningful difference.\n\"We have to realize that some of that leveling of the ground, speaking for the EU, could be realized on their own terms. It's the regulatory framework, driving cost, stifling innovation rather than unleashing entrepreneurial spirit,\" de Vries said.\nACEA's de Vries added that while Europe won't be able to substantially influence China or the U.S., the bloc's regulatory framework could be adjusted to \"try and create the best possible environment for doing business in Europe.\"\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive arm, did not respond to a CNBC request for comment.\n— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.","content_hash":"5371b9a906ffb8385fbdf8676898f118","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6096,"method_rank":0}

The \"Magnificent Seven\" accounted for more than half of the total increase in the S&P 500 in 2024, increasing the concentration of the mega-cap stocks in the index.\nThis year has seen a divergence in some of the \"Magnificent Seven\" names. Just three -- Nvidia, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Meta Platforms -- continued to outperform the index. While investors may see opportunities in the names that have declined in value so far this year (Apple and Tesla), Wall Street thinks that one of the biggest winners will continue to climb higher.\nIn fact, Wall Street's median price target on one \"Magnificent Seven\" stock is 25% higher than its stock price as of this writing. That's far higher than any other member of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nThe best \"Magnificent Seven\" stock to buy now\nWall Street analysts love Microsoft right now. They grew even more bullish on the stock after the company's most recent earnings report revealed stellar results for both its cloud computing business, Azure, and its cash cow enterprise software business. The median price target for the mega-cap stock is now $630 per share, which is a 25% increase at the time of this writing.\nMicrosoft's Azure is now a $75 billion business. It grew revenue 34% last year. More impressive is the fact that its growth accelerated in the fourth quarter. Azure revenue climbed 39% last quarter, driven by Azure's biggest customers, including OpenAI.\nAnalysts at D.A. Davidson pointed out that Microsoft's investment in OpenAI gives it the right of first refusal on training and inference workloads, and it's been a notable driver of Azure's outperformance. In comparison, the revenue of Alphabet's Google Cloud climbed just 32% last quarter, despite it being significantly smaller than Azure. The much larger Amazon Web Services grew 17%. D.A. Davidson has a $650 price target on Microsoft.\nEven more impressive is the fact that Microsoft's management noted that the cloud computing service remains capacity constrained. To that end, it's stepping up its capital expenditure plans with a $30 billion budget for the first quarter. That's a 24% increase from the fourth quarter, and puts it well ahead of its peers in its plans to build out cloud infrastructure. That suggests that more strong growth is ahead for the business. Management forecasts 37% growth for Azure for the current quarter.\nMore than just a cloud computing business\nWhile Azure is the biggest growth driver for Microsoft, its massive enterprise software business is still extremely important, and growing well in its own right.\nAnalysts at BMO Capital point out that Microsoft stands out from other large-cap software names in the space, not because of its cloud computing segment, but because of the \"breadth of portfolio including AI offerings and solid margin performance.\" The analysts raised their price target from $550 to $650 after the company's most recent earnings report.\nMicrosoft offers the Microsoft 365 productivity software suite to both businesses and individuals. Despite already having hundreds of millions of subscribers for its cloud software, fourth-quarter revenue climbed 18% for its commercial version, while consumers spent 20% more. That growth was likely driven by growing adoption of Microsoft's Copilot, which brings generative AI capabilities to the software suite. Microsoft charges extra for enterprises that want to add Copilot, while only higher-tier subscribers receive access to Copilot features. Management said it achieved the largest quarter of seat adds ever for Microsoft 365 Copilot last quarter.\nMicrosoft has also included versions of Copilot across its other enterprise software, including Github and Dynamics 365. Its Copilot Studio enables businesses to use their own data and resources to develop their own AI agents, helping improve worker productivity and reduce time searching for company-specific information.\nThe software business is a major cash cow that's helping fuel the massive spending necessary for Azure. The two sides of the business have worked well together, enabling Microsoft to maintain strong operating margins while growing quickly. Operating income climbed 17% last year, with an overall operating margin of 46% (a slight improvement from the prior year's 45% margin).\nWith strong growth for both the enterprise software and cloud computing business, Microsoft is poised to produce another strong year of financial results. Its forward price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 33 is certainly a big premium over the rest of the S&P 500, but it's emerged as a leader in artificial intelligence for both cloud computing and software. Its growth justifies that premium price, and Wall Street thinks there's a lot more room to grow from here. I don't see any reason to disagree.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Furthermore, Wall Street has rated both of these chip stocks as “Strong Buy.” For investors looking beyond the usual suspects, Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Broadcom (AVGO) could be names worth watching closely.\nValued at $1.4 billion, Broadcom is a global technology company that designs and develops semiconductors and infrastructure software. AVGO stock is up 28% year-to-date, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index ($NASX) is up 11.6%.\nBroadcom operates in two segments. On the semiconductor side, it manufactures products for data centers, AI, networking (Ethernet switches\/routers), broadband, wireless, and storage. On the software front, through the VMware acquisition, it provides cloud and virtualization software that enables enterprises to build and manage private and hybrid clouds.\nIn the second quarter, Broadcom generated total revenue of $15 billion, representing a 20% year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA surged to $10 billion, up 35% from a year ago, reflecting exceptional operating discipline. Adjusted earnings increased by an impressive 43.6% to $1.58 per share, with a gross margin of 79.4% thanks to a favorable product mix. Broadcom’s rapidly expanding AI business generated $8.4 billion in semiconductor revenue, a 17% increase year over year. AI semiconductor revenue alone reached $4.4 billion, a 46% increase, marking the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Broadcom’s Ethernet-based networking solutions, such as Tomahawk switches, Jericho routers, and network interface cards, have become essential for hyperscale AI clusters.\nBroadcom’s infrastructure software division is powered by VMware and generated $6.6 billion in revenue, a 25% increase. Management announced that 87% of its 10,000 largest customers have now adopted VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), resulting in a stable and growing base of annual recurring revenue. In the quarter, free cash flow amounted to $6.4 billion, or 43% of revenue. The company ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in cash and $69.4 billion in gross principal debt. Broadcom paid $2.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $4.2 billion in shares in the second quarter.\nThe company will report its third-quarter earnings on Sept. 4. Broadcom expects Q3 AI semiconductor revenue of $5.1 billion, representing a 60% year-over-year increase and the tenth consecutive quarter of AI-driven expansion. Infrastructure software revenue is expected to grow by 16%, reaching $6.7 billion. Total consolidated revenue is expected to increase by 21% year on year to $15.8 billion.\nOverall, AVGO stock has garnered a “Strong Buy” rating on the Street. Out of the 37 analysts in coverage, 33 rate it a “Strong Buy,” one says it is a “Moderate Buy,” and three recommend a “Hold.”\nBased on the mean target price of $302.78, the stock has potential upside of 3% from current levels. Plus, its high price estimate of $400 indicates the stock could gain as much as 36% in the next 12 months.\nChip Stock #2: Marvell Technology\nMarvell Technology, valued at $63 billion, is a semiconductor company that does not produce CPUs or GPUs like Intel (INTC) or Nvidia. It creates integrated circuits and chips that power cloud AI computing, high-speed networking, 5G, and automotive systems. Marvell stock has dropped 33% year to date.\nThe semiconductor maker reported record first-quarter fiscal 2026 revenue of $1.89 billion, up 63% year on year. Fueled by insatiable AI demand and a sharp recovery in networking markets, Marvell not only exceeded its own revenue and earnings targets, but also the consensus estimates. Adjusted earnings per diluted share rose 158% to $0.62. Marvell’s data center segment generated a record $1.44 billion, a 76% increase year on year. This business now accounts for the vast majority of the company’s revenue. Management attributed this growth to the rapid scaling of custom AI silicon programs into high-volume production, as well as consistent shipments of electro-optics products designed for AI and cloud deployments.\nIn the quarter, Marvell announced the integration of Nvidia’s (NVDA) NVLink Fusion into its custom silicon platform, solidifying its position as a complement to Nvidia’s merchant GPUs. While AI dominates the company’s growth story, Marvell's enterprise networking ($178 million) and carrier infrastructure ($138 million) businesses are also showing signs of improvement.\nWhile focusing on AI, Marvell is also streamlining its portfolio. In the first quarter, the company announced that it had sold its Automotive Ethernet business to Infineon (IFNNY) for $2.5 billion.\nThe company ended the quarter with $886 million in cash and equivalents and $4.2 billion in total debt. Shareholder returns accelerated as the company paid out $52 million in dividends and repurchased $340 million of stock in Q1.\nMarvell will report earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 on Aug. 28. With AI-related sales already accounting for the majority of its data center revenue and expected to grow further, the company has established a strong foundation for long-term growth.\nOverall, analysts remain optimistic for Marvell’s future, rating it a “Strong Buy.” Out of the 33 analysts covering MRVL, 24 have rated it a “Strong Buy,” two have a “Moderate Buy” recommendation, and seven suggest a “Hold.” The average price target for MRVL stock is $92.86, which implies potential upside of 27.2% from current levels. Additionally, its high target price of $149 implies potential upside of 104.1% in the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Sales for the year's first half increased by 3% in value and 1% in volume compared to 1H 2024. The division's normalised pre-tax profit stood at €2.2 million, the same as for the same period in 2024. Strong sales of premium products, particularly cod and other Icelandic offerings, positively impacted sales value and volume. The production volume of Argentinean shrimp was high but had a lower yield due to the production mix. Sales of Ahumados decreased by 4% in value and volume during 1H 2025.\nThe VA N-Europe division achieved sales of €14.3 million, a 5% rise from Q2 last year. Sales for the first half totalled €28.6 million, up from €26.5 million in the same period of 2024. Lower-than-expected salmon prices at the beginning of the year and into the second quarter positively impacted the operation. In contrast, high prices and the decreased availability of white fish had an opposing impact on the division. The pre-tax profit in Q2 was €0.4 million, up from a loss of (€0.1 million) in the same quarter last year. Price of salmon is expected to remain stable for the rest of the year, with a potential increase toward the end of the year.\nThe S&D division experienced a strong start to the year, driven by robust sales from Iceland, and sustained this momentum through Q2. Strong frozen-at-sea sales, supported by high cod demand, fuelled IS Iceland’s impressive performance during the quarter.\nBased on the Q2 results and current trading, the normalised PBT outlook 2025 remains between €7.5 million and €9.5 million. We anticipate that cod prices will stay high, while salmon prices will likely remain stable throughout the year. All divisions are expected to deliver on budget, driven by robust fish demand even in the face of higher prices.\nÆgir Páll Friðbertsson, CEO\nÆgir Páll Friðbertsson, CEO: \" The first half of 2025 was marked by strong demand for cod and record-high prices. The U.S. ban on Russian fish has pushed up prices for HG cod from the Barents Sea, compounded by quota reductions in both the Barents Sea and the Atlantic. A limited supply of whitefish and elevated prices are expected to persist.\nSalmon prices were lower than forecasted in the year's first half, resulting in strong operational performance in our salmon operations—unlike the previous two years, when they showed operational loss. Performance in 1H 2025 was significantly better than in 1H 2024, and the outlook for the remainder of the year is positive. We expect salmon prices to remain stable through Q3 and into the latter part of Q4.\nOur economic outlook remains uncertain and is expected to stay that way. Interest rates have eased, and inflation has declined in our main markets. While high cod prices and rising prices for other species have increased sales values, they also create challenges as consumers face higher costs. As a result, demand may decline further, driven by reduced availability and price increases in key markets. At the same time, financing and storage costs remain significant, reinforcing the need for vigilant credit and inventory management.\nOur primary focus remains on enhancing the performance of our existing business units, continuously optimising the company’s capital structure, and reassessing our overall strategy. These priorities will guide us in the coming months. We see significant potential for growth within our strong company network, robust sales and sourcing channels, and our highly skilled team of seafood professionals. In July, we took an important step to strengthen our operations in Argentina by signing an offer letter to acquire two vessels, building on our existing knowledge, expertise, and established business in the region. The growth of Icelandic salmon farming is another encouraging development.

The approach aims to standardize how Clune engages suppliers, so project teams can rely on consistent cost certainty.\nRecent tariff hikes on aluminum, steel and copper, for example, have prompted domestic producers to raise prices. Input costs ticked up again in July, and now sit 2.6% higher for nonresidential construction compared to a year ago, according to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\nHime’s position focuses on easing that uncertainty and building long-term value for project teams. His past roles include chief procurement officer positions at Fermilab, a U.S. Department of Energy national laboratory based in Batavia, Illinois, and for Anne Arundel County in Annapolis, Maryland.\nHere, Hime talks with Construction Dive about Clune’s purchasing strategy, tariffs and why to treat procurement as a strategic advantage opportunity.\nThis interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\nCONSTRUCTION DIVE: How are you adapting procurement strategy in light of the tariff situation, especially for sensitive materials?\nANDREW HIME: We stay incredibly close to the markets and work hand in hand with our trade partners to track not just current tariffs, but what’s likely to happen next.\nOur strategy is built around flexibility and early engagement. That means partnering with our operations team, clients, manufacturers and distributors to use market intelligence and develop sourcing strategies that minimize risk, whether it’s a pricing spike or a production delay on critical materials.\nI often say, “We need to have the right tools in the toolbox.” In procurement, that means having the right contracts in place so we can meet the needs of any project, no matter what the market throws at us.\nIn data center or healthcare projects, how do you ensure materials arrive on time and prices stay under control?\nThese projects have little room for error.\nWhether it’s delivering an MRI suite or energizing a critical IT load, we start early with demand planning and forecast modeling. This is especially true for materials with long lead times or volatile pricing.\nIt’s not just about securing materials, it’s about sequencing the right ones at the right time and understanding where we can’t afford delays.\nWe also build in backup plans, alternative vendors and transparent escalation paths when issues come up. Our procurement operation is not transactional. Much like everything at Clune, our strategy hinges on both actionable data and strong and collaborative relationships.\nThat helps us stay ahead of the curve and solve problems before they hit the schedule.\nHow does the approach of relying on a small group of trusted suppliers align with Clune’s strategy?\nIt’s part of our strategy, but we don’t approach it like a closed club. We’ve built strong national and regional vendor relationships based on shared expectations, performance, communication and accountability.\nThose relationships give us leverage and reliability. The key to success in turbulent times is staying open to new and innovative solutions.\nIf a new vendor has something that brings value, we’ll vet them. We want partners who can grow with us and help us adapt, not only to meet the needs of a specific project, but to strengthen our supply chain and support the industry.\nAre you seeing any new tools or technology that actually help with buying materials or planning ahead?\nYes, but we don’t fall for shiny objects.\nThe current global supply chain disruption unfolding around tariffs has created a significant opportunity for innovation in the space of procurement technology. Clune is taking that opportunity seriously and are looking to take major leaps that provide long-term value for our operations team as well as our clients.\nOur strategy is to focus on investing in tools that improve visibility across industries and markets and bring simplicity to navigating long-lead items, material availability and cost fluctuations.\nWhat signs do you look for that tell you prices might rise, or that delays might be coming?\nThere’s no one thing. It’s more like triangulating between global markets, vendor feedback and the on-the-ground reality.\nWe pay close attention to upstream supply chain trends, labor disruptions, raw material costs and sometimes geopolitical events. We also focus on predictive modeling so that when early warning signals start flashing, we pull together a cross-functional team to analyze risk and figure out if we should buy now or hedge.\nWe’d rather have the conversation early and be transparent with the client than wait until it’s a crisis.\nAny other trends around procurement you are keeping tabs on?\nMore owners are realizing that procurement is a strategic lever and not just a cost center. We’re being brought in earlier during preconstruction and project planning phases to help mitigate risk, improve schedule certainty and advise on sourcing strategy.\nThat shift is good for everyone. It leads to better collaboration, better outcomes and fewer surprises once construction kicks off.\nAlso, sustainability is no longer a side conversation. Recent supply chain disruption combined with industry growth is sparking innovation and creativity to bring sustainability to be more central to the design and core requirements. Customers are exploring solutions that reduce energy consumption based on design and material requirements and combining projects with renewable energy sources.\nWe’re seeing more interest in how materials are sourced, transported, recycled and reused. We’re hoping that procurement has a bigger role to play in that evolution.","content_hash":"801c7a2bde75610082d20ff90a8bb69a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5861,"method_rank":0}

France now heads into an uncertain autumn marked by budget battles, street protests, and rising pressure from investors.\nBayrou, appointed by President Emmanuel Macron after Michel Barnier’s government collapsed in a confidence vote last December, announced on Monday that he will seek parliamentary backing on 8 September. The decision reflects a political deadlock over the government’s proposed 2026 budget, which has become the focal point of the crisis. Adding to the turmoil, unions and activist groups are calling for a nationwide “total blockade” beginning on 10 September, threatening to paralyze economic activity.\nAt the heart of the standoff is Bayrou’s fiscal consolidation plan, presented in July. The blueprint aims to shrink France’s deficit from a projected 5.4% of GDP in 2025 to 4.6% in 2026, and eventually to 2.8% by 2029. To meet its target, the government has outlined a plan for €43.8 billion in savings for 2026. The bulk of this (80%) will be achieved through spending reductions, such as slowing public sector hiring, freezing pension and tax adjustments, and getting rid of two public holidays. Bayrou warned that without action, France’s debt trajectory would deteriorate sharply, reaching 125% of GDP by 2029. His plan would instead cap it at around 117%.\nBut the proposals have met fierce resistance across the political spectrum. From Marine Le Pen’s National Rally on the right to the Socialists, Greens, and France Unbowed on the left, opposition parties have rejected the plan outright, arguing it places the burden on households while lacking broad consensus. With the government facing almost unanimous hostility, Bayrou’s chances of survival look slim, fueling investor anxiety about both political stability and fiscal credibility.\nThe likely fall of the government is weighing heavily on markets — and has already begun to reshape the outlook for France’s economy and debt sustainability. The uncertainty rattled investors, sending the CAC 40 (Fra40) down more than 3.3% since Monday, its sharpest decline in weeks. At the same time, bond markets flashed warning signs. France’s 10-year yield climbed above 3.50%, its highest level since March, as investors demanded greater compensation to hold French debt.\nThe spread between French and German 10-year bonds widened to 77 basis points, compared with 69 basis points earlier this week. This widening gap reflects the increasing premium investors require for holding French OATs relative to German Bunds, which are considered the eurozone’s safest benchmark. While Germany benefits from a reputation for fiscal prudence and political stability, France is now seen as riskier, given its high debt levels, widening deficit, and mounting political uncertainty.\nThe spread acts as a barometer of market confidence within the eurozone, and the recent jump highlights fears that France could face higher financing costs for longer if instability persists.\nFinancial stocks bore the brunt of the selloff, with Société Générale plunging more than 10.5% over the past five sessions, while BNP Paribas slipped over 8%, AXA lost more than 9%, and Crédit Agricole fell nearly 8%. Banks and insurers are often the first to feel the impact of political instability and rising sovereign borrowing costs, as their balance sheets are heavily exposed to government bonds.\nWhen yields on French debt rise, the market value of these bonds declines, eroding the capital positions of lenders and insurers that hold them in large quantities. In addition, political uncertainty raises doubts about the government’s ability to implement reforms or maintain fiscal discipline, which in turn undermines confidence in the broader financial system. For banks in particular, higher sovereign yields also mean higher funding costs, tightening conditions just as credit demand is already weakening in a slower economy. Together, these pressures explain why the financial sector has been at the forefront of the selloff.\nWeekly CAC 40 Index Technical Outlook\nThe CAC 40 has come under heavy pressure, with the index falling back toward 7,700. This week’s 3.4% decline not only wiped out recent gains but also reinforced the market’s difficulty in breaking above the 7,960–8,225 resistance zone, which has repeatedly capped rallies since 2024.\nPrices have remained trapped in a wide consolidation range between roughly 7,500 and 8,200 since April, with each attempt to test the upper boundary followed by sharp pullbacks. The most recent rejection underscores investor hesitation amid tightening financial conditions and rising bond yields.\nThe Ichimoku Cloud highlights this indecision: while the index is still hovering near the cloud’s upper edge, the inability to establish sustained momentum above resistance suggests that bullish conviction is fading. A decisive weekly close below 7,641, the baseline of the Ichimoku system, would increase the risk of a deeper retracement below the cloud toward the lower boundary of the range near 7,500. Beneath that level, the index could retest the previous yearly low below the 7,000 key level.\nThe RSI has slipped to around 49, firmly in neutral territory and trending lower, suggesting fading buying pressure. Unless momentum stabilizes, sellers could remain in control in the near term.\nSources: CNBC, ING, BBC, France24, The Wall Street Journal","content_hash":"f1b09b8586d423284edb57662bb737a4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5825,"method_rank":0}

With both top-line strength and operational discipline, Workday demonstrated that its customer adoption, AI-driven innovation, and platform expansion strategy are paying off.\nWorkday stock has dipped 12.9% year-to-date, compared to the broader market gain. Nonetheless, Wall Street forecasts potential upside of 53%.\nWorkday is a cloud-based software company that helps businesses manage their employees and finances. Its platform is used for payroll, hiring, and performance reviews, as well as budgeting, expense management, and accounting. Workday reduces enterprise complexity and cost of ownership by managing people and money on a single AI-native platform, while also providing speed and precision in decision-making.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2026, customer adoption increased across healthcare, government, financial services, technology, and education, demonstrating the Workday platform’s broad relevance. Subscription revenue increased 14% year over year (YoY) to $2.17 billion. Total revenue increased by 12.6% YoY to $2.4 billion. Adjusted earnings increased 26.3% to $2.21 per share.\nTotal subscription revenue backlog stood at $25.37 billion, with current RPO at $7.91 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash and marketable securities totaled $8.2 billion. The company also repurchased $299 million in stock, reflecting confidence in its long-term value creation.\nIn the quarter, Workday made it clear that India is a key component of its future strategy for long-term, sustainable growth. The company announced plans to launch services in the country through a local data center. It also began expanding its teams and partner ecosystem in the region. Workday is laying the groundwork in a market where AI, digital transformation, and workforce modernization are accelerating.\nFurthermore, Workday continues to position AI as a tool to help people achieve their full potential, rather than a replacement. With Workday Illuminate, which it claims is the largest and cleanest finance and HR dataset in the industry, the company is positioning itself to deliver highly relevant AI-driven insights and automation across enterprises. Workday has a significant moat, with over 75 million users under contract and a trillion transactions processed last year alone.\nIn the second half of the year, the company intends to prioritize scaling AI innovation, driving full-suite adoption, and expanding global reach. Following a strong first-half performance, Workday increased its full-year fiscal 2026 guidance. Subscription revenue could increase by 14%, reaching $8.8 billion. CEO Carl Eschenbach stated, “We’re building for the long term while executing in the near term — and I couldn’t be more excited about what’s ahead. When we put AI to work for people — not in place of them — we unlock potential we’ve only begun to imagine.”\nWorkday’s emphasis on India, AI-powered innovation, and unified finance and HR platform positions it well to capitalize on a growing total addressable market. Investors should watch out for Workday’s upcoming Workday Rising conference and Financial Analyst Day on Sept. 16. The company intends to disclose more information about its AI roadmap, new product innovations, and long-term growth and margin expansion strategy.\nWhat Are Analysts Saying About Workday Stock?\nFollowing the Q2 earnings, Citi analystSteven Enders held on to his “Neutral” rating and lowered WDAY’s target price to $260 from $279. Enders found the second-quarter results to be mixed, and he is cautious about the company’s upcoming analyst day and near-term outlook.\nSimilarly, Canaccord lowered its price target to $275 from $330, while maintaining a “Buy” rating on the stock. According to the firm, Workday’s second-quarter results exceeded the high end of its revenue and earnings guidance. However, management was cautious when discussing the potential impact of its recent acquisition of Paradox, a recruitment automation platform, claiming that it was too early to quantify the inorganic contribution. Furthermore, the firm noted that, while Workday’s backlog growth improved significantly in Q2, the company clarified that much of this strength was due to customer-led early renewal activity rather than new deal acceleration. These conflicting signals prompted the firm to lower the target price.\nOn the other hand, Bank of America Securities analyst Bradley Sills maintained a positive outlook, reaffirming the stock’s “Buy” rating. Sills cited a favorable risk-reward scenario, despite not expecting Q2 earnings to be a significant catalyst. Sills believes Workday is well-positioned to deliver above-market growth in the coming quarters, citing a balanced strategy, consistent pipeline builds, and ongoing subscription revenue momentum, which supports his bullish stance on the stock.\nOverall, on Wall Street, analysts rate Workday stock as a “Moderate Buy.” Of the 38 analysts covering the stock, 24 rate it a “Strong Buy,” three say it is a “Moderate Buy,” 10 rate it a “Hold,” and one says it is a “Strong Sell.” The average target price of $291.82 implies the stock can rally as much as 30% over the next 12 months. The high price target of $340 suggests upside potential of 53.6% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Yet, he had to eat humble pie on this one. After stating that “very useful quantum computers” may still be 15 to 30 years away in January, Huang held the company's first-ever quantum day just a couple of months later, sounding ever-so-bullish about it.\nAnd not just Nvidia, tech titans such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), along with pure-play quantum computing names such as D-Wave (QBTS), Rigetti Computing (RGTI) and IonQ (IONQ) are making a beeline to gain a head start in the quantum computing race, widely touted to be the next battleground for big tech after artificial intelligence (AI).\nFounded as Honeywell Heating Specialty Company in 1906, Honeywell is a diversified technology and manufacturing conglomerate with four primary business segments. These are aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, Performance Material and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions.\nValued at a market cap of $141.5 billion, HON stock is down 2.1% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, with the stock offering a dividend yield of 2.03%. This was higher than the sector average of 1.68%.\nHowever, to answer the aforementioned question, Honeywell's trump card to make space for itself in the quantum computing industry lies with its subsidiary, Quantinuum.\nQuantinuum's Valuation Grows 2X in 18 Months\nBorn in 2021 from the merger of Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing, Quantinuum designs and delivers advanced trapped-ion quantum computers and middleware, software, and applications across industries like cybersecurity, chemistry, finance, and AI. Headquartered in Cambridge, UK, with a U.S. base in Broomfield, Colorado, it now employs 450–550 staff, including over 300 scientists and engineers.\nQuantinuum’s leadership includes CEO Rajeeb Hazra, formerly at Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU), and Chief Product Officer Ilyas Khan, founder of Cambridge Quantum.\nAfter raising $300 million at a $5 billion valuation, headlined by J.P. Morgan (JPM) in February 2024, the company is now seeking to raise fresh capital at a proposed valuation of $10 billion, with Nvidia being tapped to become the marquee investor this time.\nHaving said that, what is driving such rapid valuation growth for Quantinuum?\nIn April 2024, Quantinuum’s H-Series trapped-ion platform achieved a quantum volume of 1,048,576, the highest publicly reported figure in the industry. This performance is supported by a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.9%, a specification that greatly reduces computational errors and enables the execution of more complex algorithms with accuracy. The hardware is built on a Quantum Charge-Coupled Device architecture, which ensures that all qubits are directly connected. This design eliminates the need for performance-draining qubit swaps and allows circuits to be implemented more efficiently. In addition, the adoption of a two-dimensional grid layout lowers the number of control lines needed for each qubit, a feature that improves scalability for future systems.\nThen, a joint effort with Microsoft has produced four logical qubits capable of running 14,000 operations in sequence without error. This result represents an 800-fold improvement in error suppression and is considered an important milestone toward achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing, a level of reliability that competing platforms have yet to demonstrate.\nBeyond its hardware, Quantinuum operates a fully integrated quantum technology stack. Its software portfolio includes TKET, an open-source compiler designed for compatibility across different quantum machines.\nThere is InQuanto, which focuses on quantum chemistry applications, and Quantum Origin, a system for generating cryptographic keys with quantum-level security. This combined approach to hardware and software development enables closer integration and faster innovation than models where these functions are separated.\nHealthy Financials\nHoneywell's financials have been solid, and the company has consistently outperformed Street expectations, reporting nine consecutive quarters of earnings beats.\nIn the most recent quarter, Honeywell reported revenues of $10.4 billion. This marked a yearly growth of 8% as the company's earnings rose by 10.4% from the previous year to $2.75 per share. Other than the Industrial Automation segment, all other segments reported year-over-year (YoY) growth in revenue.\nAlthough operating cash flows fell marginally from the prior year, they remained at a considerable $1.32 billion. Free cash flow generation exceeded $1 billion in the quarter, with the company closing the quarter with a cash balance of $10.35 billion. This was higher than its short-term debt levels of $6.34 billion.\nEncouragingly, Honeywell also raised its full-year 2025 guidance for both revenue and earnings. The company has now guided net sales to be in the range of $40.8 billion to $41.3 billion, up from $39.6 billion to $40.5 billion earlier, while earnings are now expected to be between $10.45 and $10.65 per share, up from $10.20 to $10.50 previously.\nAnalyst Opinion on HON Stock\nThus, analysts have attributed a rating of “Moderate Buy” for the stock, with a mean target price of $255.05. This denotes an upside potential of about 14.46% from current levels. Out of 24 analysts covering HON stock, 13 have a “Strong Buy” rating, and 11 have a “Hold” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Training a single large language model can consume as much electricity as 1,000 U.S. homes use in a year, and hyperscale data centers are driving power demand growth not seen since the 1990s. Nuclear plants, renewables, and grid-scale batteries suddenly sit at the center of the AI boom, as tech giants race to secure reliable, carbon-free power.\nFor investors, this collision of AI and energy creates a new class of winners beyond semiconductor makers. The companies best-positioned are those delivering baseload nuclear, scalable renewables, and the storage systems that balance it all. Here are four energy stocks covering the spectrum -- from established powerhouses to speculative disruptors.\n1. The nuclear incumbent\nConstellation Energy(NASDAQ: CEG) operates the largest nuclear fleet in America, generating 10% of the nation's carbon-free electricity. That scale suddenly matters enormously. Tech giants, including Microsoft and Meta, have signed long-term nuclear power purchase agreements with Constellation to secure 24\/7 clean energy for their data centers.\nThe company projects 10% annual earnings growth through 2028, fueled by AI-linked demand. With 21 reactors providing reliable baseload power -- exactly what AI workloads require -- Constellation has become the de facto AI-nuclear play. Trading at 33 times forward earnings with multidecade revenue streams locked in, Constellation Energy is expensive but irreplaceable in the AI value chain.\n2. The Altman-backed moonshot\nIf Constellation represents today's nuclear reality, Oklo(NYSE: OKLO) embodies tomorrow's disruption. Co-founded by Jacob DeWitte and Caroline Cochran, the company was heavily backed by OpenAI's Sam Altman, who stepped down as chair in April 2025 but remains a major investor.\nOklo is developing the Aurora microreactor -- a compact design capable of producing up to 75 megawatts of clean power continuously for as long as two decades without refueling. That scale makes the technology well-suited for off-grid AI data centers or defense sites that demand reliable baseload energy in tight footprints.\nThe company has three Department of Energy pilot projects underway and aims to deploy its first commercial reactor by 2027, pending Nuclear Regulatory Commission approvals. But the risks are enormous: Oklo is still pre-revenue, faces long regulatory lead times, and currently trades at a valuation above $10 billion, almost entirely on investor expectations.\nAnalysts suggest that if small modular reactors achieve scale, they could deliver earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins far higher than traditional utilities. That remains a big \"if,\" but if successful, Oklo could leapfrog incumbents to become a cornerstone supplier of power in an AI-driven world. This is venture-capital risk packaged as a public stock -- with asymmetric upside if the technology proves viable.\n3. The renewable giant's AI pivot\nNextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE) offers a more balanced approach to the AI-energy thesis. The world's largest renewable utility is committing $120 billion through 2029 to build solar, wind, and battery storage -- infrastructure that hyperscalers desperately need to meet carbon-neutral pledges while powering AI expansion.\nThe company has raised its dividend for 31 straight years and targets 10% annual growth through 2026. With regulated utility operations providing stability and renewable development driving 6% to 8% annual earnings growth, NextEra offers a balanced AI-energy play. At 20 times forward earnings with a 3% yield, it's the sleep-well-at-night option in this space.\n4. The storage enabler\nFluence Energy(NASDAQ: FLNC) solves AI's intermittency problem. A joint venture between Siemens and AES that later went public, Fluence builds grid-scale battery systems that store renewable energy for when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow -- a critical capability for data centers that require constant, reliable power.\nFluence expects revenue growth above 20% in 2026, aided by Inflation Reduction Act credits that improve project economics and support margin expansion. At just 0.6x sales, the stock trades like a distressed asset, despite being a global leader in storage. For investors, that makes Fluence the highest-risk, highest-reward pick of the four -- a pure play on the grid stability that AI workloads demand.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Constellation Energy right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Energy, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Constellation Energy wasn’t one of them.

Both rank among the top six cryptocurrencies in the world based on market cap, and both have shown their explosive upside potential over the past 24 months.\nWhich crypto is the better buy? XRP might get all the headlines right now, but Solana also has a lot to offer.\nFuture upside potential\nCryptocurrencies, like equities, should be valued based on their future upside potential. And that's where XRP appears to have the upper hand over Solana right now.\nNow that Ripple (the company behind the XRP token) has settled its long-running case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the stage is set for greater institutional adoption of XRP. This includes new Ripple partnerships with financial institutions around the world (and especially within the United States), as well as the build-out of new initiatives involving the Ripple cross-border payment network and the XRP blockchain ledger.\nI'm keeping my eye on two new initiatives: a new stablecoin initiative and a new asset tokenization initiative. Both have real potential to boost usage of the XRP blockchain and drive future growth for years to come. At the same time, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has made the point that the XRP-powered Ripple payment network could one day challenge SWIFT as a transaction network for financial institutions.\nOf course, Solana is no slouch either when it comes to future upside growth potential. Solana has long been touted as a potential \"Ethereum killer.\" Anything Ethereum can do, the thinking goes, Solana can do faster and cheaper.\nOne area where Solana has the obvious advantage is in terms of sheer processing speed. The core Ethereum blockchain can only process 20 to 30 transactions per second, compared to 100,000 for Solana.\nMoreover, Solana is the only major Layer-1 blockchain with its own mobile device. In 2023, Solana launched its blockchain mobile initiative, including a mobile phone (the Saga), a mobile development stack, and mobile apps. The goal, of course, was to optimize the new mobile device for the Solana blockchain.\nGiven that many people now carry their mobile devices with them wherever they go, the thinking is that this mobile-centric approach to crypto could help onboard more users to Solana for years to come.\nFuture price targets\nHow do these fabulous future growth prospects play out in terms of price? XRP appears to have the edge. Quite simply, the future price targets for XRP are off the charts. Some analysts predict that XRP will soar past $10, $20, $30, and even $100 within just a few years.\nFor the sake of comparing apples with apples, and oranges with oranges, it's worth comparing the price predictions from Standard Chartered for both XRP and Solana. In both cases, Standard Chartered calculated potential price targets for 2025 and 2028.\nIn April, Standard Chartered predicted that XRP would hit a price of $5.50 by the end of 2025, before eventually hitting a price of $12.50 by the end of 2028. Given XRP's current price of $3, that implies that XRP could nearly double in value by the end of this year, and then quadruple in value within the next three years.\nIn June, Standard Chartered predicted that Solana would hit a price of $275 by the end of 2025, and a price of $475 by the end of 2028. Given Solana's current price of $185, this implies a price increase of 50% by the end of this year, and a price increase of 150% by the end of 2028.\nWhy I'm buying XRP and not Solana\nAt the end of the day, both XRP and Solana could be great ways to diversify your overall crypto portfolio. They're both capable of explosive upside gains over the next few years. And both are projected to receive spot ETFs by the end of this year, so that means more institutional money flowing into them soon.\nIf forced to pick between the two, I'd pick XRP. The consensus appears to be that it has much higher upside potential than Solana. That being said, Solana's blockchain ecosystem is more diverse than XRP's, giving it more room for mainstream adoption in coming years.\nInvesting in crypto is always risky and volatile, especially when it comes to altcoins. But if you already have a position in Bitcoin or Ethereum, it could be worth diversifying a small amount of money into XRP as a way of boosting overall returns. Just make sure to keep your risk tolerance in mind.\nShould you invest $1,000 in XRP right now?\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and XRP wasn’t one of them.

Alpha argues that a true altseason remains unlikely until regulators approve exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, as current market conditions favor continued institutional accumulation in established digital assets over broader altcoin rallies.\nThe exchange’s latest analysis indicates that while Ethereum has reached new all-time highs above $4,950, significant capital rotation into higher-risk altcoins awaits the introduction of new investment vehicles and renewed Bitcoin momentum.\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\nCurrent Market Conditions Favor Institutional Concentration Over Retail Speculation\nThe Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 45 out of 100, firmly in “Bitcoin Season” territory despite recent altcoin strength.\nSource: CMC\nThe metric reached a yearly high of 87 in December 2024 during peak altcoin performance, but has remained subdued throughout 2025 as institutional flows concentrate in Bitcoin and Ethereum products.\nBitfinex Alpha’s August 25 report highlights Ethereum’s outperformance following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s dovish Jackson Hole remarks, which sparked a broad-based short squeeze across digital assets.\nEthereum surged to fresh all-time highs while Bitcoin consolidated in a range-bound pattern between $111,000 and $123,640.\nSource: CoinGecko\nCorporate treasury accumulation continues driving Ethereum strength, with companies like BitMine and SharpLink Gaming expanding holdings beyond $10 billion collectively.\nHowever, this institutional demand remains concentrated in established assets rather than spreading across the broader altcoin ecosystem that would signal a traditional altseason.\nETF Flows Create Structural Headwinds for Altcoin Rally\nBitcoin ETFs experienced $1.18 billion in net outflows over the past week, while Ethereum ETFs lost $197 million in a single day, marking the second-largest daily exit on record.\nETF flows have emerged as the marginal buyer and seller for both major cryptocurrencies, creating volatility that institutional investors seek to avoid in smaller altcoins.\nAmong the notable developments Bitfinex pointed to is the CFTC’s expansion of its “Crypto Sprint” initiative to advance U.S. digital asset regulation, accepting public comments until October 20 to shape rules on leveraged and retail crypto trading beyond spot contracts.\nThe next phase aims to focus on inter-agency coordination with the SEC on registration, custody, and trading requirements for a unified federal framework.\nWithout regulatory approval for altcoin ETFs, institutional capital remains trapped in Bitcoin and Ethereum products.\nThis structural limitation prevents the broad-based capital rotation historically associated with altseasons, when retail and institutional funds flow into smaller cryptocurrencies seeking higher returns.\nStill, the initiative focuses on established tokens rather than promoting altcoin adoption.\nConversion caps of approximately $16,950 per tourist suggest regulatory caution around broader crypto acceptance.\nThe realized cap growth for Bitcoin has slowed significantly compared to previous all-time high breakouts.\nCurrent monthly expansion peaked at 6% versus 13% during late-2024’s $100,000 breakthrough, which resulted from the softer risk appetite among institutional investors who drive altcoin cycles.\nTechnical and Fundamental Factors Support Delayed Altseason Timeline\nMarket analysts note that true altcoin seasons historically begin only after Ethereum establishes decisive breaks above all-time highs.\nThe 2021 altcoin surge occurred after Ethereum’s third attempt at breaking previous records, triggering massive capital flows into assets like Cardano, which gained 400% in one month.\nSource: X\/@Whale_AI_net\nCurrent market dynamics mirror early 2021 conditions, with the OTHERS\/ETH ratio at multi-year lows similar

vehicles remains undeveloped.\nAs a result, Tim Draper, founding partner of Draper Associates, argued that altcoins ultimately serve as beta testers for Bitcoin improvements, with successful innovations eventually ported to the dominant network.\nSource: YouTube\nHe noted that Bitcoin’s market share has increased from 40% to over 60% across multiple cycles, indicating a growing gravitational pull toward the leading cryptocurrency.\nHowever, Electric Capital data contradicts this narrative, showing only 2,583 total developers working on Bitcoin compared to 12,931 on the EVM stack and 9,094 on Ethereum.\nSource: Electric Capital\nWhile this data shows venture capital and institutional interest in DeFi protocols, Layer-1 alternatives, and specialized applications continue to grow, it lacks direct investment vehicles comparable to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.\nUntil regulators approve broader crypto ETF categories, altseason catalysts remain limited to retail speculation rather than institutional adoption.\nAs it stands now, the regulatory constraints, concentrated institutional flows, and Bitcoin’s range-bound behavior create conditions favoring continued Ethereum strength while delaying broader altcoin participation.\nSignificant capital rotation into higher-risk assets is needed to renew Bitcoin momentum and expand investment vehicle availability beyond current BTC\/ETH products.","content_hash":"99021a1ac44a034b49eee8bb15a6f636","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5512,"method_rank":0}

Cisco Systems is closely monitoring adoption of these tools, as well as the amount of code that’s accepted by developers. Around 70% of the company’s 20,000 developers log into AI coding tools at least once per month.\nThe acceptance rate for AI-generated code is around 24% and while that may not sound too impressive, Previn says it is a big leap from 4% nearly a year ago.\n“AI is getting better,” he adds. “It’s supporting more programming languages. Developers are getting more comfortable with it.” Over time, he hopes that as much as 70% of Cisco Systems’ code will be AI generated.\nThere’s also the ongoing work that Previn is doing to rethink the IT function’s work and responsibilities. He is reevaluating the primary work done for each role, as well as job titles, the ways to reevaluate work with AI tools, and what future training may be required to support such big, sweeping changes.\nCisco Systems has also made some investments in AI applications that improve productivity to support the non-technical workforce. Some examples include using AI to do more intelligent onboarding, which allows for Cisco to more accurately assess exactly what tools or software are needed to support the role a new employee is hired for.\nCisco Systems is also using AI for planning hardware updates. Most companies refresh their laptops every two-to-four years. But by using AI to detect a laptop’s memory, application performance, and network telemetry, Cisco Systems can decipher the difference between performance problems that can be fixed by the IT team versus when a device may fail and will need to be replaced.\nUpgrading laptops is a “significant amount of money at a company of our size,” says Previn. “And sometimes a lot of people are perfectly happy with the laptop they have.”\nWhile Cisco Systems generates nearly $57 billion in annual revenue, large enough to rank 83rd on the Fortune 500, the company competes aggressively for tech talent in an arms race that has accelerated this year as the generative AI boom continues to expand.\nTo lure skilled workers, Previn says he prioritizes creating a workplace that encourages “emotional safety for people to be able to innovate and experiment and fail fast.”\nAnother key pillar of Previn’s strategy involves recognizing IT’s operation to do all work by a singular platform. There are separate teams organized cross functionally—one to support Workday, another for SAP, and yet another for Oracle—that are made up of around six-to-ten employees who have all the necessary skills to advance an internal tech project into production. This allows small teams to operate independently.\n“There’s a huge productivity loss when you’re kind of dynamically forming and un-forming teams by project,” asserts Previn.\nPrevin says Cisco Systems fields a lot of pitches from the software-as-a-service providers it works with to add on more expensive AI capabilities. He progresses cautiously on that front. “You can consume all of those things, but run the risk of controlled cost,” says Previn. “It can create employee experience confusion, similar to what we had when chatbots started to become a thing.”\nHe expects that generative AI will increasingly evolve to become an agent-to-agent world, a digital workforce that can perform tasks on behalf of workers, sometimes autonomously and in coordination with each other. That involves an inverted approach to how employees engage with technology. Rather than an employee asking an AI search tool, “Where’s the link to Workday?” they could instead say, “I’m taking a vacation on Friday.” Agentic AI could then do the rest: block off calendars, cancel meetings, and put up an out-of-office message.\nCisco Systems has developed the company’s own internal digital AI teammate that helps the company’s employees find and understand general information more quickly. Rather than an employee being asked to toggle between different language models or select if the data they want to access is publicly available or is internal information, the AI assistant infers intent and determines the appropriate selections.\nPrevin says this approach is an evolution of his thinking that Cisco Systems can’t assume that workers are up to date on which AI models are most advanced and best match the tasks they are trying to complete.\n“The rate of innovation in AI is happening so quickly that if you find out your developers are using a language model that is six months old, then effectively, all the software you’re writing is already six months out of date,” says Previn.\nJohn Kell\nSend thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here.","content_hash":"b319afb66b9d570dd2d9aa32f73e7162","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5493,"method_rank":0}

This Wednesday, Aug. 27, the king of artificial intelligence, a stock comprising nearly a twelfth of the entire S&P 500 Index ($SPX) by itself, and around 10% of the Nasdaq-100 ($IUXX), is up to bat.\nAnd based on how the market appears stretched, the stock could be vulnerable. If not immediately after this week’s announcement, then into September, when the Hamptons empty out and offices across the country are filled with “How was your summer?” chatter.\nNVDA’s report this quarter comes at a time when some on Wall Street are questioning how long investors will be patient. Not with NVDA’s market-driving, life-altering chips. The company is way past the stages of viability, market leadership, and the challenge of competition. Most of that is in the rear-view mirror. But with the intermittent concerns about Chinese competition. And more recently, potential constraints that could arise from an NVDA relationship with the U.S. government, which seems intent on creating its own index fund, one stock at a time.\nBut the biggest hurdle for NVDA this time around is an old issue that tends to creep up when a stock gets so big, so powerful, and so closely watched that it becomes a proxy for the market’s entire mood. Let’s face it, if you own an index fund, NVDA is your biggest holding. And if you don’t, you probably own it in some other form.\nI’ll finish below with my collar analysis, but that’s only one of four ways to play the other side of an Nvidia earnings disappointment. This has nothing to do with the actual numbers. It is all about the vibe for this stock now. And the growing concerns that all the AI chips in the world won’t be a long-term bullish situation if the buyers of those chips take a long time to monetize those chip investments.\nThis was the story of the dot-com bubble. The internet was the real deal. But it was assumed to deliver instant profits for those paying up to build off of it. It took a few years longer, and it crushed the market. That’s a risk with NVDA now. The profits have to match the expectations.\nWhen NVDA Drops, These ETFs Rise\nNVDA is one of many stocks that now have “inverse” ETFs built around them. These funds typically use derivatives, such as the three shown here.\nIf the goal is to simply have a position that moves in the exact opposite direction of NVDA stock, the Direxion NVDA Bear -1X ETF (NVDD) aims to deliver just that. As with most inverse and leveraged ETFs, NVDD is designed to provide that inverse exposure one day at a time. So the mathematics of investment loss, and the expense ratio on inverse and leveraged ETFs, can work against investors over time. So these should be used for trading, not long-term investing.\nFor those not satisfied with trying to crush it on NVDA dips and only getting a mirror image of the daily move, the Tradr 1.5x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVDS) and the Graniteshares 2x Short NVDA Daily ETF (NVD) take that inverse idea further.\nThese are relatively small ETFs, which is another risk to monitor and research. Spreads on these are not as tight as for NVDA stock itself. And that leads me to the other two ways I’m highlighting here for NVDA bears.\nThey both involve options. However, the first only requires buying one option, a put, on NVDA. You don’t have to hold the stock, since the assumption is you want to profit from a decline in Nvidia.\nHere’s what a put option might look like as of Monday’s market close. I chose a close expiration date since the idea is to capitalize on a huge drop on earnings. These are volatile, since the stock is. That means buying options can be expensive, though the IV Rank below indicates that NVDA is in the bottom 28% of its 12-month volatility range. So, relatively cheap.\n$445 paid gets the option holder the right to sell 100 shares of NVDA at $170 before expiration day in a few weeks. So the stock really needs to fall to under $166 to make a clear profit. However, if it occurred this week, right after Wednesday’s announcement, that might allow the put option holder to profit without the stock actually getting down to that level. Options on stocks like this are more about trying to profit from volatility that accompanies a sudden change of circumstances. Like a rush for the exits on a stock.\nHow to Collar NVDA\nAnd, since I’m a guy who enjoys a good collar when I see one, here’s how that strategy can work when you have a volatile stock around earnings.\nThe example below strikes the put at $180 to that same 9\/19\/25 expiration date as above. However, I also write a covered call out to only that same date, and I get all the upside to $228. So my cost of the option is essentially my cost. And the upside? 22%, five times the downside.\nNVDA is like its own table at the Wall Street casino. There are so many ways to try to profit from it, other than buying and holding it. And since holding it when it falls sharply and stays down is not something all investors are willing to take on, it helps to know that whether you own the stock or not, you can profit when NVDA falls, not only when it’s rising in price.\nOn the date of publication, Rob Isbitts did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It hardly signals that an olive branch could be extended, or accepted, any time soon.\nMoreover, the Kremlin's cool response to U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to arrange a bilateral meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke volumes, with Russia barely commenting on the offer of talks, let alone acquiescing to them.\nRussia's finance ministry stated earlier in August that the budget deficit had reached 4.88 trillion rubles ($61.1 billion) between January and July this year, equating to 2.2% of GDP. During the same timeframe, government spending \"surged by 20.8% to 25.19 trillion rubles ($317.8 billion),\" state news agency TASS reported, citing the finance ministry.\nUnprecedented levels of government expenditure on defense have, up until this point, been supported by the continuing sales of oil and gas to Russian allies like China and India, and an increase in taxes.\nBut oil export revenues are declining amid sanctions and lower global demand, which means the Kremlin might be forced to consider other spending cuts or further tax rises.\nIn the meantime, Russia's growth outlook is not so rosy either. In 2024, Russia grew 4.3%, but this year, it's expected to expand a far more meager 1% to 2%, according to the Central Bank of Russia (CBR). That poses a risk for the Kremlin as it considers whether to pursue peace, or continue the war against Ukraine while it has an advantage on the battlefield.\n\"For the Kremlin, a brief period of low growth is tolerable, though combined with lower oil prices, it would reduce fiscal revenues. The main gamble is that the cooling of the economy won't trigger a prolonged recession,\" Alexander Kolyandr, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said in analysis in late July.\n\"So far, the government can maintain defense and social spending, but may need to cut elsewhere, which would put it on a dangerous path,\" he added.\nReduced spending or austerity measures could further slow economic growth and wage increases at a time when sanctions, low oil prices, and challenges to property rights discourage private capital investment, he noted.\n\"On the other hand, if the government doesn't reduce fiscal support, there's a risk high inflation will return,\" Kolyandr said.\nInflationary pressures, prompted largely by the surge in defense spending, sanctions and labor shortages that have caused imbalances in supply and demand in other industrial sectors, as well as rampant food price hikes, are also on the Kremlin's mind amid fears that the economy has been overheating.\nRussia's central bank has spent several years trying to tame the country's stubbornly high inflation rate, which hit 17.8% just after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Ostensibly, its efforts have been successful, with the rate of price rises cooling to 8.8% in July.\nThat prompted the CBR to cut its base rate by 200 basis points to 18% last month, following a 100-point reduction the previous month. It also lowered its inflation outlook for 2025, forecasting a 4% threshold would be reached in 2026.\n\"Current inflationary pressures, including underlying ones, are declining faster than previously forecast,\" the central bank said after its July 25 meeting, adding that \"domestic demand growth is slowing. The economy continues to return to a balanced growth path.\"\nCEPA's Kolyandr remarked that a \"balanced growth path\" was \"a euphemism for anemic growth,\" warning that while the CBR was \"claiming a victory over galloping prices ... it's come at a price.\"\nRecession risk\nPutin is fully aware of the economic challenges Russia faces, having warned in June that the economy must not be allowed to drift into recession.\n\"Balanced growth is moderate inflation, low unemployment, and continued positive economic dynamics ... At the same time, some specialists and experts point to the risks of stagnation and even recession. This should not be allowed under any circumstances,\" Putin said, in remarks to the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum and translated by Reuters.\nThe latest growth data certainly suggests a slowdown is underway, with growth of 1.1% year-on-year in the second quarter, down from a 1.4% expansion in the first quarter.\n\"The economy is clearly struggling amidst imbalances that have built up due to the war effort. We expect growth to slow further over the coming quarters,\" Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, stated in emailed analysis in August.\n\"The big picture ... is that Russia's economy is struggling under the weight of high interest rates and the ongoing war effort. A prolonged period of weak growth lies in store,\" Peach added.\n\"Surveys of business sentiment and investment intentions have fallen to multi-year lows. The labour market is cooling and weaker demand will help to ease inflation pressures,\" he said. Capital Economics predicted GDP growth of 0.8% over 2025, \"with a recession this year still a very high risk.\"","content_hash":"eb8566b85d6f3d849482036203237765","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5391,"method_rank":0}

President Trump, who had once criticized Intel (INTC), suddenly signaled support. The U.S. announced plans to convert unused CHIPS Act grants into a roughly 10% equity stake in Intel.\nAt the same time, marquee investors piled into INTC stock. Billionaire David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management disclosed an 8 million share position worth around $179 million in Q2, and others followed suit: AQR Capital boosted its holding by 210%, Citadel added 6.25 million shares, and Renaissance Technologies bought 7.22 million shares of Intel. Even SoftBank (SFTBY) announced a $2 billion investment at roughly $23 per share in mid-August. All told, Wall Street’s smartest money seems to be treating Intel as a potential comeback story, a beaten-down chip giant suddenly viewed as a turnaround play. Could it be? Let's discuss.\nBased in California, Intel is a legacy chipmaker at the center of a high-stakes turnaround. Once dominant in PCs and data centers, the company now fights to reclaim ground lost to AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM). With fresh investments, government backing, and renewed investor interest, Intel is positioning itself as a rebound value play.\nAfter a bumpy start to 2025, Intel’s stock has staged a strong rebound, climbing 20% in the past month, bringing its year-to-date gain to 27%. The rally has been fueled by reports of potential government interest in taking a stake, sparking renewed optimism around the chipmaker’s turnaround.\nIn terms of Valuation, INTC is trading at very attractive multiples. Its price-to-book (P\/B) ratio of 1.04x is notably lower than the sector median of 4.45x, implying it is undervalued. Additionally, its price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio is 2.02x compared to the sector's 3.30x, suggesting a cheaper price relative to revenue.\nMoreover, Intel offers a solid dividend of around $0.28 per share per quarter, making it a contender for value-oriented and dividend-focused investors.\nBillionaire & Hedge Fund Bets\nEven before the official deal, big investors were acting as if Intel’s bottom had arrived. In Q2, Tepper’s Appaloosa established a new position of 8 million shares in Intel. Other hedge funds also piled in, as mentioned in the intro. In aggregate, I think these moves suggest, as Surbhi Jain writing for Bazinga wrote: “some of Wall Street’s smartest minds see Intel as a major turnaround play.”\nThis smart-money buying has come alongside a sharp rise in Intel’s stock. Reports indicated the stock jumped more than 20% on news of the government stake and SoftBank’s investment. The combination of political support and hedge-fund accumulation has been cited as key momentum drivers. For retail investors, the message seems clear: if billionaire managers are betting big, maybe this long-suffering chip leader is finally turning the corner.\nIntel Shows Mixed Q2 Performance\nDespite the political excitement, Intel’s Q2 earnings showed a business still in repair. Revenue was $12.86 billion in Q2 2025, essentially flat year-over-year. The company missed on profitability with an EPS loss of $0.26, missing the estimated $0.14.\nIntel took heavy one-time charges, about $1.9 billion of restructuring costs and $800 million of asset write-downs, which weighed on margins and drove the loss. As a result, adjusted operating profit remains negative, and gross margins have compressed. For example, in Q2, the gross margin was only 27-28% compared to the mid-30s a year earlier, as outdated factory equipment was retired.\nIntel also burned cash in the quarter, with a loss of $1.1 billion of adjusted free cash flow (FCF), largely due to continued investment and costs. However, the balance sheet still showed roughly $21 billion in cash and short-term investments at quarter-end.\nOn the other hand, Intel is aggressively trimming expenses. CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel has already slashed about 15% of its core workforce. The goal is to limit annual R&D+MG&A spending to $17 billion in 2025, down from over $20 billion, and to cap capital expenditures at $18 billion for the year. CFO David Zinsner emphasized that monetizing non-core assets and lowering operating costs are key to “strengthening our balance sheet.”\nLooking at the future, management expects Q3 2025 revenue of roughly $12.6 to $13.6 billion and is targeting EPS of about a loss of $0.24 for the period. This outlook assumes the company’s cost-cutting plans continue to take hold.\nWhat Do Analysts Say About Intel Stock?\nMost analyst firms stayed cautious on Intel’s government stake news. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated a “Neutral” stance, noting that limited EPS power at the company level could cap gains near the mid-$20 range.\nOf the 39 analysts tracked by Barchart, the consensus rating stands at “Hold,” with a breakdown of one “Strong Buy,” 33 “Hold,” and five “Strong Sell.” Intel shares have already moved past the average price target of $23, though the Street-high forecast of $62 implies a potential 148% upside from current levels.\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The strength in both orders and shipments of these so-called core capital goods was despite independent surveys indicating that businesses were hunkering down amid rising costs from tariffs on imports.\nThe upbeat data was overshadowed by a survey from the Conference Board showing consumers' perceptions of their ability to find a job were the weakest in more than four years in August. Employment growth slowed to stall-speed during the three months through July, which economists have blamed on President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policy.\n\"Businesses cannot afford to be so sanguine about tariffs,\" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo. \"Increased costs are difficult to pass on in the present environment which means they must look for other ways to preserve margin. One way to do that is by keeping an eye on labor costs.\"\nCore capital goods orders surged 1.1% last month after a revised 0.6% decline in June, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders rebounding 0.2% after a previously reported 0.8% drop in June.\nShipments of core capital goods increased 0.7%, the biggest gain since April 2023, after rising 0.4% in the prior month. These shipments go into calculation of the spending component in the gross domestic product report. Orders and shipments were also likely inflated by higher prices.\nCore capital goods orders have fluctuated within a wide band this year, surging as businesses rushed to bring in goods before the Trump administration's sweeping import duties kicked in, and declining as the front-loading abated.\nThe data was marred by Trump's unprecedented move to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, which renewed concerns over the central bank's independence. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading lower.\nBusiness spending on equipment slowed in the second quarter following double-digit growth in the January-March quarter. Some economists still expected business spending on equipment to weaken this quarter because of the import duties.\n\"Policy uncertainty is lower now but not eliminated and some key questions remain unanswered,\" said Oren Klachkin, financial markets economist at Nationwide. \"This will weigh on executives' minds and restrain capital expenditures, only for projects deemed essential or worth the potential cost.\"\nThere were solid increases in orders for machinery, electrical equipment, appliances and components, primary metals, computers and electronics, as well as fabricated metal products.\nTARIFFS ON CONSUMERS' MINDS\nBut overall durable goods orders, items ranging from toasters to aircraft meant to last three years or more, fell 2.8% as bookings for commercial aircraft declined.\nDurable goods orders decreased 9.4% in June. Boeing reported on its website that it had received only 31 aircraft orders compared to 116 in June. Boeing has been the biggest winner of the White House's trade deals and economists expect aircraft orders to rise this year.\n\"But significant orders for planes this year may be more a consequence of pulling forward of future orders as opposed to longer-lasting demand,\" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup.\nWhile business investment is showing resilience, consumers are increasingly worried about jobs and future income, which could hamper spending.\nThe Conference Board survey showed the share of consumers who viewed jobs as \"hard to get\" jumped to 20.0% in August, the highest since February 2021, from 18.9% in July.\nThe proportion saying jobs were \"plentiful\" eased slightly. That pushed the survey's so-called labor market differential to 9.7 from 11.0 in July.\nThis measure correlates to the unemployment rate in the Labor Department's monthly employment report.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell last week signaled a possible rate cut at the central bank's September 16-17 policy meeting, in a nod to rising labor market risks, but also added that inflation remained a threat. The U.S. central bank has kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range since December.\nThe Conference Board survey also underscored the growing inflation concerns, noting \"consumers' write-in responses showed that references to tariffs increased somewhat and continued to be associated with concerns about higher prices.\"\nConsumers' average 12-month inflation expectations rose to 6.2% after easing for three straight months.\n\"This report highlighted the problem facing the Fed,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital. \"The Fed focuses more on hard data, the employment report, and longer-term inflation expectations, but the divergence is worth noting.\"\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Andrea Ricci)","content_hash":"7ea01fc4d0e8831f4d0d07b837799066","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5332,"method_rank":0}

That is why the Trump administration's new 10% stake in chipmaker Intel (INTC) has been a hot topic of debate. While some have argued that such a move is akin to a socialist regime and not the free market-centric U.S., others have lauded the move, citing national security concerns.\nNow, the government has set its sights on memory and storage solutions provider Micron Technology (MU). A beneficiary of the Biden-era CHIPS Act, Micron received subsidies worth $6.2 billion from the government last year to produce chips in the U.S. Well, President Donald Trump reckons that this funding should not be free, and the government should be allowed to wet its beak.\nHow this would happen isn't clear, and the messaging coming out of the White House has been inconsistent to say the least.\nAbout Micron\nFounded in 1978, Micron specializes in memory and storage solutions, including DRAM, NAND and NOR flash memory, and SSDs. These products are critical components in a wide range of devices, from personal computers and smartphones to data centers, automobiles, and industrial equipment. Notably, Micron operates through several well-known brands, including Micron and Crucial, serving both enterprise and consumer markets.\nValued at a market cap of $131.2 billion, the MU stock is up 37.8% on a YTD basis. Further, the stock offers a dividend yield of 0.39%, and with a payout ratio of just 7.14%, the scope for further growth remains.\nBut the pertinent question remains: What does the government's potential interest in a stake in the company mean for MU stock? Let's take a closer look.\nMicron's Financials Are Strong\nMicron has been a consistent performer over the past several years, with its revenues and earnings climbing at 10-year CAGRs of 7.23% and 5.69%, respectively. Granted, it may not jump out as being extraordinary, but it is decent, especially considering the other company in which the government has already taken a stake in: Intel.\nMoreover, Micron has reported an earnings beat in nine consecutive quarters. In the most recent quarter, i.e. Q3 2025, Micron's revenues came in at $9.3 billion. This marked a yearly growth of 36.6%, with gross margins expanding to 39% from 28.1% in the same period.\nThe EPS of $1.91 reflected a quadrupling of the earnings from the previous year's figure of $0.62 per share. This also came in higher than the consensus of $1.60 per share.\nNet cash flow from operating activities also saw a jump to $11.8 billion from $5.1 billion in the year-ago period as the company closed the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $10.2 billion. This exceeded the short-term debt levels of $538 million by a wide margin.\nFor Q4 2025, Micron is projecting revenues to be in the range of $10.4-$11 billion, the midpoint of which would mark a year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth rate of 38.1%.\nMicron's Unique Positioning Poises It for Growth\nMicron is much better positioned for growth than Intel, too.\nA major growth driver for Micron is its High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), an advanced form of DRAM that delivers much faster data transfer speeds while using less power. Its entire HBM supply for 2025 is already sold out, and it is shipping in high volumes to four customers, including AMD’s (AMD) Instinct MI355X GPUs, which use Micron’s 36GB HBM3E.\nMeanwhile, Micron has a strong competitive edge in energy efficiency as its HBM3E consumes roughly 30% less power than rival products. In AI data centers, where energy use is a key cost and performance factor, this advantage is critical. Further, the next-generation HBM4, already in testing with several customers, is expected to deliver 2TB\/s bandwidth with 20% less power consumption. Sampling should begin by mid-2025, with mass production in 2026, positioning Micron well for future AI accelerator demand.\nAnother catalyst is the increasing speed of its 1-gamma DRAM production. Micron recently began shipping the industry’s first 1-gamma-based DDR5 products, made using EUV lithography for higher density, lower costs, and better margins.\nFinally, Micron also stands out as the only large-scale HBM supplier outside of South Korea, offering customers valuable supply chain diversification amid rising geopolitical tensions, making it a crucial strategic partner for many technology companies.\nAnalyst Opinion\nThus, Micron is in a much better position than Intel, and the proposed government stake in the company opens it up to possible interventions that may hinder its superb growth prospects. So, investors should be wary of the same. Otherwise, the company looks solid, with the analyst community believing as much.\nOverall, analysts have deemed the MU stock a “Strong Buy” with a mean target price of $152.42. This denotes an upside potential of about 31.6% from current levels. Out of 35 analysts covering the stock, 25 have a “Strong Buy” rating, four have a “Moderate Buy” rating, five have a “Hold” rating, and one have a “Strong Sell” rating.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Or half-month, to be more specific.\nSince reaching a record high on August 12, shares have been mired in a steep sell-off, falling 17%.\nThe tumble stood in stark contrast to the stock's 147% year-to-date ascent up until that point, a rally driven by fervid retail investors and market-wide excitement around the growth potential of AI.\nWall Street analysts say a combination of three major factors has Palantir's army of loyal retail investors feeling more hesitant on the stock:\n1. Short-seller interest\nAndrew Left, the founder of Citron Research — best-known for his previous bets against Hertz and Nikola — recently revealed that his firm had taken a short position in Palantir. In a mid-August note, he cited the company's \"absurd\" valuation, adding that he believed the firm was divorced from fundamentals.\nLeft spoke about his bold call to Fox Business, which was likely the catalyst that sparked fear in many retail investors holding the stock, Louis Navellier, the founder of Navellier & Associates, told Business Insider.\n\"The Citron guy went on [TV] and slammed it. And that kind of started its descent,\" Navellier said. \"Anytime a stock gets extended, the short-seller is likely to try to prick that bubble.\"\nOther short-sellers have joined the fray in recent weeks. At the end of July, Palantir had a short interest of 54.7 million shares, representing around 2% of all its public stock. Short interest in the firm has increased around 2% since the prior month, according to data from MarketBeat.\n2. Profit taking\nInvestors have been using Palantir's monster rally in 2025 as an opportunity to cash in some of their shares. At its peak, shares were up nearly 150% from the start of the year.\nThat applied to large firms all across the tech sector, according to Tyler Radke, a senior equity research analyst at Citi, said last week that this profit-taking trend applied to all sorts of mega-cap tech firms. He pointed to the recent decline in Microsoft stock, despite the software giant's blowout earnings for the second quarter.\n\"I just think it's a bit of repositioning some of the volatility,\" Radke said. \"I think just for Palantir, just the track record of buying these high multiple stocks at these levels hasn't been great,\" he added.\n\"Profit-taking is normal. If a stock goes up 15%, it's got to pull back 5 to 10%,\" Navellier said.\n3. Institutional selling\nMarket makers on Wall Street regularly sell high-performing stocks in their algorithmic trading programs, Navellier said. That's because many firms try to implement mean reversion in their trading strategy, which is the idea that asset prices tend to eventually fall back to their historic average.\nThat's made the recent profit-taking among Palantir investors worse, he said.\n\"What was going on that Monday through Wednesday is we had a very serious mean reversion program hitting all the winners, and they were hitting anything that was up,\" Navellier said of the prior week, pointing to the broader sell-off in markets and tech stocks.\nA comeback in sight\nDespite the latest sell-off, Palantir is still the top-performing stock in the S&P 500. Its still-remarkable rally in 2025 has been driven by a handful of factors, including a slew of lucrative, long-term contracts it secured with the US government.\nThe company also blew the doors off its latest earnings report. Palantir notched $1 billion in revenue for the first time ever, marking a 48% increase from the same quarter the prior year.\nNavellier, whose firm manages over $800 million in client assets, said he had no plans to sell Palantir anytime soon. The stock remains one out of eight gems on his \"A grade\" list, due to its strong fundamentals, he said.\n\"I don't mind if it pauses for a month or two. All I care about is when it announces next time it blows it out of the park and guides higher,\" he said of Palantir's next earnings report.\nPalantir's retail investors, many of whom share a cultlike following to the stock, have also sounded mixed about the outlook. But strains of optimism still exist about the company's future, despite the recent selling pressure.\n\"Lmao. Anything citron touches is immediately a long. They basically always cause a stock to crash before ppl are like wait.... Then price surges,\" one Reddit user on r\/WallStreetBets wrote in a thread about Nvidia's valuation.\n\"Nobody wanted it at 6$ in 2022,\" another user said.\nNeil Rozenbaum, one retail trader who said he sold most of his shares of Palantir last year but still remained invested in the company, told BI he regretted unloading the stock.\n\"I viewed Palantir as expensive,\" he said, adding that he now saw the company as an \"AI winner\" and would consider buying more in the future.\nPalantir's turnaround story will likely begin with analysts start revising their forecasts for the stock higher, or if Palantir reports a new business contract or guidance for its hiring anytime soon, Navellier speculated.\n\"It's just that [Fox] ruined the party by having the Citron guy on. That's all,\" he said.","content_hash":"844aad36772a5ff98090f532cf498bec","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5292,"method_rank":0}

The company disclosed on Monday it had purchased an additional 103 BTC for around ¥1.73 billion ($11.7 million) at an average price of $113,491 per coin.\nThe company, which began its Bitcoin strategy in April 2024, now ranks seventh globally among public corporations in Bitcoin reserves, according to Bitcointreasuries data.\nPresident Simon Gerovich of Metaplanet celebrated the purchase on X, noting that Metaplanet has also been added to the FTSE Japan Index in its September review, a move that upgraded the stock from small-cap to mid-cap status.\nShares rose 3.5% in Monday trading, though the stock remains down nearly 27% over the past month. Year-to-date, however, Metaplanet is up nearly 148%, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its bold Bitcoin-centric strategy.\nRemixpoint Inc. also revealed a substantial addition to its reserves, purchasing 41.5 BTC over the past week for approximately ¥715 million ($4.6 million).\nThe Tokyo-listed firm, best known for its energy management and electricity services, now holds 1,273 BTC, pushing it into the global top 40 corporate holders.\nFashion retailer ANAP Holdings followed suit through its subsidiary ANAP Lightning Capital, acquiring 11.68 BTC worth nearly ¥197 million ($1.3 million) on August 22. The firm’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at just over 1,017 BTC at an average cost of ¥14.7 million ($100,000) per coin.\nThe company noted that its Bitcoin balances are marked to market each quarter, with unrealized gains of more than ¥2.1 billion ($14 million) as of this week.\nAgile Media Network Inc., a Tokyo Growth Market-listed advertising company, announced a smaller purchase, adding 0.59 BTC for ¥10 million ($66,000). The firm had previously committed to acquiring up to ¥100 million worth of Bitcoin between July and September.\nWith this latest addition, Agile Media has accumulated just under 3 BTC over six separate purchases this summer, reflecting a more measured approach to digital asset exposure.\nRounding out the list, Def Consulting said it will begin a Bitcoin treasury program, though details of its initial purchase have not yet been disclosed.\nThe coordinated push comes as Bitcoin prices hover near $112,000, down from record highs earlier this month. For Japanese corporates, however, the downturn has been seen less as a deterrent and more as an entry point into a long-term strategy modeled after U.S. pioneers like Strategy.\nAnalysts note that Japan’s regulatory clarity and investor appetite for diversification have created fertile ground for Bitcoin adoption at the corporate level.\nJapan’s Bitcoin-Friendly Policies Attract Global Investors and U.S. Interest\nSupporting this corporate adoption wave, Japan’s regulatory clarity has been a decisive factor. The Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to formally recognize crypto assets as financial products under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act by 2026.\nAlongside, proposed tax reforms could lower crypto capital gains from rates as high as 55% to a flat 20%, making corporate adoption far more appealing.\nNotably, Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato reinforced this stance during the WebX2025 forum in Tokyo, where he emphasized that digital assets could play a role in diversified investment portfolios. While acknowledging volatility risks, he said creating an “appropriate trading environment” would help manage those risks without stifling innovation.\nThis shift has sparked speculation about whether Japan might eventually consider a strategic Bitcoin reserve. André Dragosch, European Head of Research at Bitwise, noted that Japan’s regulatory pivot could lay the groundwork for such a move.\nAt the same time, global players are eyeing Japan’s open stance. Eric Trump is set to visit Tokyo in September for Metaplanet’s shareholder meeting, aligning with his family’s broader Web3 ambitions.\nAmerican Bitcoin, backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, has also signaled interest in acquiring Japanese firms to expand corporate Bitcoin holdings, leveraging the country’s strong retail culture and clear rules.\nInstitutional activity is accelerating across the region as well. CMB International Securities recently launched 24\/7 Bitcoin trading in Hong Kong while preparing to expand into Japan. Meanwhile, the FSA is expected to approve the country’s first yen-backed stablecoin, issued by JPYC, as early as October.\nThe momentum is already delivering results. Metaplanet, Japan’s largest Bitcoin treasury holder, has doubled its holdings roughly every 60 days since adopting the Bitcoin Standard, growing its shareholder base to over 128,000.\nGlobally, more than 302 corporations now hold a combined 3.68 million BTC, worth around $418 billion.","content_hash":"b7c50979dd5010a79405b0285a8cea01","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5158,"method_rank":0}

NVDA, a maker of artificial-intelligence chips, is among a small group of closely watched Big Tech stocks that can heavily influence how the S&P 500 SPX moves because of their outsize weighting in the U.S. equities index. As recently as Friday, Nvidia has the biggest weight in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, an exchange-traded that tracks the index, at 7.9%.\n“All eyes are on Nvidia,” said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, a research firm that provides technical analysis of markets, in a note Monday. The levels to watch for Nvidia’s stock are its 50-day moving average of around $167 and “minor resistance near $184,” she said.\nShares of Nvidia, which has a massive market value exceeding $4 trillion, finished Monday with a 1% gain, after falling 1.4% last week, according to FactSet data.\nBig Tech stocks struggled last week ahead of Powell’s speech Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Wyoming. But his remarks hinting that the Fed may lower interest rates in September triggered a broad stock-market rally that helped fuel their rebound that day.\nThe Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS — whose portfolio consists of Big Tech stocks including Nvidia, Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Tesla Inc. TSLA and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META — jumped around 2.5% on Friday but still saw a weekly loss of 1.1% last week, according to FactSet data.\n“Last week, the ‘gen-AI trade’ was more important than U.S. monetary policy in terms of near-term market direction,” Colas said of generative artificial intelligence. The “selloff ahead of the chair’s speech was caused by concerns about gen-AI adoption and how much Big Tech is willing to spend on this ‘next big thing,’” he wrote.\nThe Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which seeks to provide equal-weight exposure to the seven Big Tech stocks that it holds, closed 0.5% higher Monday.\n‘Elephant in the room’\nU.S. equity markets tend to rally during the week before and after a Fed chair’s Jackson Hole speech, “as they first partially discount policy clarity and then finish the job over the subsequent five days,” Colas said.\nPowell’s remarks on Friday seemed “to bless a September rate cut,” an expected Fed policy shift that had already been reflected in the federal-funds futures market, he wrote.\nIn a separate note early last week, DataTrek analyzed the S&P 500’s performance surrounding Jackson Hole speeches from Fed chairs over a period running from 2010 through 2024. Colas calculated that over that time frame, the S&P 500 returned an average 0.6% in the five days after the Jackson Hole event — noting that Fed chairs did not attend the annual gathering of central bankers in two years with that period, including 2013 and 2015.\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1.5% Friday, closing the trading session with a weekly rise of 0.3%.\nThe U.S. stock market ended down Monday, in a light day on the U.S. economic calendar. The S&P 500 shed 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 0.8% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP retreated 0.2%, according to FactSet data.\nBespoke Investment Group also researched the S&P 500’s performance around the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole gatherings, finding in a note emailed Monday that “since 2009, the S&P 500’s median gain has been 0.5% with positive returns in 11 out of the last 16 years” in the week after the symposium.\n“Big Tech has become very influential in the market,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial, in a note Monday. “Concentration risk is real and rising.”\nNvidia, Microsoft and Apple represent a combined 21% of the S&P 500 index. “Add in Amazon, Meta Platforms and Alphabet, and you’re at nearly 32% across just six companies,” he wrote.\nThis week, Nvidia will be the last of the so-called Magnificent Seven to report results for the prior quarter. As expectations for Nvidia keep rising, Saglimbene cautioned that “year‑over‑year comparisons are becoming more difficult to top.”\nNvidia’s stock has surged almost 34% in 2025 through Monday, according to FactSet data. The S&P 500 is up 9.5% so far this year, while the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF has climbed a steeper 10.4% over the same period.\nBased on 474 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings for the second quarter, 80% were above analyst expectations, according to an emailed note from LSEG that cited data through Friday.\n“Earnings season is mostly over, except for the elephant in the room — Nvidia,” wrote Bespoke.","content_hash":"d9ab847c7496203cc24323fa905a8fc9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5133,"method_rank":0}

It went from like, $44 million to $29.5 million, which is a great deal in my head,\" she said.\nThe property boasts a cantilevered glass living room, an infinity pool with a spa, a sunken fire pit, and a 5,000 square foot garden, according to the property listing.\nThe young billionaire also owns a condo in Florida, which she bought for $6.7 million in 2021, as well as another farmhouse-style home in L.A., which she secured at $4.2 million in 2024.\n\"I generally like appreciating assets, and I think this is something that will appreciate; not all properties will appreciate. It's a single-family house, it comes with a lot of land. The [L.A.] fires just happened, so I think everything's on a discount,\" Guo said.\nGuo said there's less demand for larger homes now, so it's easier to negotiate down and not lose out, if she decides to resell in the future.\nShe also likes to spend money on comforts such as a private jet to skip lines at the airport, but some purchases are pure wish fulfillment.\n\"I really have an ick for depreciating assets, but I did splurge on one, and that would probably be my Ferrari,\" she added. Guo's luxury sports car is a vintage rose color.\n\"It's like one in 10 or something in the world. They pitched it really hard and I was like, 'oh, it's pretty. Sure. I didn't even think about it,\" she said.\nIn February, a class action lawsuit was filed against Guo and her company Passes, claiming that she allegedly distributed child sexual abuse material on the platform to paying subscribers.\n\"This lawsuit is a shakedown and part of an orchestrated attempt to defame Passes and Ms. Guo, and these disturbing claims have no basis in reality,\" a spokesperson for Passes said in a statement.\n\"As explained in the motion to dismiss filed on April 28, Ms. Guo and Passes categorically reject the baseless allegations made against them in the lawsuit, which was only filed against them after they rejected a $15 million payment demand.\"\nClark Smith Villazor, the New York-based litigation firm that brought the lawsuit against Passes, has yet to respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nMillionaires vs. billionaires\nGuo said there's a distinction between some millionaires and billionaires, as the former will often try to show off how much money they have.\n\"Sometimes you see people will try to overcompensate to show they have more than they actually have and I've definitely seen people overcompensate and splurge more than they should to try to make themselves look wealthier than they are,\" she said.\n\"Let's say you're worth a few million, and you hang out with people worth billions, at least, from what I've seen from an outside perspective, they spend a lot more, and they're almost living to their every dollar to be able to blend in.\"\nGuo describes herself as a \"minimalist\" and leans on the side of the quiet luxury trend. Most of her clothes are unbranded and $10 a piece, she said. Occasionally, she'll throw on a nice piece of jewelry if she's going to an event.\n\"My daily life is very quiet,\" she added.","content_hash":"506888d84f68f34dc4773e4a24eca661","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5124,"method_rank":0}

Global has demanded a high-profile crypto trader known as “The White Whale” travel to Malaysia for in-person verification to unlock over $3.1 million in frozen funds.\nThese demands came despite the trader already completing multiple KYC requirements, including live video verification, address proof, and phone number confirmation.\nThe exchange’s Global Head of Customer Service, Derrick, personally extended the invitation, offering a “VIP experience” and luxury accommodations while insisting that face-to-face meetings are necessary to complete the verification process.\nSecurity Concerns Mount as Crypto Kidnappings Rise Globally\nThe controversial demand comes amid growing concerns about crypto-related kidnappings and security risks facing high-net-worth individuals.\nThe White Whale, who claims to hold over $100 million in on-chain assets, rejected the meeting proposal, citing personal security concerns and noting that MEXC’s Terms of Service contain no requirements for in-person KYC procedures.\nMEXC froze the trader’s account in July 2025 under vague “risk control” protocols without prior notice or clear explanation.\nWhen the trader expressed reluctance to travel, Derrick’s response was telling: “But I understood that you have sought to expedite the unfreezing of your account,” essentially linking fund access to the Malaysia meeting requirement.\nThe incident has sparked widespread social media backlash under the hashtag #FreeTheWhiteWhale, with multiple users reporting similar account freezes and fund seizures by MEXC.\nExchange Doubles Down Despite Missing Legal Basis for In-Person Demands\nMEXC’s persistence in demanding face-to-face verification lacks foundation in their published terms of service, raising questions about the exchange’s compliance procedures.\nAfter the Malaysia proposal was rejected, Derrick suggested Hong Kong as an alternative location, claiming it would be “one of the safest countries” for the meeting.\nThe exchange representative acknowledged the unusual nature of their request, stating, “this is indeed not a usual process, but I am really trying to help out for your appeal.”\nHe characterized the in-person meeting as part of a “manual verification process as an exception” to facilitate the fund release appeal.\nThe White Whale has already completed extensive verification procedures accepted by MEXC during previous reviews, including liveness checks, address verification, and phone number confirmation.\nThe trader emphasized having provided all requested documentation and questioned why additional verification requirements emerged without clear justification.\nMEXC’s approach contrasts sharply with standard industry practices, where remote KYC procedures typically suffice for account verification and fund access.\nThe exchange’s inability to point to specific terms of service provisions supporting their demands undermines the legitimacy of their verification requirements.\nThe situation escalated as MEXC attempted to frame the meeting as a collaboration opportunity, with Derrick mentioning “enhanced trading perks” and “exciting partnership opportunities” alongside the verification process.\nHowever, the trader remained focused solely on fund recovery and account closure rather than on ongoing business relationships.\nPattern of Account Freezes Emerges as Users Report Similar Treatment\nMultiple MEXC users have reported comparable experiences with arbitrary account freezes and questionable fund recovery procedures.\nPablo Ruiz documented losing access to $2.08 million USDT after his account was frozen on April 17, 2025, under “risk control” protocols with no clear explanation or appeal mechanism.\nMEXC informed Ruiz that his account review would take 365 days, with instructions to “contact us again on 04\/17\/2026.”\nThe exchange provided contradictory information, at one point claiming the risk control process was completed while support insisted the review remained ongoing.\nPrevious incidents from 2024 included “clawback” allegations where MEXC reportedly reversed profitable trades and confiscated funds from user accounts.\nTrader “Al Gore Rhythms” had $33,658 deducted from his spot account, with MEXC claiming they have “taken measures to recover the losses incurred” due to “abnormal trading activities.”\nAnother case involved CoackKCrypto, who alleged MEXC seized $330,000 “due to abnormal profit” without clear justification or due process.\nUsers reported that MEXC deleted transactions from their history and provided automated responses rather than substantive explanations for enforcement actions.\nThe offshore exchange operates with less regulatory oversight than publicly listed U.S. companies, potentially contributing to inconsistent enforcement practices.\nMultiple enforcement entities continue investigating various offshore exchanges following the FTX collapse, while users increasingly question custodial risks associated with centralized platforms lacking transparent dispute resolution mechanisms.\nAt the time of publication, the MEXC team has neither released the funds nor provided any clarity on the matter.","content_hash":"f2f3e808391a4351f977850b420c08e0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5113,"method_rank":0}

The company also has a growing foundry business that is the centerpiece of its turnaround effort. However, it badly trails both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung (SMSN.L.EB) in market share.\nAfter its recent run higher, INTC stock is more than doubling the year-to-date return of the S&P 500 ($SPX), which is up nearly 11%. Intel now trades just 9% off its 52-week high of $27.55, but is still 64% off its all-time high set near the turn of the century.\nHowever, it’s the company’s valuation that is raising eyebrows right now. Intel’s price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio is 88, with a forward P\/E of 227, indicating that there are massively high expectations baked into the stock. Expectations are high because the federal government announced it was taking a 10% stake in Intel by investing $8.9 billion into the company. However, the company also disclosed that $5.7 billion of the funding would be in the form of grants that were previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the 2022 U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. The act was passed with the intention of increasing semiconductor research and manufacturing in the U.S. Intel is also receiving $3.2 billion as part of the Secure Enclave program, which is funded by the Commerce Department to support manufacturing of advanced chips for the military and intelligence agencies.\nCombined with $2.2 billion the government already issued to Intel, the government’s total commitment is $11.1 billion.\nThe U.S. is purchasing 433.3 million shares of Intel stock at $20.47 per share and will receive a five-year warrant at $20 per share for an additional 5% of Intel shares. The option can be executed if Intel does not own at least 51% of its foundry business.\nSoftBank (SFTBY), based in Japan, also announced a $2 billion investment in Intel. SoftBank is paying $23 per share for Intel stock. “This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role,” SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said.\nIntel’s Continues to Reposition\nIntel’s deal with the Trump administration marks the latest in a series of major changes the company has made since CEO Lip-Bu Tan replaced Pat Gelsinger in the top job in March. Tan is repositioning the company by cutting 15% of the workforce and is terminating planned chip facility projects in Germany and Poland. In addition, it disclosed in a regulatory filing that it may be forced to “pause or discontinue” its foundry business entirely if it fails to secure a customer on its next technology cycle.\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the dominant player in the foundry space, with an estimated 67% of the market share. Samsung has 11%, with no other company having more than a 5% share.\nIntel’s second-quarter earnings report showed revenue of $12.86 billion, which was better than analysts’ consensus expectation for $11.92 billion. But the company posted a net loss of $2.9 billion, or $0.67 per share, versus a year ago when Intel’s net loss was $1.61 billion and $0.38 per share. The loss included an $800 million impairment charge from “excess tools with no identified re-use,” the company said.\nIntel issued third-quarter guidance for revenue in the range of $12.6 billion to $13.6 billion.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for INTC Stock?\nMost analysts appear to be viewing Intel with caution – of the 39 analysts surveyed at Barchart, only one gives it a “Strong Buy” rating, with five listing INTC stock as a “Strong Sell” and the rest recommending a “Hold.”\nFollowing the announcements of the U.S. government and SoftBank investments, analysts at Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Truist Financial, and UBS all reiterated their hold ratings.\nAnalysts have a mean price target of $23.09, or roughly $2 below Intel’s current trading price. Although there is one bullish outlier with a price target of $62, the consensus sentiment is that Intel stock is already ahead of itself. Investors would be better off biding their time and waiting for more developments before taking a position.\nOn the date of publication, Patrick Sanders did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

As of Aug. 25, the flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 31.7% year-to-date, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 9.7% gain.\nWood's remarkable return of 153% in 2020 helped build her reputation and attract loyal investors. Her strategy can lead to sharp gains during bull markets but also painful losses, like in 2022, when ARKK dropped more than 60%.\nThose swings have weighed on her long-term results. As of Aug. 22, the Ark Innovation ETF has delivered a five-year annualized return of negative 2.7%, while the S&P 500 has an annualized return of 15.5% over the same period.\nCathie Wood’s investment strategy explained\nWood’s investment strategy is straightforward: Her Ark ETFs typically buy shares in emerging high-tech companies in fields such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, biomedical technology, and robotics.\nShe says these companies have the potential to reshape industries, but their volatility leads to major fluctuations in Ark funds' values.\nOver the 10 years ending in 2024, the Ark Innovation ETF wiped out $7 billion in investor wealth, according to an analysis by Morningstar’s analyst Amy Arnott. That made it the third-biggest wealth destroyer among mutual funds and ETFs in Arnott’s ranking.\nStill, Wood has been bullish on the market. In a letter to investors published in late April, she dismissed predictions of a recession dragging into 2026 and struck an optimistic tone for tech stocks.\n\"During the current turbulent transition in the U.S., we think consumers and businesses are likely to accelerate the shift to technologically enabled innovation platforms including artificial intelligence, robotics, energy storage, blockchain technology, and multiomics sequencing,\" she said.\nNot all investors share this optimism. Over the past 12 months through Aug. 21, the Ark Innovation ETF saw $1.6 billion in net outflows, according to data from ETF research firm VettaFi.\nCathie Wood sells $1.6 million of Robinhood stock\nOn Aug. 21, Wood’s ARK Fintech innovation ETF (ARKF) sold 14,914 shares of Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) worth roughly $1.6 million.\nThat came right after two sizable purchases last week: 123,336 shares on Aug. 18 and 150,908 shares on Aug. 19, worth a combined $30 million.\nRobinhood is an online brokerage that went public in 2021. It offers retail investors stocks, options, and crypto trading through its app.\nIn July, Robinhood reported second-quarter earnings of 42 cents a share, topping Wall Street’s forecast of 35 cents. Revenue came in at $989 million, ahead of the $913.3 million consensus. The brokerage's funded accounts rose by 2.3 million, or 10% year-over-year, to 26.5 million.\nRobinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said the company’s strong business results were “driven by relentless product velocity.” He also said the company launched tokenization, which in data security refers to converting sensitive information into a nonsensitive digital replacement, or token.\n\"I believe [this] is the biggest innovation our industry has seen in the past decade,\" he said.\nSeveral analysts have lifted their price targets for Robinhood stock after the earnings.\nMizuho analyst Dan Dolev raised the firm's price target on Robinhood to $120 from $99 and reiterated an outperform rating, citing the company's \"big quarter\" and accelerating year-over-year growth in funded accounts, thefly reported.\nMizuho also views Robinhood's asset tokenization and expansion into lending as \"particularly interesting.\"\nLast week, Bernstein raised its price target on Robinhood to $160 from $105, the highest on Wall Street. The firm reiterated an outperform rating.\nBernstein says the Trump administration is pushing to make the U.S. the global hub for crypto and sees the bull market lasting into 2026, with a possible peak in 2027. The firm argues that Robinhood’s mix of equities, crypto, and financial services makes it more predictable.\n“Robinhood’s diversified model offers crypto upside without the same volatility as pure-play exchanges,” the analysts said.\nRobinhood stocks were traded at around $108 on Aug. 25, up 191% year-to-date.\nWood first bought into Robinhood in the third quarter of 2021. It was Ark Invest’s fourth-largest holding at the end of the second quarter, according to its latest 13F filing.\nWood trimmed her Robinhood stake by 2.46 million shares in the second quarter, a 24% cut. Even so, the Ark funds still owned 7.8 million shares worth about $729 million at the end of June, accounting for 5.34% of the portfolio.","content_hash":"ca380265e527153ecf8d594f4e412018","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5060,"method_rank":0}

But that type of fraud can be difficult to prove, experts say.\nPresident Donald Trump announced in a Truth Social post on Monday night that he was removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. He cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook committed mortgage fraud by claiming homes in two different states as her primary residence at the same time.\nCook's attorney on Tuesday said Cook will file a lawsuit to challenge her removal.\n\"President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook,\" the lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHow Roth conversions could slash Trump's $40,000 'SALT' deduction for high earners\nS&P 500 investors have been rewarded in 2025. Experts say it's time to diversify\nWho benefits from 0% capital gains for 2025 under Trump's 'big beautiful bill'\nThe Department of Justice has also recently targeted Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James with similar mortgage fraud allegations.\nHere are the key things to know about owner-occupancy mortgage fraud, according to experts.\nFinancial incentive\nThe main reason a borrower could be motivated to claim a primary residence on a mortgage application is to get a lower interest rate for that home.\nTypically, mortgages for a primary residence have lower interest rates and homeowner's insurance costs, said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of mortgage website HSH.\nMortgage interest rates are generally 0.5% to 1% higher for investment properties than for primary homes, according to Bankrate. Homeowners also typically pay about 25% more for insurance as a landlord compared with a standard homeowners policy, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\nOwner-occupied means \"you're going to live there the majority of the time,\" Gumbinger said. But there are limited exceptions, including for military service, parents providing housing for a disabled adult child or children providing housing for parents, according to Fannie Mae.\nIf a homeowner changes primary residences, they need to inform their mortgage lender that the original property is no longer owner-occupied, Gumbinger said.\nTax benefits\nThere are also federal and state tax benefits for primary residences, according to Albert Campo, a certified public accountant and president of Campo Financial Group in Manalapan, New Jersey.\nFor example, when an owner sells a home and makes a profit, they can take a capital gains exemption worth up to $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples filing jointly, as long as they meet certain IRS rules, including owner occupancy for two of the past five years.\nFor tax purposes, a homeowner can have only one primary residence at a time.\nWhen a taxpayer owns more than one home, proving which one is the primary residence is \"always based on facts and circumstances,\" Campo said. For example, a primary residence is typically where an owner spends most of their time, votes, files their tax returns and receives mail, he said.\n'Difficult to detect'\nA 2023 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that more than 22,000 \"fraudulent borrowers\" misrepresented their owner-occupancy status, out of 584,499 loans originated from 2005 to 2017. The data was based on a subsample from more than 15 million loans originated during this period.\nTypically, the fraudulent borrowers took out larger loans and had higher mortgage default rates, the authors found.\nHowever, this type of fraud may be \"difficult to detect until long after the mortgage has been originated,\" the authors wrote.\nIn the court of law, this is small ball and very difficult to prove.Jonathan KanterWashington University in St. Louis law professor and former Assistant Attorney General\n\"There is a difference between the court of law and the court of public opinion,\" Jonathan Kanter, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and a former assistant attorney general, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week when asked about Cook. \"In the court of law, this is small ball and very difficult to prove.\"\n\"You'd have to establish not only that she filled out the form incorrectly, but she had the specific intent to deceive, to defraud banks, as opposed to just making a mistake,\" he said.\nDuring fiscal year 2024, 38 mortgage fraud offenders were sentenced in the federal system, according to the United States Sentencing Commission's interactive data analyzer. That number is up slightly from 34 offenders in 2023, but down from 426 offenders in 2015, the earliest date in that tool's dataset. The U.S. Sentencing Commission data does not break out the types of mortgage fraud.","content_hash":"a3e415e1113daaa26c66d64136d096b3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4852,"method_rank":0}

Its lineup of electric vehicles (EVs) has made it a highly regarded brand known to be at the cutting edge of design and innovation. Shares have performed very well in the past, although they trade 30% below their peak (as of Aug. 22).\nMaybe it's time for investors to look elsewhere. Is this other auto stock, which has climbed 143% in the past five years, a better investment than Tesla over the next five years?\nThe bear case for Tesla\nTesla might be a trillion-dollar business these days, but there's no shortage of reasons for investors to worry. Growth has taken a hit, with deliveries and revenue down 13% and 12%, respectively, year over year in Q2 (ended June 30). Higher interest rates don't help, as they make cars less affordable. What's more, competition remains stiff; Tesla is no longer the only EV game in town, with both domestic and international rivals making their presence felt in the industry.\nManagement has cut prices to maintain volumes, which eats into profitability. Tesla reported an operating margin of 16.8% in 2022. During the latest quarter, this metric fell to 4.1%. That's not a trend that investors want to see.\nOf course, the long-term thesis rests on Tesla introducing a global robotaxi service. If executed successfully, this could be a financial boon. But as things stand right now, the future is highly uncertain, with questions remaining about technical progress, regulatory changes, and user adoption.\nBringing luxury to the auto sector\nIt might be a good idea for investors to turn their attention to Ferrari(NYSE: RACE). This isn't your typical car company. It's essentially a top luxury brand that sells extremely expensive vehicles, with some models going for millions of dollars. The business intentionally keeps a limit on production and deliveries, with the main goal being to support the brand and maintain a level of exclusivity.\nFerrari sold just 3,494 units in Q2. Compare this to a mass-market automaker like Ford, which sells a much greater number of vehicles. Even Tesla, which is a premium brand, sells far more cars than Ferrari.\nFerrari's growth isn't turning heads, but it's solid and dependable. Revenue increased 4.4% during the second quarter, and it was 82% higher than in the same period of 2019.\nWhat makes Ferrari special comes further down the income statement. The company reported a Q2 operating margin of 30.9%. That's in line with well-known consumer brand Apple. And it's light years ahead of what Tesla registers.\nBeing able to flex its pricing power is a key strategic advantage. Ferrari can raise the prices of its vehicles, and demand will still be robust, as has been the case historically. The company is basically catering to the wealthiest people on the planet. They aren't necessarily concerned about tightening their budgets. It's all about showcasing their status, something that owning a Ferrari helps with. This should be true even in a recessionary scenario.\nFerrari shares are much cheaper than Tesla's. The former trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 48.8, while the latter trades at a sky-high 195.5 multiple. It seems Tesla is always expensive, as investors buy into whatever Elon Musk says. This makes it a story stock. Investors might never get to buy Tesla at a bargain valuation.\nTo be clear, Ferrari shares aren't cheap. But given its durable performance in any economic scenario, steady growth, and incredible profits, I view it as the better stock to own over the next five years.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

But I don't think it's worth getting off this ride now -- particularly as Nvidia's all-important quarterly earnings are around the corner.\nThe backdoor issue\nThe new developments are connected to Nvidia's H20 high-functioning chips, which the company had made specifically for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips. The chips have been in the news a lot this year. You may remember that in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia disclosed it took a $4.5 billion inventory charge because export restrictions prevented it from selling the H20 chips.\nThen this summer, Nvidia struck a deal with the Trump administration that would open the Chinese markets to them in exchange for 15% of revenues from the H20 sales.\nWhile the export restrictions seem to be handled, Nvidia is now facing additional problems from Beijing. China reportedly asked tech companies and AI developers not to use the H20 chips, particularly for government purposes. Beijing also approached Nvidia to ask if the chips have tracking technology that would allow them to be operated remotely. CEO Jensen Huang said the company assured the Chinese government that backdoors do not exist, but the discussions are continuing.\n\"As you know, [Beijing] requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20s, for some time and I've worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses, and so hopefully this will be resolved,\" he told reporters in Taiwan, according to CNBC.\nMedia outlet The Information reported Friday that Nvidia is now asking some of its suppliers, including Amkor Technology and Samsung. Reuters reported that Nvidia also asked Foxconn to stop H20 production.\nThat's news that could frighten investors -- Nvidia stock is up over 30% so far this year, and sentiment has been high that the resumption of H20 sales could further fuel returns.\nEarnings are around the corner\nNvidia and Huang will surely have a lot to say about the H20 issue when Nvidia reports its fiscal 2026 Q2 earnings after the closing bell on Aug. 27. Analysts at Yahoo! Finance are expecting earnings per share of $1.01, versus $0.68 per share a year ago. The consensus revenue estimate is $46.12 billion, up 53% from the same quarter a year ago.\nNvidia is a powerhouse because of its overwhelming power in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it's estimated to have more than 90% of the market share. And as some of the company's biggest customers said they intend to increase spending in their data centers to further power the AI and advanced computing platforms, Nvidia appears to be in a solid position for this week's report -- even without the Chinese H20 sales.\nIn fact, I'm suggesting that Nvidia's plan to scale back production, even temporarily, is a good one. The company already has billions of dollars in H20 inventory and took a huge charge in the first quarter because it wasn't able to move the product. Why keep building when roadblocks keep popping up in Washington and now Beijing?\nAnalysts surely aren't concerned. In fact, many increased their price targets on Nvidia stock in recent days.\nSource: Yahoo! Finance\nI'm fully expecting a solid earnings report on Aug. 27, but like other investors, I'll be keenly interested in the H20 developments. When Nvidia is finally able to freely sell in China, it will be another tailwind for the biggest publicly traded company on the planet. But it's not the only positive catalyst for Nvidia stock.\nShould you buy stock in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The design software developer for disrupting digital collaboration soared during its first day trading last month, briefly clearing above a $55 billion valuation. Volatility has been the norm since then, as the stock has declined by close to half its peak. Piper Sandler initiated coverage on the stock last week on Wednesday at an “Overweight” rating and at an $85 price target, citing healthy growth patterns and secular tailwinds in digital design.\nThe timing comes amid heightened scrutiny of newly minted IPOs, many of which have struggled after early euphoria. While the S&P 500 ($SPX) has advanced steadily this year, investors in growth software names are navigating higher risk and reward swings. Against that backdrop, Figma is trying to prove it can convert hype into sustained growth, leveraging a large user base and early moves in AI-driven design.\nFigma (FIG) builds cloud design and collaboration software to enable real-time co-creation by teams. The San Francisco, California-based company competes in the wider SaaS and digital design sector, going up directly against Adobe (ADBE) and other productivity apps. With a recent market value of roughly $35.5 billion, Figma has rapidly become one of the biggest publicly traded design-centric software companies.\nShares have ranged from $67 to $142.92 in the past 52 weeks, with a current market capitalization of $37 billion. At Friday's close at $77.30, FIG remains well off IPO highs, lagging its group peers and the S&P 500 Index, up about 25% in the same time frame.\nAs of about mid-trading day Monday, FIG stock is down over 7%.\nValuation is complicated given the company's growth trajectory. On trailing metrics, Figma in the previous year generated $1.16 billion in revenue and $180.6 million in net income. That translates to a lofty enterprise value-to-sales multiple of around 30x, well in excess of the typical software peers. Analysts argue, however, that at ARR near $1 billion a decade after launch and free cash flow (FCF) expected to grow towards 30% by 2030, investors are paying for good growth optionality rather than near-term margins.\nFigma does not currently pay a dividend, and management has indicated that cash flow will be reinvested into expansion initiatives, including AI product rollouts and international growth.\nFigma to Report Q2 Earnings on September 3\nMost recently, Figma posted quarterly revenue of $228.2 million and net income of $8.6 million. Wall Street will be watching intently when the company posts Q2 2025 results on Sept. 3. Of greatest concern will be ARR growth, conversions from the free to the paid customer base, and whether new price changes introduced earlier in the year (a 20% to 33% increase in full-seat prices) are the reason for top-line acceleration.\nManagement has highlighted multiple growth levers beyond pricing: cross-selling new products, monetizing its 25 million monthly visitors and 13 million active users, and expanding globally. The company is also in the early innings of embedding AI into its platform. While ambitious product launches could temporarily pressure margins, Piper Sandler believes they position FIG for long-term upside.\nWith the volatility typical of the recent IPOs, investors can expect to see swings leading up to earnings. And with FIG stock down by almost half from the highs, September's execution can determine the direction for the next leg.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for FIG Stock?\nCoverage of FIG is still limited, but Piper Sandler’s initiation sets the tone. The firm issued an “Overweight” rating with an $85 price target, suggesting modest upside of about 10% from current levels. While only two firms have published targets so far, Wall Street generally views FIG as a high-growth SaaS company in the early stages of scaling monetization.\nFurther, Piper Sandler analyst Brent Bracelin projects ARR could triple to more than $3 billion by 2030 while FCF margins expand toward 30%. That long-term outlook contrasts sharply with near-term volatility, leaving investors to decide whether to stomach the swings in pursuit of outsized gains.\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The stock's reaction will have an influence on just about anything related to equities, but no ETF will be affected more than the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) . The implications will be substantial, and it deserves our attention from a chart perspective. First, the ETF has barely moved since early July, with false breakout and breakdown attempts having taken place various times over the last few weeks. This can best be categorized as a six-week trading box. Notably, SMH has done a good job capitalizing on two prior digestive phases (also trading boxes), both of which turned into continuation patterns within the larger uptrend. Said uptrend all started with SMH first blasting through a cup-and-handle pattern that developed from April to early May. If that looks familiar, it should: the S & P 500, NDX, and hundreds of other ETFs and stocks surged from a similar pattern, setting the stage for the uptrend that has since followed. Simply put: for SMH's uptrend to continue now, we'll need another breakout from this trading box again. Turning to the weekly chart, it's clear that from the April low through the recent high, SMH has gained approximately 75%. In 2020, SMH also hit the 75% mark in early August. Needless to say, the two periods couldn't be more aligned at this stage – both times, explosive rallies commenced after the ETF logged monstrous pivots, which came after preceding, historic volatility. Back in 2020, SMH then spiked into the end of August before the September market correction hit. As we know, that volatile trading period only slowed SMH briefly on its way to an ultimate 230% advance. This remains a viable blueprint for SMH, with it still percolating near its summer highs in front of tonight's event. Zooming much further out, we see that with SMH breaking out to new all-time highs recently, the ETF also logged its sixth multi-year pattern breakout, best viewed on the monthly log chart. Each of the prior five times, the ETF extended from the breakout zone for months — sometimes, years. In other words, if SMH were to undercut its recent breakout zone soon after blasting above it this time, it would mark a clear change of behavior from what we've seen consistently since 2013. Lastly, here is the relative chart of SMH vs. the XLK Technology Sector. The ratio line is close to breaking out of a potential, nearly, two-year bullish inverse Head & Shoulders pattern. The last time that occurred was early 2024, which led to six months of noticeable SMH outperformance. This is important for a few reasons. First, Semiconductors is the biggest group within the Technology sector with a 36% weighting (software is a close second at 35%). That means that Semiconductors also have the largest weighting in the S & P 500 at 13%. NVDA, of course, is the biggest component of all three (SPX, SMH and XLK). So, putting it altogether, a continued advance in NVDA would help the stock, SMH, XLK and broader market all break out. And when SMH outperforms XLK, the SPX, and equities as whole, all get a tail wind. This truly shows how important the stock and SMH ETF both are for this uptrend to continue. — Frank Cappelleri Founder: https:\/\/cappthesis.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

The federal government's 10% stake in Intel does not come with a board seat or any governance rights. But Uncle Sam's financial backing could still steer the chipmaker in directions that ultimately harm the interests of shareholders.finter \"Based on what we know so far, we don't consider this to be a positive for INTC shareholders,\" Wolf Research equity analyst Chris Caso, who covers the semiconductor industry, told his clients this week. Intel has essentially become a vehicle for U.S. industrial policy and investors will be taken along for the ride, Caso said. The chipmaker is now locked into a path where it will be forced to invest in manufacturing capacity even if demand hasn't materialized and the return on investment is low, he said. \"While this deal provides INTC with the cash it needs to invest and to keep the business afloat, it won't improve the ROI of that investment,\" Caso said. The market is also not that enthusiastic with Intel's stock up less than 3% since the Trump administration announced its investment last Friday. Capital discipline Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan had promised investors that he would be more prudent with the chipmaker's capital and spend money on new manufacturing capacity only when he can ensure a solid return. \"I do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it, they will come,\" Tan said on Intel's July earnings call, before the government bought an equity stake. \"Under my leadership, we will build what customers need, when they need it, and earn their trust to consistent execution.\" Tan's promise of capital discipline is likely no longer the case given government's stake in Intel, Caso said. Many investors were hoping Intel would divest some of its manufacturing and focus more on designing chips, Loop Capital managing director Gary Mobley told clients this week. But Uncle Sam's stake comes with an agreement that incentivizes Intel to keep majority ownership of its foundry business, Mobley said. \"There is a protective covenant as part of the U.S. investment that incentivizes INTC to retain majority ownership of INTC, so don't expect an imminent separation of INTC Products from INTC Foundry,\" Mobley said. Intel's own warning Intel this week disclosed to investors the risks it sees from the deal. The chipmaker warned in a filing that the U.S. government stake could hurt its international sales, which accounted for 76% of the company's revenue on 2024. Intel might now face more regulations, obligations or restrictions when operating in other countries, it said. Intel acknowledged that \"it is difficult to foresee all the potential consequences\" given that there are so few recent precedents for the U.S. taking an equity stake in a publicly traded company. \"There could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors,\" Intel told investors in the filing. \"There may also be litigation related to the transaction or otherwise and increased public or political scrutiny with respect to the Company.\" The bull case for Intel would be the Trump administration pressuring chipmakers to use Intel as a foundry, Caso said. But this is bad policy and difficult to achieve, he said. \"Forcing US chipmakers to use a foundry they otherwise wouldn't have will reduce their competitiveness, and would also represent a bad deal for shareholders of INTC's foundry customers,\" he said. The U.S. government stake doesn't solve Intel's fundamental problems, TD Cowen's Joshua Buchalter told clients this week. Intel's technology is viewed by customers as lagging behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing . \"Net, it remains difficult for us to gain confidence in the immediate and long-term path forward,\" Buchalter said. \"Roadmaps and customer confidence are not (re)built overnight, and the strategy seems very much in flux.\"","content_hash":"73be3c0cd71903ed2fbbb8ce16d89e29","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4116,"method_rank":0}

It said the agency's \"current trajectory\" under President Donald Trump \"reflects a clear departure\" from the intent of the post-Katrina overhaul, adding they meant to \"sound the alarm\" to their superiors at the agency, Congress and the public.\nThe agency's current and former head lacked \"legal qualifications, Senate approval, and the demonstrated background required of a FEMA Administrator,\" the letter said. The decisions those leaders and Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem have made \"erode the capacity of FEMA and our State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) partners, hinder the swift execution of our mission, and dismiss experienced staff whose institutional knowledge and relationships are vital to ensure effective emergency management,\" it said.\nThe authors said Noem's requirement that her office review agency expenditures of more than $100,000 had slowed response times, which contributed to delays in assignments during the deadly flooding in Kerrville. They also expressed outrage over cuts to risk reduction efforts, what they said was interference with preparedness programs aimed at helping state and local partners, the censorship of climate science and the significant decline in FEMA's workforce.\nMore from NBC News\nTransportation Department announces plans to take over D.C.'s Union Station\nSen. Susan Collins heckled by protesters at Maine ribbon-cutting event\nTrump says the U.S. would accept 600,000 Chinese students, sparking uproar among some conservatives\nThe Washington Post first reported that employees involved in the letter had been placed on leave.\nReached for comment on the letter, a FEMA spokesperson said it was \"not surprising\" that \"the same bureaucrats who presided over decades of inefficiency are now objecting to reform.\"\n\"Change is always hard. It is especially for those invested in the status quo, who have forgotten that their duty is to the American people not entrenched bureaucracy,\" the spokesperson said. \"Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, FEMA will return to its mission of assisting Americans at their most vulnerable.\"\nDelwalla said that the decision to put employees on leave \"underscores the many issues these public servants described in their declaration and their bravery in standing up for Americans in need.\"\n\"Once again, we are seeing the federal government retaliate against our civil servants for whistleblowing — which is both illegal and a deep betrayal of the most dedicated among us,\" Delwalla added. \"DHS said that these employees are simply 'afraid of change' which is an insult to anyone working at FEMA, the agency directly responsive to rapidly intensifying and changing circumstances. Stand Up for Science is proud to have hosted their Katrina Declaration and we stand by the FEMA 36.\"\nIn addition to targeting FEMA with severe cuts, the Trump administration has sent mixed messages about whether the agency should continue to exist. The president said in June that he wanted the federal agency to wind down after the hurricane season ends. Just a few weeks later, in June, Noem said on NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that Trump didn't want the agency to be eliminated but to undergo an overhaul.","content_hash":"d7c7d7ed96846acd4a272a281ca6c455","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3964,"method_rank":0}

Economic data has been mixed and the path of future monetary policy is up in the air, while unresolved events continue to unfold in Washington, D.C., he said. In addition to the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts in September, President Donald Trump 's attempt to fire Fed Board of Governors member Lisa Cook has added to the unpredictability, he noted. \"What I'm trying to do is really lean into strategies to generate income that I feel highly confident in, regardless of what happens in terms of the economic environment, regardless of what happens in Washington or monetary policy,\" said Chang, senior portfolio manager on the Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond Fund , as well the Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond ETF . The former is rated four stars by Morningstar. A-shares, available to individual investors, have a 5.25% 30-day SEC yield and 0.45% expense ratio. The latter, launched in June, has a 30-day SEC yield of 5.45% and a 0.3% expense ratio. VGMS mountain 2025-06-09 Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond ETF since its June 9 inception The funds aim to gain broadly diversified exposure across the credit spectrum and hold Treasurys, corporate bonds and emerging-market securities. Being selective In this environment, Chang is shying away from large sector bets and focusing more on single name and country selections. While he is also co-head of the firm's high-yield group, he doesn't think investors are necessarily being paid to take risk in junk bonds right now. \"While we're positive on corporate fundamentals here in the U.S. and generally constructive on macro policy, spreads are pretty tight, probably tighter than they should be,\" he said. \"So we'd be tilting the portfolio a little bit more towards having a higher quality bias.\" Nearly 30% of the Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond Fund is in BB-rated assets, the higher end of the high-yield market. It holds 23% of the portfolio in BBB bonds, which is the lower end of the investment-grade market. Those are the two largest allocations. VMSIX YTD mountain Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond Fund year to date Generally speaking, Chang is leaning more towards non-cyclical defensive sectors, such as health care and utilities, that should hold up even if the economy weakens. Beneath the surface Within high yield, he's finding opportunities when looking beneath the surface. \"If you drill down one or two levels, you'll see a fair amount of dispersion in terms of how companies are doing [and] how certain sectors are doing,\" he said. For his investment grade assets, he's focused on the front end of the curve. Other areas of opportunity include bank loans, which are pretty attractive right now, he said. \"[They are] higher up in capital structure, a little bit safer in general than high yield and offer pretty attractive carry with, [in] today's environment, pretty limited opportunity cost because of where high yield is trading,\" Chang explained. His emerging market focus these days is on the middle part of the asset class, since valuations are really tight — especially in the highest quality bonds, he said. \"There's a decent amount of countries that we like, where you have governments that are more reform oriented and they offer pretty attractive carry,\" Chang said. For example, the fund holds government bonds issued by Mexico. This mix of assets across the spectrum gives the team flexibility at a time when it's important to stay nimble, he said. \"The ability to access a much wider opportunity set, that's always pretty valuable,\" he said. \"It's especially valuable in times like this where income is pretty hard to come by.\"","content_hash":"3df966617e0c3c7df1bc0a191bbe78a5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3735,"method_rank":0}

The protesters delivered a court summons notice at his office, according to a statement from the group.\n\"Obviously, when seven folks do as they did today — storm a building, occupy an office, block other people out of the office, plant listening devices, even in crude form, in the form of telephones, cell phones hidden under couches and behind books — that's not OK,\" Smith told reporters during a briefing.\n\"When they're asked to leave and they refuse, that's not OK. That's why for those seven folks, the Redmond police literally had to take them out of the building.\"\nSmith said that out of the seven people who entered his office, two were employees.\nWhile the company doesn't retaliate against employees who express their views, Smith said, it's different if they make threats. Microsoft will look at whether to discipline the employees who participated in the protest, Smith said.\nOnce inside Microsoft's building 34, the No Azure For Apartheid protesters demanded that the company cut its ties with Israel and ask for an end to the country's alleged genocide.\nTech's megacap companies are doing more work with defense agencies, particularly as demand increases for advanced artificial intelligence technologies.

The past month has seen significant swings in precious metals prices. Safe-haven demand drove several metals to multi-year highs in late July, followed by partial pullbacks in August as market winds shifted. Gold and silver, in particular, rallied on economic uncertainty, with gold briefly hitting record territory and silver reaching levels unseen since 2011. Precious metal trends and hedging advice is covered monthly in MetalMiner’s MMI Report.\nPalladium: July Spike Fades on Auto Demand Worries\nPalladium prices soared in July, rising over 13% for the month. The metal even reached a year-to-date high of about $1,288 per troy ounce on July 11. But by late August, palladium had retreated to roughly $1,100\/oz, giving back much of the summer’s gains.\nEven so, short-term sentiment isn’t all bearish. The recent U.S. rollback of EV tax credits could delay an electric transition and keep more gasoline hybrids on the road, modestly supporting palladium demand in the interim. Additionally, any supply hiccups, whether from Russian export snags or mining issues, could quickly tighten the market again.\nInvest in Gold\nOn balance, most sourcing professionals remain cautious. With palladium’s fortunes so tied to a cooling auto sector, many foresee continued price volatility or gradual declines.\nPlatinum: Rally Persists on Supply Deficit and Substitution\nPlatinum represents another standout for precious metals prices. Prices surged ~12% in July, before experiencing a slight pullback. Like gold, Platinum benefited from safe-haven buying as U.S. trade policy grew more unpredictable. Jewelry buyers and other consumers also jumped in. Indeed, with the gold-to-platinum price ratio at all-time highs, many jewelers substituted cheaper platinum for gold, boosting demand.\nNotably, platinum’s supply-demand fundamentals remain bullish. According to industry reports, the metal is in its third consecutive year of supply deficit in 2025 due to constrained mining output and steady industrial needs. Looking forward two months, many analysts expect platinum to remain well-supported.\nAuto-sector demand (for diesel and hybrid vehicle catalysts) and nascent growth areas like hydrogen fuel cells provide a diversified demand base that platinum-only suppliers can count on. Meanwhile, Bank of America recently emphasized platinum’s broader demand profile beyond autos, which represents a key distinction from palladium’s narrow focus.\nSilver: Near 14-Year Highs as Tight Supply Meets Safe-Haven Demand\nSilver has also enjoyed a stunning climb this summer. In late July, silver touched an intraday peak of $39.91\/oz, its highest level since 2011. Even though it has since eased back into the upper-$37 range, silver is still up roughly 30% year-to-date, outpacing even gold’s impressive gains. Again, several factors converged to fuel silver’s rally. As a precious metal, silver was able to ride gold’s coattails. According to HSBC analysts, record-high gold prices exerted a “strong gravitational pull” that lifted silver along with it.","content_hash":"22ee2d541709b98b451262e963b21d8c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3172,"method_rank":0}

United Capital Financial Advisors, for example, has more than 80% of its total AUM allocated to ETFs, while NISA Investment Advisors has less than 2%. The divide arises from the fact that many firms continue to rely heavily on mutual funds — a trend experts said will likely reverse in the coming years as ETFs become more mainstream.\nInvest in Gold\n“What I’m seeing with mutual fund issuers is they’re creating overlays. So it’s still the core strategies, but now they’re offered as an ETF,” said AdvizorPro’s Hesom Parhizkar, who contributed to the report. “[ETFs are] just a more agile vehicle.”\nREAD ALSO: SEC Enforcement Claims Tumble Almost 50% This Year and Music Festivals, UFC Fights.

That followed the SEC’s adoption of the ETF Rule, which allowed issuers to bring the strategies straight to market without obtaining an exemption. The number of ETFs has exploded, and early adopters are more likely to be all in, said Amrita Nandakumar, president of Vident Asset Management. “It does not surprise me that firms like Creative Planning and Hightower continue to be at the top of the list, as they were among the first RIA adopters of ETFs,” she said. Still, the fact that there are roughly twice as many mutual funds available has meant that certain firms haven’t had to “venture too far into ETFs,” she added.\nOther findings from the report include:\n-\nCaptrust, which had the highest AUM of any of the firms included, at more than $1 trillion, had less than 2% of its assets allocated to ETFs.\n-\nValmark Advisors was second to United Capital in terms of the proportion of its AUM allocated to ETFs, at 80%.\n-\nChurchill Management Group was third, at 77%.\nModera Wealth Management allocates roughly a third of its assets to ETFs, as many clients are in legacy mutual funds that they have no reason to sell, chief investment officer George Padula said.

There isn’t necessarily an ideological divide on ETFs, since things like mutual funds and alternatives might not be included in the public filings that the dataset is based on, Parhizkar said. The recent explosion in crypto ETF allocations has been “mind-boggling” and more a result of client demand than advisor recommendations, he added. “It’s much easier to buy [crypto] off of one the bigger custodians as an ETF vehicle, versus trying to set up a coin-based account and actually buy the underlying holding.”\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

The point was simple: never compromise what the customer experiences. That stance underpins See’s enduring franchise and illustrates a broader Berkshire doctrine — win on value, not gimmicks.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nA $10 Billion Reason to Buy This Quantum Computing Stock Now\n-\nThis 3X Leveraged QQQ ETF Is Warning Traders of the Next Major Move\nIn the same 1983 letter, he praised Nebraska Furniture Mart as the “ideal business” — one that passes savings to customers and converts trust into superior economics.\nFrom Quality to Moat\nFour decades of Buffett’s shareholder letters echo the same idea with different words: widen the moat. Berkshire looks for businesses with favorable long-term economics and durable competitive advantages, then invests with the intent to make that edge a little wider every day. Buffett and his longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, both believed explicitly that management’s job is to extend and improve products and service to strengthen the moat — an owner orientation that resists shortcuts and squeezes.\nThat philosophy rests comfortably alongside Buffett’s preference for brands and franchises whose value to customers, rather than their cost to produce, sets price — what he calls economic goodwill. See’s is his canonical example, offering high returns on modest tangible assets because the customer’s affection is the asset. In inflationary periods, he noted, true goodwill compounds — it’s “the gift that keeps giving.”\nCustomer-First Compounds Into Owner Value\nBerkshire’s customer-first ideology has scaled into one of the world’s largest public companies. As of mid-August 2025, Berkshire’s market value sits around $1.0 trillion — a testament to decades of reinvestment behind moats instead of chasing fads or financial engineering.\nAnd the culture shows up repeatedly in the letters:\n-\nProtect the franchise: If there’s a tradeoff between reported earnings and the long-term franchise with customers, Berkshire favors the franchise (e.g., See’s kept quality inviolable and worked costs elsewhere).\n-\nValue over optics: Accounting never dictates operations; intrinsic value does. Berkshire would rather own “$2 of earnings that is not reportable” than chase reported numbers, because customers and cash flows, not GAAP optics, sustain moats.\n-\nLow-cost, high-trust retailing: Nebraska Furniture Mart’s model — buy brilliantly, run lean, pass savings on — is quintessential Berkshire: customer surplus comes first, and owner surplus follows.","content_hash":"c28080e117a429dc6b950ffad580eb88","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3107,"method_rank":0}

The company manufactures mechanical thrombectomy devices designed to remove clots, and its innovation lies in the use of algorithms that modulate aspiration power when a clot is detected and control a separate valve that injects saline to reduce friction between the clot and the catheter. This combination allows for maximum clot removal while reducing the risk of blood loss, giving Penumbra a meaningful competitive advantage.\nThe thrombectomy market in the U.S. represents a large opportunity, with more than 1 million procedures annually across stroke and peripheral vascular segments and a total addressable market estimated at over $8 billion. Penumbra currently has only high single-digit penetration into this opportunity as of 2024, leaving significant headroom for expansion. The company is already gaining traction in the venous setting through its Flash product, and future growth could be catalyzed by the development of Thunderbolt, a device aimed at stroke treatment.\nA major potential inflection point is the Storm-PE trial, which completed enrollment this quarter and is evaluating CAVT plus anticoagulation against anticoagulation alone for intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism patients. If the trial demonstrates superiority, Penumbra could drive a paradigm shift in pulmonary embolism treatment and significantly expand its market. With early momentum, underpenetrated markets, and a clinical trial that could transform the standard of care, Penumbra represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Penumbra, Inc. (PEN) by northeasternsvf in November 2024, which highlighted CAVT technology, market expansion, and international approvals.

Despite a solid product portfolio addressing critical enterprise needs, the company’s growth trajectory has been moderate, with a three-year revenue CAGR of 10.3%, falling short of the desired 20.3% target implied by a reverse DCF analysis.

Investors are advised to monitor the company’s ability to scale its platform, drive adoption, and capitalize on the growing enterprise cybersecurity and data protection market before considering a meaningful entry.

This suggests an implied expected value of +135%, even when conservatively assuming a complete loss in the 10% downside scenario. The company is focused on reopening an old oilfield located in federal waters off the coast of California, a site previously operated by Exxon for decades before operations were halted due to an onshore pipeline leak.\nThe existence of oil reserves is not in question, and the investment thesis hinges on the resumption of production once the pipeline is brought back online. The primary obstacle has been persistent litigation from environmental groups, which has delayed the process through legal challenges. However, recent developments suggest that opposition is running out of viable avenues, and court proceedings are expected to conclude in the near term. If litigation is resolved and the pipeline is restarted, SOC’s stock should re-rate as the company begins to generate production and revenue, driving material value creation.\nWhile timing remains uncertain—it could be as soon as August or delayed into 2026—the asymmetry of risk and reward remains highly favorable. Investors face the possibility of capital loss, but the combination of visible reserves, strategic positioning, and a clear operational pathway create a compelling setup.

On Monday, Intel filed documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing a series of potential risks tied to the government's possible investment.\nIntel warned that the deal faces multiple uncertainties, and that having the U.S. government as a major shareholder could create additional risks. The company said the transaction could trigger negative reactions from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, and business partners, and could also lead to litigation.\nOne key concern is international sales. Intel reported that 76% of its revenue in fiscal 2024 came from outside the U.S. If the U.S. government were to become a major shareholder, the company could face tougher regulations or restrictions in foreign markets.\nIntel also noted that the deal could dilute the interests of existing shareholders.\nBy the close of trading overnight, Intel shares had fallen more than 1%.\nDespite these warnings, the Trump administration has shown no signs of backing down. In fact, Trump posted on social media overnight, saying he intends to pursue more deals like the one with Intel.\nTrump wrote on social media: \"I paid zero for Intel, is worth approximately 11 billion dollars. All goes to America. I will make deals like that for our country all day long.\"\nOn Monday, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told CNBC that the government will not interfere in Intel's operations. He also revealed that the transaction reflects a broader strategic goal the Trump administration is pursuing.\nKevin Hassett\nDirector of the U.S. National Economic Council\n\"The president has made it clear all the way back to the campaign, he thinks that in the end, it would be great if the U.S. could start to build up a sovereign wealth fund. So I'm sure that at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries.\"\nOvernight, several market participants told CNBC they were more concerned than optimistic.\nAnalysts point out that Intel's core challenge lies in reviving its manufacturing business, and government ownership does little to address that — while adding new complications.\nJames Pethokoukis\nAEI Economic Policy Analyst\n\"You're creating new problems by creating companies which seem dependent on on the government which may have policy making Now, part of their politics, part of their policy making. I can see plenty of downsides.

Respecting boundaries is another.\nConversely, there are red flags it's worth looking out for when you're dating to ensure you're not starting a relationship with someone who could hurt you or make you miserable.\nIn fact, the No. 1 trait that says it's time to end things with a partner is \"somebody who lacks empathy,\" says psychotherapist and author of \"13 Things Mentally Strong Couples Don't Do,\" Amy Morin.\nHere's why.\n'They might minimize how you feel or dismiss it'\nA lack of empathy is often described as callous, cold-hearted, and even narcissistic. A person who exhibits this trait won't be able to understand or envision how you feel, Morin says. And they might not even care.\n\"They might minimize how you feel or dismiss it,\" she says. They'll say, \"you're just being dramatic or they'll tell you that you shouldn't get so upset about something so minor.\"\nA partner who lacks empathy will also blame you for how situations unfold. They'll tell you, for example, \"it's your fault that you feel that way,\" says Morin, \"or it's not my fault if you can't do this because you have too much anxiety.\"\nPeople who lack empathy are also very self-centered and a relationship with one can be exhausting and suffocating.\n\"They're only thinking about what they want,\" Morin says. \"they just can't take into consideration how their behavior affects you or affects anyone else around them.\"\nA lack of empathy, while uncommon, is a red flag\nThere are various conditions that could cause this trait in a person, Morin says. For example, people with narcissistic personality disorder have it, as well as some people with autism. Those who suffer from depression might even exhibit it at times.\nBut a lack of empathy isn't all that common, Morin says. Regardless, it is a huge red flag. Dating or being in a relationship with someone who behaves this way could result in a lot of pain, anger and frustration.\nIf you feel like the person you're with never checks in about your feelings or consistently dismisses your emotions when you raise them, it might be time to leave, Morin says.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

That ship's sailed.\"\nLast week, Trump announced the administration had begun an investigation into furniture imports. Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that the inquiry would be completed within the next 50 days and that furniture from abroad would be subject to tariffs \"at a rate yet to be determined.\" He said this action would bring the furniture business back to states like North Carolina, South Carolina and Michigan.\nBut to Cramer, it's unlikely those states will return to being hubs of furniture production because the U.S. has favored a cheaper import supply chain for years. This system is \"the bargain of globalization,\" he said, where the U.S. sacrificed domestic jobs in exchange for inexpensive goods.\nHe pinpointed Wayfair, RH and Williams-Sonoma as leading furniture makers that source heavily from other countries.\nCramer mentioned that Wayfair in particular does the bulk of its manufacturing abroad, suggesting that higher tariffs would only lead to price hikes on products, not a resurgence of domestic production. While RH and Willams-Sonoma are taking steps to increase domestic manufacturing, Cramer said it is difficult for them to find skilled labor that can make high-quality items. He suggested U.S. workers who made furniture have \"simply moved on to other things, or they retired,\" and tariffs won't be enough to bring them back.\nHowever, he said tariffs could actually bode well for Ethan Allen, which has said it makes 75% of its products domestically. The furniture company might be at an advantage if it keeps prices low while competitors implement hikes to compensate for tariffs, Cramer said. But that dynamic isn't likely to make a big difference in the long run, he suggested.\nWhile the federal investigation was launched under a national security statute, Cramer said he doesn't think furniture trading necessarily fits into that category. He suggested it's more important to U.S. security to make goods like semiconductors or rare earth minerals domestically.\n\"At the end of the day, I'm skeptical that we can bring back the American furniture industry as we remember it, and even if we could…would it be worth the cost?\" Cramer asked. \"I don't know.

Initially introduced to a token called Persistence (XPRT) by a psychic, Richardson encouraged Thomson to invest. The heiress ultimately placed more than $40 million into the asset, later expanding her holdings across at least a dozen cryptocurrencies.\nRichardson says she spent up to 20 hours a day managing the digital portfolio and executing trades. “Everything I did was based on her instructions, as part of her effort to minimize losses,” Richardson said.\nShe stored hardware wallets with Thomson’s funds in her home, at times in drawers and other unsecured locations.\nThomson disputes that she approved many of the transactions. According to a forensic investigation by consulting firm Guidepost Solutions, hired by Thomson, more than 450,000 trades were made with her funds over several months.\nMany were described as highly risky and not pre-authorized. Guidepost alleges Thomson’s total losses exceeded $80 million.\nTaylor Thomson Files Lawsuit\nThe fallout led to a legal dispute. In 2023, Thomson filed a lawsuit against Richardson and Persistence, seeking at least $25 million in damages. The complaint accused Richardson of misleading Thomson about the coin’s potential and failing to disclose a $783,702 XPRT “finder’s fee” she allegedly received.\nRichardson has denied wrongdoing and claims the investment decisions were made jointly. “There was never a formal contract between us—just a clear oral understanding, reaffirmed often, about what she wanted me to do on her behalf,” she said.\nThe dispute has since escalated to include counterclaims of defamation, with Richardson representing herself in court. The two have not spoken since 2022. Thomson’s lawyers continue to pursue asset recovery, while Richardson now drives for Uber and has applied for public assistance.This case shows how personal relationships can override basic controls when handling digital assets. Without written agreements or third-party oversight, informal crypto deals risk turning into high-stakes legal battles that blur financial and emotional boundaries.","content_hash":"c5e458de75ce33ca1af5025e446503e5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2968,"method_rank":0}

Is This a Once in a Lifetime Investment Opportunity?\nKey Points\n-\nBYD is setting ambitious international growth targets and building the infrastructure to get there.\n-\nThe company has been on a steady upward trajectory for years, yet its stock still trades at an investor-friendly price.\nFor years, investors have watched BYD (OTC: BYDDY) quietly transform itself from just another electric vehicle (EV) maker in China into a global powerhouse. The company is now on track to sell more EVs globally this year than Tesla, and it will be shipping those cars on its very own fleet of massive ocean carriers. With a goal of moving half its sales outside of China by 2030, BYD is charting its course for a true global expansion.\nFrom steady gains to global goals\nOver the past five years, BYD has been on a remarkably steady upward trajectory. Revenue, shipments, and global brand recognition compounded at a pace that would make most automakers envious. Yet despite that growth, investors can still pick up shares of BYD for $15. That's a surprisingly low buy-in in comparison to rival Tesla, especially for a company positioning itself as a dominant global automaker.\nOwning the high seas\nMost carmakers outsource logistics and pray for shipping slots. But BYD has taken a different approach. Though BYD continues to operate with traditional shipping contracts, its building its own fleet of seven car-carrying cargo ships so it can deliver vehicles to Europe and South America in a way that sidesteps costly bottlenecks and cuts out the middleman.\nIf you want proof of how serious BYD is about exports, it doesn't get much stronger than this investment in its own delivery fleet. The cost to build just four of its ships is estimated to be around $500 million. That's a significant investment that highlights just how committed the company is to this approach.\nStrategically sidestepping speed bumps\nOf course, ambition alone doesn't guarantee profits. BYD has been methodical about market entry, by balancing both tariffs and local politics. In Europe, it shifted manufacturing focus toward Turkey, where costs are lower and trade rules friendlier, while slowing down plans in Hungary. After the EU slapped higher tariffs on China-built EVs, BYD pivoted to shipping plug-in hybrids instead. This level of flexibility has positioned BYD to keep its European momentum alive while keeping showrooms stocked.\nDemand that's hard to ignore\nMeanwhile, global appetite for EVs keeps expanding. In South America, EV sales nearly doubled in Brazil during the first half of 2025, making it the fastest‑growing market in the region. Across Asia, sales of EVs in 2024 were up over 40% from 2023 as consumers adopt more affordable models. Western Europe just logged record-breaking registrations for EVs, helped by better charging infrastructure and the arrival of more affordable models.","content_hash":"8fbc5881f7529acd050450da4d213eb6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2943,"method_rank":0}

In less than three years, Sudhanshu Priyadarshi, CFO of Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP), was tapped for a chief executive role.\nKDP announced on Monday an agreement to acquire Amsterdam-based coffee-seller JDE Peet’s for about $18 billion. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026. Afterward, KDP (No. 284 on the Fortune 500) will split into two U.S.-listed companies: Priyadarshi will lead the coffee business, and current KDP CEO Tim Cofer will head the beverage business, with brands such as Dr Pepper, 7 Up, and Snapple. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of next year.\n“Sudhanshu has been a true partner of mine over the past two years,” Cofer said on a call with investors Monday morning. He described him as an “ambitious strategic thinker, a financially-minded operator, and an inspiring people leader.” Priyadarshi said in a LinkedIn post Monday that it’s an honor to be named the future CEO of the global coffee company.\nThe road from CFO to CEO\nPriyadarshi spent 14 years at PepsiCo in finance and strategy, including as CFO for Global R&D & Nutrition. He later served as global COO at Cipla, handling multiple M&A deals, and held senior finance roles at Walmart. Before joining KDP in November 2022, he was CFO of Vista Outdoor.\nKDP’s board chose Priyadarshi for his strong consumer packaged goods foundation at PepsiCo, extensive strategy and M&A experience—going through a spinoff will “feel natural to him,” Scott Simmons, co-managing partner at executive search firm Crist Kolder Associates, told me.\n“Most importantly, just a year after joining KDP as CFO, he was given responsibility for the $2 billion international business,” Simmons said.\nAs more finance chiefs move into CEO roles, Simmons added, Priyadarshi’s move into general management overseeing a significant P&L, combined with his experience since 2022 as a board member at Wabash National, are “textbook plays for growing a CFO into CEO.”\nMorningstar analyst Dan Su told me that, as CEO for the global coffee company, investors will focus on Priyadarshi’s global operational experience and ability to lead diverse teams.\nKDP itself was established in 2018 following the $18.7 billion merger of Keurig Green Mountain Coffee and Dr Pepper Snapple. This made it the most diversified enterprise in nonalcoholic “refreshment” beverages, with more than 125 brands as owner, investor, or distributor. This diversification helped the company weather shifts in consumer preferences.\nKDP’s acquisition of JDE Peet’s comes as coffee prices climb amid new trade wars and the recent 50% U.S. tariff on Brazilian imports, the world’s top coffee exporter. On Monday, the market initially disliked the move, sending KDP shares down as much as 11% and erasing billions in value. Still, analysts and Fortune’s Shawn Tully see Cofer’s strategy as a fundamentally sound long-term shift for the company.

The company now offers integrated omnichannel solutions, including point-of-sale, digital ordering, loyalty and engagement, operational intelligence, and payment processing, serving over 140,000 locations across 110+ countries.\nIts unified platform, powered by a single customer data set, creates a flywheel effect that reduces churn, expands cross-selling opportunities, and enhances customer stickiness, particularly among enterprise brands like McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Burger King. PAR’s recent acquisitions—including Stuzo, TASK Group, and Delaget—have broadened its addressable market to convenience and fuel retailers, international restaurants, and advanced analytics, while divesting non-core government operations has simplified the business structure.\nThe company is approaching cash flow positivity, with ARR growth of 15%-20% projected over coming years, generating operating leverage and long-term growth potential. PAR’s hardware complements its SaaS offerings, including POS terminals, drive-thru systems, and in-store peripherals, supported by extensive professional services such as implementation, training, and technical support. The company maintains strong competitive advantages through open integration, enterprise-grade solutions, AI-enabled product development, and long-standing relationships with major brands.\nWhile facing a competitive and rapidly evolving market, PAR mitigates supply chain risks and leverages R&D to maintain innovation and reliability. Overall, PAR represents a compelling investment case, with a growing unified platform, strong market positioning, and multi-year ARR expansion potential, offering significant upside as the company scales its SaaS, hardware, and professional services ecosystem.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Paylocity Holding Corporation (PCTY) by Francesco Ferrari in April 2025, which highlighted the company’s strong long-term growth, high operational efficiency, and ability to generate alpha with low volatility. The company's stock price has depreciated approximately by 3.15% since our coverage. This is because the thesis partly didn’t play out. The thesis still stands as Paylocity continues expanding its SaaS offerings. Shareholdersunite Essentials shares a similar bullish view but emphasizes its integrated SaaS and hardware platform, enterprise client base, and multi-year ARR growth potential.","content_hash":"b8402717925badef94a52cf222dbbf76","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2917,"method_rank":0}

What Does the Data Say About Buying NVDA Stock Here?\nChipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is scheduled to release its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending July 27, 2025), after the closing bell Aug. 27. All eyes will be on the company’s revenue and earnings per share, as well as guidance for the third quarter and the rest of the year.\nNvidia is the unquestioned leader in producing graphics processing units (GPUs) used in data centers to power the most sophisticated computing processes, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and large language models (LLMs). And now Nvidia received yet another glowing review as the company prepares its earnings report.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nA $10 Billion Reason to Buy This Quantum Computing Stock Now\n-\nThis 3X Leveraged QQQ ETF Is Warning Traders of the Next Major Move\nThe Latest From Wedbush\nWedbush Securities is arguably one of the best-known and respected research firms on Wall Street, particularly when it comes to tech stocks. The company is known for its bullish calls and has at times compared the AI-driven tech cycle to the Internet boom of 1996. Dan Ives, the company’s managing director and global head of technology research, is one of the most influential analysts covering tech stocks today.\nNow Wedbush is suggesting that Nvidia, which has grown to be the biggest publicly traded company in the world with a market capitalization of almost $4.4 trillion, could still have a massive growth opportunity with its GPUs.\n“When Nvidia reports earnings this week on Wednesday after the bell the tech world and Wall Street will be listening closely to every word from (CEO) Jensen (Huang) as we continue to believe from our Asia field checks that demand to supply is 10:1 for Nvidia's golden chips,” Wedbush analysts wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\nThat’s massive, particularly when you consider Nvidia’s massive revenue numbers today. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Nvidia recorded $44.1 billion, up 69% from the previous year. And it would have been even more had U.S. export restrictions not prevented Nvidia from selling its H20 chip in China. The company took a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter for excess inventory, and also was prevented from delivering $2.5 billion in chips that were already purchased.\nNvidia still isn’t selling those chips, although they’ve been the subject of a lot of discussion. This summer, Nvidia struck a deal with the Trump administration that would allow it to sell the H20 in exchange for 15% of the revenue from those sales. The H20 was created for the Chinese market specifically in response to U.S. restrictions. While it’s not as powerful as the Hopper H100, it still has high bandwidth memory and has been optimized to deliver 20% faster inference speeds on some large language model workloads.","content_hash":"a88ed4341da9af94c0bf80dcc79cb981","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2892,"method_rank":0}

I’ve always rented — is there even a point to buying now?\nRetirement often marks the beginning of a new chapter, though this chapter unfolds uniquely for each individual. Consider the life of a 68-year-old retiree in Sarasota, Florida — single, childless and thoroughly enjoying their independence. With comfortable rental accommodations and sufficient retirement income to support an active lifestyle of travel, fine dining and regular rounds of golf, this retiree exemplifies how the golden years can truly shine with freedom and fulfillment.\nWhile your vibrant social circle provides fulfillment, the absence of heirs has you wondering if property ownership is practical for your situation. The decision between buying and renting extends beyond the traditional homeownership dream — it's fundamentally about financial viability.\nDoes investing in real estate make economic sense for you?\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n-\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n-\nWant an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nDo the numbers add up?\nBased on data from RentCafe, renting a two-bedroom condo in Sarasota costs approximately $2,079 monthly, totaling $24,948 annually. To purchase a similar property, you would need around $380,000, as reported by Sarasota Magazine.\nIf you make a 50% down payment of $190,000 and finance the remaining amount at the current average 30-year fixed mortgage rate of approximately 6.5% (according to Freddie Mac), your monthly payment would be around $1,200 for principal and interest. This calculation doesn't include additional costs such as property taxes or condo fees.\nAt first glance, purchasing a home might seem like the more economical choice compared to renting – but let's take a closer look. Before jumping to conclusions, we should examine the complete monthly financial picture to ensure we're accounting for all costs:\n-\nHOA fees range from $200 to $450 in Sarasota, so let’s meet in the middle and say you’re paying $300 a month.\n-\nMonthly property taxes are about 0.74% across Florida according to Tax Foundation, which works out to roughly $235.\n-\nCondo insurance will be roughly $52, based on the average yearly cost of $624 that Insurance.com lists for the area.\n-\nDon’t forget to put aside money for maintenance and repairs. It’s recommended to save 1 to 4% of your home value each year — 1% for newer houses and closer to 4% for older homes. In this case, let’s say you’re looking at a new build, which comes to about $300 a month.","content_hash":"22cea929172b8561d6122e16e58faead","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2890,"method_rank":0}

Nvidia – Shares of the chip giant fell more than 3%. The company's second-quarter results beat on the top and bottom lines, posting adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share and $46.74 billion in revenue. That's compared with the $1.01 per share and $46.06 billion, respectively, that analysts surveyed by LSEG were anticipating. Data center revenue tallied $41.1 billion. Although that marked a 56% increase year over year, it missed the StreetAccount estimate of $41.34 billion. Snowflake – Shares jumped about 12% on the heels of the data cloud and artificial intelligence company posting better-than-expected second-quarter results. Snowflake earned 35 cents per share, after adjustments, on revenue of $1.14 billion, above the profit of 27 cents per share and $1.09 billion in revenue that analysts were expecting. Its third-quarter guidance was also upbeat. NetApp – The stock fell more than 6% after the intelligent data infrastructure company's first-quarter results just barely beat expectations. The company earned $1.55 per share, excluding items, and $1.56 billion in revenue, while analysts were looking for $1.54 per share and $1.55 billion in revenue, according to LSEG. Its outlook was also roughly in line with analyst estimates. CrowdStrike Holdings – The cybersecurity provider tumbled almost 8% postmarket after its second-quarter non-GAAP operating margin reached 21.8%, down from 23.5% a year ago, according to FactSet. While second-quarter results topped Street estimates, CrowdStrike said third-quarter revenue would total $1.21 billion to $1.22 billion, lower than the LSEG consensus estimate of $1.23 billion. Urban Outfitters – The apparel retailer's stock tumbled nearly 8% despite fiscal second-quarter results that were better than expected. The company earned $1.58 per share, or 10 cents more than Wall Street predicted. Revenue of $1.5 billion topped the $1.48 billion estimate, with growth at both its Free People and Anthropologie brands. Urban's stock has climbed more than 42% year to date. Pure Storage – The data management company's stock shot up more than 13% after fiscal second-quarter results solidly outpaced estimates. Pure Storage earned 43 cents per share, excluding items, on revenue of $861 million. Analysts surveyed by LSEG predicted the company would earn 39 cents per share on $847 million in revenue. Nutanix – The cloud computing company's stock fell 5% despite reporting fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped estimates. Nutanix said it expects first-quarter revenue to be between $670 million and $680 million, compared with an LSEG estimate of $679 million. It projected revenue for the fiscal year of $2.9 billion to $2.94 billion, while analysts estimated $2.92 billion on average. — CNBC's Christina Cheddar Berk and Scott Schnipper contributed reporting.","content_hash":"729a3dfbeb6e174a25e939f267ecbb67","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2880,"method_rank":0}

The share of outlook downgrades, at 14%, is the lowest in the firm’s data going back to 2015.\n“There’s basically no reason that a management team would want to raise guidance on something that they’re not 100% positive on because they know the implications of that,” said Andrew Greenebaum, senior vice president of equity research product management at Jefferies. “I would argue that is a lot of what’s powering stocks higher.”\nThe benign revenue outlook from businesses is at odds with data that’s showing signs of labor weakness amid elevated inflation.\nCouple that with uncertainty about valuations that look rich by any estimate, and it’s clear why investor skepticism remains high. A closely watched survey from the American Association of Individual Investors shows more bets on stock-market losses than gains, while a separate survey from the National Association of Active Investment Managers, which tracks equity exposure among investment advisers, shows few signs of euphoria.\n“I don’t see something that says people are falling over themselves to risk up,” Greenebaum said.\nWhile US stocks surged on Friday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated in his speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that interest rate cuts are coming, the enthusiasm quickly fizzled to start this week amid concern over the challenges policymakers face in balancing rising prices and growing risks to the labor market.\nFed officials are contending with inflation that’s still above their 2% target and now rising, as well as employment data that’s showing signs of weakening. Uncertainty around how tariffs will impact each of those factors also looms large.\nYet Corporate America is showing few signs of worry.\nAn assessment of earnings transcripts by Morgan Stanley found that mentions of “order books” and “raise guidance” advanced to recent highs this quarter as companies readjusted their outlooks in the aftermath of the onset of a global trade war that flared in early April. Communications services, financials, consumer discretionary and information technology are S&P 500 sectors where per-share earnings outlooks were revised higher for both 2025 and 2026 in the past few months.","content_hash":"1117148dc7a807ad5e554021efe3d32b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2878,"method_rank":0}

The tie-up, however, is just the first step in Keurig Dr Pepper’s plans for a corporate breakup.\nREAD ALSO: Apple Hits the Jackpot as Google Ducks Antitrust KO and Macy’s Makeover Smoothes Out Earnings-Related Worry Lines for Investors\nThe Doctor (Pepper) Will See You Now\nAfter the JDE Peet’s acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper says it will split into two companies: one focused on coffee beverages (the Keurig and Peet’s side of the equation), and the other focused on soft drinks and sodas (Dr Pepper’s domain, along with brands like 7Up and Snapple). The split into two independently listed companies comes as the coffee and soft drink industries, broadly speaking, march in different directions. Soda sales have dropped considerably over the course of the health-conscious 21st century, while the coffee market has exploded.\nFor Keurig Dr Pepper, the shifting tastes have been a mixed bag. Its soft drink business is experiencing something of a revival: The company credited new soda flavors, like Dr Pepper Blackberry, for driving revenue up 11% year-over-year to $2.7 billion in its most recent quarter. Meanwhile, its coffee unit, which consists of both the at-home Keurig K-Cup business as well as the Green Mountain brand, has struggled in the ultra-competitive market. Worse, trade war developments this year are hurting its coffee business on two fronts:\n-\nEarlier this month, the White House imposed 50% tariffs on imported goods from Brazil — including ultra-popular arabica coffee beans; trading futures for the crop have surged about 35% so far this month.\n-\nMeanwhile, the company’s at-home K-Cup brewing machines are now more complicated and costly to produce, also thanks to tariffs. CEO Tim Cofer said last month that “tariff impacts will become prominent” in the second half of the year, with the coffee business’s performance likely to be “subdued.”\nJAB Left, JAB Right: Cofer said the company projects that folding in Peet’s will give the standalone coffee business $16 billion in global sales, in addition to $400 million in cost savings. The beverage unit is projected to have $11 billion in global annual sales. The tie-up isn’t too surprising, either, given that the two sides share some mutual parentage. European investment group JAB Holding is a controlling shareholder in JDE Peet’s as well as a minority shareholder in Keurig Dr Pepper.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to face headwinds, with investors cautious about near-term price performance amid macroeconomic volatility.\nMonth-to-date figures show this divergence: Bitcoin has posted net outflows of $1 billion, reflecting waning confidence, while Ethereum has managed to sustain inflows despite the broader risk-off sentiment.\nYear-to-date inflows for Bitcoin stand at just 11% of its total assets under management (AUM), lagging behind Ethereum.\nEthereum Shows Relative Resilience\nEthereum weathered the storm more effectively, with outflows limited to $440 million. Mid-week buying momentum helped offset initial pessimism, driving month-to-date inflows of $2.5 billion, compared with Bitcoin’s losses.\nEthereum’s rebound was reflected in its performance relative to AUM. CoinShares reported that inflows represented 26% of total Ethereum AUM, showing stronger institutional conviction in the asset’s long-term potential.\nThe relative resilience suggests that investors may view Ethereum as better positioned to benefit from dovish monetary indications and its evolving role in decentralized finance and staking markets.\nAltcoins Deliver Mixed Results\nFlows into alternative digital assets were varied, reflecting polarized investor appetite. XRP recorded the strongest gains, attracting $25 million, followed by Solana with $12 million and Cronos with $4.4 million.

Market update: Stocks are nudging higher for the second session in a row. Beyond some retail earnings and results from a couple of enterprise software names, there is no major news driving the market. That will change at around 4:20 p.m. ET when Nvidia's earnings results are released. The potential impact to Nvidia's earnings on the rest of the market could be far reaching — affecting other semiconductors and technology companies that play a role in the AI chip supply chain, the cloud hyperscalers that are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI, and the industrials such as Eaton and GE Vernova whose electrical and power generation equipment are necessary to support the data center buildout and their consumption needs. Key numbers for after the bell : Here are the consensus estimates compiled by LSEG that Nvidia will have to beat: In the fiscal second quarter, Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $46.06 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.01. For the fiscal third quarter, Nvidia is expected to guide revenue of $53.14 billion and gross margins of about 73.3%. Nvidia does not provide an adjusted earnings-per-share outlook. Club holding CrowdStrike also reports after the close. Here are the consensus estimates compiled by LSEG that the cybersecurity company will have to beat: In the fiscal second quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to report revenue of $1.15 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.83. For the fiscal third quarter, CrowdStrike is expected to guide revenue of $1.23 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.91. Up next: Earnings from Snowflake , HP Inc , Five Below , Agilent , and Urban Outfitters after the bell. Before the opening bell on Thursday, Best Buy , Dollar General , Dick's Sporting Goods , and Brown-Forman report.

Younger clients are expected to be more risk-tolerant since they are building wealth and have plenty of time to make corrections. “As you invest over time, you learn from your mistakes, and hopefully don’t make those same mistakes again,” Krugman told Advisor Upside.\nThat risk entails more than just heavy exposure to stocks over fixed-income, however. Nearly 55% of new investors said their portfolios were more diversified than their parents’. New investors’ top priority is building their financial knowledge, and the study showed that they are more familiar with advanced income-generation methods like fully paid lending, bond ladders and covered calls, while also favoring non-traditional assets like crypto and other alternatives. In fact, crypto can be a big indicator of a client’s mentality, the study found:\n-\nMore than half of crypto holders predict the stock market will perform better in the next 12 months, compared with just 31% of investors who don’t hold any crypto.\n-\nAlso, crypto investors are two times as likely to say their risk tolerance is higher than it was in 2024.\n“Regardless of a client’s age, it’s always important to help your clients develop a financial plan that they can stick to,” Krugman said.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

The company intends to list on Nasdaq under the ticker “MCGA.”\nNotably, all founding shareholders have agreed to a one-year lock-up on their holdings, followed by a three-year gradual release schedule.\nAccording to CryptoSlate’s data, CRO’s value jumped more than 21% to $0.19452 as of press time.\nCRO Treasury\nUnder the agreement, the new treasury will receive roughly $1 billion in CRO, equal to about 19% of the token’s market capitalization at the time of announcement.\nIn addition, partners plan to contribute $200 million in cash and another $220 million through warrant exercises. Yorkville has also arranged a $5 billion equity line of credit via an affiliate, providing a mechanism for further token purchases.\nThe company plans to stake its CRO assets to generate recurring revenue. According to executives, the goal is to create a “flywheel effect.” This means that as more CRO is acquired and staked, the token’s value could rise, enabling further fundraising and deeper integration across financial services.\nSpeaking on the deal, Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and CEO of Crypto.com, said:\n“The sheer size and structure of this project will encompass more than the entire current market capitalization of CRO, with the additional commitments of over $400 million in cash and a further $5 billion line of credit facility to acquire additional CRO.”\nIntegration within Trump Media\nThis partnership expands the link between Trump Media and the Cronos ecosystem.\nTruth Social, Trump Media’s social media platform, is expected to adopt CRO as its native token. Trump Media has separately disclosed $105 million worth of CRO purchases, while Crypto.com acquired $50 million of Trump Media shares.\nThese moves bring the group’s combined CRO exposure close to 7 billion tokens.\nDevin Nunes, the Chairman and CEO of Trump Media & Technology Group, said the deal proves that the firm continues to be “bullish on cryptocurrency.”\nHe added:\n“Financial markets are becoming increasingly digital every day, and companies of all sizes and sectors are strategically planning for the future by establishing digital asset treasuries anchored by assets that have created a comprehensive value proposition and are poised for even greater utility.”\nStay ahead of the crypto curve — subscribe to CryptoSlate's Substack newsletter now.","content_hash":"df070b4c9c6c9520a4064a737c2190d5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2820,"method_rank":0}

The billionaire encourages young people to spend their free time learning everything they can about AI—and how to teach older generations how to implement tools from OpenAI and Google. “That is every single job that’s going to be available for kids coming out of school,” he says.\nThe future of work can feel demoralizing for Gen Z as recent college graduates continue to struggle to find jobs, in part thanks to companies thinking they can outsource new talent to AI.\nHowever, in practice, 95% of all generative AI pilots are flopping, and it’s left a gaping opportunity for Gen X and baby boomer bosses to be taught how to actually implement the technology the right way. That’s where Gen Z can come in, according to Mark Cuban.\n“Learn all you can about AI, but learn more on how to implement them in companies,” the billionaire told TBPN last week, while adding that leaders don’t actually understand how to implement all of these new tools yet.\n“Learn to customize a model, walk into a company, show the benefits. That is every single job that’s going to be available for kids coming out of school.”\nThe 67-year-old emphasized that Gen Zers in their senior year of college—or high school even—should be spending any “excess time” they have learning the difference between AI-powered video generators, such as OpenAI’s Sora and Google’s Veo, and how to customize AI models. He stressed that they should be able to walk into any small business and immediately spot how AI could help.\n“There are millions of companies that have one, five, 10, 50, 100, 500 people that aren’t going to have AI budgets, that aren’t going to have AI experts. This is where kids get hired,” Cuban said.\nFortune reached out to Cuban for comment.\nEmbrace AI—or get left behind\nThe former Shark Tank star has long been an embracer of AI. Earlier this year, he said if he was a young person today, he’d spend every waking moment learning about AI—and would even listen to podcasts while sleeping to get ahead.\nAnd while he hasn’t gone as far as other business leaders to predict AI will help colonize the galaxy in just five years time, Cuban does believe it will soon become a baseline skill on par with email or Excel.\n“If you’re not using [AI] to move faster or make smarter decisions, you’re behind,” he told Fortune earlier this year.\n“[AI isn’t] just a tool, it’s leverage. If you’re not using AI to move quicker and make smarter decisions, you’re at a disadvantage,” Cuban added. “The most successful entrepreneur will understand how to properly use AI.”","content_hash":"cbefaa4c7359cd1feb6b35ad75c980f1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2815,"method_rank":0}

The reality, however, is that Americans aged 43 to 57 carry the largest amount of debt out of any age group — almost $1.45 trillion more than the next highest age group (27 to 42).\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nSo while it’s nice to dream about retiring at 58, exactly how realistic is it?\nWhat you’ll need to retire at 58\nRetirement looks different for everyone, so determining if you have enough money saved to retire by age 58 depends solely on your wants and needs. There are numerous online calculators to help you determine your specific retirement wealth requirements, but SmartAsset crunched some general numbers for retiring at age 58, while assuming a lifespan of 100 years.\nThe calculation, based on an average annual withdrawal of at least $50,000 (but likely more due to inflation) and an investment portfolio with a rate of 5% annual growth, showed that you’d need $1.34 million saved to retire at age 58.\nThose with pensions, or collecting Social Security when they become eligible, will add a bit more of a cushion to that. But still, that’s just your base, day-to-day living.\nAs Citizens Bank notes, “It's important to determine your post-retirement spending based on your expected lifestyle.”\n“Expected lifestyle” is the key phrase here. If you intend to spend your retirement traveling or indulging in other activities that may raise costs. For example, if you plan on joining a golf or country club, spending more on entertainment and eating out, or buying that dream car you always wanted — then you’ll need to have more money put away to accommodate that.","content_hash":"1d0062bd14f030c18875886e525f781c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2814,"method_rank":0}

Amin expects that HUMAIN will get approvals to buy semiconductors from Nvidia and other companies from the Trump administration, which has moved to loosen restrictions on chip exports to the Gulf.\n“After President Trump visited Saudi Arabia, I’m fairly confident that we have the right structure in place to achieve what we need to get done,” Amin said. Trump was accompanied on the visit by many of the US’ leading technology bosses, which “set the right tone” for boosting cooperation between the two countries, he said.\nKnow More\nHUMAIN launched its first consumer product on Monday, a large language model called HUMAIN Chat that operates in Arabic and English and that will form the foundation for other commercial applications the company will launch later this year.\nIts announcement follows similar moves by Abu Dhabi and Qatar to launch Arabic-language LLMs in a bid to position themselves as rival centers for AI.\nHUMAIN plans to develop 1.9 gigawatts of new data center capacity by 2030, expanding that to 6 GW by 2034. It hasn’t previously disclosed existing data center capacity. The company is in talks with Saudi Arabia’s energy minister and domestic power companies about securing the electricity needed for those facilities, Amin said, and has locked up the power it needs for a 100 megawatt data center to be delivered next year.","content_hash":"39ab9c5270421880535285c2a08a827f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2812,"method_rank":0}

Using the hospital’s digital slide archive, the company trained algorithms to flag potentially cancerous lesions in images.\nDive Insight:\nBy 2021, Paige had raised more than $220 million, received authorizations for software in Europe and the U.S. and landed deals with Philips and Quest Diagnostics. The company, which went on to partner with Microsoft, looked to build on the authorization of software for supporting the diagnosis of prostate cancer by developing AI tools for other tumor types. Paige continued to receive 510(k) clearances.\nThe company, which last disclosed a financing round in 2021, has accepted a buyout offer that is worth less than 40% of its publicly disclosed funding to date. Tempus will mostly pay for Paige in stock. The deal will also see Tempus assume Paige’s commitment under a Microsoft Azure cloud services agreement.\nTempus CEO Eric Lefkofsky said in a statement that buying Paige “substantially accelerates” his company’s effort to build the largest foundation model in oncology. Foundation models are AI neural networks trained on large datasets. The models provide a starting point for the development of AI tools that perform specific tasks.\nBuying Paige gives Tempus more data to train its model. Paige has already developed a foundation model for cancer using 1 million slides. In total, the company has almost 7 million digitized pathology slides and associated data from 45 countries. The dataset spans genders, races, ethnicities and regions.\nThe takeover is aligned with the M&A plan that Lefkofsky outlined on an earnings call two weeks before disclosing the buyout. Lefkofsky said he is happy with Tempus’ diagnostic portfolio and, as such, might look to do deals that enhance the data or apps businesses. Within those areas, Lefkofsky said Tempus was prioritizing deals that would not derail the company’s plans to become profitable.\n“We're not looking to move in a direction that would change our operating plan materially,” Lefkofsky said. “You should expect us to be disciplined in terms of what we acquire, you should expect it to be synergistic, plug some kind of hole within the company that we believe is strategic and important and not be some kind of crazy left turn that has us going backwards in massive ways.”","content_hash":"a0155effdd58ec64eef2833e8d4f900a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2812,"method_rank":0}

Crypto winter is a particularly painful type of bear market when prices drop for months on end and confidence in the entire asset class seems to evaporate.\nThe good news is that winters end. The bad news is that they always come back eventually. So, should investors expect hard times in crypto to be right around the corner?\nWinter is (probably) coming\nA crypto winter is best thought of as a long stretch of falling flat prices in major coins, alongside persistently pessimistic market sentiment that, on average, appears to be fully justified.\nThese periods tend to also be characterized by a large reduction in the amount of chatter related to cryptocurrency on social media, and much less news coverage from investment publications. Crypto winters can happen alongside any given set of macroeconomic conditions, but they have often coincided with economic turbulence or rising interest rates.\nThe most recent winter ran from early 2022 through roughly the third quarter of 2023. Although the Federal Reserve's rate-hiking regimen to fight inflation was responsible for causing much of the bearish conditions at the time, the market's difficulties were substantially exacerbated by the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in late 2022.\nHistorically, Bitcoin's (CRYPTO: BTC) halving, which occurs roughly every four years, has been followed by a surge to new highs, and then a deep winter. Bitcoin's peaks that followed halvings came in late 2013, December 2017, and November 2021, about 12 to 18 months after each halving.\nThe reason for Bitcoin playing such a large role in crypto winters is quite simple: The coin is on its own responsible for more than 50% of the entire sector's market cap. So when it stumbles, the fall is almost never contained and tends to spread to other coins.\nAnd when prices plummet, it has a way of delivering investors with some harsh clarity regarding what projects are actually delivering value, and which were more style than substance. Hence the tendency of crypto winters to extinguish entire market segments, chains, coins, and the portfolios of many aggressive investors.\nThe last winter's damage was enough to shake the conviction of cryptocurrency evangelists and tourists alike.\nBitcoin fell more than 70% from its 2021 high.

Analysts were expecting $41.3 billion, according to data from Bloomberg. Segment revenue was $26.2 billion in the prior-year period. The numbers didn't include sales of its lower-powered H20 chips into China.\nNvidia also noted that approximately 50% of its data center revenue came from large cloud service providers.\nShares in the AI leader fell more than 2% in early trading, after falling over 3% following its report Wednesday.\nNvidia reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.05 on revenue of $46.7 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $1.01 on revenue of $46.2 billion. The company reported adjusted EPS of $0.68 and revenue of $30 billion in the same quarter last year.\nNvidia projected Q3 revenue of $54 billion plus or minus 2%; expectations were for $53.4 billion. The company said its projections didn't include H20 sales. It also approved an additional $60 billion in stock buybacks.\nNvidia shares were up 35% year to date and over 40% over the past 12 months as of Wednesday afternoon. In July, the chipmaker became the first company to see its market capitalization top $4 trillion.\nNvidia's EPS and revenue growth have moderated over the past few quarters following the massive growth spikes it saw during the onset of the AI craze. Total revenue growth in its latest quarter came in at the slowest pace since the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024.\nNvidia CFO Colette Kress noted that data center compute revenue declined 1% sequentially as a result of a $4 billion reduction in H20 sales. Revenue in gaming, Nvidia's second-largest segment, hit $4.3 billion, above estimates.\nIn a statement, CEO Jensen Huang said production of its next-gen Blackwell chips \"is ramping at full speed, and demand is extraordinary.\"\n\"The AI race is on,\" Huang added, \"and Blackwell is the platform at its center.\"\nThe report comes after a flurry of moves between the company and the Trump administration, which first saw Trump revoke his prior ban on the sale of Nvidia's chips to China but now requires the AI giant to pay the government a 15% cut of sales into the country.\nTrump initially banned the sale of chips to China in April and dropped the ban in July, adding the 15% fee in August.\nTrump also announced he will place a 100% tariff on semiconductor shipments into the US unless companies commit to building in the country. Nvidia should be exempt from the tariff.","content_hash":"5c888d7823a9ad5ee04b845c907f71d0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2782,"method_rank":0}

After a sluggish start to 2025, the chipmaker’s stock has staged a remarkable rebound, recently climbing to a new all-time high of $184.48 on Aug. 12. Over just the past three months, shares have surged 38%, easily outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 10% gain during the same stretch.\nThis impressive rally reflects the growing investor enthusiasm surrounding NVDA, particularly as the company continues to dominate the artificial intelligence (AI) space with its chips. Further, the resumption of H20 chip sales to China is a positive step. That development could even pave the way for Nvidia to raise its full-year outlook when it reports results this week.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nA $10 Billion Reason to Buy This Quantum Computing Stock Now\n-\nThis 3X Leveraged QQQ ETF Is Warning Traders of the Next Major Move\nDespite the stock’s big move higher, Nvidia’s technical picture suggests there may still be room to run. The 14-day Relative Strength Index sits at 58.44, well below the threshold that typically signals overbought conditions. That indicates the rally is not yet overstretched and could have more fuel, particularly with AI tailwinds and supportive market sentiment in play.\nWhat the Options Market Is Pricing in for NVDA Stock\nWhile Nvidia is likely to deliver another strong quarter, the options market is not expecting much volatility in NVDA stock post earnings. Traders are pricing in a post-earnings move of about 5.7% in either direction. That’s slightly higher than NVDA’s average post-earnings move of 4.7% over the past year.\nHowever, history shows that Nvidia’s shares have dropped after three of the last four earnings reports, a reminder that even strong results don’t always translate to immediate stock gains.\nIs Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?\nNvidia’s upcoming second-quarter financials are likely to remain strong as demand for its data center compute products continues to surge. Notably, its Blackwell GPU architecture is witnessing solid growth and could remain the key growth catalyst in Q2.\nNotably, in the first quarter, Nvidia delivered $44 billion in revenue, up 69% year-over-year. Data Center sales, which account for the bulk of business, surged 73% to $39 billion as AI workloads transitioned from training to inference. The ramp-up of Blackwell, the fastest in Nvidia’s history, played a key role, contributing nearly 70% of Data Center compute revenue as customers shifted away from Hopper. The launch of the GB200 NVL system marked a major architectural breakthrough, allowing data centers to scale workloads efficiently and deliver lower inference costs. Manufacturing yields have improved, and rack shipments to customers are accelerating.","content_hash":"49331ff608168e1c6c8eb62f4d5a4267","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2776,"method_rank":0}

In that vein, XRP's (CRYPTO: XRP) latest price movement sent it under $3 on Aug. 20, and in doing so it triggered a predictable chorus of worry. Is this the start of a bigger slide lower, or just a breather after the cryptocurrency gained about 400% during the past 12 months?\nThe more important question here for investors is whether the forces that drove XRP's climb remain in place. Let's unpack what happened with the past few days of price action and put it into the asset's longer-term context to start.\nThe news wasn't exactly positive\nWhile simple volatility is the most likely explanation for XRP's dip below $3, it's also true that there was some news that could be interpreted negatively.\nOn Aug. 18, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opted to defer deciding on whether to approve several spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications from asset mangers until late October. Such headlines often dent investor enthusiasm for a coin, even if it says little about the odds of approval for the ETFs -- and the odds are still quite good. So it's really not any reason for holders of XRP to worry whatsoever.\nNow let's look to the forces supporting the coin's price and that could potentially keep driving it higher.\nRipple, the company that issues XRP, recently acquired Rail, a stablecoin payments platform, to accelerate institutional financial flows toward the XRP Ledger (XRPL). That move meshes neatly with Ripple's launch of RLUSD (CRYPTO: RLUSD), the stablecoin that's native to the XRPL. Between those two actions, Ripple is shoring up its appeal to banks, currency exchanges, and institutional investors, all of which it is marketing XRP to, and all of which need ample access to stores of on-chain value that mimic fiat currency, like stablecoins.\nCrucially, Ripple is also working to shore up the regulatory compliance features those institutions insist on. The chain now natively supports authorized trust lines to restrict crypto token holding to approved accounts, and asset freeze controls that give asset issuers strong oversight over potentially suspicious wallets. These are the plumbing tools that let banks, fintechs, and asset issuers operate on-chain without needing to do any risky legal guesswork.\nWhere fresh demand can come from next\nSo Ripple's foray into stablecoins and institutional compliance tooling are part of the reason XRP's price rose so much during the past 12 months. And during the next few quarters, there are a handful of other things for holders to look forward to.","content_hash":"3df4b1d4ec0ece094280e09f04993dbd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2755,"method_rank":0}

The category demonstrated notable resilience in 2024, according to Bain & Company. Last year, the sector grew between 0% and 2% to reach an estimated value of 31 billion euros, or about $36 billion.\nHowever, even during an economic downturn, wealthy shoppers tend to trust certain categories, such as high jewelry, meaning expertly crafted, one-of-a-kind pieces featuring complex, artistic designs and rare gemstones. By contrast, fine jewelry is made of precious materials and is mass produced and easily recognizable.\nHigh jewelry led market growth, outshining more accessible segments, while competition intensified due to the entry of luxury fashion houses and ambitious regional players, according to Fredrica Levato, senior partner at Bain & Company and co-author of the firm’s 2024 Altagamma annual Luxury Goods Market Study.\n“This made [jewelry] the most stable segment within the core luxury categories, outperforming others such as the watch industry, which saw a 5% to 7% decline amid cooling consumer interest,” Levato said in an email.\nRichemont jewelry brands fared best in recent earnings reports. The company owns Buccellati, Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Vhernier, and posted an overall Q1 revenue increase of 3% to 5.4 billion euros. In its earnings release, Richemont said sales at its jewelry houses increased 7% year over year, while its specialty watchmaker division fell 10%.\n“Richemont jewelry brands…have been outperforming the broader industry and peers for a number of quarters, since the pandemic, but now this outperformance is more pronounced,” Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in an email.\nBy contrast, recent revenue figures at LVMH have been less positive. The company owns nine combined watch and jewelry houses, including Bulgari, Tiffany & Co., Chaumet, Repossi and Fred.\nThe company posted overall revenue of 39.8 billion euros for the first half of fiscal 2025, representing a 4% decline year over year. Revenue at its watches and jewelry division was down 1% for the period.\nMeanwhile, rival luxury conglomerate Kering owns jewelry brands Boucheron, Pomellato, DoDo and Qeelin.

While S&P doesn’t see meaningful improvement in the fiscal deficit, it doesn’t expect steep deterioration either. However, reciprocal tariffs face legal challenges and could be struck down.\nRatings agency S&P Global had some good news and bad news on the U.S. deficit outlook. The good news is that it won’t get much worse. The bad news is that it won’t get much better, either.\nA key factor for the deficit forecast is President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which should help offset the impact of tax cuts and spending in the federal budget.\nS&P reaffirmed its AA+ rating on U.S. debt last week, citing the overall strength of the economy, institutions that provide effective checks and balances, proactive monetary policy, and the dollar’s status as the world’s top reserve currency.\nThe outlook on the credit rating, which is a notch below the top AAA grade, remains stable because the deficit won’t muddy the picture.\n“This incorporates our view that changes underway in domestic and international policies won’t weigh on the resilience and diversity of the U.S. economy,” S&P said in a statement. “And in turn, broad revenue buoyancy, including robust tariff income, will offset any fiscal slippage from tax cuts and spending increases.”\nTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to add trillions of dollars to the deficit over the next decade as new tax cuts were added while spending saw cuts to some programs and hikes to others. At the same time, the Congressional Budget Office sees tariffs shaving trillions of dollars off the deficit.\nS&P actually sees some improvement in the deficit, which is expected to shrink to 6% of GDP from 2025 to 2028, down from 7.5% in 2024 and an average of 9.8% from 2020 to 2023. But that will not stop the total debt from soaring past record highs last seen during World War II.\nMeanwhile, S&P sees GDP growth accelerating to an average pace of 2% in 2027 and 2028, from 1.7% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.\n“The combined implementation and execution of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, higher tariff revenue gains, and their effect on growth and investment will inform whether the fiscal trajectory improves or worsens,” S&P added.\nSo a lot is riding on tariffs. And given Washington’s reluctance to raise revenue via income tax hikes, analysts have pointed out an estimated $300 billion to $400 billion a year in tariff revenue would be too much to turn away, meaning levies are likely here to stay.","content_hash":"2b4de0f1e428b72586b34283d7c0ebbb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2751,"method_rank":0}

Today, reports are highlighting an Aug. 21 stock sale by CEO Alex Karp totaling over $60 million, along with $26 million in sales by CTO Shyam Sankar - so, should Palantir bulls panic?\nIf they haven’t yet, probably not. First, there’s not much of a meaningful sentiment interpretation to take away from planned, automated, and\/or tax-related stock sales by executives. Second, following the latest transaction, Karp still owns 6.4 million shares of PLTR stock worth about $1 billion.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nA $10 Billion Reason to Buy This Quantum Computing Stock Now\n-\nThis 3X Leveraged QQQ ETF Is Warning Traders of the Next Major Move\nIs It Time to Buy the Dip in PLTR Stock?\nHere’s PLTR with a few different technical indicators to gauge its momentum and overbought status - Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Average Directional Index (ADX) - which seem to indicate the sharp correction is leveling off.\nHowever, valuation concerns loom large over the stock's prospects. PLTR trades at approximately 90 times forward sales and 242 times forward adjusted earnings, making it one of the most expensive components of the S&P 500 Index ($SPX). As a result, the stock was one of the hardest-hit when artificial intelligence (AI) plays were kneecapped last week by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s “bubble” warning.\nPalantir Crushes Q2 Estimates\nDuring the second quarter, Palantir’s revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, as the company demonstrated impressive growth across key segments. U.S. commercial revenue showed particularly strong momentum, surging 93% year-over-year to $306 million, while government revenue increased by 53% to reach $426 million.\nThe company's growth also continues internationally, as evidenced by its newly expanded partnership with SOMPO Holdings through Palantir Technologies Japan KK. Encouraging adoption of Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) platform and consistent securing of major contracts, including a recent $10 billion U.S. Army deal, underscore their market leadership position in data analytics and artificial intelligence solutions.\nShould You Buy, Sell, or Hold PLTR Right Now?\nSeveral prominent analysts, including RBC's Rishi Jaluria, maintain bearish outlooks, suggesting additional downside risk of up to 71%. Even after PLTR’s earnings beat earlier this month, Jaluria raised the stock’s price target only to a Street-low of $45 and backed an “Underperform” rating, with the analyst writing that “we question the durability of AIP-led momentum.”","content_hash":"aa70c3596c314c54968605acd11b5f89","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2746,"method_rank":0}

So when the time comes to drop a client, it can be just as difficult but also just as important. Whether a client ignores advice, withholds information or is simply rude, cutting ties might be the healthiest option.\n“Holding onto a toxic relationship drains more than it gives,” said Thomas Ravert, CFP with Pathway Capital. “Letting go creates space to focus on clients who value the relationship.”\nREAD ALSO: SEC Enforcement Claims Tumble Almost 50% This Year and Music Festivals, UFC Fights. How Advisors Are Appealing to Next-Gen Clients\nI Saw the Sign\nAn advisor’s main job is to advise (duh), so when clients don’t follow recommendations, the relationship loses meaning. Tom Arasz, founder of Bmore Financially Fit, said he experienced that firsthand with one couple. In meeting after meeting, the three would agree on a financial plan, but the couple would never stick to it. “They’d go out and buy a new car instead of paying off credit card debt,” he told Advisor Upside. When Arasz ultimately fired the clients, he felt like he was fulfilling his fiduciary duty by not having the couple waste money on his services if they weren’t taking them seriously.\nAs the saying goes, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Some clients, however, try to get one, or at least a cheaper meal. Arasz recalled firing another client who misled him about complex tax issues that were beyond the advisor’s expertise. “Even if I had the expertise, I would’ve quoted them a higher fee to balance out how much work they were going to be,” he said.\nIf a client is kind but uncommitted, an advisor might give a final nudge or recommend a better fit elsewhere. But if a client is abusive to staff, that’s an immediate red flag, said Tom Balcom, founder of 1650 Wealth. “I wouldn’t want to drop that ‘grenade’ in the lap of another financial advisor, so I would merely de-link them from our firm,” he told Advisor Upside.\nBreak It Off. Even with glaring red flags, letting go isn’t easy. Rising acquisition costs make every client feel hard-earned. The median cost to acquire a new client hit $3,800 in 2023, up 75% from 2021, according to Kitces Research. High-growth practices now spend 12.5% of revenue on marketing, compared with 9.7% by their peers.\n“Part of it is that it is so difficult to get clients,” said Monica Dwyer, CFP with Harvest Advisor. “You work so hard for it and you have likely already made a huge time commitment.”\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

Their client base primarily consists of business owners and retirees, but they also work with some Major League Baseball players and are looking to branch into the college athlete space.\nThe team, which also includes Vice President of Operations Steven Phan and five other advisors, opted to move to LPL to scale what they can offer clients. According to Matthew Houston, this would give the firm “the tools of a Wall Street firm without actually being one. “\n“As a historically regional firm, we realized that our technology couldn’t keep up, and our younger clients were seeking something that better suited their needs,” he said.\nAccording to SEC records, Lynn Houston joined the industry in 1970, with stints at over a dozen firms, including Lehman Brothers and UBS. Matthew Houston registered in 2003 and worked at Lynn Mason until 2006 (as did his father). The duo hit Citigroup, Southwest Securities and B. Riley Wealth Management before affiliating with Wedbush Securities in 2021.\nLPL also brought Lincoln, Neb.-based advisors Jenna Vitosh and Natalie Paige on board this week to launch Chloey Wealth on its RIA platform. The duo collectively oversaw about $140 million in assets, with Vitosh joining from Edward Jones and Paige from New York Life.\nEarlier this month, LPL Financial announced it closed on its acquisition of Commonwealth Financial Network, delaying the final integration timing to 2026’s fourth quarter. LPL announced in March that it would acquire the privately held Commonwealth, a Waltham, Mass.-based firm with about 3,000 advisors and $305 billion in assets, for a cash deal of about $2.7 billion.\nAccording to LPL, the firm is on track to hit its retention target of 90% of Commonwealth advisors, though several large teams have already departed for rival broker\/dealers.\nIn an earnings call earlier this month, CEO Rich Steinmeier was optimistic about retention, saying that for many Commonwealth advisors “who are prioritizing the Commonwealth experience, their community, the technology service ongoing, and really staying at their forever home for their business and their clients, staying with Commonwealth is their only option.”\nA week after the closing, LPL hired Emily Field as its new chief people officer to oversee the firm’s human resources team.

Here's the Biggest Reason Why There's Still Time.\nKey Points\n-\nXRP has far outperformed popular cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past 12 months.\n-\nCross-border payments are growing at a fast pace.\n-\nXRP helps facilitate cross-border payments more cheaply and quickly.\nWhen Bitcoin was created in 2009, it was seen as nothing more than a niche internet experiment. There are plenty of stories about people using the cryptocurrency to buy items like pizza, gift cards, or coffee (a decision they likely rue now).\nBut as Bitcoin became more popular, many other cryptocurrencies emerged. Some of these have legitimate use cases, and some can be viewed as nothing but a quick cash grab from their creators and early insiders. One cryptocurrency that falls into the former category is XRP (CRYPTO: XRP).\nXRP is a cryptocurrency that enables fast and cheap cross-border payments, and it has had a great run over the past 12 months, up over 390%. That's over five times the returns of Bitcoin and Ethereum in that span. The recent rally may have investors thinking they missed the wave, but there's one big reason why there's still time to hop on the boat.\nCross-border payments are becoming more frequent\nSending money from one country to another has traditionally been expensive because of the reliance on banks (and pre-funded accounts) and high intermediary fees. However, with the introduction of XRP and other nontraditional sources, these transactions are increasingly becoming cheaper and more frequent.\nAccording to Allied Market Research, the global cross-border payments market was around $206 trillion at the end of 2024. By 2034, it's expected to be around $414 trillion. This is great news for XRP because it feeds right into its main use case of being a bridge currency to facilitate these transactions.\nWhat traditionally could cost someone 5% to 7% of the transfer amount , XRP is able to do it for fractions of a cent and much faster. If XRP can capture even a small fraction of the cross-border payment flow, it can be a good investment for some time.\nShould you buy stock in XRP right now?\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and XRP wasn’t one of them.

If you had invested $1,000 in the Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEMKT: VNQ) a decade ago, you would have about $1,770 today, assuming you reinvested your dividends along the way.\nThis isn't a terrible outcome. After all, you wouldn't have lost money. But when you consider that $1,000 invested in an S&P 500 index fund such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO) 10 years ago would be worth $3,900, it doesn't exactly look like stellar performance.\nWhat went wrong?\nThe short version is that the real estate sector underperformed the S&P 500 because, first, the S&P 500 has been on an incredible bull run. It has produced annualized total returns of about 14.6% over the past decade, making it touch to beat.\nIn addition, real estate is perhaps the most rate-sensitive sector of the market. Over the past 10 years, we've seen two prolonged periods of Federal Reserve rate increases, with a global pandemic in between. In fact, the benchmark federal funds rate is more than 400 basis points higher than it was a decade ago.\nReal estate investment trusts (REITs) have a strong history of outperforming the market in falling rate or zero-rate environments but underperforming when rates are high or rising.\nWithout turning this into an economics lesson, there are a few reasons REITs are so sensitive to interest rates. One is borrowing costs. REITs tend to rely heavily on borrowed money to grow, similar to how you might rely on a mortgage to buy a home. Rising rates make the economics of borrowing less favorable.\nIn addition, rising rates put pressure on commercial real estate property values, which tend to have an inverse relationship with risk-free interest rates (those offered by Treasury securities). The properties REITs own can literally be worth less simply because rates went higher.\nOn the other hand, it's worth noting that these things can also become real estate's biggest catalysts in a falling-rate environment.\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard Real Estate ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Real Estate ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Real Estate ETF wasn’t one of them.

Of the self-proclaimed job hoppers, about a fifth received a boost of $50,000 or more.\nToday, those tales of ultra-successful transitions between companies feel like a thing of the past.\nA July report from Arlington, Virginia-based Eagle Hill Consulting showed that the majority of employees plan to stay in their current position for at least the next six months, with the Gen Z employees who once led the job-hopping charge reporting the highest intent to remain where they are.\nAccording to the BoA Institute’s new report, there are several good reasons for the cooldown.\nPessimism is worse than during the pandemic\nJob seekers are currently feel pretty pessimistic about the labor market, and for good reason: A recent report from global outplacement and coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that through the end of July, U.S.-based employers had announced more than 800,000 job eliminations in 2025, while, per a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. economy created just 73,000 new jobs in July.\nFurther, based on the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey released August 15, the percentage of respondents expecting unemployment to rise in the next year has hit a 10-year high, surpassing even the early pandemic era.\nPayoffs for switching jobs have declined\nAmid this climate, the data from the BoA Institute indicates that job hopping is largely on pause. Although job hopping has increased slightly since the start of 2025, the estimated rate has trended continuously downward since its peak of 26% in 2022.","content_hash":"042ed9825bfb48c64cf50b20378df7bf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2724,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on HROW. Harrow, Inc.'s share was trading at $38.23 as of August 19th. HROW’s trailing and forward P\/E were 9.64 and 3.33k respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nPhoto by Michael Longmire on Unsplash\nHarrow, Inc. is a U.S.-based ophthalmology pharmaceutical company rapidly expanding its branded portfolio with products such as VEVYE, IHEEZO, TRIESENCE, and the soon-to-launch BYQLOVI, alongside biosimilars BYOOVIZ and OPUVIZ. VEVYE, launched in January 2024, has quickly gained market share in dry eye disease, surpassing CEQUA and TRYVAYA and positioning itself to challenge category leader MIEBO, with management projecting it will become Harrow’s first product to generate nine-figure annual revenues.\nIHEEZO, introduced as the first branded ocular anesthetic in 14 years, has achieved strong adoption with broad reimbursement coverage, while TRIESENCE has doubled its customer base since 2025, supported by favorable Medicare reimbursement changes. BYQLOVI, an FDA-approved steroid secured in 2025, targets a large post-operative market and is slated for launch in early 2026. Harrow also retains equity and royalty rights in Melt Pharmaceuticals and Surface Ophthalmics, both advancing late-stage clinical assets that may add future optionality.\nFinancially, Harrow reported Q2 2025 revenues of $63.7 million, up 30% year-over-year, with GAAP net income of $5.0 million and EBITDA more than doubling, reflecting improving profitability and scale. Management projects revenues of over $280 million in 2025, with longer-term goals of achieving $250 million in quarterly revenue by 2027, implying ~$1 billion annualized by 2028.\nHowever, risks remain material: $182 million in debt maturities in 2026 necessitate refinancing or asset sales, while stock-based compensation has already diluted shareholders by 9.1% over the past year. Reimbursement pressures and payer consolidation further weigh on execution. If Harrow delivers on its ambitious targets and mitigates financing challenges, its shift toward branded pharmaceuticals and biosimilars could drive a market capitalization above $6 billion by 2028, implying significant upside from current levels.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Harrow, Inc. (HROW) by Simon in September 2024, which highlighted strong revenue growth, expanding dry-eye treatment sales, and its direct-to-provider model. The stock has depreciated ~13% since then as costs pressured results. The thesis still stands given scaling opportunities. Penny Insight shares a similar view but emphasizes product traction, biosimilars, and financing risks.","content_hash":"0d3eb039412efe543a304e1163b0f4c1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2718,"method_rank":0}

Dominari’s expansion into this space aligns with our mission to identify transformative opportunities and bring them into the mainstream for Dominari shareholders and clients.”\nDominari’s pivot into crypto is the latest chapter in a long transformation.

According to the U.S. Treasury Department, the national deficit occurs when the federal government’s spending is higher than its revenues.\nRead More: I Asked ChatGPT What Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Means for Retirees’ Taxes: Here’s What It Said\nExplore More: 6 Big Shakeups Coming to Social Security in 2025\nSo what is the national debt? GOBankingRates asked ChatGPT to explain it in simple enough terms that a 12-year-old could understand. Here’s what it said.\nAlso see whether you and your wallet should care about the Big Beautiful Bill’s impact on the national debt.\nNational Debt Basics\nAs a way of introducing the subject, ChatGPT compared the United States government to a “huge family with a really big budget.” Most of the family’s money comes from taxes, and it spends that money on everything from schools and roads to hospitals and the military.\nThe debt part comes in when the government spends more money than it earns.\n“When that happens, it needs to borrow money to pay for everything,” ChatGPT noted. “That borrowed money is called the national debt.”\nCheck Out: I Asked ChatGPT What the Point of Trump’s Tariffs Are: Here’s What It Said\nHow Does the Government Borrow Money?\nWhen the government goes into debt, it borrows money by selling bonds. Here’s how ChatGPT explained it:\n“A bond is like an ‘I owe you’ note. People, banks or even other countries buy these bonds and the government promises to pay them back later with interest (a little extra money as a thank-you). Every time the government borrows more than it pays back, the debt grows. Just like if you keep borrowing money from your parents or friends but don’t pay it back, your IOUs keep piling up.”\nFrom a pure financial standpoint, this constant borrowing doesn’t sound too great. But there is an upside — as long as the debt doesn’t grow too high. For example, it can be used to pay for new and improved highways and fund various programs.\nBut when the national debt keeps growing higher — as it continues to do in 2025 — it can cause a variety of problems. Here are three cited by ChatGPT:\n-\nThe government might have to pay a lot of interest.\n-\nThere could be less money for important stuff.\n-\nOther countries might worry about lending to us.\nAnother problem, related to the third one cited by ChatGPT, is that rising national debt can ding the country’s credit rating. If fact, that has already happened.","content_hash":"3149b7440f330dbd3fbb99398678ab53","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2708,"method_rank":0}

The company remains focused on delivering more of the benefits and unique value-creating opportunities of its three-nation network, which connects shippers in all parts of North America via effective interline service options,” CPKC said.\nCPKC in 2023 merged with U.S.-based Kansas City Southern, creating the first single-line railroad serving Mexico, Canada, and the U.S.\nIt’s not certain if Ottawa would even permit Canadian National (NYSE: CN), a crown jewel of Canada’s industrial history, to be part of a shared ownership structure with a U.S. entity. Furthermore, while CN in the past has mounted a number of failed merger proposals – notably with Santa Fe in 1999 – the strained state of relations with Washington for now raises questions about a major transnational business deal. At the same time, it’s possible the other railroads will watch and wait to see how the Surface Transportation Board evaluates the UP-NS deal before making their own proposals.\nCN also has expressed support for additional interline partnerships rather than mergers.\nAny major rail merger, CPKC said, poses “unprecedented risks to customers, rail employees, and the broader supply chain. Those risks would be exacerbated by the inevitable follow-on consolidation.”\nThe industry should instead focus on interline partnerships, which can provide many of the same benefits of mergers but without the integration risk, CPKC said.","content_hash":"659d953ea8c4ae58a622491f2d390501","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2706,"method_rank":0}

NXST’s trailing and forward P\/E were 10.86 and 15.11 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nCopyright: wihtgod \/ 123RF Stock Photo\nNexstar Media Group’s ($NXST) announced acquisition of Tegna ($TGNA) represents a landmark deal in the broadcast television sector, but the transaction raises important strategic and financial questions. The company opted for an all-cash offer rather than a stock component, a choice that heavily increases leverage in the short term and delays deleveraging to 3x until 2028. While management highlights synergies of $300 million, representing roughly 37% of Tegna’s EBITDA, skeptics question whether such efficiencies can offset the structural decline of broadcast TV viewership.\nThe strategic rationale emphasizes scale, broader geographic reach, and competitive positioning against Big Tech and Big Media, but in reality advertisers can already target audiences nationally via digital platforms such as Google and Meta, undermining the incremental value of larger coverage maps. Management has drawn parallels to its Tribune Media acquisition, pointing to proven cost synergies, but the combined Nexstar\/Tribune entity has underperformed the broader market since 2019, highlighting the industry’s growth limitations. With the Tegna deal, investors must weigh the risk of heightened leverage against the promise of near-term earnings accretion.\nEquity holders face years of patience while Nexstar manages debt in a declining industry, while Tegna shareholders, by contrast, receive the certainty of an all-cash payout. For long-term investors, the lack of organic growth, reliance on financial engineering, and shrinking broadcast audience base raise concerns about sustainability. The deal may extend Nexstar’s runway through cost cuts, but without meaningful revenue growth, its upside remains constrained. For Tegna shareholders, however, the cash exit represents an attractive outcome.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Nexstar Media Group, Inc. (NXST) by Value Don’t Lie in April 2025, which highlighted the company’s strong free cash flow, capital returns, and regulatory-driven M&A optionality. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately 16% since our coverage. This is because investor confidence in buybacks played out. The thesis still stands as FCF resilience remains intact.

They, therefore, have no idea whether they’re actually moving forward or backward. After all, high income does not necessarily equal high net worth. Individuals should track this number consistently to ensure it’s going up.\nCheck Out: The No. 1 Key To Wealth, According To Wahei Takeda, the ‘Warren Buffett of Japan’\nSavings Rate\nNext, Seo highlighted savings rate with the following formula: “Savings rate = (income – expenses) ÷ income x 100.”\nYour savings rate shows you how much of your income you actually keep after all other expenses are paid and highlights some truths about your financial behavior. Is there a good deal left over, or are you spending almost everything you make?\nTracking your net worth is a great first step, but it means relatively little without understanding key factors contributing to how and why that number is trending in the direction it is. Seo said that if you’re not tracking your savings rate, you have no idea how long it’s going to take you to achieve financial freedom.\nYour Freedom Number\nSpeaking of financial freedom, Seo defined the freedom number as “the amount of money you need to make in order to never work again.” He advised tracking this number with the following formula: “Your freedom number = (monthly expenses x 12) x 25.”\nIn other words, the estimated cost of retirement for 25 years. So if someone has $5,000 worth of monthly expenses, they will need $1.5 million invested to retire.\nThis number is based on the 4% rule, which states that if retirees withdraw 4% of their investment portfolio every year, their money should last throughout retirement (even once inflation is factored in).\n“The idea here is as long as your investments are earning at least 4% on average per year, your money should last forever,” Seo explained.","content_hash":"42cbdeb3c9ab470b7cafa73001b54e04","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2697,"method_rank":0}

Today, family capital anchors about 25% of the firm’s assets, while the rest comes from third-party institutions. Anchor investors of Iris include Kim Dong-won, a scion of the family behind South Korea’s Hanwha Group, and Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund.\nPrivate credit is a pivot for Lau, who had bet on venture capital with her other firm, RHL Ventures, which she co-founded in 2016 alongside younger members of some of Southeast Asia’s most influential families. The other partners are Raja Hamzah Abidin, son of prominent former Malaysian politician Raja Nong Chik, and Jojo Kong, whose father David Kong founded Nirvana Asia Ltd, one of the largest death-care service providers in Asia.\nLau, who now leads a 15-person team, says institutional partners can be more straightforward to work with than other families. She declined to disclose Iris’s total assets, or her family wealth.\nLau plans to take majority stakes of 50% to 80% in international companies and help them with their expansion in Southeast Asia. For example, US and Chinese businesses coming to Malaysia and Indonesia. Recent deals include an investment in biotech firm Mirxes Holding Co., which listed in Hong Kong in May.\nRelative to a family office, “institutional capital is easier because they’re more clear with what they want. It’s all about financial returns; there are no emotions,” said Lau.\nLau has a Master of Law from the University of Sydney, and earlier in her career was Vice President at Heitman Investment Management, where she helped manage $4 billion of long-only and absolute return equity strategies.

In 2020, the company announced that it was buying up Bitcoin and adding it to its balance sheet. Its stock soon became a proxy for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, and the firm’s value soared as Bitcoin surged in price.\nCopycats eventually emerged, and, over the last few months, the number of tokens that public companies have acquired has multiplied. There are digital asset treasuries for Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, and a host of other cryptocurrencies. Tuesday’s announcement appears to be the first example of a crypto treasury company dedicated to the Cronos token.\nProponents say that crypto’s newest form of financial alchemy lets traditional investors, who are usually limited to the stocks and funds tradeable in brokerage accounts, gain exposure to different cryptocurrencies. Detractors, including those in the crypto industry, say the trend is a bubble and will soon pop.\nStill, the number of crypto treasury companies continues to sprawl. In fact, Trump Media and Crypto.com’s public vehicle isn’t even the first digital asset treasury in the Trump family’s crypto empire.","content_hash":"15b2657ece822398d15b86afbb53eaff","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2697,"method_rank":0}

VLO’s trailing and forward P\/E were 55.17 and 19.27 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nQiuJu Song\/Shutterstock.com\nValero Energy Corporation (VLO) is a leading independent petroleum refiner and a growing force in renewable fuels, supported by its scale, efficiency, and disciplined capital allocation. At the core of the company is its extensive refining segment, comprising 15 refineries with a throughput capacity of roughly 3.2 million barrels per day, primarily concentrated along the U.S. Gulf Coast. This geographic advantage provides access to diverse crude oil sources, cost-efficient logistics, and robust export markets, enabling Valero to sustain strong cash flow generation across cycles.\nIts ability to process a wide range of feedstocks, combined with consistently high utilization rates and a low-cost structure, allows the company to maintain flexibility and preserve margins in volatile energy markets. Beyond refining, Valero has established itself as a leader in renewable diesel through its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, one of the largest producers globally. This business converts waste feedstocks like used cooking oil and animal fats into low-carbon fuels, providing a natural hedge against regulatory pressures and evolving consumer demand.\nThe company has also entered Sustainable Aviation Fuel, reinforcing its first-mover advantage in lower-carbon transportation solutions. A defining feature of Valero’s strategy is its disciplined capital allocation, balancing consistent shareholder returns with reinvestment in growth. The company has prioritized dividends and buybacks while channeling growth capital into projects that enhance refining efficiency and expand renewable fuels capacity. This balanced approach not only maximizes near-term shareholder value but also positions Valero for long-term profitability and resilience in the global energy transition.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Delek US Holdings by Matt Lindsay in May 2025, which highlighted the Enterprise Optimization Plan, midstream deconsolidation, and shareholder returns as key drivers of long-term value. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 16.37% since our coverage. This is because operational progress offset refining headwinds. The thesis still stands as optimization continues.

Given Warren Buffett's incredible track record of identifying high-quality companies, there's certainly a reason for investors to learn more about this top beverage stock.\nCoca-Cola is a highly regarded consumer brand, with hundreds of different drinks served in virtually all corners of the globe. It's wild to think that 2.2 billion servings of the company's beverages are consumed every day.\nThe business has its merits, but if you buy $10,000 worth of Coca-Cola shares in 2025, will you become a millionaire in 10 years?\nCoca-Cola's bull thesis\nMany reasons support the argument that Coca-Cola is a high-quality business. The brand is one factor, and it supports the company's economic moat. Coca-Cola has been around for over 100 years. Its customers have grown an affinity for its products, thanks to consistent offerings and effective marketing.\nThe durable brand is also supported by the industry Coca-Cola operates in. There isn't much disruption or innovation happening in this market, and things don't change much over time. This gives me confidence that the brand will be relevant decades from now. In this way, Coca-Cola is a company Buffett likely views as a \"forever\" holding.\nThat brand positioning has resulted in impressive profits. Coca-Cola outsources the heavy lifting of bottling and distribution to third parties, helping it run a leaner operation. In the latest quarter (Q2 2025, ended June 27), the business reported net income of $3.8 billion, translating to a fantastic net profit margin of 30%.\nBeing able to consistently raise prices helps management offset cost inflation. Favorable pricing added a 5% bump to revenue during Q2. This attractive trait should help Coca-Cola maintain its profit margins as we look ahead.\nThe company's bottom-line performance directly benefits shareholders. Coca-Cola has raised its dividend for a jaw-dropping 63 straight years. With a healthy dividend yield of 2.91%, the stock can be a top choice for investors seeking a steady income from their portfolio holdings.\nCoca-Cola won't generate huge returns\nIn the past 10 years, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of 286% (as of Aug. 22). Coca-Cola has been a serious laggard. Its shares have generated a total return of just 145%. I think investors can expect much of the same going forward.","content_hash":"b5546ea590ebd70cb8d462187a47985e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2692,"method_rank":0}

(LPLA), the largest independent broker-dealer in the U.S., is positioned to capture market share in the growing independent financial advice industry by leveraging its scale, technology, and advisor incentives. The company provides technology solutions that help advisors operate more efficiently and service clients more effectively, enabling it to benefit from both secular growth in demand for financial advice and the migration of advisors from wire houses to independent models. LPL’s size, with over $1.5 trillion of assets, gives it a cost advantage, allowing reinvestment into advanced technologies and competitive payouts.\nIts platform offers flexibility through multiple affiliation models and outsourcing options, making it attractive for advisors seeking independence. This scale also enables LPL to offer industry-leading economics, with payouts exceeding 90% of generated revenues, reinforcing its ability to recruit advisors and attract assets. The virtuous cycle of asset inflows and reinvestment continues to strengthen its competitive edge, while rising asset prices provide an additional structural tailwind.\nThe company is expected to sustain low-teens asset growth and expand margins, driving EBITDA growth at a mid-teens pace. Combined with share repurchases, this should compound earnings per share at a high-teens rate over time. LPL’s strategy of reinvesting in technology and scale advantages positions it to continue gaining share in a growing market, while its strong economics create sticky advisor relationships.

When Bitcoin moves higher, most cryptocurrencies tend to follow, and vice versa.\nI still think XRP is one of the more compelling cryptocurrencies to watch, given its network utility and ties to Ripple, which is bridging the gap between the crypto and mainstream finance.

Instead of using salary increases to strengthen their financial foundation, many fall into the trap of upgrading their lifestyle too quickly.\n“What I see most often isn’t a lack of discipline or ambition, it’s a mindset shaped by scarcity, fear and comparison that keeps them stuck in habits that don’t serve long-term wealth,” said Melissa Murphy Pavone, founder of Mindful Financial Partners. “After years of hustle, many clients feel they’ve earned a certain lifestyle, but when income increases, spending rises just as fast (or faster). It’s often framed as ‘self-care’ but it often delays real wealth-building.”\nA scarcity mindset often drives lifestyle creep, Pavone said. Many people operate from a constant sense of “never enough,” whether it’s money, time, knowledge or opportunity. That mentality often drives reactive decisions instead of thoughtful, intentional financial choices.\n“My advice… pay yourself first,” Pavone said. “Start small, Start now, Stay Consistent.”\nCheck Out: The No. 1 Way Americans Become Millionaires Is Pretty Boring — and Easy To Do\nNot Understanding Your Budget\nMany millennial families underestimate the importance of truly understanding their household budget. Without clarity on where their money goes, especially regarding the distinction between fixed and variable expenses, financial decisions often feel reactive rather than intentional.\n“A surprising number of families don’t truly know what it costs to run their household,” said Sean Babin, CEO at Babin Wealth Management. “Without a clear grasp of fixed vs. variable expenses, it’s nearly impossible to make confident financial decisions. If your money disappears every month and you’re not sure where it’s going, wealth-building becomes guesswork.”\nBabin shared the story of a millennial couple earning $250,000 who still felt like they were living paycheck to paycheck. The problem wasn’t income; it was a lack of clarity.","content_hash":"5c7bb48058e4770d86d83d7f7fca77d2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2678,"method_rank":0}

Apple has traded in a much more narrow range, with a difference of roughly $75 between its high and low points.\nLearn More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nConsider This: 6 Hybrid Vehicles To Stay Away From in Retirement\nTrump’s sweeping tariff threats contributed to sharp selloffs for both companies back in April. But the president’s habit of later backing off many of those tariffs has calmed investors, leading to a series of rallies that have pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new all-time highs in recent weeks.\nMicrosoft has also touched a record high. But Apple has had a much harder time gaining traction.\nSo which stock has performed better since Trump took office? So far, Microsoft is the clear winner. Keep reading to learn more.\nMicrosoft’s Performance\nBecause Trump was inaugurated on a federal holiday — Jan. 20, 2025, also Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day — the stock markets were closed. So for our purposes, we’ll look at stock performances since the close of trading on Jan. 21, 2025.\nHere’s a look at how Microsoft’s stock has performed since Trump took office:\n-\nClosing price on Jan. 21, 2025: $428.50\n-\nClosing price Aug. 20, 2025: $505.72\n-\nPct. gain\/loss: +18%\n-\nClosing high since Jan. 21: $535.64 (Aug. 4)\n-\nClosing low since Jan. 21: $354.56 (Apr. 8)\nFind Out: Barbara Corcoran Put $62 Million Into Her ‘Shark Tank’ Investments — How Much Did She Make?\nApple’s Performance\nHere’s how Apple’s stock has performed since Trump took office:\n-\nClosing price on Jan. 21, 2025: $222.64\n-\nClosing price Aug. 20, 2025: $226.01\n-\nPct. gain\/loss: +3%\n-\nClosing high since Jan. 21: $247.10 (Feb. 24)\n-\nClosing low since Jan. 21: $172.42 (Apr. 8)\nWhat The Numbers Mean\nAs the above charts show, investors are much more bullish on Microsoft than Apple under Trump. The charts don’t even tell the whole story, either.\nSince the beginning of 2025, Microsoft’s stock has posted a year-to-date gain of about 19.4%. In contrast, Apple is down nearly 10% for the year — even though the S&P 500 is up more than 8% year-to-date, per Yahoo Finance.\nTariffs tell a big part of the story. As Fortune reported, Microsoft has much less direct exposure to tariffs because it doesn’t deal in a lot of physical or computer products.","content_hash":"c715ee4b21c3a788cf004b591bfd07c0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2678,"method_rank":0}

Where last week focused on the difficult question in cattle, “Is the climb to new all-time highs by boxed beef being driven by consumer demand or tight supplies?”, this week’s Column is going to cover the big three questions that have come in of late. Some that didn’t make the cut have to do with Brazil’s 2026 soybean crop, a subject I will be covering over the course of the next Q (quarter, in industry terminology), the next US Federal Open Market Committee move (with the September rolling around in three weeks), and the fate of US stock indexes as the key month of October draws nearer on the horizon. Generally speaking, there is time to think about these queries and others. Given Chaos Theory – an unexpected change at a key time can lead to a different result – it’s difficult to look too far into the future. Therefore, it behooves us to focus on the path immediately in front of us, or the results immediately behind us for the view is clearer.\nSo, let’s move on to today’s issues.\nMore News from Barchart\nQuestion #1: Was the August 1 Cattle on Feed report bearish? No. My good friend and cattle industry insider Kyle Bumsted called me early Monday morning. In his line of work, he talks with folks looking to trade cattle – cash, futures, options – on a daily basis. While many of them are supposedly “hedgers”, I spent enough time as a commodities broker to know what that means: A hedge position is only a hedge until it becomes a speculative position. It is with a great deal of historical (hysterical?) observation I can say the favored of those in the cattle markets is the famed Texas Hedge – being long cash cattle and futures.\nUsually, I find ANY reaction to USDA’s Cattle on Feed reports humorous. Is almost as if those who should know have it wiped from their memory banks that the numbers are at least a month old upon release. The latest round showed marketings and placements that occurred during July, resulting in the number of head still counted in feed yards on Friday, August 1. For the record the report was released on Friday, August 22. It seems the BRACE Industry was squawking about how bearish the placement number of 1.598 million head was. Why? Because it was up 11% from the previous month. Okay. But it’s interesting how this group usually compares to the previous year, which in this case showed July 2025 was down 6% from July 2024 which was down 1% from 2023. In fact, last month’s year-to-year drop in placements was the most since 8% from July 2021 in relation to 2020, the latter coming with a Covid-19 asterisk.","content_hash":"a1ba61640f3d87b7e90f93fc17a76d4b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2676,"method_rank":0}

Cook, who was appointed to her position by former President Joe Biden, said Trump did not have cause to fire her and that she would not resign. The Fed said it would accept the court's decision about Cook's termination, CNBC reported.\nTrump's attempt to remove Cook marks an escalation of his attacks on the central bank and its independence. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed — especially Chair Jerome Powell — for refusing to cut interest rates. Trump said Tuesday he would soon have a \"majority\" of his own nominees to support his wish to lower rates.\nStocks climbed during Tuesday's session as investors largely shook off Trump's latest effort to assert dominance over the Fed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.30%, the S&P 500 increased 0.41% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.44%.\nAccording to Cramer, the Fed should be independent from the president because a central bank controlled by a president or prime minister usually results in higher inflation. But he suggested that Trump's action doesn't matter to many investors because it has little to do with more market-moving events set to take place this week — namely earnings from artificial intelligence giant Nvidia.\nCramer said he wants a central bank that \"looks at the evidence and tries to do the right thing regardless of the president,\" adding that he's not trying to minimize the significance of Trump's efforts to control the organization. However, when it comes to making money on the market, he said Nvidia's new chip and whether customers will make money using it is more important.\n\"Look, for pretty much my entire career, if somebody told you to sell stocks because of a headline from Washington, you would have been dead wrong,\" he said. \"We already went through this in Trump's first term.\"\nSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.\nDisclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Nvidia.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ADMA. ADMA Biologics, Inc.'s share was trading at $17.80 as of August 22nd. ADMA’s trailing and forward P\/E were 20.94 and 28.99 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nAdma Biologics (ADMA) has delivered a remarkable financial turnaround, with 2024 standing out as a pivotal year. Gross profit has compounded at an impressive 34% CAGR from 2020 to 2024, reflecting strong topline expansion. Net income has moved from a loss of $75.5 million in 2020 to profitability of $197.7 million in 2024, marking a significant inflection point. Operating income turned positive in 2023 and has accelerated since, while free cash flow now stands around $110 million, cementing the company’s move into consistent profitability.\nThese gains are further supported by robust margins, both at the gross and net income levels, underscoring operational discipline. Return on invested capital has surged to an extraordinary 78%, indicating highly effective capital allocation, while goodwill remains negligible, highlighting that growth is being achieved organically rather than through acquisitions. Capex requirements have also declined, further enhancing free cash generation.\nWhile insider ownership sits around 2%, below the 10% benchmark often favored by investors, founders remain active in the business, signaling alignment with shareholder interests. Stock-based compensation, though impacting free cash flow accounting, is small relative to overall FCF and does not materially alter the investment case. ADMA has also initiated buybacks, including a $5 million program in 2024, reflecting confidence in future performance, though some investors may prefer reinvestment over repurchases.\nValuation metrics strengthen the appeal, with forward P\/E and P\/FCF both trading below historical medians, suggesting meaningful undervaluation. With accelerating profitability, strong capital efficiency, and expanding margins, ADMA presents a compelling investment case with significant upside potential.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Bio-Techne Corporation (TECH) by scuttleblurb in May 2025, which highlighted its diversified model across proteins, diagnostics, and CGT while noting cyclical risks. The company’s stock price has depreciated approximately by 19.11% since our coverage. This is because growth expectations were reset after COVID tailwinds faded. The thesis still stands as organic growth rebounds. Felix shares a similar bullish stance on ADMA Biologics, but emphasizes profitability inflection and undervaluation.","content_hash":"59add89e79389448a366af34fa335219","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2673,"method_rank":0}

Credits for solar panels and energy-efficient home improvement expire at the end of the year, meaning homeowners need to act fast if they want to receive the perk.\nThe credits’ expiration comes as residential energy prices soar past overall inflation, with electricity prices up 5.5% in July compared to a year ago.\nRelated: Tesla, GM, Ford EV buyers get extra breathing room ahead of tax credit expiration\n“We certainly expect that folks are going to continue to take advantage of these credits while they’re still available,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at the nonprofit Rewiring America, which, on Monday, launched a campaign to inform consumers about the various expiring benefits.\n“The impact of these tax credits has been significant,” Pierce said. “Households have saved thousands of dollars across the country.”\nThe energy-efficient home improvement program credit allows consumers to claim a credit capped at 30% of the total cost for qualified heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, or biomass heating systems, up to $2,000.\nThrough the credit, Americans can also claim up to 30% of the total cost, limited to $1,200, for all other energy-efficient home improvements, which can include up to $1,200 in insulation upgrades, $600 for new electrical panels, $600 for exterior windows and skylights, and even up to $150 for a home energy audit, where a professional tells a homeowner how to make a home more efficient to save money.\n“For many folks, we would recommend starting there, with this energy audit,” Pierce said. “That can help to lay out the blueprint for making smart investments that are going to lead to the biggest bill savings.”\nOverall, consumers can claim up to $3,200 a year.\nIn terms of dollar value, the tax benefits are even more significant for solar panels and their installation under the residential clean energy credit: up to 30% of the project’s qualifying costs. Because a home solar system is a considerable expense — nearly $21,000 for an average-sized solar panel installation after the incentives kick in this year — the savings can be worth several thousand dollars. Unused portions of the credit can also help offset later years’ tax bills until they are completely dried up.\n“I have a pastor that I work with that put in solar, and they were able to use the credit over a three-year period,” said Steven Elliott, tax director at Mercer Advisors.","content_hash":"d131970438eeb22526f1db8dd4151ff0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2665,"method_rank":0}

Moreover, Premier’s latest piece of M&A is above all, like the Fuel10K deal, a move to give the Mr Kipling cakes maker more exposure to the healthier parts of the store.\nThere’s no question Premier’s so-called “branded growth model” has paid off for the Ambrosia and Bisto maker in recent years.\nIt’s a long time since Premier was derided in the UK investment community as something of a “zombie” company weighed down by debt and a pension deficit and therefore unable to invest enough in its brands.\nThe group has enjoyed four consecutive financial years of rising revenue and profits. Premier’s headline revenue (which excludes exchange rates and its exits from frozen pizza and powdered desserts and drinks) grew 3.5% in the year to 29 March to £1.15bn. Premier said its headline branded revenue increased more than 5% to just over £1bn.\nThe UK remains the bulk of the business.

KTOS’s trailing and forward P\/E ratios were 685.00 and 212.77 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions is positioned for strong multi-year growth as its early investments in next-generation defense technologies begin to scale into larger contracts. The company has built capabilities across hypersonics, drone engines, small missile engines, space systems, microwave electronics, and unmanned platforms—areas now seeing significant funding inflows from the U.S. Department of Defense and allied militaries.\nThis timing is highly favorable, as geopolitical tensions and modernization initiatives are driving unprecedented demand for cutting-edge defense solutions. Kratos’s differentiated expertise in these high-demand segments enables it to compete effectively against larger incumbents while maintaining agility and cost advantages, which is critical as defense customers increasingly prioritize rapid development and deployment cycles. The company’s strategy of investing ahead of demand is now paying off, with momentum building across its portfolio and a growing backlog that reflects both the scale and urgency of military procurement programs.\nImportantly, Kratos’s positioning in unmanned systems and hypersonic technology aligns directly with priority areas of defense spending, offering long-term visibility and sustained growth potential. With military budgets globally expanding to address evolving threats, Kratos is uniquely placed to capture an outsized share of these opportunities. The operating backdrop has never been stronger for the company, and the pipeline of opportunities continues to expand. Taken together, the alignment of strategic investments, favorable budgetary trends, and escalating demand for advanced defense systems makes Kratos a compelling growth story with significant upside for investors as its platforms move from development into scaled production.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (KTOS) by Kooky_Lime1793 in January 2025, which highlighted its $1.45 billion hypersonics contract, drone leadership, and AI-driven “Loyal Wingman.” The stock has appreciated about 139% since then as defense contracts played out. The thesis still stands.

We saw that earlier this year, as the market had one of its fastest major declines on record.\nWhy Use TQQQ to Trade the Nasdaq-100?\nNaturally, every investor must decide the trading details for themselves. But I find many do not even consider leveraged ETFs, because they’ve heard stories about holding too long and having their price erode more than expected. Or, they just don’t want to have that much loss potential (3X the QQQ via TQQQ), despite the allure of 3X upside in a strong market.\nMy short answers: Don’t hold too long, and don’t invest nearly as much in something like TQQQ as you would in QQQ. That’s just a quick primer. And the underlying rule for me is know what you own and do your research.\nWhat’s TQQQ’s Story Now?\nI’ve traded TQQQ a lot the past couple of years, for many reasons. That includes using options on it, with or without the ETF. And I’ll show one current option collar possibility below.\nBut the main takeaway from the two TQQQ charts below is that, as I’ve seen before with this ETF, since it moves three times faster than the QQQ, it can often act as a “sneak preview\" of QQQ moves to come.

NATL’s trailing and forward P\/E were 22.09 and 9.50 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nNCR Atleos Corp (NATL), the ATM-focused spin-off from October 2023, presents a compelling investment case, trading at 6.3x FY25E EBITDA and 10x earnings with 3x leverage. Historically hardware-centric, NATL has transformed its revenue mix toward recurring streams, driven in large part by the $2.5bn Cardtronics acquisition in 2022. The company generates revenue from hardware, software, services, and network transactions, with its emerging ATMaaS (ATM-as-a-Service) offering poised to be a key growth driver.\nATMaaS allows banks to outsource all ATM operations, improving efficiency and increasing contract lifetime revenue 2.5x relative to legacy models. While still under 6% of total sales, the segment has shown strong early momentum, with Q1 and Q2 revenue growth of 24% and 32%, respectively, and ARR reaching ~$250m.\nNATL’s broader self-service banking and network segments are growing modestly, supported by ATMaaS adoption and increasing transaction volumes. Peer comparisons show NATL is competitively positioned alongside Diebold (DBD), Brink’s (BCO), and Euronet Worldwide (EEFT), all of which trade at slightly higher multiples and pursue similar growth strategies. NATL targets 2027 EPS of $6, implying a 20-24% annual growth rate and potential valuation upside to $52–67 per share using peer multiples. Free cash flow generation is substantial, with management expecting ~$700m over six quarters, and leverage is set to fall below 3x by 3Q25, enabling a $200m buyback and flexible capital allocation.\nDespite skepticism around the secular ATM market, NATL’s ATMaaS innovation, recurring revenue base, and strong free cash flow provide a clear growth path. Investors have the opportunity to capture early-stage upside at a reasonable 10x earnings multiple, with a multi-year EPS CAGR of ~23%, while strategic execution and market adoption of ATMaaS remain key upside catalysts.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on NCR Atleos Corporation (NATL) by Alex Feng in April 2025, which highlighted the company’s leadership in ATMaaS, shift to recurring revenue, and integration of Cardtronics’ ATM network. The stock has appreciated approximately 41% since coverage, reflecting strong adoption. Value Don’t Lie shares a similar perspective but emphasizes updated trading multiples, near-term growth, and early ATMaaS momentum.","content_hash":"a0995da34f9b73bb41ddf993cd1ebb49","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2655,"method_rank":0}

While AMD has a significantly smaller market share than best-in-class Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), it has carved out a solid foothold for itself in the industry.\nStill, AMD is a $265 billion company right now, so it would take a 277% rise for it to join the $1 trillion club by 2030. While that sounds like a lot, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) required is 27%. With how rapidly the AI industry is expanding, that doesn't sound like an unachievable growth rate, but is it realistic for AMD?\nLet's take a look.\nAMD's diversification is helpful and harmful, depending on the quarter\nAMD offers a broad lineup of computing hardware. It offers graphics processing units (GPUs) that compete directly against Nvidia in both data center and gaming, as well as other applications where GPUs are commonly used. Right now, the biggest use case for GPUs in data centers is AI training and inference.\nWhile Nvidia is solely focused on GPUs, AMD's product lineup expands beyond that. It also has CPUs that can be placed in consumer laptops and computers in both aftermarket and original equipment manufacturing (OEM) settings. It also has an embedded processors division, thanks to its acquisition of Xylinx. These purpose-built processors span a wide variety of industries and are a promising area for continuous growth for AMD.\nAMD's downfall versus Nvidia has been its lack of focus, as AMD is spreading its resources across multiple technologies instead of focusing on a single technology. Some may consider this a strength, because if the data center GPU market falls apart, AMD will be hurt much less than Nvidia. On the flip side, with data center spending booming, AMD doesn't experience the same strength as Nvidia. That has been the case over the past few years, and is a primary reason why Nvidia's stock left AMD in the dust.\nHowever, AMD could still be a solid stock to own, even if it hasn't delivered the performance Nvidia has.\nAMD needs business to return to China if it hopes to be a $1 trillion company\nAMD's second quarter was a mixed bag. Its data center division was harmed by the Trump administration's decision to revoke its export license to China, an action that also hurt Nvidia. However, AMD has reapplied for an export license with the assurance from the government that it will be approved. The catch is that these two will have to pay a 15% export tax, which would eat into both companies' margins.","content_hash":"682856dfec9c56bc467ff763f26f6f3c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2652,"method_rank":0}

I leaned in closer. What if, Steven-Waiss posed, it was actually those with communications degrees who would likely win out in the end? The soft people skills that comms majors learn—like conflict resolution and ability to influence, persuade, and inspire—are just going to increase in importance in the age of AI, she said at a Fortune dinner presented in partnership with ServiceNow.\nIt’s an interesting theory, and may make sense at a time where tech job postings remain 36% below pre-pandemic levels, with entry-level tech roles down 34%, according to a recent Indeed study.\nAnd with some fearing that entry-level roles could decrease thanks to AI, it may be time to think of other options for recent grads. Steven-Waiss proposed a solution: A two-year, entry-level career program where new hires enter a “problem-solving pool.” She envisions companies hiring up to 100 early-in-career, digital natives every year that rotate around a company and figure out where their contributions and passions are highest.\n“It’s like the new hustle those of us GenXer’s learned climbing the corporate ladder or doing the summer job. There’s going to be people that figure out, ‘God, I’m really good at engineering,’ or ‘I’m really good at inbound product management’ or ‘I’m really good at finance,’” she said. “It’s a problem-solving team with a mission and they will learn how to collaborate, and we will likely see innovative new solutions that existing teams wouldn’t have come up with.”\nSteven-Waiss said this type of model would be a positive for the bottom line, too. Companies wouldn’t have to have specific jobs in each department to budget for. Everyone in the problem-solving pool would make the same salary, and finance departments would know exactly what the spend would be, she said.\n“When you grow up in a function or a career path, you almost always wear that jersey. So in the case that they’re coming into this rotation, where there’s no set job, they’re wearing the jersey of the company,” Steven-Waiss said. “They’re wearing the jersey of the problem they’re actually working to solve, and they are going to learn so much about the dynamics, about how the company makes money.”","content_hash":"310e8298f118cf24ad1e302380507683","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2649,"method_rank":0}

Rocket has consistently gained share in the fragmented origination market, with 12% in refinance and 4% in purchase originations, supported by leading efficiency metrics. While most originators take 45 days to close a refinancing loan, Rocket averages just 20 days, with more than half of loans now closing in under 15 days.\nThis speed advantage, enabled by continuous reinvestment in automation, highlights its structural edge. Mr. Cooper, the largest mortgage servicer with an 11% market share, further strengthens this platform. Its cost-to-service has fallen nearly 50% over five years, making it a key beneficiary of servicing rights sales from weaker peers under pressure in the high-rate environment. The merger of Rocket and Mr. Cooper creates a powerful ecosystem where servicing directly feeds origination, supported by Rocket’s industry-leading refinance recapture rate of ~85%, more than three times the industry average.\nThis integrated model challenges the traditional economics of the mortgage market, reducing costly customer reacquisition and creating durable competitive advantages. Beyond the combination’s inherent synergies, Rocket is leveraging AI to automate core workflows such as income and credit verification, further enhancing throughput, conversion, and customer experience. These efficiency gains not only improve profitability but also enable lower pricing for consumers, reinforcing share gains. Together, Rocket and Mr. Cooper position the company as a uniquely advantaged consolidator with significant upside potential.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Rocket Companies, Inc.

The company's share price closed out the daily session down 1% but had been down as much as 5.9% shortly before 10 a.m. ET. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) ended the day down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) was down 0.2%.\nWhile there doesn't appear to have been any major business news behind Palantir's valuation contraction today, the broader market saw moderate selling pressures that seem to have impacted the stock. The stock is now down 10% over the last week of trading and 16% from its all-time high.\nIs Palantir stock a buy right now?\nPalantir is one of the strongest overall players in the artificial intelligence (AI) software space, and it's been posting momentous sales and earnings growth. On the other hand, it's not as if the company hasn't already gotten a lot of valuation credit for its strong business growth and long-term expansion opportunities.\nTrading at approximately 90 times this year's expected sales and 242 times expected non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) adjusted earnings, Palantir has a valuation profile that stands out as being extraordinarily growth dependent even among the field of high-flying AI stocks. Despite the stock seeing a significant pullback from its all-time high, Palantir is still up 108% across 2025's trading and 1,840% over the last three years.\nRecent sell-offs connected to macroeconomic risk factors and concerns about the current state of practical business applications for AI technologies are a reminder of the high level of risk that comes with investing in a company that already has a lot of explosive growth priced into its valuation. Along those lines, Palantir is probably still too richly valued to be a sensible investment for investors without very high levels of risk tolerance.\nWhile I think the stock looks quite risky right now, I also think that it has a good chance of significantly outperforming the broader market over the next five years. In addition to very strong momentum with private-sector customers, Palantir's heavy exposure to the defense industry suggests that the stock comes with characteristics that help offset some of the risks associated with the biggest sources of potential geopolitical destabilization for the market.","content_hash":"1ccaf475f20e91b0da87f4bee897e4c8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2639,"method_rank":0}

The price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) has risen as well, skyrocketing 76% over the past year alone.\nThere's a general sense of optimism among investors with both stocks and cryptocurrencies, but if tougher economic times are ahead, some of the large returns they've experienced could experience a reversal. Bitcoin has proved to be a resilient cryptocurrency in the past, bouncing back after significant pullbacks. Is it worth buying Bitcoin while it's still under $120,000? Here's what investors should know.\nWhy Bitcoin's price continues to climb\nBitcoin began its most recent ascent after President Trump was elected to office late last year. The initial bump likely came as crypto investors anticipated that the Trump administration would be more favorable toward cryptocurrencies.\nThey weren't wrong. Since taking office, Trump has rolled back regulations on cryptocurrencies, announced a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dropped some lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies, and even launched his own meme coin. While these developments aren't necessarily good things, they have contributed to the rise in crypto prices, including Bitcoin's.\nMore importantly, Bitcoin has gained momentum as the coin has received wider institutional acceptance. Nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been launched over the past year, allowing investors an easy way to invest in Bitcoin's price changes. With large financial institutions now selling shares in Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin has a new level of credibility in the investment world.\nWhy Bitcoin could pull back soon\nWith its massive price gains of about 76% over the past year, there are some concerns that Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) is currently a bit frothy. For one, investors have been pushing Bitcoin higher as part of a general optimism in most investments, including the stock market, as the economy has shown resilience over the past few years.\nBut there have been some recent signs that the economy may be slowing. Revised hiring figures for May and June were much lower than previously thought, and July's hiring was slower than expected as well.","content_hash":"723378b90d92788b3fc57f22571bd291","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2637,"method_rank":0}

With nuclear energy emerging as a leading power solution for data centers that support artificial intelligence (AI) computing, investor appetite for small modular reactor (SMR) developers like Oklo has been strong for over a year now.\nWhen Oklo completed its business merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in May 2024, the market jumped at the opportunity to load up on Oklo stock, and the company raised about $306 million in proceeds from the transaction.\nBut how have investors who have held on to Oklo since May 2024 fared? Let's take a closer look at what a $1,000 investment one year ago would be worth today.\nInvestor interest in this nuclear energy stock has been electric\nOklo achieved some successes in the summer of 2024, but in November the company notched some major victories. For one, Oklo announced plans to partner with two major data center providers to deliver up to 750 megawatts (MW) of power for data centers across the U.S., bringing its pipeline to approximately 2,100 MW.\nInterest from data center companies has remained strong, and in July Oklo announced projects with Vertiv and Liberty Energy to explore how Oklo could support data center infrastructure.\nIn addition to data centers, Oklo broadened its interests with the acquisition of Atomic Alchemy, a specialist in radioisotope production.\nWhile there have been occasional downturns, Oklo stock has vastly outperformed the market over the past year. Investors who bought $1,000 in Oklo stock on Aug. 21, 2024, have seen their positions grow to $9,929 one year later.\nIs now the time to charge up your portfolio with Oklo?\nWith the company still preparing to start commercial operations, an investment in Oklo is still fairly speculative. For those seeking a more conservative option, a nuclear energy exchange-traded fund may help them scratch their itch for nuclear energy exposure while mitigating the risk of a single investment in Oklo stock.\nShould you buy stock in Oklo right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Oklo, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oklo wasn’t one of them.

Only Aave (14%) had a green week in the Top 20.\nIt could have been worse, but a flash flood of institutional and ecosystem momentum saved the week for Solana.\n-\nPantera Capital is raising up to $1.25 billion to launch Solana Co., a U.S.-listed firm designed to hold massive amounts of SOL.

On Wednesday, he unveiled a radical simplification of the miner's operations into three core business units: iron ore, copper, and a combined aluminium–lithium group.\nTrott, who previously headed the company's coveted iron ore division, said the changes would deliver sharper focus and greater accountability across the group.\n\"A simplified business structure, grounded in our fundamental commitment to safety and with a sharper focus on the most compelling opportunities we have, will enable us to deliver new standards of operational excellence and value creation,\" he said in a press release.\nAlso Read: Rio Tinto Posts Weakest Half-Year Profit In Years\nWith extensive knowledge of the iron ore business, Trott appointed industry veteran Matthew Holcz as the division leader. The consolidated unit will integrate Rio's vast Western Australian operations with the Iron Ore Company of Canada and, once developed, the giant Simandou project in Guinea.\nMeanwhile, the company is merging its lithium business with its aluminium portfolio. Jérôme Pécresse will manage the business, comprising Atlantic Operations Aluminium, Pacific Operations Aluminium, and Lithium. By combining downstream-focused businesses, Rio aims to drive efficiency, implement productivity initiatives, and strengthen its exposure to future-facing commodities.\nOther parts of the business are now under review. The miner's borates operation in California, its Richards Bay Minerals unit in South Africa, and the iron and titanium operations in Quebec have all been shifted to Chief Commercial Officer Bold Baatar for a strategic assessment. Those reviews could lead to divestments as the company narrows its focus on higher-return areas.\nThe overhaul also brings significant executive departures. Kellie Parker, who played a key role in repairing Rio's damaged reputation after the 2020 destruction of a sacred Indigenous site in Australia, will leave after 24 years with the group. Sinead Kaufman, head of minerals and once a contender for the chief executive post, is also departing.\nStrategic resets are not unusual following CEO appointments, but this time, they come at a turbulent period for the firm. Subdued iron ore and lithium prices, combined with rising costs, have dragged its half-year profit down to $4.8 billion in July – the lowest since 2020. Its minerals division, now under review, has been cash-flow negative for two years, with weak demand for borates and titanium weighing heavily on earnings.","content_hash":"7d25ee27aad399a12b9d6caa9e81cc62","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2618,"method_rank":0}

Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said there was no meeting planned between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine and that there \"needs to be an agenda first\" for a meeting to take place. \"This agenda is not ready at all.\"\nConcerns about higher OPEC production are negative for crude prices after OPEC+ on August 2 endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1. OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. OPEC July crude production fell by -20,000 bpd to 28.31 million bpd.\nAn increase in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bearish for oil prices. Vortexa reported today that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days rose by +11% w\/w to 96.77 million bbl in the week ended August 22.\nLast Wednesday's weekly EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of August 15 were -5.6% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -0.7% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -13.0% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending August 15 rose by +0.4% w\/w to 13.382 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd posted in the week of 12\/6\/2024.","content_hash":"8ac1524d8883896745e3019bccdf4d59","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2613,"method_rank":0}

In 2023 and 2024, workforce shortages, high labor costs and pressure from payers strained operators’ bottom lines.\nAlthough 2025 has brought fewer filings, the restructuring firm warned this month that the reprieve could be short lived, as operators brace for looming impacts of changes to federal healthcare programs, including cuts to Medicaid.\nIn first day court filings, ModivCare’s chief restructuring officer said industry headwinds had plagued the medical transportation firm.\nModivCare delivers in-home and on-site healthcare services, remote patient monitoring and transportation for non-emergency appointments. Its portfolio serves millions annually across 48 states and Washington, D.C., and employs over 23,600 employees, according to court documents.\nHowever, a large portion of ModivCare’s services involve supporting low-income patients on Medicaid.\nModivCare said it has already experienced financial pressures related to declining state reimbursements for Medicaid and predicts the financial strain will worsen next year as cuts from Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act begin.\nThe company said that many, “if not all,” of its most significant customers are at least considering budget cuts in response to the federal healthcare cuts, darkening ModivCare’s expectations for revenue in 2026.\nMeanwhile, ModivCare has also been impacted by broader challenges, including labor cost inflation, mounting competition for clients and Medicare Advantage plan design changes, which the company says have reduced coverage for supplemental benefits, like its services.","content_hash":"c34d93b95b75d249a19ca5b03965ccaf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2608,"method_rank":0}

If forecasters are correct, inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index grew at the same rate as in June.\n\"Core\" inflation, which excludes volatile prices for food and energy, is expected to have risen 2.9%, up from 2.8% in June. An uptick in that measure would be especially notable:. Officials at the Fed use PCE core inflation to judge whether inflation is running at the central bank's target of a 2% annual rate. It hasn't been under the central bank's goal for more than four years, and it is once again headed in the wrong direction as tariffs push up prices on store shelves.\nThis week's PCE report could be especially significant because it is the last one that Fed officials will see before Sept. 16 and 17, when the central bank's policy committee will meet to decide whether to cut interest rates.\nFinancial markets widely anticipate the Fed will cut its benchmark interest rate from its current higher-than-usual level of 4.25% to 4.5%. A lower fed funds rate would put downward pressure on interest rates, which could boost the job market at a time when hiring has slowed dramatically. However, a rate cut could take some of the downward pressure off of inflation at a time when businesses are passing the cost of President Donald Trump's widespread hikes of import taxes on to consumers. Trump has heavily pressured the Fed to cut interest rates.\n\"If it weren’t for all the politics, that would be another reminder that inflation is still running above the Fed’s target and not exactly crying out for a rate cut in September,\" Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a commentary.\nRead the original article on Investopedia","content_hash":"65a11b29db906767e89eaa18306f3f88","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2605,"method_rank":0}

The reversal of what had been steady inflows removed a key stabilizing factor.\nAt the same time, investor rotation into Ethereum has accelerated. ETH-linked products drew multi-billion-dollar inflows in August as the token outperformed Bitcoin, leaving BTC “temporarily lagging in the capital rotation cycle,” Zhao noted.\nOn-chain data also showed realized profits collapsing toward breakeven, reinforcing fading market conviction.\nShort-term rebounds have so far been unsustainable, with traders focusing on downside protection and hedging strategies.\nDespite weak retail sentiment, Zhao said institutional and sovereign buyers remain active. These players have been scaling into positions during the pullback, extending exposure while retail demand softens.\nBitcoin now sits at what Zhao described as a “critical inflexion point,” with two possible near-term paths: consolidation in the $110,000–$120,000 range or a break lower to test psychological support at $105,000–$100,000.\n“The absence of a fresh macro catalyst… is likely to drive BTC into a period of market consolidation as the market digests the recent distribution,” he said.","content_hash":"af73d96678eedae9a520ce5e5b5e6ad7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2604,"method_rank":0}

It’s down 4.86% at the time of writing, and is set to close in the red for the fourth August running.\n24h7d30d1yAll time\nMeanwhile, September tends to be one of Bitcoin’s weakest months, with an average drawdown of 4.68%.\nThat’s led Bitwise to warn that the current backdrop “tempers near-term bullish conviction” — with weaker inflows into exchange-traded funds suggesting that investors are reluctant to increase their exposure when prices are high.\nIt might not all be bad news though, and there are factors that could help BTC buck the trend next month. For one, we’re due to find out whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates for the first time in 2025, and this could prove to be bullish.\nData from CME FedWatch now shows there’s an 88.2% chance that the cost of borrowing will be slashed at the next Federal Open Markets Committee meeting — and that’s all thanks to the hints dropped by Jerome Powell last week.\n“Continuation of the Fed’s easing cycle would extend the U.S. recovery and crypto bull phase, though the upcoming framework review is expected to reaffirm a strict 2% inflation target.”\nBitwise also says Larry Fink’s ascension to interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum is a significant development — putting a “pro-Bitcoin, pro-tokenization advocate at the center of global policy dialogue.”\nLooking to Ether, the report adds that there appears to be a “structural rotation of risk away from Bitcoin dominance.” Authors also point to how the EU is considering whether to roll out its controversial digital euro on the Ethereum blockchain, which could amount to a ringing endorsement of this decentralized infrastructure.\n24h7d30d1yAll time\nBitwise went on to touch on the sluggish progress so far that the Trump administration has made in making a strategic Bitcoin reserve a reality — with uncertainty about how much BTC the government currently holds.\nBut it’s interesting to note that Brazil is currently examining whether to allocate up to 5% of its foreign reserves into BTC — the equivalent of $19 billion. That would equate to a warchest of about 173,000 coins at current market rates, and eclipse what the U.S. has planned. Given the government doesn’t own any coins at this point, this would also contribute to additional buying pressure if approved.","content_hash":"9067060557e9cc7c816ac2bf111fc203","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2596,"method_rank":0}

The brand hopes VaynerMedia can help it push the envelope and pivot in real time to capture relevant discussions, an embrace of risk in a typically conservative field. The partnership also aims to wed H&R’s brand-building initiatives closer to performance marketing.\n“Bringing social creative and media together under one partner isn’t just operationally efficient, it’s a competitive advantage,” said Cress in a statement. “VaynerMedia’s integrated approach fuels agility, sharpens our cultural edge, and ensures we’re building stronger connections with more customers, all year long by integrating H&R Block into daily interactions.”\nH&R Block in recent years has worked to evolve its marketing and customer service, tapping into TikTok content, generative artificial intelligence and subcultures like gaming.

In that time, its stock is up around 400%, far more than the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which is up around 14%, or any other S&P 500 stock in that span.\nLike many other stocks, Palantir has been a huge beneficiary of recent artificial intelligence (AI) hype, but there seems to be a specific reason Wall Street has increasingly become obsessed with the stock: the recent success of its commercial business.\nFor most of its existence, Palantir's main platform, Gotham, has been built mainly for government entities like the CIA, Department of Defense, and FBI. Although this has been a good business for Palantir, relying solely on government contracts could limit growth due to future budget constraints and political volatility.\nWith the introduction of Palantir's AI Platform (AIP) -- which is designed to use AI to automate operational processes -- it has shown that it can be successful in catering to commercial businesses. In the second quarter (Q2), Palantir's U.S. commercial business increased revenue 93% year over year to $306 million and accounted for around 30.5% of its total revenue.\nHere is how much the segment made in the previous three quarters:\n-\nQ1 2025: $255 million\n-\nQ4 2024: $214 million\n-\nQ3 2024: $179 milliom\n-\nQ2 2024: $159 million\nWith Palantir's commercial business showing promise, its total addressable market is always widening. The stock has admittedly become very expensive with Wall Street's obsession, but its long-term growth potential just became more promising.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

BeOne, formerly known as BeiGene, has rights to Imdelltra revenue because of a $2.7 billion collaboration deal it struck with Amgen in 2019.\n-\nPer deal terms, BeOne has the option to sell another chunk of Imdelltra royalties in the next year for $65 million, bringing the deal total to around $950 million. Royalty said the initial royalty stream amounted to “approximately 7%” of worldwide net sales.\n-\nLaunched in 2024 for small cell lung cancer, Imdelltra earned sales of $215 million through the first six months of 2025, most of it in the U.S. under an accelerated approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Amgen recently reported data from a clinical trial showing the drug extends survival compared with chemotherapy, which should secure its place on the market.\nDive Insight\nBeOne is now well established as a commercial drugmaker, recording total sales of $2.4 billion through the first six months of the year from drugs it developed as well as some of Amgen’s products in China. However, it also has significant expenses, burning about $2 billion over the same time — about half on research and development of its own drugs like Brukinsa and sonrotoclax.\nThat profit picture for the first half looks like it will be sustained for the full year, as BeOne’s executives forecast positive operating income and cash flow even before this deal was announced. The deal will only build on that momentum, executives said Monday.\n“A strong balance sheet is a hallmark of the most successful companies in our industry, and this transaction provides increased operational and strategic flexibility as we continue to execute our business strategy for the long term,” said CFO Aaron Rosenberg, in a statement.\nA so-called bispecific antibody, Imdelltra triggers an immune response to cells expressing a protein called DLL-3, common among tumor cells in small cell cancer, a hard-to-treat disease that until recently has had few innovative treatments. While Merck & Co.’s immunotherapy Keytruda and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Opdivo have gained approval for small cell lung cancer, they were withdrawn when confirmatory data didn’t support their use. Roche’s Tecentriq can be used in certain patients, however.","content_hash":"60b9b799212766aa21182e5c577b175b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2585,"method_rank":0}

Prices have also been under pressure over the past week and posted 2-week lows last Monday on the outlook for Brazil's sugar mills to increase production. Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.\nMore News from Barchart\nSugar prices have some support from signs of stronger global sugar demand.

Also, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said last month that 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Monday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 611.2 mm as of August 18, or 1% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices.

In Q3, the data center revenue more than doubled year-over-year, reflecting the growing demand for its products in the AI infrastructure space.\nA key driver has been Micron’s high-bandwidth memory (HBM) products, which are essential for training and running large AI models. The company has scaled production of its HBM3E line, now shipping in high volumes to major chipmakers. Looking ahead, its next-generation HBM4 is already sampling with customers and promises higher speeds and lower power consumption. With mass production scheduled for 2026, HBM4 could help maintain Micron’s leadership in this fast-growing market.\nMicron’s growth story extends well beyond data centers. In PCs, demand is strengthening as AI-enabled laptops hit the market and the Windows 11 upgrade cycle gathers pace. Micron is gaining share in client solid-state drives (SSDs), a trend that should continue to lift results.\nThe mobile segment is another bright spot. With AI pushing up memory needs in smartphones, Micron’s advanced DRAM and NAND solutions are increasingly in demand for flagship devices. Its latest LP5X memory is already shipping and seeing strong uptake.\nAutomotive and industrial markets are also contributing to growth. As cars incorporate more advanced driver-assistance systems and factories adopt AI-driven automation, demand for high-performance memory is climbing.

Conversational intelligence can help teams discover satisfaction patterns across all customers to better determine what is or isn’t working.\n“You still don't want to ignore outcomes, you don't want to ignore survey scores, you don't want to ignore CSAT or net promoter, but you want to have a deeper sense of what's driving those outcomes and what's controllable,” Cantor told CX Dive.\nConversational intelligence also offers the benefits of scale and speed, according to Andrew Custage, senior Director and head of research insights at Medallia. While surveys offer structured feedback, AI can process unstructured data in real time.\n“This allows organizations to act while the customer is still engaged with an agent, rather than waiting for periodic reviews that may happen days or weeks later,” Custage told CX Dive in an email. “AI is also essential for making sense of open-ended and unbiased feedback in these conversations, which creates a more complete and holistic view of the customer experience than surveys alone can provide.”","content_hash":"7a621fe27b0c2b707354d03b963e55c9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2581,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on IRM. Iron Mountain Incorporated's share was trading at $91.49 as of August 15th. IRM’s trailing and forward P\/E were 653.50 and 62.50 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nIron Mountain Incorporated (IRM) combines the stability of its long-standing records management business with the growth potential of its expanding data center operations, creating a compelling investment case. The company recently drew renewed interest after a re-entry at more attractive valuation levels in the second quarter of 2025, following a tax-loss harvesting exit earlier in the year. Its core records management segment provides a highly predictable and durable cash flow stream, underpinning steady growth and offering investors a defensive foundation.\nComplementing this stability, the data center business is positioned as the key driver of future expansion. With visibility to more than triple its current operational capacity, the data center segment is expected to deliver outsized growth that elevates the company’s overall financial trajectory. Management, led by CFO Barry Hytinen, continues to articulate a growth path of approximately 10% in total cash flow and high single-digit gains in per-share metrics over the coming years, reflecting both scale opportunities and operating leverage.\nThis blend of steady, recession-resilient revenue from records storage and high-growth upside from data centers makes IRM a unique hybrid in the infrastructure and technology landscape. The re-entry into shares reflects confidence that the company’s current positioning and valuation present an attractive risk\/reward profile, supported by clear visibility into growth drivers. As execution on data center expansion progresses and records management continues to provide reliable cash generation, IRM is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value, balancing defensive qualities with secular upside.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Weyerhaeuser Company (WY) by DB_SILVER_FOX in May 2025, which highlighted its timberland ownership, inflation-protected cash flows, and upside from carbon credits and real estate. The stock has appreciated about 2.41% since our coverage as the thesis partially played out. The thesis still stands given WY’s durable asset base.

Cook said Trump had no authority to fire her and she would not resign. Her term is due to end in 2038.\nThe unprecedented move by Trump could lead to a protracted legal battle that risks resetting norms for the central bank's independence and a president's involvement in monetary policy. Cook's exit from the Fed could speed up Trump's efforts to reshape the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy.\nTrump has been pushing the Fed to cut rates to stimulate growth and reduce borrowing costs.\nExpectations of a potentially more dovish Fed helped to send shorter-dated yields lower, while the yield curve steepened as the long end showed a more modest drop. Market participants said long-dated yields were likely to feel more upward pressure from political influence over the Fed, since a subsequent lowering of interest rates could increase worries about inflation, while foreign demand could be hit by fears over the Fed's credibility.\nDespite remaining inflation pressures, traders have been pricing in a 25-basis-point interest rate cut for the Fed's September policy meeting, encouraged by dovish signals from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, data pointing to labor market weakness and a shakeup at the central bank.\n\"On Friday, we had a major catalyst, which was a green light from the Fed to begin cutting rates.

CEO Dev Ittycheria noted that while AI is not yet a \"material driver\" of the company's growth, he noted that \"enterprise uptake of AI is still early.\" He went on to say that the \"real enduring value\" will come from custom AI solutions that will transform their businesses, and that MongoDB provides the tools that will help developers prosper.\nManagement gave investors other reasons to celebrate, as the company raised its full-year forecast for the second consecutive quarter. MongoDB is now guiding for fiscal 2026 revenue of $2.35 billion, or roughly 17% growth. The company also significantly increased its profit outlook to $3.68, up from $3.03 at the midpoint of its guidance. This shows the company is focusing on expanding its profit margins.\nMongoDB stock isn't cheap, selling for 11 times sales. However, that's roughly half its average multiple of 20 since the company's IPO in late 2017.","content_hash":"ddc129f311a02c160d6c76b94457f836","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2575,"method_rank":0}

Prices have also been under pressure over the past week and posted 2-week lows last Monday on the outlook for Brazil's sugar mills to increase production. Last Monday, Covrig Analytics reported that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.\nMore News from Barchart\nSugar prices have some support from signs of stronger global sugar demand. China's July sugar imports surged +76% to 740,000 MT, and Pakistan recently tendered for 200,000 MT of refined sugar.\nOn August 12, NY sugar rallied to a 2.5-month high on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. On August 15, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of July fell by -0.8% y\/y to 3,614 MT, and the 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through July fell -7.8% y\/y to 19,268 MT. However, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of July increased to 54.10% from 50.32% the same time last year. Also, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said last month that 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Monday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 611.2 mm as of August 18, or 1% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).","content_hash":"a6339a81e720c7ad4ab0c7366a8f1f91","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2574,"method_rank":0}

Two stocks that have posted impressive gains over the past three years are SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) and Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD), which have gained over 280% and more than 1,000%, respectively.\nBoth of these growth companies have carved out important niches in their respective markets, giving investors a unique way to invest in financial products. But of the two, which one is the better growth stock over the long term? Let's take a look.\nSoFi has rapidly expanded its financial services\nSoFi's growth has been nothing short of impressive over the past few years. The company boasts 11.7 million members now, an increase of 34% from the year-ago quarter. That amount of growth doesn't just happen by accident and shows SoFi's management has successfully rolled out financial services that resonate with customers.\nSoFi offers a variety of services, from personal loans to credit cards and bank accounts, and has attracted a loyal following among younger customers. The results financially speak for themselves, with sales rising 44% in the second quarter to $858 million and adjusted earnings skyrocketing 7 times to $0.08 per share.\nPart of the company's success has come from its fee-based revenue, like credit card fees, which rose 73% in the quarter to $378 million. The company's financial performance was so strong in the second quarter that management raised SoFi's full-year revenue guidance to about $3.4 billion -- a 31% jump from 2024.\nRobinhood is benefiting from a surging market\nRobinhood has benefited from an explosion of stock-buying interest over the past few years. The company's easy-to-use trading app is popular among younger investors, and the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, along with stocks, in the app allows Robinhood to appeal to a wide group of investors.\nIt's easy to see just how popular Robinhood's platform is based on its Q2 results alone, in which revenue rose 45% to $989 million and earnings surged 100% to $0.42 per share. Much of these gains were fueled by Robinhood's transaction-based revenue, which rose 65% in the quarter and showed that investors are eager to continue using the app to invest.","content_hash":"ec72de9c624f3c8ad0dd6b0473c95196","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2569,"method_rank":0}

Now, contentious former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli has weighed in on the debate with a clear verdict, calling the stock “close to worthless.” Thus, he is short-selling the counter, citing the company's weak fundamentals, especially its low gross margins.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nThis 3X Leveraged QQQ ETF Is Warning Traders of the Next Major Move\n-\nAs Trump Talks Intel Stake, Billionaires Can’t Get Enough of INTC Stock\nAbout Newegg Commerce\nFounded in 2001, Newegg Commerce is a tech-focused e-commerce retailer specializing in computer hardware, consumer electronics, gaming peripherals, and tech accessories. Rapid growth led to being named a top 10 internet retailer by 2005, with sales exceeding $1 billion, and rising to $1.3 billion by 2006.\nNewegg got listed in 2021 via a SPAC merger with Lianluo Smart, and currently commands a market cap of $4.21 billion.\nSo, is Shkreli right? Is the stock really “worthless?” It may not be worthless, but investors should still avoid the stock. Why? Let's find out.\nProfitability Concerns Overshadow Visible Improvement\nNewegg recently reported its results for the first six months of this year. Although there has been improvement, the company remains unprofitable.\nNet sales increased by 12.5% from the previous year to $695.67 million, as net losses narrowed to $4.2 million from about $25 million in the year-ago period. Cash outflow from operations narrowed as well, but then again it remained that, an outflow. Net cash outflow from operating activities stood at $49.9 million, which was $63.2 million for Jan-June 2024. Overall, the company closed the quarter with a cash balance of $59.1 million, higher than its short-term debt levels of $12.8 million.\nInterestingly, gross margins, the primary reason for Shkreli's short-selling stance, actually improved to 11.5% from 10.2%.\nShifting focus towards some key operational metrics, average order value increased to $467 in H1 2025 from $401 in H1 2024 as active customers also increased to 1.13 million from 1.09 million in the same period.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Social Media Today newsletter.\nElon Musk is embarking on yet another expensive, but likely fruitless, legal challenge against a market opponent, with Musk’s xAI lodging a lawsuit against both Apple and OpenAI over alleged market collusion, which is designed, xAI claims, to stifle potential competition.\nEarlier in the month, after the launch of xAI’s latest Grok 4 model, Musk accused Apple of deliberately restricting promotion of the Grok app, despite its clear popularity.\nAs per Musk:\n“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action.”\nWhich, of course, is incorrect.\nAs many have pointed out since Musk made this claim (and was even mentioned in a Community Note on Elon’s X post), many AI apps have reached the number one spot in the App Store rankings, including Perplexity, DeepSeek and Meta AI.\nBut for some reason, xAI has launched legal action on this basis either way, alleging that both Apple and OpenAI have \"locked up markets to maintain their monopolies and prevent innovators like X and xAI from competing.\"\nThe filing suggests that Apple’s partnership with OpenAI has driven the company to angle the market to benefit the company. Late last year, Apple reached a deal to integrate ChatGPT into its operating system for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, and xAI claims that this deal is why Apple is now penalizing xAI in its rankings.\n\"If not for its exclusive deal with OpenAI, Apple would have no reason to refrain from more prominently featuring the X app and the Grok app in its App Store.\"\nOr both X and Grok are just not as popular as Elon thinks. But logic aside, it seems that xAI is going to go ahead with its legal action on this basis, which seems unlikely to do anything, other than costing all parties more money.\nThough it could also backfire on Musk, by prompting Apple to take a closer eye at Elon’s apps, which may not pass the App Store qualifications around adult content or protection of kids. Indeed, the recent addition of NSFW AI companions on X could be due for App Store scrutiny, while Grok’s recent racist rants could also be problematic, if Apple were inclined to hit back at Musk’s companies.\nI mean, last time Elon decided to take on Apple, over app store fees, he shut up pretty quick when Apple informed him of such risks.","content_hash":"95c7b6e63837492e68482147c7b9a469","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2541,"method_rank":0}

That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July.\nNvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024.\nBut Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings.\nInvestors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending.\nWall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten Biden-era export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in lost revenue in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales to China in exchange for a 15% cut.

That’s partly due to challenges with connecting WM and Stericycle’s systems, CEO Jim Fish said during a Q2 earnings call. The company is making “significant progress” in resolving that, he said.\nWM expects the Stericycle segment to net between $80 million to $100 million in targeted synergies in 2025, executives said.\nStericycle resolved another unrelated court settlement earlier this year. In January, it agreed to pay a $9.5 million civil penalty for a series of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act violations related to shipping issues at the company’s former hazardous waste management business between 2014 and 2020. Stericycle operated a nationwide hazardous waste transportation, storage, treatment and disposal business until it sold that segment to Harsco, now known as Enviri, in 2020.\nEditor’s note: This story has been updated to include a statement from Stericycle.","content_hash":"c383a265faa78fff22fae78e1326c3e2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2509,"method_rank":0}

The practice drew renewed scrutiny from Congress in 2021, amid the so-called \"meme stocks\" frenzy when retail investors drove up the price of shares in GameStop and caused losses to hedge funds. In response, the SEC, led at the time by Democratic chair Gary Gensler, said it would introduce rules to increase transparency around short-selling.\nThe review will now fall to the SEC's new leadership, led by Paul Atkins, President Donald Trump's Republican SEC chair pick.\nAn SEC spokesperson said the regulator's rulemaking must take into account a thorough cost-benefit analysis.\n\"The Commission is reviewing the decision and will determine next steps as appropriate,\" the spokesperson said.\nThe hedge funds expect the agency will ultimately re-propose a new version of the rule rather than scrap it, according to one person familiar with their thinking.\nBryan Corbett, CEO of the MFA, the group which led the litigation, cheered the ruling in a statement.\n\"These regulations were fatally flawed from the start when the SEC adopted highly related rules on the same day without analyzing the impact one would have on the other,\" he said.\nThe associations have sued to overturn other new rules the SEC adopted in 2023 under Gensler, with the groups scoring some victories.\n(Reporting by Carolina Mandl, in New York; Editing by Andrea Ricci, Stephen Coates and Nia Williams)","content_hash":"a7a94f583a7245f61f37f830d87f75cb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2505,"method_rank":0}

The company's share price roared nearly 320% higher over the last year as artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a potentially massive performance driver for the business.\nAs a pioneer in small modular reactors (SMRs), NuScale could be well-positioned to win power contracts for AI data centers and other energy-intensive use cases. It's undoubtedly a very high-risk stock, but some scenarios could lead to it delivering huge returns.\nCan NuScale stock deliver 5x returns over the next five years?\nWith its second-quarter report, NuScale announced that revenue increased 710% year over year to reach $8.1 million. While that's very impressive growth on a relative scale, it also has to be viewed in the context of the company's roughly $10 billion market capitalization.\nThe result is also far less impressive when stacked against performance in the first quarter -- which saw the business post sales of $13.4 million. Smaller energy companies can see outsized levels of cyclicality when it comes to results, but the sequential quarterly sales decline raises questions about the growth thesis amid expansion trends in the broader AI infrastructure market.\nData centers for AI and other applications have enormously intensive power needs. While the near-term expansion of artificial intelligence will almost certainly see some unexpected twists and turns, the long-term outlook for AI technologies remains very promising.\nNuScale and other nuclear energy specialists will likely see some powerful sales catalysts connected to rising demand driven by the ongoing buildout of AI infrastructure. With that dynamic in mind, it's not impossible that NuScale could turn a $10,000 investment into $50,000 over the next five years.\nOn the other hand, some very strong growth is already priced into the company's valuation even though its stock has pulled back roughly 30% from its peak. While the stock could certainly bound well above current levels over the next five years, expecting fivefold returns could be overly optimistic.","content_hash":"8e1c545dfdba54de55464b2bc9cc0804","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2505,"method_rank":0}

The dollar fell against every major peer, though later trimmed losses as Cook said the president did not have authority to fire her and vowed not to resign.

The central bank has held monetary policy steady so far in 2025 amid concerns that Trump’s tariffs will fuel inflation, though on Friday Chair Jerome Powell signaled a potential adjustment in September. Lower rates tend to benefit non-yielding gold.\nForcing out Cook, who is facing allegations of mortgage fraud, would allow Trump to secure a four-person majority on the seven-member board. Earlier this month, he chose Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve in the place of Adriana Kugler, who vacated her position early.\n“Any pick would be seen as closely toeing the line to Trump’s demands for looser policy,” said Charu Chanana, a strategist at Saxo Capital Markets Pte. “For gold — that means support from increasing rate cut expectations, but also from investors hedging for longer-term inflation and institutional risks down the line.”\nThe precious metal has climbed by more than a quarter this year, with the bulk of those gains occurring in the first four months as heightened geopolitical and trade tensions spurred haven demand. Since hitting a peak above $3,500 an ounce in April, the metal has lacked fresh catalysts for advances — though several market watchers, including Citigroup Inc. and the wealth management unit of UBS Group AG, anticipate more upside later this year.\nTraders were also watching US personal consumption data due on Friday. The figure — excluding food and energy — is expected to accelerate at the fastest annual pace in five years, which could limit the Fed’s ability to lower rates.","content_hash":"897945cedd5e5f51def5f8dab6c38962","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2478,"method_rank":0}

Instead, Tesla rejected that offer, according to new legal filings that were first reported by Reuters.\nThe settlement proposal, which was made in May, was disclosed in a filing that requested Tesla cover legal fees for the plaintiffs in the case. A representative for the plaintiff’s attorney told TechCrunch that Tesla rejected the settlement by default because they were not accepted within the 30-day timeframe. That language is also in the recent court filing, as shown below.\n“Both Proposals for Settlement were served in compliance with and pursuant to Florida Rule ofCivil Procedure 1.442 and Fla. Stat. § 768.79. Tesla did not accept Plaintiffs’ Proposals for Settlement within thirty (30) days of service. Therefore, Tesla rejected the Proposals for Settlement by operation of the rule and statute.”\nEarlier this month, a jury in federal court in Miami found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash that involved the use of the company’s Autopilot driver assistance system. One person was killed when a Tesla Model S with Autopilot engaged plowed through an intersection and hit a Chevrolet Tahoe. The crash victims, Neima Benavides Leon and her boyfriend Dillon Angulo, were standing outside the vehicle on the shoulder at the time. Leon was killed while Angulo was severely injured.\nThe driver, who was not a defendant in this case, was sued separately for his responsibility. The lawsuit filed in 2021 against Tesla centered on Autopilot, which was engaged but did not brake in time to avoid going through the intersection. The jury assigned the driver two-thirds of the blame and attributed one-third to Tesla. As part of the verdict, the jury awarded the $242.5 million verdict as part of its decision.\nTesla, in a statement provided to TechCrunch earlier this month, said it plans to appeal the verdict “given the substantial errors of law and irregularities at trial.”\nTechCrunch has reached out to the plaintiffs’ attorneys as well as Tesla. An outside PR firm that previously provided statements on Tesla’s behalf declined to comment and directed TechCrunch to the company’s press address. Tesla disbanded its communications team several years ago.\nThe lawsuit, case 1:21-cv-21940-BB, was filed in 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.","content_hash":"e089adbf67818025a6cb3239c8614300","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2457,"method_rank":0}

(NYSE:HPQ) will release earnings results for the third quarter, after the closing bell on Wednesday, Aug. 27.\nAnalysts expect the Palo Alto, California-based company to report quarterly earnings at 75 cents per share, down from 83 cents per share in the year-ago period. HP projects to report quarterly revenue of $13.71 billion, compared to $13.52 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nWith the recent buzz around HP, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, HP offers an annual dividend yield of 4.29%, which is a semi-annual dividend amount of 29 cents per share ($1.16 a year).\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $139,696 or around 5,172 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $27,928 or around 1,034 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.16 in this case). So, $6,000 \/ $1.16 = 5,172 ($500 per month), and $1,200 \/ $1.16 = 1,034 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2\/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2\/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2\/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nHPQ Price Action: Shares of HP fell 1.8% to close at $27.01 on Tuesday.\nOn May 28, HP reported worse-than-expected second-quarter adjusted EPS results and issued third-quarter adjusted EPS guidance below estimates.\nRead More:\nImage: Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

One of those moves involves Nagle Companies, a temperature-controlled food transportation provider, which completed its acquisition of Kandel Transport Inc., an Akron-based refrigerated carrier. This strategic merger combines two family-oriented enterprises renowned for their unwavering commitment to safety and service excellence.\nFollowing the acquisition, the combined enterprise now operates a fleet of 115 tractors and 200 trailers, generating an estimated $45 million in annual revenue.\nThis expanded footprint enhances Nagle’s logistical network and positions the company to better navigate and anticipate market demands.\n“Kandel Transport has built a strong reputation for integrity, safety, and reliability,” said Ed Nagle, in a news release. “We saw early on that our companies shared not only the same values, but also complementary strengths. By joining forces, we’ll be able to provide enhanced resources, upgraded technology, and stronger network opportunities for our customers while supporting the talented team at Kandel.”\nOne of the most significant gains from the acquisition lies in Kandel Transport’s cross-border operations between the United States and Canada.\nAccording to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, in March 2025, Trucks moved $94.2 billion of freight, a 9.5% increase year over year, $67.5 billion with Canada and $77.3 billion with Mexico. Mexico may have moved into the top trading partner spot, but volumes between the U.S. and Canada aren’t a negligible amount.\nThe integration of these routes will not only smooth logistical flows across borders but also increase purchasing power in critical categories such as fuel, equipment, and parts, advantages Nagle anticipates will translate into operational efficiencies and cost benefits.\nDespite the operational integration underway, Kandel Transport will maintain its own branding and organizational structure for the time being. “This partnership allows Kandel to remain true to who we are while also giving us access to resources that will strengthen our long-term future,” said Jack Daniels of Kandel Transport, in a news release. “Our drivers, staff, and customers will benefit from the expanded opportunities, modern technology, and operational expertise that come with being part of the Nagle family.”\nThe post Nagel Companies completes merger with Kandel Transport appeared first on FreightWaves.","content_hash":"4da29b9bc6d44b0657c0102fc76b44e1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2442,"method_rank":0}

Worldwide Exchange airs at 5 a.m. ET each day.) Investors are looking at ways to play Nvidia earnings in the options market ahead of the latest report for the AI chip giant. Plus, a look at the industrial sector. Worldwide Exchange Pick: Industrials Stephanie Aliaga of JPMorgan sees more upside in industrials ahead of Nvidia earnings even with the sector gaining more than 16% year to date. Key to Aliaga's bull case are the capex investments by megacap tech names — with Alphabet , Amazon and Meta all announcing double-digit increases to their spending plans last quarter. \"Industrials have seen a really stellar run this year but we think this likely has more legs to come as investors continue to diversify their exposure from the mega caps and also access some of the opportunities coming from this capital infusion.\" \"We increasingly need to look beyond just the companies spending the money and where all that capital is flowing. We are in the midst of a significant capital spending boom,\" Aliaga added. Options market and Nvidia The options market is implying a 6% upside or downside move for Nvidia post earnings. Tom Sosnoff of Tastytrade said he sees significant risk for a move lower in the chipmaker. \"I'm definitely playing this earnings reports, I'm playing the downside small,\"' Sosnoff said. \"I think it's overpriced, I think the stock should be inside the expected move to the downside.\" He added valuation is a factor in his trade but may be less for most retail traders with Nvidia's forward PE sitting at 36. \"From a traders perspective, I think traders think it is rich … the PE ratios don't come into play as much as the general feel of how something is trading at these levels and it's the most valuable company in the world, I think that has to be considered a little rich.\" Tech trade ahead of Nvidia earnings David Royal of Thrivent said investors should maintain their tech holdings ahead of Nvidia earnings. \"We like Big Cap tech overall, we think the earnings power of Big Cap tech is strong. I wouldn't be lightening up on tech,\" said Royal. \"There is a lot of liquidity out there about $7 trillion dollars sitting in US money market funds, that's up from $4 trillion a few years ago, that money would easily find it's way into mega cap tech if Nvidia beats,\" he said.","content_hash":"9303f18e7244ae7130198a9cdc58b9c5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2419,"method_rank":0}

Artémis did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThis news comes after Puma released preliminary second-quarter results in July that were below expectations. In Q2 2025, Puma sales fell by 2 percent, in currency adjusted terms, to 1.94 billion euros.\nAt the time of the earnings release last month, Puma also made deep cuts to its guidance for the rest of the year.

Previously the company had been much more upbeat, predicting low growth and a positive EBIT — earnings before income and taxes — of somewhere between 445 million and 525 million euros. Now it expects a loss.\nBut the company is making strides in turning things around.\nIn April, Puma SE chief executive officer Arne Freundt stepped down from his role, with the company citing “differing views on strategy execution” as for why he left the brand.\nFreundt was replaced by Adidas veteran Arthur Hoeld, who took on the role as chairman and CEO on July 1.\nIn January, Puma implemented a cost savings plan after reporting lower than expected fourth-quarter sales and a drop in annual profit in its latest preliminary results. Dubbed “nextlevel,” Freundt described the initiative at the time as a comprehensive efficiency program targeting cost optimization and operational improvements.\nBest of WWD\nSign up for FN's Newsletter.

Artificial intelligence is the topic we love to hate, yet people, not to mention the media (guilty as charged), can’t stop talking about it.\nMost Read from Fast Company\n-\n4 ways to spot a self-centered person in 5 minutes or less, according to psychologists\n-\nThis man keeps buying and returning 110-pound anvils on Amazon\nYet the question most business leaders have is slightly different. They want to know how the AI revolution will affect their bottom line. A new report from Morgan Stanley looks into that—and here’s what it found.\nHow much will companies save?\nThe short answer, according to Morgan Stanley’s report, is that corporate adoption of AI has the capacity to reshape the future of work, saving businesses nearly $1 trillion a year.\nThe report, “AI Adoption and the Future of Work,” which was viewed by Fast Company, suggests S&P 500 companies could accrue annual net benefits totaling some $920 billion a year. The bank looked at potential future states of AI-driven labor impacts and saw benefits from cost reduction, as well as a productivity lift. A good portion of those savings could come from employing fewer people and from natural attrition as tasks are automated and productivity increases.\nThey also found that adopting AI could translate into some $13 trillion to $16 trillion in long-term market value creation potential for those S&P 500 companies.\nWhat’s the fine print?\nThe savings won’t come all at once. Morgan Stanley’s analysis shows there will be some up-front costs at the beginning of the rollout, and also the returns won’t come in for a while, likely years.\nSo, how will this affect my job?\nAccording to the bank’s report, 90% of jobs will be impacted by AI automation and augmentation to some extent—but that doesn’t mean all those jobs will become obsolete.\nWhich sectors are most exposed?\nAI could generate pre-tax savings in many industries. Sectors with the highest returns are consumer staples distribution, retail, real estate management, and development and transportation, which could see more than 100% of expected 2026 pretax profits.\nMeanwhile, the technology hardware and equipment and semiconductor sectors are not expected to save as much.\nThis post originally appeared at fastcompany.com\nSubscribe to get the Fast Company newsletter: http:\/\/fastcompany.com\/newsletters","content_hash":"bfaa0ec6410bfcb057827f7fbff1a9fa","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2389,"method_rank":0}

When combined with exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows since then, the combination of the two has purchased a staggering 4.9% of all ETH in circulation, the analyst noted.\nInvest in Gold\nAs a result the world's second-largest cryptocurrency hit a fresh all-time high of $4,955, on Sunday 24, Kendrick said.\nAlthough these inflows have been significant, the point, said Kendrick, is that they are just getting started. He previously estimated that the treasury companies would end up owning 10% of all ETH in circulation, a goal that definitely seems in reach.\nDespite the recent plunge in ETH, Kendrick is sticking with his previous forecast that ether would reach $7,500 by year-end. He views the sell-off to below $4,500 over the last two days as creating a great entry point.\nTurning to the valuation of ether treasury companies, Kendrick said they have continued to normalize. The mNAV multiples (the ratio of the value of their crypto holdings versus stock market capitalization) for Sharplink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion have declined, falling below that of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).\nGiven that the ether treasury companies are able to capture ETH’s 3% staking yield, Kendrick sees no reason for the mNAV multiples to be below that of MSTR (which captures no such staking yield).\nFurthermore, the SBET announcement on Friday that it will repurchase stock if the NAV multiple falls below 1.0, creates a hard floor for the ETH treasury multiples, he added.\nETH ETF Flows Remained Strong Despite Sell-Off\nDespite Monday’s market rout, which dragged ether (ETH) down 8% — about four times bitcoin’s (BTC) decline — investors in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) kept buying.\nThe funds saw about $444 million in inflows on Monday, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust's (ETHA) $315 milllion, according to Farside Investors.\nThat followed $338 million in inflows for the group on Friday when ether was soaring following dovish Jackson Hole remarks by Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nRead more: Ethereum Treasury Stocks 'Better Buy' Than ETH ETFs, Standard Chartered Says","content_hash":"158885a6101a42d6d278e34777a124ad","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2357,"method_rank":0}

On Monday, he moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud . Tuesday he said he will soon have a \" majority \" of his own nominees to push for a lower central bank overnight borrowing rate. \"People are paying too high an interest rate. That's the only problem with us. We have to get the rates down a little bit,\" said Trump. The bond market, however, is not reacting with lower rates. The benchmark 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields have actually moved higher this week. The former — used to price everything from credit card debt, mortgages and auto loans — traded near 4.29% on Wednesday, while the 30-year climbed to 4.95% — near the psychologically important 5% level.

Not only that, but the moves this week in the bond market defeat Trump's efforts to help out homeowners paying high interest rates. Mortgage rates are largely determined by where the 10-year and 30-year yields are trading, and when those two move higher, don't expect mortgage rates to come down anytime soon. Stocks would normally be under pressure when the bond market moves like this, as future profits becomes less valuable the higher interest rates go.

And as the institutional realization of the digital asset space comes about, the demand is going to increase.”\nThe firm sees Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as a gateway for investors who don’t want to handle custody themselves. “At a minimum, incorporating Ether into that portfolio starts leading you on the path to having a more diversified book of digital assets,” Gokhman said.\nLong-term outlook\nWhen asked about the future of demand, Gokhman described it as a “secular trend.” He acknowledged volatility in the short term, but said long-term catalysts such as regulation and broader use cases will keep driving interest.\n“You really need to be patient and calm through those bouts of volatility,” he said.\nAlthough he avoided specific price targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum, Gokhman stressed that institutionalization is reshaping the market.\n“As the market grows, it can start taking on really different characteristics.

But that would require sizable inflows, according to 10x Research's founder Markus Thielen.\n\"Some argue that bitcoin’s macro narrative alone is what matters, but without real capital flows, the price cannot rise.

At the time of writing, PENGU is trading at around $0.031, marking a 9% daily drop.\nHowever, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez believes this correction may be the best time to buy one of the top meme coins. Notably, PENGU has been forming a bullish flag channel on the 4-hour chart since August 9, a setup that often leads to major upward moves.\nIf confirmed, the token could rally as high as $0.10, representing a potential 300% gain.\nPENGU Price at Crossroads\nPENGU saw a major price rally between April and mid-July, surging around ten times during this time. However, since then, it has been consolidating inside a descending channel that began in mid-July.\nPENGU is currently testing the $0.030 support zone, which also aligns with a broader $0.025–$0.030 demand range. If the cryptocurrency fails to hold above $0.030, the next key support lies at $0.025, which could lead to further downside.\nAccording to the data by CoinMarketCap, PENGU price is down 25% in the past month, losing over $700 million in market cap.\nIf the meme coin manages to break out from this descending channel, traders should watch for immediate resistance at $0.0403. A decisive close above this level will confirm the beginning of a new uptrend.\nThe RSI is currently indicating neutral conditions on the daily chart. PENGU’s overall price action currently depends on the $0.030 support zone. Holding above this level could confirm a breakout toward $0.046 and beyond, while failure risks a drop to $0.025.\nThe price is approaching the lower Bollinger Band, which often points to a potential rebound if buyers defend this level. However, persistent weakness could see the meme coin drifting even lower.\nThe MACD histogram shows red bars, with the signal line above the MACD line.

Investors were still confident the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut rates in November.\nData from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday showed its monthly consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8% in July compared to a year earlier, up from 1.9% in June and well above median forecasts of 2.3%.\nThe trimmed mean measure of core inflation ran at an annual 2.7% in July, up from 2.1% in June. A measure excluding volatile items and holiday travel climbed to 3.2%, from 2.5%.\nIn the month, CPI rose 0.9% from June.\nThe bureau said the spike was driven by electricity prices, which jumped 13% in July as households in the state of New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory did not receive federal government electricity rebates.\n\"This means that those households had higher out-of-pocket costs for electricity in July. In addition to this, prices rose due to annual electricity price reviews coming into effect,\" said Michelle Marquardt, head of prices statistics.\nShe added that those households will receive the rebates in August.\nThe RBA cut interest rates for a third time this month and opened the door to more policy easing as inflation cooled. The board said the pace of easing over the next year could be gradual or quicker depending on the flow of economic data.\nThe RBA forecast headline inflation - which ran at 2.1% last quarter - to pick up to 3.1% by mid-next year as electricity rebates fade, but core inflation is expected to stay anchored around 2.6% over the coming years.\nThe inflation update for the first month of the quarter only covers a portion of the full CPI basket and is concentrated on goods rather than services. The statistics bureau will have the full monthly inflation data from November onwards.\nWednesday's report showed rents rose 3.9% in the 12 months to July, the lowest annual growth since late 2022, while clothing and footwear rose a chunky 1.7% in the month.","content_hash":"8fb31ab43395ac9b1e97155727c806d3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2157,"method_rank":0}

The price target adjustment largely stems from heightened competitive risks, particularly in AI workloads.\nThe firm discussed three points related to Elastic’s results:\n“Three points into results: (1) Elevated scrutiny on the predictability of paid open-source models. (2) Elastic’s participation in the AI theme. (3) FY26 revenue growth guidance. ESTC shares are trading at a 22% discount multiple to infrastructure software peers (i.e., 4.5x CY26E revenue vs. 5.8x peers). However, we believe the risk\/reward is balanced, as recent checks suggest competition for AI workloads is increasing. This could weigh on Elastic’s revenue growth. We believe the key metric is subscription revenue excluding monthly customers, where if growth accelerates to 20%+ y\/y, from +19.3% last quarter, it could be a catalyst. Reiterate Neutral, lower PO to $96 (from $104) on higher competitive risks. PO now based on 5.3x EV\/CY26E revenue (was 5.9x) vs peers at 5.8x.”\nA person with stock market data on a laptop.
