Since the announcement, analysts have published estimates on how much more customers will end up paying. But for investors trying to figure out what it all means to Microsoft's financials, analysts at UBS said the change is already factored into guidance.
""In our view, it is safe to assume that the impact of the pricing change"" was included in Microsoft's forecast, the analysts wrote in a report late Tuesday. They have a buy rating on the stock.
Microsoft's disclosure, on Aug. 12, came two weeks after the software company, it its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, issued a forecast that included double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the new fiscal year. The shares rose 4% after the report.
Microsoft said in its blog post announcing the pricing change that, ""This update builds on the consistent pricing model already in place for services like Azure and reflects our ongoing commitment to greater transparency and alignment across all purchasing channels.""
The change applies to companies with enough employees to get them into price levels known as A, B, C and D. It goes into effect when organizations sign up for new services or renew existing agreements, beginning on Nov. 1.
""This action allows us to deliver more consistent and transparent pricing and better enable clear, informed decision making for customers and partners,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email.
Jay Cuthrell, product chief at Microsoft partner NexusTek, said customers will see price hikes of 6% to 12%. Partners are estimating an impact as low as as 3% and as high as 14%, UBS analysts wrote.
Microsoft 365 commercial seat growth, a measurement of the number of licenses that clients buy for their workers, has been under 10% since 2023. Microsoft is aiming to generate more revenue per seat by selling Copilot add-ons and moving some users to more expensive plans.
Expanding that part of the business is crucial. Most of Microsoft's $128.5 billion in fiscal 2025 operating profit came from the Productivity and Business Processes unit, and about 73% of the revenue in that segment was from Microsoft 365 commercial products and cloud services.
Some customers could agree to pay Microsoft more to keep using the applications rather than moving to alternative services, said Adam Mansfield, practice lead at advisory firm UpperEdge. They may also lower their commitments to Microsoft in other areas, such as Azure cloud infrastructure, Mansfield said.
One way companies could potentially pay lower prices with the disappearance of discounts is by buying through cloud resellers instead of going direct, said Nathan Taylor, a senior vice president at Sourcepass, an IT service provider that caters to small businesses.
Sourcepass hasn't gotten many leads as a result of Microsoft's change yet, Taylor said.
""It takes a while for that information to disseminate to the industry at large,"" he said.
Microsoft shares are up 20% this year, while the Nasdaq has gained about 10%.

The new restrictions come in the wake of last month's sweeping hacking attempts against Microsoft SharePoint servers, at least some of which Microsoft and others have blamed on Beijing. That raised suspicions among several cybersecurity experts that there was a leak in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), which Microsoft uses to help security vendors worldwide, including in China, to learn about cyber threats before the general public so they can better defend against hackers.
Beijing has denied involvement in any SharePoint hacking.
Microsoft notified members of the MAPP program of the SharePoint vulnerabilities on June 24, July 3 and July 7, Reuters has previously reported. Because Microsoft said it first observed exploitation attempts on July 7, the timing led some experts to allege that the likeliest scenario for the sudden explosion in hacking attempts was because a rogue member of the MAPP program misused the information.
In a statement, Microsoft said several Chinese firms would no longer receive ""proof of concept code,"" which mimics the operation of genuine malicious software. Proof of concept code can help cybersecurity professionals seeking to harden their systems in a hurry, but it can also be repurposed by hackers to get a jump start on the defenders.
Microsoft said it was aware that the information it provided its partners could be exploited, ""which is why we take steps – both known and confidential – to prevent misuse. We continuously review participants and suspend or remove them if we find they violated their contract with us which includes a prohibition on participating in offensive attacks.""
Microsoft declined to disclose the status of its investigation of the hacking or go into specifics about which companies had been restricted.",a0362f4db3f08b6a67eb9c00a1c6be23,trafilatura

U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman in Austin, Texas, said Jacqueline McAferty plausibly alleged in her proposed class action that Musk and his political action committee America PAC wrongly induced her to provide personal identifying information as part of the giveaway, late in the 2024 election campaign.
Lawyers for Musk and America PAC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Musk founded America PAC to support Republican Donald Trump's successful 2024 presidential run.
McAferty, an Arizona resident, said Musk and America PAC induced voters in seven battleground states to sign his petition by promising that $1 million recipients would be chosen randomly, as in a lottery, though the voters had no real chance to collect.
She said voters who signed were also required to provide names, addresses, email addresses and phone numbers.
In seeking a dismissal, Musk listed several ""red flags"" as proof he had not run an illegal lottery.
He said these included statements that the $1 million recipients were ""selected to earn"" the money and expected to become America PAC spokespeople, defeating the idea that the payment was a ""prize.""
But the judge cited other statements suggesting the defendants were ""awarding"" the $1 million, and the money could be ""won.""
""It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery--even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do,"" Pitman wrote.
The judge was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2014.
Musk had also rejected the suggestion that petition signers suffered harm by providing contact information. Pitman said an expert in political data brokerage could testify what that information was worth for voters in battleground states.
The lawsuit was filed on Election Day, Nov. 5, 2024.
A day earlier, a Philadelphia judge refused to end Musk's giveaway, saying that the city's top prosecutor failed to show it was an illegal lottery.

Despite India being one of the earliest nations to engage in negotiations with the Trump administration, there is still no sign of it sealing a deal with the U.S. New Delhi is now also staring at a secondary tariff of 25% or a ""penalty"" for its purchases of Russian oil that is set to come into effect later this month.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday escalated criticism against India, accusing it of profiteering from cheap Russian oil imports and threatening to further raise tariffs on Indian goods.
""We have planned to up the tariffs on India — these are secondary tariffs for buying the sanctioned Russian oil,"" Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday.
Earlier this week, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro condemned the Asian giant's dependence on Russian oil as ""opportunistic"" and undermined international efforts to isolate Russia's war economy.
""India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs,"" Navarro said in an op-ed for the Financial Times.
By now the world is getting used to the ad-hoc and sometimes contradictory ways in which the Trump administration is pursuing its agenda.Bert HofmanProfessor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore
The sharp rhetoric threatens to unravel years of improving ties between Washington and New Delhi — with India saying the U.S. was targeting it unfairly over its Russian oil purchases.
""By now the world is getting used to the ad-hoc and sometimes contradictory ways in which the Trump administration is pursuing its agenda,"" said Bert Hofman, professor at the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore.
India has emerged as a leading buyer of Russian oil, which has been sold at a discount since some Western nations shunned purchases and imposed restrictions on Russian exports over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
It was the second-largest purchaser of Russian oil, importing 1.6 million barrels per day in the first half of this year, up from 50,000 bpd in 2020, though still trailing China's 2 million bpd imports, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Washington has not placed secondary tariffs on China for its Russian oil purchases.
India has reiterated that it was the U.S. administration that had asked it to purchase Russian oil to keep the markets calm, while pointing to the European Union and even the U.S.' existing trade with Moscow.
The country has taken aim at Washington, saying U.S. continues to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for the electric-vehicle industry, as well as fertilizers and chemicals from Russia. U.S. bilateral trade with Russia in 2024 stood at $5.2 billion, down from nearly $36 billion in 2021, government data showed.
Bilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025. In comparison, the European Union's trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data.
""India has been victimized by these pressure tactics that that the Trump administration is trying to carry out. Trump is clearly using tariffs as a pressure tactic against Russia,"" Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at Washington-based think tank Wilson Center, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""
Another factor determining the U.S. approach to India is that Trump feels ""aggrieved,"" over how Modi undercut his bid to claim credit for playing a role in the India-Pakistan ceasefire, Kugelman emphasized.
Adding to Trump's grievances is India's ""unwillingness to lower barriers"" to exports of American agricultural products such as soybeans and corn, Kevin Chen Xian An, associate research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies pointed out.
Oil trade for ceasefire
Trump's true agenda has little to do with Washington's stated goal of curbing Moscow's oil revenues, but extracting leverages from the trading partners, according to several geopolitics experts.
""The overarching objective for the Trump administration is to extract concessions from countries to figure out some justification for levying taxes on trade so that the government can fund its tax reductions on American citizens' income,"" said Drew Thompson, senior fellow at the think-tank RSIS.
""It's not based on foreign policy principles [but] on power politics and gaining leverage,"" Thompson added.
Last week, Trump rolled out a red carpet to greet Putin on his first visit to the U.S. in about a decade, sharing a ride with him in the presidential limousine to the venue.
While the meeting did not appear to have produced meaningful steps toward a ceasefire in Ukraine — a goal U.S. had set ahead of the summit — but Trump described the meeting as ""productive.""
Speaking at the joint news briefing following the talks, Putin reiterated that ""for the conflict resolution in Ukraine to be long-term and lasting, all the root causes of the crisis ... must be eliminated; all of Russia's legitimate concerns must be taken into account.""
Kirill Dmitriev, one of Putin's top negotiators, hailed Monday's talks in Washington as an ""important day of diplomacy,"" emphasizing Moscow's opposition to any short-term ceasefire deal with Ukraine.
Trump is trying to ""maximize his leverage ... pressuring India, and Russia via India,"" to get a trade deal with the former and a ceasefire pact with the latter, said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical and U.S. strategist at BCA Research. These will eventually help boost Republicans' prospects in the upcoming midterm election, Gertken added.
Not provoking China
While India faces steep tariffs for its purchases of Russian crude, China, which has remained the largest importer of Russian crude, has been spared such levies. Trump said last Friday he was not considering retaliatory tariffs on China for buying Russian oil, but might consider it in two or three weeks.
China's purchases of Russian oil have risen to 46% of overall exports from Russia in the first half of this year, from 34% in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, followed by India which imported around 36% of Russia's supplies.
When asked about China's role in Russian oil purchases, Bessent suggested that Beijing's imports were less egregious in the eyes of the Trump administration because it had already been a big buyer even before Russia invaded Ukraine.
Going soft on China may also reflect Trump's desire not to scuttle a potential high-profile summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming months and the conclusion of a lasting trade deal, said Stephen Olson, a senior visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.
The secondary tariffs on India may be intended as ""a shot across Russia's bow"" to show that the U.S. could turn up the pressure by extending similar tariffs to China, if Russia is not more compliant, Olson added.
Following weeks of escalating tensions, Beijing and Washington agreed in May to suspend the hefty duties and loosen several punitive measures imposed in April, as both sides continued to work on hammering out a durable deal.
Beijing has leveraged its sheer dominance of rare-earth minerals crucial for military and industrial use in its negotiations with Washington, maintaining a tight control on exports of the critical minerals.
The relationship with China is complicated, and the Trump administration has not yet come out with ""a clear, coherent policy toward China. Sometimes it seems like it wants to compete with China economically. Other times it seems like it wants to reach some type of understanding or a or a detente,"" Kugelman said.",90d16c0564d3d5d64e23aa1a4fdc2c4d,trafilatura

For the second day in a row, tech stocks dragged markets lower, with the Nasdaq Composite slipping 0.67%. Juggernauts such as Apple, Amazon and Alphabet were more meh-nificent than magnificent, falling more than 1%.
Palantir — the standout S&P 500 stock, having more than doubled so far this year — spent its sixth consecutive day in the red and lost its place among a ranking of the 20 most valuable U.S. companies.
While Palantir's slide was partly triggered by a report from short seller Andrew Left's Citron Research, which called the company ""detached from fundamentals and analysis,"" there was no single trigger for the broader pullback.
Investors could have been spooked by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's caution about an AI bubble forming, although some analysts dispute that assertion. ""In our view the tech bull cycle will be well intact at least for another 2-3 years,"" said Wall Street tech bull Dan Ives.
Or it could be something benign, like traders locking in profits. ""Tech stocks,"" said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, ""have had an incredibly strong run – with some up over 80% since the early April lows.""
Summer, after all, is far from over. Some investors might have just wanted to cash out for another round of margaritas.

For the second day in a row, tech stocks dragged markets lower, with the Nasdaq Composite slipping 0.67%. Juggernauts such as Apple, Amazon and Alphabet were more meh-nificent than magnificent, falling more than 1%.
Palantir — the standout S&P 500 stock, having more than doubled so far this year — spent its sixth consecutive day in the red and lost its place among a ranking of the 20 most valuable U.S. companies.
While Palantir's slide was partly triggered by a report from short seller Andrew Left's Citron Research, which called the company ""detached from fundamentals and analysis,"" there was no single trigger for the broader pullback.
Investors could have been spooked by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's caution about an AI bubble forming, although some analysts dispute that assertion. ""In our view the tech bull cycle will be well intact at least for another 2-3 years,"" said Wall Street tech bull Dan Ives.
Or it could be something benign, like traders locking in profits. ""Tech stocks,"" said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth, ""have had an incredibly strong run – with some up over 80% since the early April lows.""
Summer, after all, is far from over. Some investors might have just wanted to cash out for another round of margaritas.
What you need to know today
Fed officials divided over inflation and employment worries. Central bank governors generally agreed there were risks on both sides. But a couple — breaking from the majority — saw the labor market woes as more pressing, according to minutes of the Fed's July meeting.
Trump likely to pick Kevin Hassett as next Fed Chair. The director of the National Economic Council firmly led the pack, according to a CNBC Fed Survey. However, respondents think the president ""should"" pick former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.
No new solar or wind power projects, Trump says. Renewable energy projects will no longer receive approval, Trump posted Wednesday on Truth Social. His comment comes after the administration already tightened federal permitting last month.
Fourth day of losses for the S&P 500. Investors continued selling off technology stocks on Wednesday, with Palantir having its sixth straight losing day. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed at another high despite inflation in July coming in hotter than expected.
[PRO] The Fed is expected to cut just as markets trade at highs. This is what tends to happen when both factors coincide, according to Goldman Sachs research.
And finally...
Trump has snapped up more than $100 million in bonds since taking office
U.S. President Donald Trump has been on a multimillion-dollar bond-buying spree since taking office in January, investing in debt issued by local authorities, gas districts and major American corporations.
Across 33 pages of filings with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, or OGE, dated Aug. 12, the president outlined 690 transactions that have taken place since he took office. The documents were made public on Tuesday.

Masimo said in the lawsuit in Washington, D.C., federal court that Customs improperly determined that Apple can import watches with pulse oximetry technology, reversing its own decision from last year without notifying Masimo.
Masimo told the court that it learned of the agency's August 1 decision only after Apple announced it would reintroduce blood-oxygen reading to its watches last week.
Spokespeople for Apple and Customs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Masimo spokesperson declined to comment.
Irvine, California-based Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology to use in its Apple Watches. Masimo has separately sued Apple for patent infringement and trade secret theft in ongoing federal court cases.
Masimo convinced the U.S. International Trade Commission to block imports of Apple's Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in 2023 based on a determination that Apple's technology for reading blood oxygen levels infringed Masimo's patents.
Apple has continued to sell Customs-approved redesigned watches without pulse oximetry since the ITC's decision.
Apple said on Aug. 14 that it would reintroduce its smartwatches' blood-oxygen reading capabilities with approval from Customs. Masimo said the agency's decision to approve the watches without input from Masimo or any ""meaningful justification"" deprived the company of its rights.
""CBP's function is to enforce ITC exclusion orders, not to create loopholes that render them ineffective,"" Masimo said.
Masimo asked the Washington court to halt the agency's ruling and continue to block Apple from selling watches with the blood-oxygen feature.",ccd01958426e1ed9c5361ff69bc82ea9,trafilatura

The S&P Global flash Japan Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index increased to 49.9 in August from July's final 48.9, but it remained below the 50.0 threshold that separates growth from contraction for two straight months.
""The recovery in manufacturing output may be hard to sustain unless we see an improvement in sales in the near-term,"" said Annabel Fiddes, Economics Associate Director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, which compiled the survey.
Manufacturing output showed a modest recovery, with the output index rebounding to growth from a contraction logged in July. However, new orders continued to decline, reflecting weak demand both domestically and internationally.
Foreign orders for Japanese goods fell at the fastest pace in 17 months, underscoring the fragility of the export-reliant manufacturing sector.
Official trade data showed on Wednesday Japan's exports in July posted the steepest drop since February 2021 given the intensifying impact of U.S. tariffs.
The U.S.-Japan trade deal reached last month would lower Trump's tariffs on Japanese goods to 15%. Some manufacturers grew more confident about business conditions but overall remained cautious, a Reuters poll found earlier this month.
For manufacturers, input costs also edged up, while selling price inflation eased to its lowest in more than four years, the PMI data showed, indicating higher pressure on profit margins.
In the services sector, activity continued to expand but at a slower pace, with the flash services PMI falling to 52.7 in August from July's final 53.6.

The big-box retailer topped Wall Street's quarterly sales estimates but fell short of earnings expectations, the first time it missed on quarterly earnings since May 2022. The company said it felt pressure on profits for the period, including from some one-time expenses, such as restructuring costs, pricier insurance claims and litigation settlements.
Walmart said it now expects net sales to grow between 3.75% and 4.75% for the fiscal year, up from its previous expectations for 3% to 4%. It raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook slightly to $2.52 to $2.62, up from a prior range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.
In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company is working hard to keep prices low – including speeding up imports from overseas and stepping up the number of Rollbacks, or limited-time discounts, in its stores.
""This is managed on an item-by-item and category-by-category basis,"" he said. ""There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we've had to pass some of those costs along.""
But he added ""tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.""
Even so, Rainey said Walmart hasn't seen a change in customer spending. For example, sales of private-label items, which typically cost less than national brands, were roughly flat year over year, he said.
""Everyone is looking to see if there are any creaks in the armor or anything that's happening with the consumer, but it's been very consistent,"" he said. ""They continue to be very resilient.""
Yet on the company's earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said middle- and lower-income households have been more sensitive to tariff-related price increases, particularly in discretionary categories.
""We see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items, or in some cases, categories,"" he said.
Here's what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:
- Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 74 cents expected
- Revenue: $177.40 billion vs. $176.16 billion
Walmart shares fell 4% in morning trading Thursday.
Walmart's net income jumped to $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including legal charges, Walmart reported adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents.
Revenue rose from $169.34 billion in the year-ago quarter.
Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. climbed 4.6% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, as both the grocery and health and wellness category saw strong growth. That was higher than the 4% increase that analysts expected. The industry metric, also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.
At Sam's Club, comparable sales jumped 5.9% excluding fuel, higher than the 5.2% that analysts anticipated.
E-commerce sales jumped 25% globally and 26% in the U.S., as both online purchases and advertising grew. In the U.S., Walmart said sales through store-fulfilled delivery of groceries and other items grew nearly 50% year over year, with one-third of those orders expedited. The company charges a fee for some of those faster deliveries, and others are included as a benefit of its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+.
Its global advertising business grew 46% year over year, including Vizio, the smart TV maker it acquired for $2.3 billion last year. Its U.S. advertising business, Walmart Connect, grew by 31%.
As Walmart's online business drums up more revenue from home deliveries, advertising and commissions from sellers on its third-party marketplace, e-commerce has become a profitable business. The company marked a milestone in May — posting its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally.
Rainey said Thursday that Walmart doubled its e-commerce profitability in the fiscal second quarter from the prior quarter.
In the U.S., shoppers both visited Walmart more and spent more on those trips during the quarter. Customer transactions rose 1.5% year over year and the average ticket increased 3.1% for Walmart's U.S. business.
As the largest U.S. retailer, Walmart offers a unique window into the financial health of American households. As higher duties have come in fits and starts — with some getting delayed and others going into effect earlier this month — Wall Street has tried to understand how those costs will ripple through the U.S. economy.
Walmart warned in May that it would have to raise some prices due to higher levies on imports, even with its size and scale. The company's comments drew the ire of President Donald Trump, who said in a social media post that Walmart should ""EAT THE TARIFFS.""
About a third of what Walmart sells in the U.S. comes from other parts of the world, with China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam and India representing its largest markets for imports, Rainey said in May.
According to an analysis by CNBC of about 50 items sold by the retailer, some of those price changes have already hit shelves. Items that rose in price at Walmart over the summer included a frying pan, a pair of jeans and a car seat.
Rainey on Thursday declined to specify items or categories where Walmart had increased prices, saying the company is ""trying to keep prices as low as we can.""
He said one of the company's strategies has been bringing in inventory early, particularly for Sam's Club as it gets ready for the second half of the fiscal year and its crucial holiday season. At the end of the quarter, inventory was up about 3.5% at Sam's Club, Rainey said. It was up 2.2% for Walmart U.S.
On the company's earnings call, McMillon said the impact of tariffs has been ""gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.""
""But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters,"" he said.
Yet even with higher costs from tariffs, Walmart has fared better than its retail competitors as it has leaned into its reputation for value, competed on faster deliveries to customers' homes and attracted more business from higher-income households.
The Arkansas-based retailer's performance has diverged sharply from rival Target, which posted another quarter of sales declines on Wednesday and named the new CEO who will be tasked with trying to turn around the company.
Walmart has gained from Target's struggles. It has followed the Target playbook by launching more exclusive and trend-driven brands, including grocery brand BetterGoods and activewear brand Love & Sports. It has also expanded its third-party marketplace to include prestige beauty brands and more.
Sales of general merchandise, items outside of the grocery department, were a bright spot for Walmart in the fiscal second quarter, Rainey said. That category struggled during peak inflation in recent years, as consumers spent less on discretionary items because of rising grocery bills.
Comparable sales for general merchandise rose by a low single-digit percentage and accelerated throughout the quarter, Rainey told CNBC. He added clothing and fashion sales ""really shined for us.""",cc97a8bc9df8c2354747a34a56b55c14,trafilatura

The pause was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, which said it went into effect last week amid a broader restructuring of the group, citing people familiar with the matter.
In a statement shared with CNBC, a Meta spokesperson said that the pause was simply ""some basic organizational planning: creating a solid structure for our new superintelligence efforts after bringing people on board and undertaking yearly budgeting and planning exercises.""
According to the WSJ report, a recent restructuring inside Meta has divided its AI efforts into four teams. That includes a team focused on building machine superintelligence, dubbed the ""TBD lab,"" or ""To Be Determined,"" an AI products division, an infrastructure division, and a division that focuses on longer-term projects and exploration.
It added that all four groups belong to ""Meta Superintelligence Labs,"" a name that reflects Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's desire to build AI that surpasses human intelligence.
In pursuit of that goal, Meta has been aggressively spending on AI this year. That included efforts to poach top talent from other AI companies, with offers said to include signing bonuses as high as $100 million.
In one of its most aggressive moves, Meta acquired Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, as part of a deal that saw the Facebook parent dish out $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the AI startup.
Wang now leads the company's AI lab focused on advancing its Llama series of open-source large language models.
Too much spending?
While Meta's aggressive hiring strategy has caught headlines in recent months for their high price tags, other megacap tech companies have also been pouring billions into AI talent, as well as R&D and AI infrastructure.
However, the sudden AI hiring pause by the owner of Facebook and Instagram comes amid growing concerns that investments in AI are moving too fast and a broader sell-off of U.S. technology stocks this week.
Earlier this week, it was reported that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had told a group of journalists that he believes AI is in a bubble.
However, many tech analysts and investors disagree with the notion of an AI bubble.
""Altman is the golden child of the AI Revolution, and there could be aspects of the AI food chain that show some froth over time, but overall, we believe tech stocks are undervalued relative to this 4th Industrial Revolution,"" said tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.
He also dismissed the idea that Meta might be cutting back on AI spending in a meaningful way, saying that Meta is simply in ""digestion mode"" after a massive spending spree.
""After making several acquisition-sized offers and hires in the nine-figure range, I see the hiring freeze as a natural resting point for Meta,"" added Daniel Newman, CEO at Futurum Group.
Before pouring more investment into its AI teams, the company likely needs time to place and access its new talent and determine whether they are ready to make the type of breakthroughs the company is looking for, he added.",0bbcff73b7268f4e113f128ca77a7274,trafilatura

Chancellor Friedrich Merz campaigned on a pro-business and pro-economic growth platform, vowing reforms and investment that sparked hope in the business community. Optimism was further boosted when coalition negotiations between Merz's Christian Democratic Union, alongside its sister party the Christian Social Union, and the Social Democratic Party, triggered a major fiscal shift that is set to enable higher spending on defense and infrastructure.
The CDU, CSU, and SPD now form Germany's coalition government, and the sense of enthusiasm from businesses has persisted as the coalition's political term has gotten underway, according to business leaders who have spoken to CNBC in recent weeks.
""We have, as you heard before, a minimum of 10, maybe 20, years of weak political decisions, very ideologically driven, not business driven, not society driven, and it seems to be that the new government is going in a different direction,"" Thomas Schulz, CEO of construction company Bilfinger, said earlier this month.
Elsewhere, financial services provider Allianz's CEO Oliver Bäte welcomed the new government's approach to take competitiveness seriously, with Merz having repeatedly pledged to get Germany's industry back on track to push for global leadership.
""I can only applaud them for taking it seriously, to also mobilize financial reserves to put an unheard of investment program into place, and also end almost two decades of lethargy of under investment in infrastructure, under investment in military, defense [and] under investment in education,"" he said.
Leading German businesses in July announced their own initiative, with the goal of boosting investor interest and confidence. The group made up of 61 companies plan to collectively invest 631 billion euros [$737.4 billion] by 2028.
""This is a good signal, and it shows that there is an alliance between [the] corporate world and the politics these days, which is very important, which hasn't been the case over the last years,"" Timotheus Höttges, the CEO of Deutsche Telekom told CNBC.
The tone struck by business leaders is also reflected in recent data, with economic institute Ifo reporting improvements in company sentiment for five consecutive months now.
Call for action
However, businesses are also calling the government to action, demanding that campaign promises be turned into reality.
Allianz's Bäte told CNBC that while the government's attitude was good news, ""now comes the delivery,"" and Bilfinger's Schulz noted that ""there is at the moment only lip service in a lot of areas, with very good ideas, but we have to come to execution.""
Economists surveyed on policy by Ifo and German news organisation Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung also noted the lack of measures that have been implemented so far during Merz's term.
""30% of the participating economists rate the economic policy measures of the new German government in the first 100 days as 'rather negative', with a further 12% even rating them as 'very negative,'"" the survey found.
Participants negatively highlighted ""the lack of reform efforts in the area of social security systems. In addition, they see a lack so far of clear stimulus for further structural reforms, the reduction of bureaucracy, and progress on climate protection,"" it noted.
Business leaders had an extensive wish list to share with CNBC.
Roland Busch, CEO of tech conglomerate Siemens, was among those who called for structural reforms. Some of which included ""digitalization, faster decision processes, less bureaucracy, working [on] our energy transformation"" and changes to the labor market.
Business-specific needs were also called out by leaders, with Deutsche Telekom's Höttges saying the company could be supported by local authorities and the federal government in its build out of fibre infrastructure.
Many of these issues were also flagged by leaders as reasons for the economic weakness of recent years. Germany's economy contracted in both 2023 and 2024. Europe's largest economy then recorded gross domestic product growth of 0.3% in the first quarter followed by a 0.1% contraction in the following period, according to data, in the second quarter.
""In Germany, we have not been growing as a country in the last two years, and there are reasons behind that. It's about bureaucracy, it's about education, it's about security, about energy prices, and in that context, being competitive on a global scale,"" Carsten Knobel, CEO of chemicals and consumer goods business Henkel, noted.
""But we need to turn around this country from a not growing country back to growth,"" he said.",1eb51ed691757e5324c4c6bd4b2232d3,trafilatura

In 2024, the average price of new condos in the 23 municipalities at the heart of Tokyo hit 111.81 million yen (about $760,000), according to Real Estate Economic Research Institute's report earlier this year. The median price — a better gauge of the market — was 89.4 million yen, up 9% from a year earlier.
On a median basis, condo prices in Tokyo's 23 wards jumped about 64% from 2021 to 2025, far outpacing the 26% rise across the greater Tokyo area.
Meanwhile, Japan's income levels remain low compared with several of its developed peers, with weaker minimum wage and one of the widest gender pay gaps, making affordability a concern. In 2024, Japan ranked 25 out of 34 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranked on a purchasing power parity–adjusted, average annual wages basis, at $49,446.
Property prices in Tokyo's prime districts have soared, fueled in part by rising construction and labor costs, and as a weak yen and comparatively low valuations draw overseas investors.
The urban property boom has attracted political attention, with discussion around foreign capital restrictions featured during the recent Upper House elections. Unlike countries such as Australia, Canada and Singapore, Japan has virtually no restrictions on foreign property ownership.
The Democratic Party for the People or DPFP, which secured solid gains in the July elections, is expected to table a bill curbing foreign real estate purchases as early as the autumn extraordinary Diet session, according to local media. DPFP leader Yuichiro Tamaki has argued that home prices in urban areas have soared partly due to overseas investors buying property for non-residential, speculative purposes, and has floated the idea of a ""vacancy tax"" to curb such acquisitions.
Meanwhile, Sanseitō, a right-wing populist party campaigning on a ""Japan First"" anti-immigration platform, is also preparing its own proposal to curb foreign land acquisition but has not yet specified a timeline for submission.
With the ruling coalition lacking a majority in both houses of the Diet, the positions of opposition parties have become increasingly critical in shaping legislative outcomes.
Tobias Harris, founder of political risk advisory firm Japan Foresight, said it was hard to separate foreign property ownership from broader debates about Japan's foreign population. While not the centerpiece of Sanseitō's platform, he said the issue stands out because it offers a clearer legal path for action versus other issues.
""The party's rhetoric on the issue has emphasized both national security and economic security, hinting at the dangers of certain foreigners buying property and also the impact on Japanese quality of life if they can't afford houses.""
The exact scale of foreign buying is hard to pin down, as Japan does not publish official statistics on buyer nationality, but a semiannual survey by Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp, published in March 2025, found that in Tokyo's Chiyoda, Shibuya, and Minato wards, 20% to 40% of new apartments are typically sold to foreign buyers.
""Foreigners buying is one factor, but domestic investors and residents are also buying,"" said Makoto Sakuma, senior researcher at Japanese think tank NLI Research Institute.
Sakuma noted that although the Bank of Japan has raised interest rates since March last year, they remain low in real terms and ample liquidity is still circulating in the market with much of it flowing into urban property.
Harris said the outlook for any legislative change depends on Japan's political landscape. A new prime minister or shifting coalition dynamics could reshape how opposition parties put issues like foreign ownership on the agenda.
Romeo Marcantuoni, a doctoral candidate at Waseda University who focuses on Japanese opposition politics, said the salience of the issue moving ahead is unlikely to fade, noting that Sanseito has ramped up its rhetoric on foreigners and foreign capital since winning three Lower House seats last year.
Still, he noted the legislative path is uncertain, as more pressing priorities, such as tax cuts, cash handouts, and a gasoline levy is likely to dominate discussions in the near term.
Urban-rural divide
While Tokyo's population continues to rise, Japan's overall population has been declining since 2008, creating a sharp gap in demand between urban and rural areas.
And while there has been a property boom in major cities, the country had about 9 million abandoned homes, known as akiya, as of 2023, primarily in rural regions.
Although akiya can be purchased cheaply, they don't match the needs of many domestic buyers. Many are in disrepair, located far from jobs and services, or require renovations costing $20,000 to $300,000, depending on the property's state and location. Cultural stigma around secondhand homes and limited government support for revitalization further limit their appeal.
""When you look at the countryside, we have a huge problem with stagnation, prices are not rising and houses are not selling,"" said Parker Allen, co-founder of Akiya & Inaka, a real estate platform helping overseas buyers find and revive vacant houses in rural Japan.
Akiya hold little appeal for most Japanese, but they have been catching the attention of foreign buyers seeking lower prices, traditional architecture, and the romance of restoring an old home. Allen warns that any potential restrictions on foreign property ownership should be aimed only at metropolitan markets where competition with locals is fiercest.
""The most logical way is to focus on the cities,"" he said. ""If foreign buying is accelerating, it could price some people out of the market — but we're talking here only about the Fifth Avenues of Japan.""",94a002fd14505d73d8d655304a9e92d0,trafilatura

While not the centerpiece of Sanseitō's platform, he said the issue stands out because it offers a clearer legal path for action versus other issues.
""The party's rhetoric on the issue has emphasized both national security and economic security, hinting at the dangers of certain foreigners buying property and also the impact on Japanese quality of life if they can't afford houses.""
The exact scale of foreign buying is hard to pin down, as Japan does not publish official statistics on buyer nationality, but a semiannual survey by Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp, published in March 2025, found that in Tokyo's Chiyoda, Shibuya, and Minato wards, 20% to 40% of new apartments are typically sold to foreign buyers.
""Foreigners buying is one factor, but domestic investors and residents are also buying,"" said Makoto Sakuma, senior researcher at Japanese think tank NLI Research Institute.
Sakuma noted that although the Bank of Japan has raised interest rates since March last year, they remain low in real terms and ample liquidity is still circulating in the market with much of it flowing into urban property.
Harris said the outlook for any legislative change depends on Japan's political landscape. A new prime minister or shifting coalition dynamics could reshape how opposition parties put issues like foreign ownership on the agenda.
Romeo Marcantuoni, a doctoral candidate at Waseda University who focuses on Japanese opposition politics, said the salience of the issue moving ahead is unlikely to fade, noting that Sanseito has ramped up its rhetoric on foreigners and foreign capital since winning three Lower House seats last year.
Still, he noted the legislative path is uncertain, as more pressing priorities, such as tax cuts, cash handouts, and a gasoline levy is likely to dominate discussions in the near term.
Urban-rural divide
While Tokyo's population continues to rise, Japan's overall population has been declining since 2008, creating a sharp gap in demand between urban and rural areas.
And while there has been a property boom in major cities, the country had about 9 million abandoned homes, known as akiya, as of 2023, primarily in rural regions.
Although akiya can be purchased cheaply, they don't match the needs of many domestic buyers. Many are in disrepair, located far from jobs and services, or require renovations costing $20,000 to $300,000, depending on the property's state and location. Cultural stigma around secondhand homes and limited government support for revitalization further limit their appeal.
""When you look at the countryside, we have a huge problem with stagnation, prices are not rising and houses are not selling,"" said Parker Allen, co-founder of Akiya & Inaka, a real estate platform helping overseas buyers find and revive vacant houses in rural Japan.
Akiya hold little appeal for most Japanese, but they have been catching the attention of foreign buyers seeking lower prices, traditional architecture, and the romance of restoring an old home. Allen warns that any potential restrictions on foreign property ownership should be aimed only at metropolitan markets where competition with locals is fiercest.
""The most logical way is to focus on the cities,"" he said. ""If foreign buying is accelerating, it could price some people out of the market — but we're talking here only about the Fifth Avenues of Japan.""",94a002fd14505d73d8d655304a9e92d0,trafilatura

Last year, the local authority of Buckinghamshire, England, denied planning permission for proposals to build a new 90-megawatt data center on green belt land. The green belt is a term in British town planning that refers to an area of open land on which building is restricted.
Data centers, large facilities that house floods of computing systems to enable remote delivery of various IT services, have seen huge demand in recent years amid a global rush to develop powerful new AI systems, such as OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot.
At the same time, they have been met with concerns from environmental campaigners and activists due to the vast amounts of power they require to keep them running on an ongoing basis. AI, in particular, has been criticized for consuming massive amounts of energy.
Plans to develop the Buckinghamshire facility were twice rejected by the council previously. However, they were again resurrected under the Labour government, which is pushing to make the U.K. a global artificial intelligence hub by ramping up national computing capacity.
Buckinghamshire council again rejected the planned data center in June 2024, saying it would be ""inappropriate"" to develop it on the green belt. Then, last month, British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner granted planning permission for the project, overturning the local authority's decision.
Campaign groups Foxglove and Global Action Plan announced on Thursday that they filed a formal planning statutory review asking a court to quash Rayner's approval of the data center, raising concerns over the vast amounts of power and water such facilities require.
""Angela Rayner appears to either not know the difference between a power station that actually produces energy and a substation that just links you to the grid — or simply not care,"" Foxglove Co-executive Director Rosa Curling, said in a statement Thursday.
""Either way, thanks to her decision, local people and businesses in Buckinghamshire will soon be competing with a power guzzling-behemoth to keep the lights on, which as we've seen in the States, usually means sky-high prices.""
The U.K. Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government — which Rayner also leads — declined to comment on the legal action when asked about it by CNBC. The government has previously stressed the importance of building data center infrastructure to compete on a global level in AI development.
Thursday's move comes after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in January announced plans to block campaigners from making repeated legal challenges from so-called ""Nimbys"" to planning decisions for major infrastructure projects in England and Wales.

The entertainment company has been working on the launch of the direct-to-consumer app — which is also named ESPN — for some time. It's designed to expand access for existing cable subscribers and give sports fans outside the traditional pay TV bundle access to all of ESPN's content.
It's the first time the company is offering all of its linear TV content to customers via streaming.
""We're approaching our 46th year here, and I would say that this is one of the biggest days at ESPN, if not the biggest,"" ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro told CNBC's David Faber Thursday. ""This is something that fans have been wanting, they've been asking for for many years. And our mission is to serve the sports fan — anytime, anywhere — and we're going to deliver.""
Pitaro and Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company will be focused on the ESPN ecosystem as a whole, rather than subscribers specifically to the new service.
""As a company, we're now agnostic when it comes to linear television and digital television, digital content, we manage them together and holistically,"" Iger said. ""We look at the whole, and that's what we'll do here.""
Here's what we know about what the app will look like and how it will work for consumers.
Plan playbook
Anyone who currently pays for ESPN through their cable service will have access to the ESPN streaming app.
For everyone else, the app will come in a variety of options at sign-up.
Subscribers can buy into the unlimited plan, which grants access to all of ESPN's networks, for $29.99 per month or $299.99 annually.
ESPN says this plan will cover more than 47,000 live events annually, including the NCAA championships, the Australian Open, the PGA Championship and more.
Users can also bundle the ESPN unlimited plan with Disney+ and Hulu for $35.99 a month, including ads, or $44.99 a month without ads.
At launch, Disney will offer that same bundle at a promotional price of $29.99 per month, with ads, for the first year.
There's also another bundle on the way, in October. ESPN and Fox Corp. are teaming up to offer their direct-to-consumer streaming services as a combined offering.
Fox's service, called Fox One, also debuts Thursday and includes all Fox content including news and sports. It costs $19.99 a month on its own.
The ESPN and Fox One bundle will be available on Oct. 2 for $39.99 per month. However, customers of the pay TV bundle will receive access to each of the streaming apps at no additional cost.
What's next for ESPN+
Short of the ESPN unlimited offering, the company is also debuting its ESPN select tier.
This plan features access to all content available on the existing ESPN+ service, including live sports streaming, a library of exclusive studio shows and original content and on-demand game replays.
ESPN says this plan will cover more than 32,000 live events annually.
It will cost $11.99 per month or $119.99 annually.
Customers can also purchase the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN select bundle, which includes ads, for $16.99 per month, or a no-ads option for $26.99 per month.
ESPN+ was the sports network's first foray into streaming, launching in 2018 as a separate app that has exclusive content outside the TV network. While it has some live game simulcasts, it's never housed the bulk of ESPN's content.
ESPN+ had 24 million subscribers as of Disney's most recent earnings report.
Existing ESPN+ customers will automatically become subscribers of the ESPN select plan under the new service, the company has said.
Customers with existing subscriptions to the streaming bundles will be able to watch ESPN content on Disney+ alongside the other programming.
""This is going to continue to evolve and continue to improve over time, and in fact, with the data that will be available, it will improve even more as sports fans are served what they want to watch and what they want to see the most,"" Iger said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""
Bulking up content
ESPN's streaming service will include all of the network's live games, along with programming from ESPN2, the SEC Network and ESPN on ABC. In addition, it will feature fantasy products, new betting tie-ins, studio programming and documentaries, among other kinds of content.
The network recently signed two deals to bolster its sports offerings.
In early August, ESPN said it was entering a partnership with the WWE for the U.S. rights to the wrestling league's biggest events, including WrestleMania, the Royal Rumble and SummerSlam. CNBC reported ESPN will pay an average of $325 million per year for five years of rights. On Wednesday, ESPN and WWE said that deal starts immediately, earlier than previously announced.
ESPN also reached a deal this month with the National Football League to acquire the NFL Network in exchange for the pro football league taking an equity stake in ESPN.
Pitaro said Thursday that ESPN is having ""healthy conversations"" with Major League Baseball to reach a new deal, but did not provide specifics.

The firm downgraded Maplebear, which does business as Instacart, to underperform from neutral and slashed its price target to $42 from $55, which implies nearly 8% downside from Wednesday's close. This comes as shares have faced meaningful pressure in recent months, falling more than 13% over the past six months and more than 7% over the past month. That was exacerbated by a more than 11% drop earlier in August following the launch of Amazon's same-day delivery service of fresh foods in more than 1,000 cities and towns in the U.S., which analyst Scott Devitt believes has led to Prime becoming an ""even more compelling subscription for grocery shoppers, diminishing the appeal of Instacart.""

With these competitive pressures, the analyst said he has grown more cautious on the company's ability to achieve its longer-term targets, seeing mid-single-digit to low-single-digit gross transaction value growth year over year in the coming years.

Family offices are known to invest for the long haul, sometimes for generations. But after President Donald Trump's tariff announcements in April, the family offices of billionaire investors were quick to make significant changes to their portfolios, according to second-quarter securities filings analyzed by CNBC.
Some moves were clearly connected to tariff and recession fears. In the three months ended June 30, the family offices of David Tepper, Leon Cooperman and George Soros exited their positions in casino stock Las Vegas Sands Corp. Casino operator shares tumbled on fears that a U.S.-China trade war would endanger their Macao operations.
However, some firms dialed back their exposure to stalwart tech stocks, with Cooperman's Omega Advisors exiting its Microsoft position and reducing its Alphabet stock by nearly 90%. Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office sold down 37 positions, including Amazon and about a half dozen pharmaceutical stocks.
Cooperman told CNBC in June that he thought the stock market was too confident given uncertainties with tariffs and conflicts in the Middle East.
""I'm not a big bear, but I'm not a big bull either,"" he said on ""Squawk Box.""
Institutional investment managers — including family offices and hedge funds — that manage at least $100 million in certain securities, especially U.S.-listed equities, are required to disclose trades on a quarterly basis. While many family offices have stock portfolios worth well over $100 million, they do not have to file these 13F forms if they outsource investment decisions to a third party like JPMorgan or Bessemer Trust, according to lawyer David Guin, a partner at Withers who leads its U.S. corporate practice.
Not all the moves were related to bigger geopolitical concerns. Despite concerns about tariffs on semiconductors, family offices boosted their Nvidia holdings. Tepper's Appaloosa Management increased its Nvidia holdings by nearly 500%. Soros Fund Management purchased about 932,000 share-equivalents in Nvidia, including options.
In another artificial intelligence play, several firms boosted their bets on other chipmakers, with Appaloosa buying 8 million shares of Intel and 755,000 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Duquesne and Soros also increased their positions in TSMC.
Omega Advisors doubled down on energy providers, which are poised to benefit from AI's energy demands, including Atlas Energy Solutions, Sunoco and Energy Transfer LP.
As family offices have long investment horizons, they can afford to be opportunistic and wait for stocks to rebound. Appaloosa bought 2.3 million shares in UnitedHealth Group, which suffered a 19% sell-off in April after the insurer cut its annual profit forecast. Tepper's hedge-fund-turned-family-office also bought new stakes in United Airlines and Delta Air Lines even as recession fears threw airline stocks for a loop.
Some of Appaloosa's peers made similar bold bets, with Soros Fund Management and BlueCrest Capital Management, the family office of British hedge fund billionaire Michael Platt, also increasing its exposure to UnitedHealth. BlueCrest also started new positions in Delta and United.

Higher interest rates and a fast-shrinking labor market are taking their toll on the fix-and-flip housing market. Investors are starting to pull back, as costs rise and the time it takes to sell their renovated homes lengthens.
The fix-and-flip market contracted slightly in the second quarter of this year from the first quarter and even more sharply from the second quarter of last year, according to an index from John Burns Research and Consulting and Kiavi, a lender focused on the real estate investor.
""Sentiment remains muted, as economic uncertainty, elevated mortgage rates and rising resale inventory weigh on demand for flipped homes,"" wrote Alex Thomas of John Burns Research and Consulting, the primary author of the report.
The index surveys roughly 400 flippers and measures current sales, expected sales and flipper competition for deals. All of those sub-indices fell last quarter. Days-on-market for flipped homes increased as the supply of both new and existing homes for sale rose.
Just 30% of flippers reported ""good"" sales in the second quarter of this year compared to the seasonal norm, down from 38% in the same quarter of 2024.
""I think what our customers are really experiencing, it really comes down to housing velocity and turnover timelines,"" said Arvind Mohan, CEO of Kiavi. ""They are definitely in the velocity business, and so if it takes them an extra month to complete a transaction, that's capital that's tied up in that property that can't necessarily be freed up for the next investment.""
Roughly one third of flippers pointed to reduced labor availability due to immigration enforcement and fear-driven absences from jobsites. Labor and material costs for flips hit a record high, but costs as a percentage of sales price were flat.
""From an ROI perspective, we're not seeing much change there, right? People are still getting that kind of 30% to 31%,"" said Mohan.
""We're definitely seeing the more professional cohorts take a step back, be more conservative, be more choosy, right?,"" Mohan said. ""If they were going to buy four out of six opportunities a year ago now, they may be buying like two or three out of six just to make sure that they are prepared. As the market resets, they can reset their purchase price and keep the ROI metrics constant.""
Regionally, flippers in Florida, Northern California and the Southwest rated sales more poorly than flippers elsewhere.
""Flippers in these regions face increasing resale supply, significant competition from homebuilders, and rising costs (particularly insurance),"" wrote Thomas in the report.
Flippers are also facing the potential of declining prices, depending on where they're working. While home prices are still slightly higher nationally than they were a year ago, the gains are shrinking fast, and some markets are solidly negative, especially those that overheated in the first years of the pandemic.
Prices in June were just 1.7% higher than June 2024, according to Cotality, which noted that is well below the rate of inflation. Prices were up just 0.1% month to month, which is the slowest monthly gain since 2008.
As a result, Mohan said lenders like Kiavi are being more careful.

Housing analysts had been expecting a slight decline. Sales were 0.8% higher than July 2024.
These sales are counted by closings, so contacts likely signed in May and June, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was in decline. That rate exceeded 7% briefly in May and then ended June at 6.67%, according to Mortgage News Daily.
There were 1.55 million homes for sale at the end of July, an increase of 15.7% from the same month last year. At the current sales pace, that represents a 4.6-month supply. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller.
Inventory is now at the highest level since May 2020 but still well below pre-Covid years.
More inventory is clearly taking the pressure off prices. The median price of an existing home sold in July was $422,400, an increase of 0.2% from the same month a year earlier and a record high price for the month of July. Prices have been higher annually for the last 25 months, but the market may now be at an inflection point.
""The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. ""Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices.""
Yun noted that condominium sales increased in the South, where prices have been falling for the past year.
Activity continues to be strongest on the higher end of the market. Sales of homes priced over $1 million rose 7.1% year over year, while sales priced between $100,000 and $250,000 declined 0.1%. Sales of homes priced below $100,000 dropped 8%.
It is now taking longer for homes to sell. The average home in July sold in 28 days, up from 24 days the year before. First-time buyers also fell off slightly, representing 28% of sales, down from 30% in June and 29% in July 2024.

Here's a recap of Thursday's key moments. 1. Stocks were modestly lower Thursday, extending the S & P 500 's losing streak to five straight sessions since last week's record high. The acute market rotation over the past two days out of stocks with premium valuations appears to be easing. ""It usually takes about three days for these rotations to play out. But it looks like it might be a day and a half,"" said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. Looking ahead, investors are awaiting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech on Friday. ""That's likely going to move markets,"" Jeff said. During a CNBC interview that aired Thursday, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid expressed hesitancy about a widely expected September interest rate cut. 2. Meta Platforms hit pause on its artificial intelligence hiring spree, according to The Wall Street Journal, after onboarding more than 50 AI researchers and engineers. The report was confirmed by a Meta spokesperson who characterized the freeze as ""basic organizational planning."" The latest action should not be viewed as a slowdown in AI investments, Jeff said, noting the millions of dollars that Meta has spent on massive compensation packages to new hires. ""Maybe this is actually a good thing that they are kind of holding off on hiring. They're letting their team work and put their plan in place,"" said Jeff. 3. Walmart posted a quarterly revenue beat but missed on earnings per share. ""You don't really see that too often from Walmart,"" Jeff said, though he added that it appears to be a result of one-time expenses unrelated to core operations. Walmart stock sank more than 4.5% on the news, taking our retail names — Amazon , Costco , and TJX — with it. Walmart's same-store sales in the U.S. did go up 4.6% versus the 4.1% expected. Similarly, TJ Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX reported a 4% rise in comps on Wednesday. 4 . Boeing is in talks to sell as many as 500 planes to China, according to Bloomberg. It's good news for the aerospace industry and a positive sign that trade talks between Beijing and the U.S. are going well. ""This type of deal could get taken away in an instant if there is some type of escalation in tariff threats between the two [countries],"" Jeff said. The Club added Boeing to our Bullpen back in April on the idea that planes could be used as bargaining chips by countries looking to reduce trade deficits.

Markets: Stocks are trading lower Thursday. The S & P 500 , in particular, is on pace for its fifth straight loss, wiping out all of August's gains. The rotation out of momentum-driven winners and stocks with lofty price-to-earnings multiples — the dominant market story of the week — isn't as pronounced Thursday, with stocks like Club name GE Vernova and Palantir holding up better on a relative basis. However, the influential ""Magnificent Seven"" cohort is mostly weaker, which explains why the traditional market-cap weighted S & P 500 is slightly underperforming the Invesco S & P 500 equal-weight ETF , known as the RSP. Holding up : The health-care sector is putting together a solid few days despite the broader market weakness. The group, which is still one of the worst performing sectors this year, came to life last week thanks to a surge in the beleaguered UnitedHealth Group on news that Berkshire Hathaway purchased a stake in managed care giant during the second quarter. Club name Eli Lilly also start to rebound from its post-earnings sell-off, giving the sector a lift. Fast-forward to Thursday, and pharma stocks are helping push the health-care group higher, and those rallies are linked to some better-than-feared trade news. According to the updated trade agreement framework between the United States and the European Union, branded pharmaceuticals imported from the EU will face a 15% tariff rate. Uncertainty over the Trump administration's Section 232 sectoral tariffs on pharmaceutical imports hasn't gone away, but 15% is much more manageable than some of the triple-digit threats President Donald Trump has previously floated. Europe is a popular place for drug manufacturing. Shares of both Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly were higher on Thursday as investors digested the tariff developments. With Thursday's move, Lilly shares are down less than 5% from where they closed the day before its disappointing obesity pill data sent the stock plunging 14% in a single session. Up next: Zoom Communications , Workday , Intuit and Ross Stores report after the closing bell on Thursday. Ross Stores is a rival of Club stock TJX Companies , which reported its own strong set of results Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, Costco peer BJ's Wholesale reports on Friday. However, the main event of the day will be Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. It starts at 10 a.m. ET and will be a market-moving event.

Earlier this week, the department said it was adding wind turbines to a list of products that will face 50% tariffs on the aluminum and steel content. The ""Section 232"" investigation, which was opened on August 13 but not made public until now, could be used as a basis for even higher tariffs on imported wind turbines.
Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie said approximately two-thirds of the value of a typical U.S. wind turbine is imported.
U.S. imports of 2023 wind-related imported equipment were valued at $1.7 billion, the lowest volumes since 2013, the firm added, with Europe being the biggest exporter (41%), followed by Mexico (34%), and India (around 15%), the firm added, saying Chinese imports have diminished due to increased trade tensions.
Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump has repeatedly sought to stall development of wind and solar energy, calling them unreliable, expensive and overly dependent on Chinese supply chains.
The Commerce Department is seeking comments on the role of foreign supply chains in meeting U.S. demand for wind turbines and on ""the impact of foreign government subsidies and predatory trade practices on the competitiveness of the wind turbines and their parts and components industry.""
The United States is self-sufficient for nacelle assembly and tower supply, while maintaining limited blade manufacturing capacity. However, the majority of blades, all drivetrains and other electrical components are imported, Wood Mackenzie analyst Endri Lico said.
The department has opened numerous probes into the national security ramifications of imports of airplanes, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, heavy trucks, copper, timber and lumber, critical minerals and drones.
The offshore wind industry has struggled in recent years with soaring inflation and logistical problems that have raised costs. It faced a further setback when Trump suspended licensing on his first day back in office in January.",22c80d7db7297d2fef7d8b8f5d46832e,trafilatura

What Wall Street expects,Powell to deliver Jackson Hole speech Friday . What Wall Street expects,2025-08-21 20:45:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver what almost certainly will be his last keynote address at the central bank's annual conclave during one of the most tumultuous times in its history.
What's at stake is the near-term sentiment for financial markets, the longer-term path of the Fed's policy trajectory, and a not insignificant dose of trying to preserve vestiges of independence at a time when the normally sacrosanct institution is facing enormous political pressure.
If Friday's speech at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, goes at all like Powell's first seven-plus years in office, it will feature a calm and collected veneer even if masking the weight that he and his colleagues have been under all year.
""He's done a good job in terms of keeping the Fed's independence, ignoring the noise and some of the questions he gets, and keeping it focused on the data dependency and the Fed's dual mandate,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Investment Management. ""He's taken the high road as it relates to the Fed's independence and some of the pressure he's clearly getting from the Trump administration. So I think that he'll continue to kind of walk that line.""
Indeed, President Donald Trump has kept up a near constant drumbeat against Powell and his colleagues. As he did during much of his first term, Trump has badgered Powell to lower interest rates. But in recent days the president's attacks on the Fed have gone past mere monetary policy.
Earlier this summer, the White House lashed out at the Fed for a major reconstruction project at its Washington, D.C. headquarters. That coincided with a period when Trump toyed with removing Powell, though he later backed off the idea.
Then this week the administration trained its focus on Fed Governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud regarding two federally backed loans she took.
Amid the controversies, Powell could use the speech to at least take a swipe at the political distractions, even if he holds to past practice of not taking direct aim.
Politics and policy
""He's going to take a jab and talk about Fed independence, because what does he have to lose really at this point?"" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America. ""It seems pretty clear that Trump can't legally fire him. He can certainly put all kinds of tremendous pressure on him. And I think it's an opportunity for Powell to say the central bank's got to stay independent, and that's what we're going to do.""
Beyond the politics there's policy, and that also will be challenge.
The speech is billed as an ""Economic Outlook and Framework Review,"" indicating Powell will take time to provide his views on broad conditions as well as discuss the Fed's long-term policy goals, a review that occurs every five years.
Markets are expecting Powell to tee up a September rate cut. At each of his previous Jackson Hole speeches, starting in 2018, he indicated significant policy shifts. From pushing for quarterly cuts in that first speech to a pivotal switch in how it would view inflation in 2020 to last year's nod towards an aggressive September move, markets have taken their cues from the chair's keynote.
Wall Street commentary reflects similar expectations this time around, if in somewhat subtler terms.
""We do not expect Powell to decisively signal a September cut, but the speech should make it clear to markets that he is likely to support one,"" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle said in a note.
Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, whose district hosts the Jackson Hole event, told CNBC on Wednesday that he isn't sold yet on a September cut and will need to see more data. In fact, only Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman have overtly signaled they favor a move next month.
""We suspect that most FOMC participants who have expressed mixed feelings about cutting in September will be willing to support a cut if Powell pushes for one, but that he will think it more reasonable to make that case to them closer to the meeting with more data in hand,"" Mericle said.
Inflation vs. unemployment
Key points to watch will be how Powell characterizes the labor market and his view on the inflation pass-through from Trump's tariffs.
Shortly after the July Fed meeting, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced meager job growth for July and even weaker gains for May and June. However, multiple policymakers have used the word ""solid"" to describe the labor market, indicating they see less urgency for rate cuts.
Minutes from the July meeting indicated most FOMC members see a greater worry over inflation. Regional presidents Beth Hammack from Cleveland, Atlanta's Raphael Bostic and Schmid in Kansas City have expressed skepticism about the need for a September cut, a position that could rile Trump and upset the market.
Powell ""is likely to remain careful and not pre-commit in advance to a September cut, which could disappoint some investors,"" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. ""Much of his speech may try to provide a steady medium- to longer-term framing for policy strategy and inflation control.""
That framing could be critical as well, and is getting little attention from Wall Street so far.
Five years ago, against a backdrop of the Covid pandemic and protests over police brutality, the Fed adopted what it called ""flexible average inflation targeting."" Essentially, the framework change would allow the Fed to let inflation run hot if unemployment was higher, particularly for underrepresented groups.
Over the next couple years, the Fed stood pat while inflation hit its highest level in more than 40 years. While most officials say the inflation targeting change did not play a role in the widely-held view that inflation was ""transitory,"" the policy is likely to get a retooling, with the Fed returning to its previous inflation stance that included preemptive action if inflation appeared to be rising.
""While the adoption of the new framework in 2020 was not the primary factor behind the Fed's delay and the substantial inflation overshoot, it contributed to this outcome,"" Matthew Luzzetti, Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist, said in a note. ""For this reason, we expect Powell's speech in Jackson Hole to highlight changes to the Fed's statement on longer-run goals that will reflect this reality. Specifically, we expect the speech to call for rolling back the 2020 modifications and restoring a primary role for preemption.""
Luzzetti added that the Friday speech ""could arguably not come at a more important time"" and he expects Powell to change his tone on the labor market.
Powell's speech will be presented at 10 a.m. ET. The conference wraps up Saturday.",d91900faaff3c20196d6d1f41760f042,trafilatura

For the most part, the second-quarter earnings season has blown away Wall Street expectations. Approximately 94% of the S & P 500 has already reported, and 82% of companies have delivered a positive earnings surprise. About 79% of companies have posted revenue exceeding analysts' estimates. But several stocks have lagged their numbers. A recent report from Wolfe Research shared a list of companies that investors might consider selling — stocks that missed both revenue and earnings expectations this quarter, while also having negative year-to-date earnings revisions for 2025. One name on Wolfe's list was Southwest Airlines , down 8% this year. Last month, Southwest reported adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share on revenue of $7.24 billion in its latest quarter, while analysts polled by FactSet had estimated earnings of 51 cents and revenue of $7.30 billion. Afterward, Evercore ISI downgraded the Dallas-based carrier to an in-line rating from outperform. Still, analyst Duane Pfennigwerth's $40 price target implies Southwest shares could soar 28% from the Wednesday close. ""Trading at 36x '25E, 11x '26E EPS, we believe shares are now much closer to fair value and are beginning to more fully price in clean execution of these initiatives into next year,"" Pfennigwerth wrote. ""We also wonder if the company's aggressive pace of buyback (likely a big contributor to YTD outperformance) can be sustained at this rate."" Another stock that Wolfe says investors might avoid is Align Technology . Shares of the maker of Invisalign orthodontics have tumbled 32% in 2025. In July, Align's second-quarter earnings and revenue missed analysts' estimates. The company also guided for current-quarter revenue in the range of $965 million to $985 million, below the FactSet consensus among analysts of $1.04 billion. In the wake of the report, Morgan Stanley downgraded Align to equal weight from overweight, slashing its 12-month price target to $154 per share from $249. The new forecast implies shares might add another 7% from the Wednesday close. ""Our prior [overweight] thesis was based on ALGN's leadership in a high growth category, but growth has been challenged for years, w/ limited clarity on [the] path from here,"" wrote analyst Erin Wright. ""We view a re-rate lower as warranted, closer to the Dental peer average."" Defense prime contractor Lockheed Martin is another sell, according to Truist. The investment bank downgraded Lockheed to a hold from buy after second-quarter revenue at the maker of the F-35 fighter-bomber fell short of Wall Street estimates, and it lowered its full-year guidance below prior estimates. Truist also slashed its price target to $440 per share from $554, implying the stock won't do much in the coming year. ""We are downgrading LMT shares now as we have little confidence that management will be able to execute on its multi-year growth framework, and we can not be certain that more charges will not materialize in the coming quarters,"" wrote analyst Michael Ciarmoli. ""We expect shares will trade flat for the balance of the year given a lack of catalysts and believe LMT shares will continue to trade at a discounted multiple vs its larger peers.""

This year, announced share repurchases for constituents in the broad market index have totaled $936 billion, up 30% from the year-ago period, the firm said. These buybacks have helped lift the S & P 500 , which is up more than 8% in 2025. Big names that have shared plans to snap up shares this year include Apple – which announced a $100 billion buyback plan in May – and Uber , which said earlier this month that it would purchase $20 billion of its shares. Like dividends, buybacks are a way for companies to return profits to shareholders. Repurchases reduce the number of shares outstanding, and they suggest that management is confident in the stock's upward trajectory. They also give companies greater flexibility in rewarding shareholders. ""You can do a buyback whenever you want,"" said Sam Huszczo, CFP and founder of SGH Wealth Management in Lathrup Village, Mich. ""When you set a dividend amount and you cut it because you want to use the cash flow for something else, it's going to be interpreted as something negative,"" he added. ""All you can do is grow the dividend. It's hard to bring it down without destroying sentiment."" To that end, Jefferies shared a list of companies that offer high buyback yields and have the cash flows to sustain them. The firm scanned for U.S. companies with a market cap exceeding $5 billion, a last-12-months' buyback yield topping 4% and free cash flow yield that covers existing buybacks plus dividends. The companies must also have solid balance sheets, and ""relatively better"" 2025-2026 earnings per share compound annual growth rates and earnings revisions over the past three months. Tenet Healthcare , an operator of hospitals and health-care facilities, was on Jefferies' list. Shares have surged 42% in 2025. Last month, the company reported second-quarter results that surpassed the Street's estimates. Tenet also lifted its full-year guidance , calling for adjusted earnings to range from $15.55 to $16.21 per share, up from $11.99 to $13.12 a share. The forecast also topped the FactSet consensus of $12.85 a share. Tenet's board also authorized a $1.5 billion increase to its share repurchase program. The stock is widely liked by Wall Street, with 19 out of 24 analysts rating it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Consensus price targets call for more than 8% upside from current levels Jefferies called out Mattel on its list. The owner of the Barbie and Hot Wheels brands is about flat on the year, but analysts like the name: Eleven out of 14 analysts deem it a buy or strong buy, and price targets suggest more than 40% upside, per LSEG. Last month, the company reaffirmed its 2025 share repurchase target of $600 million. However, Mattel dialed back its full-year earnings forecast to $1.54 to $1.66 a share, down from its earlier call of $1.66 to $1.72 a share. The FactSet consensus forecast $1.64 per share. D.A. Davidson analyst Keegan Cox noted that the company said it sees $100 million in tariff costs in the second half, which is down sharply from the $270 million it previously expected. ""We think MAT should be able to offset all of those costs after already raising prices in the U.S. and is not expecting any additional price increases from here,"" the analyst said in a July 23 report. Qualcomm also made Jefferies' list. In the company's fiscal third quarter, Qualcomm returned $3.8 billion to shareholders , including $967 million in dividends paid and $2.8 billion in share repurchases. The chip play also has a history of paying solid dividends , steadily growing those payments over the past two decades. Shares are roughly flat in 2025, standing in sharp contrast to its peers that have seen a boost from artificial intelligence. In all, 22 out of the 42 analysts covering the name rate it buy or strong buy, with consensus price targets suggesting 15% upside, per LSEG.",cfda207596ed83c099da67ff2c5b8061,trafilatura

Judge Matthew Brann said that Habba's appointment as the state's top federal prosecutor by the administration ""through a novel series of legal and personnel moves"" was not legally valid.
Habba is a former personal lawyer for President Donald Trump.
""The Court concludes that Ms. Habba has exercised the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey without lawful authority since July 1, 2025,"" wrote Brann in his opinion.
""Her actions since that point may be declared void,"" wrote the judge, who sits in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.
Brann stayed his decision, which will allow the Trump administration to appeal it before it takes effect.
Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a social media post, wrote, ""We will immediately appeal.
""@USAttyHabba is doing incredible work in New Jersey — and we will protect her position from activist judicial attacks,"" Bondi wrote on X.
In a statement on Brann's ruling, the attorneys Abbe David Lowell and Gerald Krovatin, who had challenged Habba's status, said, ""Prosecutors wield enormous power, and with that comes the responsibility to ensure they are qualified and properly appointed.""
""We challenged the authority of Alina Habba because her appointment ignored the rules that give legitimacy to the U.S. Attorney's office,"" said Lowell and Krovatin, who represented a defendant in one of the cases, Cesar Pina, that formed the basis for the challenge.
""We appreciate the thoroughness of the court's opinion, and its decision underscores that this Administration cannot circumvent the congressionally mandated process for confirming U.S. Attorney appointments.""
Brann was tapped to handle the challenges to Habba holding her post because of a prior decision by the federal judges in New Jersey rejecting her for that job after a 120-day deadline for interim prosecutor appointments expired.The Trump administration sought to end-run that rejection by a complicated, five-step process that it argued allowed Habba to effectively serve as the top prosecutor.
Brann said his finding did not require the dismissal of a criminal indictment lodged by Habba's office against Pina, which Habba had approved.
But ""because she is not currently qualified to exercise the functions and duties of the office in an acting capacity, she must be disqualified from participating in any ongoing cases, including Mr. Pina's and those of Defendants Julien Giraud Jr. and Julien Giraud III,"" Brann wrote.",bf1a70af381ad80bc81d61dc883baffa,trafilatura

That's when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will address the central bank's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Investors will be listening carefully to Powell for hints on whether central bankers might cut interest rates as many three times before the end of the year, as the market thought was possible a week ago, or whether they will, at best, cut only twice, as the market thinks now after the rather hawkish minutes of the Fed's July meeting were released Wednesday afternoon. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the base case for the year remains at two rate cuts, where it has been for a while. The wild card? The odds of only one or up to three. The market this week has signaled which stocks might do better under each of those extremes. In the acute rotation that began on Tuesday, when the up-to-three rate cuts by year-end scenario was on the table, we saw investors book profits in momentum stocks and high-growth year-to-date winners and buy value-oriented and lower multiple names that can actually benefit from more cuts via upward earnings revisions. Stocks like Palantir , for which three or one rate cuts mean nothing in the face of their ties to artificial intelligence and other secular trends, were sold heavily Tuesday and into Wednesday's session. Names like Club stock Home Depot , which needs lower policy rates to spur cheaper mortgages, were bought. Investors looked past Home Depot's quarterly earnings and revenue misses to signs of a better back half of the year. When the Fed minutes came out Wednesday afternoon, the market rotation eased. Palantir bottomed and closed off its lows on Wednesday and made it into the green Thursday. Home Depot, on the other hand, came off Wednesday's session highs and closed lower. The stock was lower again Thursday. Again, fewer rate cuts means earnings revisions won't be upwardly revised as much as we may have thought to start the week. If Home Depot, or any other rate beneficiary, was priced for two cuts, but we could see three, investors had reason to believe the earnings estimates were too low. That thesis doesn't hold up, though, if the odds of that third rate cut diminish or go to one. The reason all this attention is on the Fed is that low rates are generally considered to be positive for stock valuations. Whether you want to value a stock via the lens of a discounted cash flow model or a multiples-based price-to-earnings ratio , lower rates tend to result in a higher present value for stocks. That's especially true for the high flyers that don't have much profit, if any, in the present but are expected to see robust earnings grow in the future. The reason? Future earnings have a higher present value at a lower rate because they are discounted back at a lower rate. That textbook school of thought, however, does appear to conflict with the real-world market action of the past couple of days, with premium-valuation stocks getting hit as investors started to price-in a more dovish Fed, only for the rotation to let up as soon as the Fed minutes dropped and pointed to central bankers, perhaps, maintaining more of a hawkish stance after all. Historically, it's been the other way around. It comes down to relative year-to-date performance and which companies need low rates to win. While lower rates do result in a higher present value being ascribed to future earnings, the current growth names, largely tied to the AI investment trade, have proven their ability to grow regardless of the interest rate environment. Low rates may help momentum stocks' valuation, but they don't do much in terms of upward revisions to earnings estimates over the next three to six months — again, many don't even have real earnings to begin with. More cyclical names, on the other hand, stand to see earnings estimates revised higher as they generate money here and now. Lower rates can also catalyze business investments among a host of others. Palantir probably isn't going to make more money in the third and fourth quarters because the Fed lowers the overnight bank lending rate 75 basis points instead of 50 basis points. Home Depot, on the other hand, absolutely stands to make more money should rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage finally dip under 6.5%, a historically important level that has led to increased housing activity. In 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates from the Covid-era level of near 0%, the market move was out of the growth names and into more mature names that were making money. Back then, our mantra for the year was to only invest in companies with real earnings. ""We do not want companies that only grow sales but lose boatloads of money,"" Jim Cramer told Club members then, adding that 2022 was the year that ""you want to own companies that make stuff, that do tangible things, that innovate."" The focus then was on what rates meant for valuation. When the cost of money is cheap or non-existent, as was the case during the pandemic, some investors could rationalize speculating on a flying car company's potential earnings 10 years out, but if the cost to borrow rises, then the more traditional view is it's better to own a real car company whose valuation is based on its current financial profile. The focus now is less on valuation dynamics and more on earnings revisions. Helping that move is also the simple fact that so much money has been made this year in the high-flyers that investors are ready to jump on any reason they can to book profits there and rotate into year-to-date underperformers such health care, which is the third worst performing sector in the S & P 500 year-to-date but leading to the upside this week. Bottom line So, as we await Powell's Jackson Hole speech, be mindful of this dynamic and understand that while a dovish tone has traditionally been supportive of the high-flying growth stocks due to valuation dynamics, that may not be the case this time around. Wall Street is more focused on near-term earnings revisions than valuation model dynamics. If dovish talk is, as it should be, taken to mean lower mortgage rates and more infrastructure investments, it will be the economically sensitive, cyclical names that benefit, more so than the secular growth names that are tied to themes like AI that couldn't care less about 25, 50, or even 75 basis point changes in the federal funds rate.

The Dow climbed 846.24 points, or 1.89%, reaching a fresh high and closing at a record level of 45,631.74. The S&P 500 rose 1.52% to end at 6,466.91. At its session high, the broad market index came within three points of its record. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.88% and settled at 21,496.53.
Shares of megacap technology stocks soared on Powell's comments. Nvidia added 1.7%, while Meta Platforms jumped more than 2%. Alphabet and Amazon each climbed more than 3%. Tesla shares jumped about 6%.
In a tepid speech at the central bank's annual conclave in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Powell said that ""the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance."" The Fed chief added that ""the balance of risks appear to be shifting"" between the central bank's dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. He cited ""sweeping changes"" in tax, trade and immigration policies.
Expectations for a quarter-point rate cut in September surged to roughly 83% following the speed from about 75% earlier in the week, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.
""The bar is extremely high now for the Fed to leave rates unchanged in less than a month,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management.
Friday's performance came in contrast to much more downbeat market action this week. The major averages entered the session lower week to date due to pressure in megacap tech. The latest rally helped investors claw back most of the losses from earlier in the week.

The shares slipped in extended trading.
Here's how the company did relative to LSEG consensus:
- Earnings per share: $2.21 adjusted vs. $2.11 expected
- Revenue: $2.35 billion vs. $2.34 billion expected
Revenue increased 13% from a year earlier in the fiscal second quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. The company's net income rose to $228 million, or 84 cents per share, from $132 million, or 49 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.
For the current quarter, Workday called for $2.24 billion in subscription revenue and $180 million in professional services, which implies $2.42 billion in total revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected a total of $2.42 billion. The company sees an adjusted operating margin of 28.0%, just below the 28.1% consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.
Workday, which provides software for finance and human resources departments, now sees $8.82 billion in subscription revenue for the full year, and $700 million in professional services revenue, implying a total of $9.52 billion. The LSEG consensus was $9.51 billion.
The part of Workday that works with state and local governments faced challenges during the quarter, CEO Carl Eschenbach said on the earnings call.
""I think we'll continue to see that as people are trying to figure out what the funding slowdown is going to look like, all the way to the state level,"" he said.
Meanwhile, higher education in the U.S. is facing pressure from President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in March to shut down the Department of Education.
""If it's a higher ed university that includes a healthcare system, they too are getting a little pullback in funding,"" Eschenbach said. ""So it's something we're keeping our eye on.""
Also on Thursday Workday said it's acquiring Paradox, a company with conversational artificial intelligence software for recruiting, for undisclosed terms. During the quarter, Workday announced AI agents for extracting accounting details from documents and reporting absent days.
As of Thursday's market close, Workday shares were down about 12% this year, while the Nasdaq is up about 9%.",72ff5c82c0b796a3d9c9e76e7ae95e13,trafilatura

CEO Bill Simon,2025-08-22 00:00:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Walmart's former U.S. CEO Bill Simon thinks Thursday's stock drop is bizarre.
The big-box retailer lifted its full-year sales and earnings forecast, but the stock still slid 4.5%. Walmart ended Thursday as the Dow's biggest loser.
""It was about as good of a quarter as any retailer could have in any environment,"" he said on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" ""I don't get the decline in the market today at all.""
Simon, who ran Walmart U.S. from 2010 to 2014, cites Walmart's ability to engage shoppers with lower prices while absorbing tariffs as a key advantage.
""If you liked them yesterday, I don't know why you don't love them today. Topline is growing. They're expanding their margin,"" he said. ""They are really hitting it on all cylinders.""
Simon is still active in the consumer space —now serving on the Darden Restaurants board and as Hanesbrands chairman. When it comes to Walmart, he sees the decision to raise guidance despite tariffs as a key reason for optimism.
""As far as the tariffs go, there's no tariff impact to that business,"" Simon said.
He suggested investors may have been hung up on Walmart's first earnings miss in more than three years — which was mostly driven by one-off expenses including restructuring costs and insurance claims.
""It's a big number, but it's a one-time adjustment,"" said Simon. ""It's not a... systemic issue.""
Simon hasn't always been bullish on Walmart's business. In May 2024, he told ""Fast Money"" that high-income shoppers were creating a ""bubble"" at Walmart. His concern: They would return to premium retailers once inflation started to abate.
But that hasn't happened. Simon now contends the pull of cheaper prices and convenience of having groceries and general merchandise in one place as magnetic.
""If they [Walmart] can keep those toplines going, and that's their forecast, they're going to be just a bear of a company,"" Simon said.
Walmart shares are up 8% so far this year. However, they're about 7% below the record high hit on Feb. 14.

At least that's what Quan Gang, president of Beijing-based robot vacuum cleaner company Roborock, has in mind as he strategizes for the next five years. The company ranks first among smart vacuums by global market share, according to IDC Research. Last week, it reported a nearly 79% revenue surge in the first half of this year. About half of sales came from outside China.
In an exclusive interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Quan predicted that human-like robots will become part of many households by 2030, thanks largely to advances in generative artificial intelligence.
And before then, he expects, Roborock can make its latest, high-end cleaner with an AI-powered robotic arm so cheap that the mass market will be able to buy it — for at most a few hundred U.S. dollars.
""If we only focus on the premium segment, in the end, other than being the best robotic vacuum cleaner company in the world, we will have nothing,"" Quan said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He noted that robot vacuums still don't have a very high household penetration rate.
China, the largest market for the robot vacuums by value, has a penetration rate of only 5.6%, while the United States, the second-largest market, has a 22% penetration rate, according to Euromonitor estimates for 2025. The firm predicts penetration in the U.S. will tick up to 24.1% over the next two years, and edge down to 5.5% in China.
Competition in the robotic vacuum + robotic arm category heated up earlier this year at the U.S. Consumer Electronics Show, with Roborock and at least two other Chinese competitors releasing demos. The AI-powered arm removes obstacles from the cleaner's path as it rolls autonomously around the house.
So far, only Roborock has started selling one, called the Saros Z70 — but with a hefty price tag of around $2,600 on amazon.com. The site shows 141 reviews and a 4.6 rating. Roborock did not share specific sales figures.
Initial reviews of the Saros Z70 from U.S. tech sites such as Mashable and Wired weren't impressed, especially given the price, but hoped for more capable versions in the near future. Both recommended that consumers stick with the more traditional Roborock Saros 10R — which retails for $1,600.
Robot vacuum cleaner companies should develop products that ""bridge cutting-edge technologies and mainstream price points to accelerate adoption,"" said Jin Liu, senior analyst of small appliances at Euromonitor International.
But even if the price comes down, it would only be a small step toward having a robot help with cooking and other household chores.
Vacuum cleaners are the ""only successful application [of robots] in our homes to date,"" said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation (A3). ""This is after four decades of talking about how we're going to have robots in our home.""
""What made the [robot] vacuum cleaner so successful is it didn't cost that much,"" he said. For the same thing to happen for humanoids to enter homes, he said, there needs to be a compelling quality for the price.
Humanoids, such as those from Chinese startup Unitree, still cost tens of thousands of U.S. dollars and don't have clear household use cases yet.
Navigating tariffs
Despite its mass market ambitions, Roborock said that because of tariffs, it had to raise the Saros Z70 price by $700 from the original $1,899.
Quan said Roborock started working with suppliers late last year in Vietnam, where he said the company can fulfill all its North American orders.
Looking ahead, he said the company is considering global supply chain partnerships, but not necessarily to invest in building its own factories. Roborock's plans for a Hong Kong listing are primarily to raise capital for international expansion, Quan said, noting the company is also expanding beyond vacuums.
Despite Roborock's 79% revenue surge, the company more than doubled its spending, largely on research and development, steepening the company's losses in the first half of the year.
Quan said the company has hired nearly 100 AI experts this year and is still hiring — with an eye to add a total of nearly 200 AI experts this year. He said many of the new hires have overseas education or work experience.
The company built a dedicated AI lab in Shanghai and a research institute in Shenzhen, soon after Roborock's founding in 2014. When asked about computing power, Quan said there are many solutions and that buying Nvidia chips aren't the only option.
As for improving the AI-powered robotic arm and making it cheaper, ""the challenge lies primarily with the algorithm and data,"" he said, not the hardware.
Humanoid apps
As AI becomes more critical for household robots, Quan has an even bigger vision.
""If this robot in your home needs to clean, then it will have to integrate the cleaning knowledge that Roborock has accumulated over the years in algorithms, models, data and training,"" he said. ""Then it can be installed onto the robot like an app.""
""This robot may be Tesla's, or Unitree's, or someone else's, ... but in the area of cleaning, it will be inseparable from Roborock,"" he said, claiming the company has the best data on cleaning tasks. Another company might have the best data for robots to cook, he said.
The humanoid market will likely reach $5 trillion by 2050, with $800 billion in China alone, according to Morgan Stanley estimates.
""With humanoids, if they can't do more than one thing, then they're competing against an existing form factor that can do one thing very well,"" Burnstein said. But ne noted companies around the world expect there's a big market for safe, affordable humanoids that can cook, clean, help the elderly and do other things.
""We're not there yet with the technology, but maybe we'll get there and maybe that multitasking would be the differentiator potentially,"" he said. ""So you wouldn't need 5 robots. You might just need one.""",06047cfccc5456ca697d4d17e0e28ecf,trafilatura

The Stellantis automaker unveiled a new Jeep Cherokee on Thursday, the latest move to try to jump-start sales. It's the first Jeep hybrid system, and the first for Stellantis in North America.
The 2026 Jeep Cherokee redesign aims to evoke the iconic Cherokee SUV brand, which has dotted the company's history for decades. Jeep had previously discontinued the model in 2023 under Stellantis' former CEO Carlos Tavares as part of various cost-cutting measures.
Thursday's model marks the debut of Stellantis' new 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain, with more than 500 miles to a tank of fuel. The car will boast a ""technology-filled interior,"" according to the company, including Stellantis' new Connect One services package.
""Hybrid was the perfect piece to round out the rest of our portfolio,"" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told CNBC's Phil LeBeau on Friday morning.
The new model, which the company said is longer, taller and wider than the previous Cherokee, also maximizes its space with 30% more cargo capacity.
""This is the biggest segment in the United States, and bringing this back into our portfolio is a perfect fit between the Compass and the Grand Cherokee,"" Broderdorf told CNBC. ""This is obviously one of the largest misses from our sales decline that is now going to help reinvigorate a positive direction for us going forward.""
The entry-level 2026 car starts at $36,995, including a $1,995 destination charge. The cars will arrive at dealerships toward the end of this year and the beginning of next year, with production taking place at Stellantis' Mexico plant.
The announcement comes as Jeep tries to reinvigorate its sales in what has been a yearslong slump for the brand.
Amid a six-year sales decline for Jeep, Stellantis is also facing headwinds from President Donald Trump's tariffs, estimating its full-year impact for the company will reach 1.5 billion euros, or $1.74 billion. Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who took over the top job at the automaker earlier this summer, said on a July call with analysts that the company has been working with the Trump administration.
""Costs are certainly going to be impacted by tariffs,"" Broderdorf said. ""But obviously, being a global brand and having multiple nameplates at the plant, it allows us to be very, very flexible.""
Filosa, who was previously the CEO for Jeep, has long aimed to recover Jeep's market share through a revitalization of the Cherokee brand.
Stellantis touted a gradual improvement over the coming months in its first-half earnings in July.
""My first weeks as CEO have reconfirmed my strong conviction that we will fix what's wrong in Stellantis by capitalizing on everything that's right in Stellantis — starting from the strength, energy and ideas of our people, combined with the great new products we are now bringing to market,"" Filosa said in a July statement.",840900fc93ebf579891d7b12f8224106,trafilatura

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO Dive newsletter.
Upwork CFO Erica Gessert is focusing on ensuring the freelance talent marketplace has “levers in our business that are macro-agnostic” following what she termed as a “breakout quarter,” she told CFO Dive in an interview. The Palo Alto, California-based platform offers an online marketplace for global freelance talent, underpinned by AI, according to its website.
For its second quarter, Upwork reported a 47% year-over-year rise in net income to reach $32.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, as well as recording record revenue of about $195 million — a 1% YoY rise. Adjusted EBIDTA, meanwhile, jumped by 40% YoY to reach $57.1 million, according to its Q2 earnings results released Aug. 7.
Strong growth in AI-related services helped drive these results, a factor that was also enabled by several strategic acquisitions in recent years. The company has made four acquisitions during the past three years. Integrating technologies from those acquisitions into its AI tools drove “some of the great growth that we've been able to show in Q2,” Gessert said.
As part of its Q2 results, Upwork announced its acquisition of workforce management company Bubty, as well as a plan to acquire Ascen, a “digitally native solution for contingent W-2 workers,” according to its earnings release. The moves follow the acquisitions of Objective AI in 2024 and Headroom, an AI-powered video conferencing platform, in 2023, according to company documents.
However, an important factor of Upwork’s M&A strategy is “we would not have had the flexibility or optionality to do this … without worrying about accessing the capital markets, had we not made this big push to increase profitability [and] cash flow,” Gessert said.
Managing the integration piece
CFOs play a critical role in hitting the right balance between profitability and growth: it’s the job of the finance chief to remind the rest of the business that “profitability gives the business optionality for growth, and that's what it's done for us,” Gessert said. For its Q2, the company reported an 85% jump in free cash flow to reach $65.6 million, according to its earnings report.
Gessert joined Upwork in April 2023 after an eight-year tenure at PayPal, where she served in a number of roles, including a three-year span as its senior vice president, finance and analytics, according to her LinkedIn profile. Her past roles also include a six-year career at telecommunications provider Sprint, where she served in positions including VP, finance operations, postpaid marketing and CFO, Sprint Prepaid.",aaabdb5f5bab156520c9b4f04798a2d6,trafilatura

“We believe Polaris Forge 2 represents the next stage in Applied Digital’s rapid growth and our position as a leader in delivering high-performance AI infrastructure,” said Applied Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:APLD) CEO Wes Cummins.
”The demand for AI capacity continues to accelerate, and North Dakota continues to be one of the most strategic locations in the country to meet that need. We have strong interest from multiple parties and are in advanced negotiations with a U.S.-based investment-grade hyperscaler for this campus, making it both timely and prudent to proceed with groundbreaking and site development,” he added.
While we acknowledge the potential of APLD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Bain Capital and Cinven, which jointly own Stada, have started gearing up to hold an initial public offering of the business as soon as October, the people said. London-based buyout firm CapVest was in discussions to acquire Stada but it’s been unable to reach an agreement, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.

CapVest was in talks to buy Stada together with a group of other institutional investors in a transaction valuing the business at around €10 billion ($11.7 billion) including debt, Bloomberg News has reported.
The potential acquisition would have been a large deal for CapVest, which manages about €12 billion in assets. Talks cooled in part due to disagreements over valuation as well as the structure of CapVest’s bid, according to some of the people.
Bain and Cinven are now returning to plans for an IPO, which has always been their preferred exit route, the people said. While negotiations on a potential deal with CapVest have hit an impasse, the situation is fluid and there’s still a chance they could overcome their differences and reach an agreement, the people said.
Representatives for Bain, CapVest, Cinven and Stada declined to comment.
Bain and Cinven started weighing options for Stada in 2023. The company manufactures and sells a range of products such as consumer health-care items, generic drugs and specialty medication for rare and chronic diseases.
Stada told investors in June that it’s on track to achieve its earnings guidance of €930 million to €990 million of adjusted Ebitda for the year. It’s targeting €4.25 billion to €4.4 billion of adjusted revenues.
The company’s brands include Grippostad, which helps treat colds and flu infections, and Hirudoid cream for bruises and hematoma. Bain and Cinven agreed to buy Stada for €5.3 billion in 2017, a deal that gave them control of one of Europe’s last independent generic-drug companies.

The 73-year-old governor will attend the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole annual symposium this week, where Chair Jerome Powell's assessment of the American economy and hints on the next U.S. rate cut will be factors in Japan's own deliberations.
Ueda has become one of the more cautious members of the BOJ's nine-member board in recent months and his concerns about the economic impact of U.S. tariffs are likely to provide some restraint among his fellow policymakers who are calling for more rate hikes, analysts and sources say.
An analysis in the BOJ's recent outlook report in part underscores his caution over the expected hit to Japan's economy from tariffs that could complicate its decision around the timing of the next rate hike.
""Japan's trade deal with the U.S. reduced, but did not eliminate, uncertainty over tariffs,"" said a source familiar with the central bank's thinking, a view echoed by another source. ""It's too early for the BOJ to be optimistic on Japan's economy.""
Ueda has faced growing calls from within his board to pay more attention to mounting inflationary pressure in Japan's once deflation-prone economy.
A U.S. rate cut could push up the yen against the dollar, which may ease concern about the inflationary impact of a weak yen - but could hurt exporters' profits depending on the pace.
Stubbornly high food inflation has led some BOJ board members to warn of second-round price effects that could warrant another rate hike, a summary of the bank's July meeting showed.
The hawkish signals contrast with Ueda's post-meeting comments justifying going slow on rate hikes on the view underlying inflation, which focuses on domestic demand and wages, remains below the BOJ's target.
""Governor Ueda appears to pay particularly close attention to the U.S. economy,"" said former BOJ board member Takahide Kiuchi. ""If he becomes more convinced that the U.S. economy will stabilise, the BOJ could eye a rate hike this year.""
CIRCLE OF HAWKS
On the surface, the hawks appear to be gaining an upper hand.
Among current board members, three - Naoki Tamura, Hajime Takata and Junko Koeda - are seen by markets as hawks due in part to their recent comments warning that rising food prices could risk leading to broader-based, sustained inflation.
Deputy governor Ryozo Himino, who once warned that keeping real interest rates negative for too long would be ""abnormal"", is considered the most hawkish among the BOJ's leadership.
By contrast, the doves, who dominated the board when Ueda's predecessor Haruhiko Kuroda deployed a massive stimulus in 2013, have seen their presence and voice diminished.
Toyoaki Nakamura, who voted against a rate hike in January, retired in June and was succeeded by Kazuyuki Masu, who is seen as taking a neutral stance on policy. Once a fan of heavy money printing, Asahi Noguchi has also turned more neutral and voted for raising rates in January.
Such shifts in the board's policy bias put Ueda and his career central banker-turned deputy Shinichi Uchida in the more dovish camp, as their comments continue to focus on downside risks to Japan's fragile economy.
Their caution reflects the BOJ's preference to await more data to gauge whether the global economy, including Japan's, will withstand the hit from U.S. tariffs, say sources familiar with the bank's thinking.
It also reflects lingering worries within the BOJ that the damage to exports and capital expenditure will intensify in coming months - as predicted by the bank's economists.
In analyses included in the July quarterly outlook, BOJ economists warned company profits are likely to fall this year because of U.S. tariffs, hurting capital expenditure.
There is good reason to worry. While Japan's trade deal with the U.S. agreed to cut tariffs for its mainstay auto exports, Washington has not made clear the timing of the reduction.
Many analysts expect exports, which lifted Japan's second-quarter GDP, to lose momentum later this year as the hit from U.S. tariffs deepens.
Even hawkish board members warn such risks could warrant caution on rate hikes.
""We need to scrutinise whether any negative impact from U.S. tariffs could appear,"" board member Takata said in a speech on July 3.
Despite the board's hawkish tilt, Ueda's cautious stance may prevail given the influence the governor holds over BOJ decision making.
With support from staff of key divisions, the governor prepares proposals on policy and interest rates for a vote by the board. Most have been approved unanimously or by a majority, including the BOJ's exit from a decade-long stimulus last year.
The governor's proposal has never been voted down since the current board framework took shape in 1998.
""I don't see any tough negotiator in the current board who could stage a revolt. It's hard to imagine the hawks proposing a rate hike against the governor's will,"" said former BOJ official Nobuyasu Atago, who used to be staff for hawkish ex-board member Miyako Suda.
""Governor Ueda's leadership within the board appears to be fairly strong.""

A7A5 has been used to evade sanctions that the US and UK imposed on Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022, according to crypto forensics firms TRM Labs and Elliptic.
“If the Kremlin thinks they can hide their desperate attempts to soften the blow of our sanctions by laundering transactions through dodgy crypto networks — they are sorely mistaken,” UK Sanctions Minister Stephen Doughty said in a statement.
“These sanctions keep up the pressure on Putin at a critical time and crack down on the illicit networks being used to funnel money into his war chest.”
The UK sanctioned Capital Bank, a Kyrgyzstan-based bank, and cryptocurrency exchange Grinex, which crypto tracing firm TRM Labs has described as a “successor platform” to Garantex, a previously-sanctioned Russian exchange.
It also sanctioned Meer, a centralised crypto exchange registered on December 9, 2024 — the same day that Grinex and A7A5 were established, according to TRM.
The ruble-pegged A7A5 is issued by Kyrgyzstani company Old Vector and designed to facilitate the recovery of assets belonging to Garantex customers, according to TRM. About $26 million in Tether’s stablecoin USDT on Garantex was frozen after officials in the US, Germany, and Finland seized the exchange’s primary domain in March.
(UK officials did not accuse Tether of aiding in Russian sanctions evasion in their Wednesday notice. But US authorities opened an investigation into the company last year for possible violations of sanctions and anti-money laundering rules, according to a Wall Street Journal report. CEO Paolo Ardoino accused the newspaper of “regurgitating old noise.”)
“Former Garantex customers were credited with A7A5 in amounts equivalent to their frozen balances, which could then be traded or redeemed on [Grinex],” TRM wrote in its August 4 report.
In late June, crypto forensics firm Elliptic said over $1 billion was being transferred through A7A5 daily, with the aggregate value of the stablecoin’s transfers topping $41 billion.
A7A5 is a yield-bearing stablecoin, paying holders 50% of the interest earned on the bank deposits that back it, according to its documentation. It is available on Ethereum and TRON.
“We are creating not just a ruble stablecoin, but a tool that gives the market the opportunity to safely enter the ruble and USDT, as well as an alternative to USDT that is not subject to sanctions risks,” the team behind A7A5 has said, according to Elliptic, which did not provide a source for the quote.",b3900187fefeca724f41ec9153b21b13,trafilatura

The betting market will be available through Robinhood's Prediction Markets Hub, available across the U.S. through Kalshi, the popular trading platform said in a blog post on Wednesday.
""Customers can now trade on the outcomes of the most popular pro and college football games, including all regular season pro matchups, and all college Power 4 schools and independents,"" according to the post.
Robinhood is positioning the move as an alternative to traditional betting platforms. Rather than routing through sportsbooks, these trades are executed on Kalshi’s federally regulated exchange and treated like commodities, not wagers.
""Unlike sports betting, where the firm sets a line, event contracts leverage the power and rigor of financial market structure and are offered in a marketplace where buyers and sellers interact to set the price,"" the blog post said.
With this move Robinhood could be coming after some of the traditional betting platforms, such as DraftKings (DKNG) and Fanduel parent Flutter Entertainment (FLUT).
Regulated sports betting
The launch marks Robinhood’s latest move into prediction markets after previously signaling interest in the space.
In March, the company rolled out a broader “Prediction Markets Hub” available through CFTC-regulated exchange Kalshi, following the popularity of crypto-native platforms like Polymarket, where users bet on outcomes ranging from elections to inflation rates using USDC.
While Polymarket operated in a regulatory gray zone in the U.S., it recently said it is preparing an official return to the U.S. through the acquisition of QCX, a regulated derivatives exchange, following a federal investigation into Polymarket's operations that was dropped.
However, Robinhood sidestepped those regulatory concerns by partnering with Kalshi, which is an exchange already licensed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That allows Robinhood to tap into sports, politics and macroeconomic event trading without triggering gambling laws.
Today's news is likely a step into a broader strategy as Robinhood starts with sports betting, one of the most popular betting avenues. ""We currently offer contracts across crypto, economics, financials, sports, culture, and more, with others being added regularly,"" the post said.
""Ultimately, our goal is to enable anyone, anywhere, to trade, invest or hold any financial asset and conduct any financial transaction through Robinhood.""

Gold's price is driven by ownership changes, not traditional supply-demand dynamics.
-
Gold isn't consumed but accumulated and kept in vaults, reserves, and jewelry.
-
Conviction and opportunistic buyers drive it — like Manhattan real estate.
Gold may be a commodity, but its price moves more like prime Manhattan real estate than barrels of oil, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note.
Invest in Gold
That's because, unlike oil or gas, gold isn't consumed. It's accumulated. Buyers have been flocking to the precious metal in recent months, pushing gold to ever-higher price records.
Nearly all gold ever mined — about 220,000 metric tons — still exists, mostly locked in vaults, central bank reserves, or jewelry boxes. New annual production adds just over 1% to the existing stock and is capped by operational and technical constraints.
""You can't pump gold — but you can bid it out of someone's hands. Gold doesn't get used — it changes hands and gets repriced,"" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts.
""The gold price reflects who is more willing to hold it and who's willing to let go,"" they added.
That makes gold very different from other commodities, where traditional supply-demand dynamics apply and higher prices could choke off demand.
""Its market clears through changes in ownership, not production-versus-use balances,"" wrote Goldman's analysts.
Goldman identifies two groups of buyers: ""conviction buyers"" such as central banks, ETFs, and speculators, who buy regardless of price, and ""opportunistic buyers"" — households in emerging markets like India and China — who step in only when the price is right. The second group provides a floor under gold prices during sell-offs, but it's the conviction buyers who set the trend.
That's where the Manhattan real estate analogy comes in.
""The total number of apartments is largely fixed, and the small amount of new construction each year is not what drives prices. What matters is the identity of the marginal buyer,"" wrote the analysts.
In Manhattan, there are also two groups of buyers: conviction buyers — those with deep pockets who will live there at any cost — and opportunistic buyers — those who will buy only at the right price and are otherwise content to live in New Jersey or Brooklyn, they wrote.
In both markets, prices shift not because of new supply, but because of who takes the keys.
Goldman's analysis finds conviction flows explain about 70% of gold price's month-to-month moves. As a rule of thumb, every 100 tons of net buying by conviction buyers pushes prices up by about 1.7%.",8c54bdf68d7dae3d57220ee9d00af043,trafilatura

Speaking on the ""Iced Coffee Hour Podcast,"" the outspoken investor revealed how the 1031 exchange became his financial game-changer and why he believes mindset trumps everything else in wealth building.
The $50 Million Tax Strategy
Mallah doesn’t mince words about his wealth-building secret: the 1031 exchange. This tax provision allows real estate investors to defer capital gains taxes by rolling proceeds from property sales into new investments.

“The 1031 exchange made me who I was today,” Mallah told host Graham Stephan. “It forced me to never touch my money and instead roll it into the next deal.”
The numbers tell the story of his success. Mallah estimates he would owe approximately $50 million in taxes if he sold everything without utilizing 1031 exchanges. By continuously reinvesting rather than cashing out, he’s built an empire that generates consistent cash flow while deferring massive tax obligations.
“Without the 1031 and banks, I would have remained a garbage man,” he added, emphasizing how this strategy accelerated his growth trajectory.
Mindset Over Money: The Mental Game of Wealth
For Mallah, financial success starts in the mind. On the podcast, he explained that he has zero tolerance for what he calls “negative people” or those who aren’t actively working to improve their circumstances, even when they possess the ability to do so.

“Many intelligent people with potential fail because their priorities aren’t in order,” he told the hosts. “They focus on partying or superficial desires instead of personal and financial growth.”
His wealth-building philosophy centers on training your brain to focus on activities that lead to financial security while avoiding distractions like gambling, excessive drinking, or trying to “keep up with the Joneses.”
The Full-Time Job of Managing Wealth
Despite his success, Mallah told Stephan that he treats wealth management as a demanding career. He described managing his portfolio as requiring “constant thought, homework, and calculation of tax ramifications, appreciation, depreciation, and cash flow” before making any property decisions.",28d5aa38fd2d009a78ebfe502053d03e,trafilatura

Sam Altman may be right to say that investors in AI are “overexcited,” but this isn’t a bubble in the tulip mania sense. OpenAI has real revenues ($13 billion) and massive user growth. Still, tech valuations, especially the Magnificent Seven’s dominance in the S&P 500, look overheated, suggesting a potential correction even if fundamentals remain strong.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the word “bubble” three times in 15 seconds in a room full of reporters and then urged them not to write a story about it—thus ensuring that plenty of stories would be written. He was arguing that investors are “overexcited” by AI.
Is he right?
From the point of view of technical stock valuations, probably yes. From the point of view of fundamentals, maybe not.
A classic bubble exists when the assets being valued are fundamentally not worth their price (and never will be) or when the underlying value is close to zero.
So, in the great Dutch “tulip mania” of 1637, it is clear in hindsight that the price of a tulip bulb should never be equal to 10 times an annual salary.
And in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, it became clear in hindsight that many mortgages had been given to people who simply didn’t have the ability to afford them, and thus those mortgages were worth far less than banks’ balance sheets said they did.
So the question becomes whether AI is a bubble or not right now. From the fundamental point of view, the answer is no. OpenAI isn’t literally worth nothing. It’s not a tulip bulb or a tract home in the middle of nowhere. There is a real business there.
JPMorgan’s Brenda Duverce told clients in a recent note that “OpenAI’s ARR has reached ~$13bn (up 30% from Jun-25), and the company has reported it is on track to reach 700mn weekly active users (up 40% from Mar-25), while surpassing 5mn paying business users (up 66% from Jun-25).” She also noted that a “secondary market transaction that could push the company’s valuation to $500bn, up from the previously cited $300bn post-money figure from Mar-25, which would make OpenAI the most valuable private company in the world.”
To put that bluntly, a company with a chatbot that often gets things wrong is somehow about to become the largest unicorn earth has ever seen. That does feel frothy.
But OpenAI isn’t worth nothing: $13 billion in revenues is a real thing. Maybe the value of its equity will decline in the short term but the company isn’t teetering the way Lehman Brothers was in 2007.
But how about the technical point of view?
There is a lot of chatter on Wall Street right now about whether tech stocks are overvalued in a way that looks like a bubble. They have some scary charts!",fc555dad6c767cbeec9da124fcd9d70a,trafilatura

Over the past sixty years, Buffett’s investing strategy has turned the firm into a trillion-dollar giant, with powerful positions in the insurance, tech, and energy sectors. He’s known as a major backer of American brand names, and has long held multi-billion positions in Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola.

Buffett is particularly well-known for his promotion of value investing, buying into high-quality companies and holding onto them for the long term. A master of the bon mot, Buffett has said that if you can’t imagine holding a stock for 10 years, then you shouldn’t even hold it for 10 minutes. He has also shown a preference for buying into undervalued stocks, as long as their fundamentals are sound, and his success in finding those gems has earned him the nickname ‘the Oracle of Omaha.’
Following Buffett’s trades has long been a viable strategy for the ordinary retail investor – and as he retires, we can take a look at two of his final stock purchases as the head of Berkshire Hathaway.
They’re interesting choices – but according to the TipRanks database, analysts at Bank of America aren’t as convinced. So, let’s give them both a closer look to see where these names are at – and maybe get an idea of just why a major investor and a major investment bank are taking diverging stands.
UnitedHealth Group(UNH)
The first stock we’re looking at here, UnitedHealth, is a giant of the US health insurance industry – in fact, with its market cap of $275 billion, it is the largest company in that space. UnitedHealth operates through two distinct, but complementary, business divisions. The first of these, the eponymous UnitedHealthcare, offers customers a full range of health benefits and affordable coverage. The company’s policies include employer and individual plans; Medicare and retirement plans; and community and state benefit products.
Under its second main business division, Optum, the company provides a wide range of direct-care health services, including mental health services. Optum Health acts as a patient-centered provider, for high-quality, community-based care nationwide. Optum Insight partners with the payers, the providers, and the government and life-science companies that develop services and handle payment – all to create a simplified administrative and financial process. Finally, Optum RX deals with the pharmacy end, making medications available at affordable prices.
Through these business arms, UnitedHealth covers more than 148 million people worldwide, and employs nearly 400,000 people. The company’s workforce includes administrative and office staff; insurance adjusters; clinicians and pharmacists – everyone needed to provide leading-edge healthcare services. The company generates revenues in the hundreds of billions, but we should note, however, that UNH shares fell in April of this year, after the company released its 1Q25 results – and revised its full year 2025 guidance downward, a slide that continued when the company suspended its 2025 outlook in May. The stock faced additional downward pressure after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into possible Medicare fraud at the company. All told, the stock is down 39% for the year-to-date.
On a positive note, UnitedHealth’s 2Q25 report showed a top line of $111.6 billion, a figure that up 13% year-over-year and met Street expectations. At the bottom line, the the non-GAAP EPS came to $4.08, missing the forecast by 37 cents per share. Even though the company’s earnings missed the forecast, they are still more than enough to fund the dividend. UNH’s next common share payment, for $2.21 per share, is due to be paid on September 23. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to $8.84 per common share and gives a forward yield of 3%.
Buffett, for his part, must think the stock now offers some great value. Last Friday, the stock got a bump when Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosure forms revealed that Buffett’s firm opened a significant stake in UNH. Berkshire Hathaway bought 5,039,564 shares of UNH, a stake that is worth $1.532 billion at the current share price.
On the other hand, while Bank of America acknowledges that UnitedHealth is a solid player in its field, it believes the company faces some near-term difficulties. As analyst Kevin Fischbeck writes, “UNH set a tone of refocusing on strong execution, but the pace of improvement is likely slower than expected. UNH expects ‘solid but moderate earnings growth in 2026, but accelerating in 2027 and in succeeding years.’ UNH didn’t explicitly bless 13-16% LT growth, but pointed in that direction, indicating it would get back to low double-digit ranges and get back to ‘historical levels,’ which is predicated on reasonable growth from well run businesses, compounding efficiency gains, deploying capital for shareholders and M&A. UNH was much more open about segment margins and issues, creating a better understanding of the drivers. That said, we reiterate Neutral given what we see as significant earnings power, but low visibility in earnings in the near term.”
The stated Neutral rating is accompanied by a $290 price target – which implies a downside of 4.5% in the next 12 months. (To watch Fischbeck’s track record, click here)
There are 22 recent analyst reviews on file for UNH, and the breakdown – 18 to Buy, 2 to Hold and Sell, each – supports a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $304.01 and the average target price of $312.95 indicates a modest one-year upside potential of 3%. (See UNH stock forecast)
Allegion(ALLE)
The next stock we’ll look at is Allegion, a leader in the home security field. Allegion’s products are designed to keep people safe, whether at home, at school, at work, or traveling to and fro. The company has operations and sales in more than 120 countries, and its product lines focus on doorway security: residential and commercial locks and locking mechanisms, door closers and other exit devices, and advanced doorframes to control access to protected spaces. The company spun off from Ingersoll Rand to become a stand-alone public firm in 2013. Allegion boasts that some of its owned brand names date back to the 1700s.
Among the names in Allegion’s portfolio are Austral Lock, Kreiger Specialty Products, Stanley Access Technologies, Steelcraft, Kryptonite, and Soss Door Hardware. Most of the company’s product brands can be found around the world, and specific products include such stand-bys as keys and levers; portable chains and locks (think bicycles, here); electronic access and monitoring devices; weather stripping solutions for exterior doors; latches, hinges, and other hardware for door systems; and even automated entrance solutions. While we don’t always think of doors and doorways as essential technology, Allegion’s product lines remind us that doors – and other access points – are vital areas wherever we go.
In its quarterly report for 2Q25, Allegion’s top line came to $1.02 billion. This was up 5.6% from the prior year and was $20.6 million better than had been anticipated. The company’s bottom line also beat the estimates; the $2.04 non-GAAP EPS was up 4% year-over-year and was 5 cents per share better than expected.
When we turn to Warren Buffett’s purchase, we find that the legendary investor’s new position in ALLE totals 780,133 shares. This holding is currently valued at $130.414 million.
This is another stock whose good execution has caught Bank of America’s attention. 5-star analyst Andrew Obin notes the company’s new management and its sound prospects for continued strong results – although he also notes that Allegion’s close connections to the construction industry could be problematic if interest rates remain high. Obin writes of the company, “While Allegion’s end markets have been weak, the company has executed well. Since August 2022 when the current CEO John Stone joined, the Architecture Billings Index (ABI) has only been at or above 50 for six months. Despite the depressed ABI, Allegion has beat on EPS every quarter since Stone has been CEO. We expect the execution to remain strong as the company’s markets bottom/improve… Our Neutral rating balances Allegion’s consistent execution and the bottoming of the non-resi construction market with Allegion’s exposure to the residential construction market which remains soft in the current high-interest rate environment.”
Obin’s Neutral (i.e., Hold) rating comes along with a $175 price target that implies this stock will gain 5% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Obin’s track record, click here)
There are 9 recent analyst reviews here, and their split of 3 Buys and 6 Holds gives the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. ALLE shares are currently trading for $167.17 and have an average price target of $171.56, suggesting the shares will stay rangebound for the time being. (See ALLE stock forecast)

Veganz Group is putting its operating divisions into separate subsidiaries and moving to a holding structure.
The company, which made a loss of €4.8m ($5.6m) in 2024 amid declining sales, will remain the majority owner of each of the subsidiaries – Mililk, Happy Cheeze, Peas on Earth and Veganz.
“The new structure creates the basis for a clear focus as an innovative technology investment holding company and supports further international growth,” Veganz Group said in a statement.
Veganz Group – which will change name to Planethic Group – believes the restructuring will give the different businesses more chance of hitting their growth targets. The shake-up will also allow potential suitors to invest in specific subsidiaries, rather than only the entire group.
Just Drinks understands Veganz Group is in talks with interested parties to invest in the subsidiaries. Discussions have so far progressed furthest for its plant-based milk business Mililk.
“With the measures decided today, we are laying the foundation for accelerated growth,” founder and CEO Jan Bredack said in a statement. “The new holding structure and capital measures increase our strategic flexibility, improve the liquidity of our shares and open up significant value enhancement potential for our shareholders.”
Bredack is stepping down in October but will remain “closely associated” with the business as the Berlin-headquartered company’s largest shareholder.
He will focus on indoor farming as the managing director of OrbiFarm, the business Veganz Group sold for €30m to an unidentified “third party” earlier this year, plus a profit share.
Ryan Tegtmeier, a former CFO of online supplements business Nu3 Group, will succeed Bredack as CEO.
The AGM, held last Wednesday (13 August), also saw Veganz Group’s executive and supervisory boards for the 2024 financial year discharged.
On Friday, the company announced that supervisory board chairman Roland Sieker had decided to step down.
Yesterday, Veganz Group said company shareholder Evgeni Kouris had been appointed to the role.
Reporting its 2024 results in May, Veganz Group said sales dropped 34% to €10.8m.
It added that the DACH region, namely Germany, Austria and Switzerland, accounted for 95% of the sales total, with Germany the company’s largest market at 81%.
Meanwhile, EBITDA losses for 2024 narrowed to €2.4m from €6.3m a year earlier and, similarly, the net loss shrank to €4.8m from €9.5m.
Earlier today, the company said a rights issue, private placements in July and August, as well as the “utilisation of contingent capital”, had strengthened its equity base to around €8.4m. “With the additional placements, we have strengthened our equity base and thus created the necessary flexibility to consistently implement our growth strategy,” Bredack said.",beaa4626d08b7422acec5fc905cb2ce4,trafilatura

(NYSE: NEXA) (""Nexa Resources"", ""Nexa"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce the full resumption of operations at its Cerro Pasco Complex. The Atacocha and El Porvenir mines have resumed at normal capacity utilization levels following the cessation of illegal protests by a small group of individuals from the San Juan de Milpo community, which has restored access to the mines.
The temporary and partial disruption resulted in an estimated zinc production loss of approximately 1.2kt of zinc. This volume is expected to be recovered in the upcoming month, and as previously disclosed, the Company's 2025 production guidance remains unchanged.
Nexa reaffirms its commitment to maintaining constructive dialogue with local communities and authorities and to supporting the social and economic development of its host regions.
About Nexa
Nexa is a large-scale, low-cost, integrated polymetallic producer, zinc being our main product, with over 65 years of experience developing and operating mining and smelting assets in Latin America. Nexa currently owns and operates four long-life underground polymetallic mines, two located in the Central Andes region of Peru, and two located in Brazil (one in the state of Minas Gerais and one in the state of Mato Grosso). Nexa also owns and operates one low-cost polymetallic open pit mine, also in the Central Andes region of Peru, and three smelters, two located in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil (Três Marias and Juiz de Fora), and one, located in Lima, which is Cajamarquilla, the largest smelter in the Americas.
Nexa was among the top five producers of mined zinc globally in 2024 and one of the top five metallic zinc producers worldwide in 2024, according to Wood Mackenzie.

According to Ramsey personalities George Kamel and Jade Warshaw, that still doesn’t mean any of it is good. On a recent episode of “The Ramsey Show,” the two ranked debt from worst to least harmful.

Starting with payday loans, which you should absolutely avoid, and ending with medical debt, which can sometimes be unavoidable, here is a ranked list of what types of debt are the worst.
Also see the key barriers standing in the way of paying off debt.
Payday Loans
“If we have a spectrum here, I think the worst is payday loans,” Warshaw said.
Payday loans are highly predatory loans that can trap borrowers in cycles of repayment. Typically only small dollar amounts are involved, usually under $500, per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. However, these loans can be very costly because effective interest rate can be 300% or 400%, Kamel noted.
Check Out: Do Your Student Loans Affect Your Credit?
Buy Now, Pay Later Plans
Warshaw said she considers buy now, pay later (BNPL) plans just as dangerous as payday loans because of the potential for developing negative spending habits. BNPL loans can normalize borrowing for everyday purchases, encourage overspending and create a pattern of dependency on debt.
Credit Cards
The next on the list was credit cards, with the experts highlighting their predatory nature and high interest rates.
High interest rates and easy access make credit cards one of the most common and damaging forms of unsecured debt. As reported by LendingTree, citing Federal Reserve data, Americans hold a total $1.209 trillion in credit card debt as of the second quarter of 2025, and 46% of adults carried a credit card balance for at least a month in the past year. And the rates aren’t favorable, with an average APR in the second quarter of 21.16%.
Car Payments
“The car payment is what keeps you average. It’s what keeps you broke,” Warshaw said. And Kamel noted that this is one of the worst types of debt for the middle class.
While technically secured by a vehicle, car loans are tied to a rapidly depreciating asset. According to Kelley Blue Book, your car can depreciate around 30% over the first two years. And many people will get a new car and a new payment as soon as they pay off their current car.
“It’s just keeping you from building wealth,” Warshaw said.
HELOCs
The experts brought up home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) later in the video, noting that they’re also a middle-class trap.",7c731643c6a7ae2bce8c08511c930c02,trafilatura

The Japanese technology group said in a statement that the investment will give it about a 2% stake in the company. Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s chief executive and chair, called Intel a “trusted leader in innovation” and said the investment shows confidence that production in the U.S. will expand, with Intel at the center.
Intel’s chief executive, Lip-Bu Tan, has been in the role for only five months. He inherited a company trying to pull out of a long slump marked by sliding sales, repeated losses and fading dominance in chip design. Already under Tan it has announced plans to lay off 20% of its staff to pare back bureaucracy within the company.
Tan said Tuesday that Intel was “very pleased to deepen our relationship with SoftBank, a company that’s at the forefront of so many areas of emerging technology and innovation and shares our commitment to advancing U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership.”
“Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,” he added, referring to the SoftBank boss.
SoftBank’s move builds on a pledge to grow stateside, after President Donald Trump said it would channel $100 billion into the country over four years. The Japanese government has pressed Washington to ease tariffs in return for that investment.
The announcement came shortly after the report that the U.S. federal government is mulling an investment that would make it Intel’s largest shareholder. That deal would convert some or all of the grants allocated to the company under the U.S. bipartisan Chips and Science Act into equity, according to Bloomberg .
Intel was granted a combined $10.9 billion in grants under the act for commercial and military manufacturing, which former President Joe Biden signed into law in 2022.
A stake in Intel would be Trump’s latest try at intervening in the chipmaking industry. Last week, the U.S. government announced a deal that would have two of Intel’s rivals, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, pay 15% of their revenues from sales in China.
Danni Hewson, an analyst at AJ Bell, said the latest deal gives Intel “one vote of confidence that Tan’s recovery effort can be successful.”",f701d3919c6acb0cf2036e74604b14a5,trafilatura

(NYSE:BTU) has abandoned its planned $3.8 billion purchase of steelmaking coal assets from Anglo American (OTC:AAUKF), citing a material adverse change following a March fire at the Moranbah North mine in Australia. The incident left the mine idled with no clear timeline for resuming longwall production.
The withdrawal comes less than a year after Anglo agreed to divest the portfolio to Peabody as part of a sweeping restructuring effort. The original deal, valued at up to $3.8 billion, was expected to close in 2025.
That package included an 88% stake in the Moranbah North joint venture, a 70% share of the Capcoal joint venture, and other key positions such as the Dawson and Roper Creek projects.
Also Read: Options Corner: Peabody Energy Could Ride A Red Wave Back To Relevance
Anglo American CEO Duncan Wanblad had described the sale as a critical move to streamline operations and sharpen the company's focus on copper, iron ore, and crop nutrients. The divestment followed its earlier $1.1 billion sale of a Jellinbah Group stake.
At the time of the announcement, Jim Grech, Peabody's president and CEO, had called the portfolio ""world-class"" and said it would create long-term value by integrating with Peabody's global operations.
However, after the fire at Moranbah North, the largest mine in the package, no revised terms were reached to offset the long-term impact.
Peabody subsequently terminated both the acquisition and a related agreement to sell the Dawson mine to PT Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama.
Anglo had projected Moranbah would produce more than 5 million tons of saleable coal in 2025. Instead, the fire saddled the mine with roughly $45 million in monthly holding costs, undermining the deal's economics. The uncertainty around recovery ultimately became the deal's breaking point.
Peabody now plans to emphasize growth from its Centurion Mine in Australia, a 25-year premium hard coking coal project, while continuing a four-part strategy built on safe operations, returning 65-100% of free cash flow to shareholders, organic growth, and balance sheet strength. The company said it remains well-positioned despite the failed acquisition.
In the wider coal sector, peers include Arch Resources Inc. (NYSE:ARCH) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc. (NYSE:AMR). Investors also track energy-linked exchange-traded funds such as the VanEck Coal ETF (NYSE:KOL) and the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME).

Dee will be responsible for overseeing all technology and information platforms supporting Kohl’s stores and e-commerce operations, and will report to Michael Bender, Kohl’s interim chief executive officer.

“We are happy to welcome Steve to the Kohl’s team during this important time for the company,” Bender said in a statement. “As an omnichannel retailer, it’s critical for our business to have smart, agile tech solutions that both drive the work and enable operational effectiveness. Steve is well-positioned to help accelerate our strategic goals and enhance the experiences we deliver to our customers and teams.”
Kohl’s has been struggling to reverse its pattern of declining sales and profitability for several seasons.
The Menomonee Falls, Wisc.-based Kohl’s indicated that Dee has more than 25 years of experience in technology and “a track record of driving results, scaling technology teams and delivering innovative tech solutions.”
“Retail is an exciting and dynamic industry that depends on smart, scalable technology solutions to serve associates all across the country, enable the systems that run operations and ultimately improve the way Kohl’s can serve our customers,” Dee said in his statement.
Dee fills a role previously held by Siobhán Mc Feeney, who served as Kohl’s chief technology and digital officer until leaving the business last April. Prior to Kohl’s, Dee ran technology operations at Nike, Hayneedle and J.Crew and has 12 years experience at Accenture, leading clients through transformational programs in the consumer goods and retail spaces. Most recently he was chief information and technology officer for Rodan + Fields, a skin care and hair care company.
While filling one critical role, Kohl’s has yet to fill another. The company continues to search for a CEO, to succeed interim CEO Bender.
Bender moved into the interim position following the sudden departure of Ashley Buchanan, who was fired last May following an investigation that disclosed he arranged for Kohl’s to sell his girlfriend’s coffee products at very favorable terms to his girlfriend’s company. The investigation also showed that Buchanan hired Boston Consulting Group, where his girlfriend, Chondra Holt, worked as an adviser.

This year, just four companies are on track to spend more than $350 billion and are set to spend at least $400 billion in 2026. To put that into perspective, adjusted for inflation, the entire Apollo program -- which put humans on the Moon -- spent less than $300 billion over 10 years.
CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) is right in the middle of this data center boom, buying Nvidia's top chips and renting them out to companies like Microsoft. The opportunity here is massive, but so is the risk, as the company continues to fuel its growth with debt.
1. CoreWeave has a $30.1 billion backlog
The company fills the substantial gap that exists between demand for AI computing power and current supply. It's what has led CoreWeave's top line to explode, up more than 200% year over year as of its second-quarter report. The jump from under $400 million in Q2 2024 to more than $1.21 billion in Q2 2025 is incredible, but can it continue?
The $30.1 billion in backlog sure makes it seem so, at least for the foreseeable future. That's $30.1 billion in sales lined up so long as the company follows through on its commitments and can build out the capacity needed to fill those orders.
There's a wrinkle here, however. While the $30.1 billion is a significant increase from last quarter's $25.9 billion, the company had already announced a $4 billion deal with OpenAI in its last earnings that accounted for the bulk of the quarter-over-quarter jump. CoreWeave only booked $1.4 billion in new contracts this quarter -- not as much as might have been expected.
2. CoreWeave spent a record $2.9 billion in capex
The company spent $2.9 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in Q2, the bulk of which went toward purchasing Nvidia's hyper-advanced data center chips as it tries to meet the demand. Management has to make sure that it spends cash now to have chips available when customers need it; as best it can, it needs to anticipate demand, but it doesn't want to overspend if it can avoid it -- these chips aren't cheap. That makes capex a useful indicator of where the company thinks that demand will be in the future.
And while a record-setting capex would seem at first blush to mean all is good, the $2.9 billion was actually lower than Wall Street expected and could indicate demand is not as strong as hoped.
3. CoreWeave's debt continues to grow, topping $11 billion
In order to scale at its lightning-fast pace, the company is making use of debt -- a lot of it. In Q2, the company's total debt reached more than $11 billion, and analysts believe it could add another $10 billion by year-end. Just to service the interest on this debt, the company paid nearly $270 million in the second quarter. That's extremely high. In fact, CoreWeave paid more than 13 times its operating income just to cover the interest on its debt. And if it indeed adds another $10 billion to its debt load before 2025 is done, that multiple could be even worse.
And while many companies effectively leverage debt to scale, the assets the company is buying with this debt don't have that long a useful life. These aren't loans for a gas pipeline that will last decades. These are high-interest loans for chips with shelf lives of a few years.
CoreWeave is riding the edge
CoreWeave's growth is built on too rocky a foundation for my taste. While the blistering pace and massive backlog are reassuring in the near term, there are already some cracks. But relying on high-interest debt to play the middleman in AI doesn't seem like a long-term winning strategy to me.
There will likely come a time when the Microsofts of the world prefer to cut out the middle man and drive down their own margins. And even if that doesn't happen, if AI demand cools even slightly, CoreWeave could be left out to dry, given its reliance on high-interest debt. I would avoid CoreWeave stock.

Shonda explained that she had started a credit repair business after losing her brother in 2020 and struggling to return to traditional work. But the business never took off. “It’s still slow,” she said. When asked how much it currently earns, she replied, “$600 a month.”

Ramsey told her not to file for bankruptcy just yet. Instead, he advised her to stop paying on the credit cards for now and let them go bad, since many creditors will eventually settle for pennies on the dollar. “You could go through and settle these credit cards over the next five years and, you know, end up getting completely out of debt for $25,000 or $30,000,” he said.
He also encouraged her to stop focusing on quick wins and start building a steady career using her criminal justice degree. “If instead you had taken that same amount of energy and poured it into your career, you’d probably be making $100K right now,” Ramsey said.

As I'm writing this on Aug. 18, industry leader Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) gained 13.9% over the last three months, while Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) soared 81.3%. Despite the bullish market mood and several helpful developments in Polkadot's corner, the official cryptocurrency of the Web3 Foundation dropped 11.8% lower instead.
All that could change in a hurry. I would argue that Polkadot is deeply undervalued these days, and poised for strong returns in the long run. At the same time, leading crypto-trading platform Coinbase Global just released a market analysis that suggests traders will be swinging away from Bitcoin and into altcoins in the next quarter -- which would be good news for smaller names like Polkadot.
So there's some urgency to my Polkadot recommendation, but Coinbase's analysis is not the core of my thesis. I'm looking at why people use Polkadot, not chart squiggles and economic trends. Read on to see the three biggest reasons why I'm a Polkadot buyer in 2025.
1. Web3 infrastructure
The Web3 idea has been around since 2014, when Polkadot co-founder Gavin Wood coined the term. Web3 always had some dedicated fans, but the world at large never seemed ready to trade in centrally owned social networks for community-driven blockchain solutions.
Things are different in 2026.
The U.S. government is throwing heavy support behind the cryptocurrency industry, and people are getting more comfortable with decentralized blockchain networks. Popular examples include the Brave web browser, the Uniswap digital assets trading system, and the soccer game FIFA Rivals. All three apps rely on Polkadot in various ways.
I can't promise that Web3 applications will go mainstream very soon, but all the ingredients of that recipe are ready for a bake-off. Decentralized content and financial tools could gain mainstream traction any day now, and Polkadot will absolutely benefit when it happens. Owning a few Polkadot coins in 2025 sets you up to take advantage of the Web3 revolution in 2026 and beyond.
2. Boy, this thing is fast!
Polkadot connects to a plethora of other blockchain ledgers, transferring data between them in secure and easy-to-use channels. It stands to reason that this ledger must be fast in order to keep up with this multitude of connections.
And it is indeed very fast. A speed test in December 2024 reached 140,000 transactions per second (TPS). This event used only a portion of Polkadot's testing network, Kusama. Putting the entire production-grade Polkadot system to work could yield more than 620,000 TPS.
How fast is that? Well, Bitcoin handles less than 10 transactions per second, and Ethereum's maximum TPS is roughly 120. These large networks are widely rebuked for their slow performance, though. Avalanche is known for its snappy transaction performance, but its theoretical TPS ceiling stops just short of 1,200.
What about Solana, the speed king of modern blockchain networks? With a theoretical TPS of 65,000, this coin puts up a fight. Its max performance is comparable to credit card processor Visa, which sported a capacity of 65,000 TPS in 2017 and actually runs 10,000 transactions per second on a global scale. Polkadot is still about twice as fast as Solana, though.
This blistering top speed isn't terribly important right now, given the modest reach of Web3 applications and much lower real-world traffic on the Polkadot network. But what happens if and when Web3 concepts go mainstream, making potential Polkadot users out of every smartphone owner in the world?
Visa's transaction volume could look tiny next to that avalanche of decentralized data, and Polkadot must be ready to handle that sea change. And I think it's ready to hit the global limelight on short notice.
3. Polkadot 2.0
And here's the best part: Polkadot's performance may look impressive right now, but it's just the start of a far more ambitious long-term plan.
I won't bore you with technical jargon like elastic scaling, agile coretime, or the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM). What you need to know is that Polkadot's technical platform is getting a bunch of important upgrades right now. Some components are already up and running, and the rest are scheduled to go live before the end of the year.
They add up to a more powerful ecosystem known as Polkadot 2.0, with much higher TPS, a more flexible development environment, and simpler ways to pay for computing capacity on the Polkadot platform. If you were on the fence about owning Polkadot, this confident step forward might be the clincher.
By the end of 2025, Polkadot will be even better prepared to make an impact on the global stage with wider Web3 adoption. I think you'll be a happier investor with some Polkadot exposure under your belt in 2026.

What does Tesla’s presence on the S&P 500 mean for investors in 2025? Here’s what you need to know.
Tesla Is Number 9 on the S&P 500
As the name implies, there are 500 stocks on the S&P 500. Tesla is number nine on this list, which means it carries more weight on the index than 98% of the companies on the list, per Slickcharts.
Find Out: I Asked ChatGPT What the Stock Market Will Look Like in 100 Days — Here’s What It Said
Tesla Makes Up Nearly 2% of the Index
The S&P 500 is a weighted index, with the larger companies higher on the list and comprising a larger percentage of the overall metric. In the case of Tesla, its stock makes up 1.82% of the total S&P 500 index.
Tech Stocks Dominate
The top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, which make up 38% of the index, are nearly all tech or tech-adjacent stocks. They are Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, Alphabet (Class A), Alphabet (Class C), Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway.
This Can All Add Up to Volatility
The S&P 500 is a bellwether for the general market, so it is expected to have some volatility. But the heavy concentration of tech stocks could mean extra volatility, especially as tariffs take effect and companies are incented to move manufacturing to the U.S.
Tesla, for example, is up 68% in the past year but down 20% year to date, as of Aug. 7, 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. Its 52-week range is $192.04 to $488.54 — a very wide spread, particularly for a company of its size.
What Is the S&P 500?
The S&P500 consists of 500 of the largest U.S. stocks, weighted by market capitalization. This means that the largest companies are represented by a larger percentage than smaller companies. Nvidia is the largest company in the S&P 500 and represents 7.72% of the total index.
The S&P 500 is broadly used as an indicator for the stock market overall, and, by extension, the health of the U.S. economy. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average (commonly referred to as “the Dow” or even “the market”) is often what news outlets report on, that index consists of just 30 stocks. The S&P 500 represents more companies and therefore may be a better barometer for the health of the market.
The S&P 500 isn’t always the same 500 companies. Companies can be added and removed, based on decisions by the experts at the S&P Dow Jones Indices. These decisions are made four times a year.",03297ed9a2214a7b4346a8368aa6fc60,trafilatura

However, a balance-transfer credit card can help. Choosing one that allows you to enjoy a low introductory APR so you can redirect your hard-earned money toward paying down the balance instead of just the high interest is a great way to get your budget in check.

High-interest credit cards can send you down a debt spiral, which can impact your finances negatively for years. Considering the average credit card debt per borrower is also on the rise, according to TransUnion, this can feel like a no-win situation. As of last year, the average debt per borrower was about $6,329, so in 2025 there may be room for improvement.
If you’re tired of seeing a large portion of your credit card payments go toward interest, opening a balance-transfer card could be a smart money move. Here are some key signs it’s a good fit for your finances.
You’re Carrying Balances on Multiple Credit Cards
Having credit card debt can be tough, and it’s even more challenging when you’re carrying a balance on multiple cards. A balance-transfer card allows you to consolidate your debt so you have just one monthly payment.
This means you won’t have to juggle multiple due dates, making it easier to remember to pay your bill on time. Even better, consolidating your credit card payments into one could reduce the total amount of interest you’ll pay.
Consider These: 25 Creative Ways To Save Money
Your High-APR Credit Card Has a Significant Balance
If your current credit card has both a substantial outstanding balance and a high APR, much of your monthly payment goes toward interest. This can make it hard to pay off your debt. However, a balance transfer can help. Simply moving your balance to a credit card with a lower APR can help you pay down debt faster.
You’re Looking To Improve Your Credit Utilization
If your credit utilization isn’t great, a balance transfer may help. Your new balance-transfer credit card may offer a higher credit limit than your existing card(s), increasing your total available credit.
This matters because credit utilization plays a key role in both VantageScore and FICO credit scoring models. Plus, the lower interest rate on your balance-transfer card allows you to pay down the balance faster, boosting your available credit and improving your utilization ratio.

The company's half-year net profit after tax (NPAT) stood at $1.31bn, with an underlying NPAT of $1.24bn, a decrease from $1.63bn in the same period the previous year. Operating revenue experienced 10% year-on-year growth, reaching $6.59bn.
The board has announced a fully franked interim dividend of $0.53 per share, corresponding to a payout ratio of 80% of the underlying NPAT and an annualised yield of 6.9%.
Woodside Energy CEO Meg O’Neill said: “Strong underlying performance of our assets, our robust financial performance and a focus on disciplined capital management have enabled us to maintain our interim dividend payout ratio at the top end of the payout range.
“The outstanding performance of our high-quality assets over the first half has continued to support safe, reliable operations.

Trump Takes Second Swing at Cutting Housing Assistance for Immigrants
Analysts expect pensions to generate returns of 11% to 12% for the fiscal year that ended in June, driven by steep jumps in stock prices. These gains would be in spite of a dip that occurred in April, when the S&P 500 shed more than $5.4 trillion in two trading sessions after investors reacted to President Donald Trump’s tariff plans.
This year’s outperformance adds to the estimated pension returns of 16% to 17% in fiscal 2024. There is usually a one-year delay between the measurement of pensions to reporting, S&P said. Managers typically plan for returns of at least 7% to maintain funded ratios, according to the report.
The ratings firms also increased its discount rate guideline to 6.5% from 6% on expectations that the market rally will continue, powered by productivity-enhancing technologies such as artificial intelligence, as well as private equity returns.
“Should US public pension plans continue to exceed expectations, with technological growth persisting as new technologies mature, and the Fed’s rates stabilize, we could see market gains and improved funding for these plans,” analysts led by Todd Kanaster wrote.

-
As a CEO working under billionaire Warren Buffett, Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan admits that being a leader is 80% love and 20% frustration. Even though some days are rougher than others, he admits that the key to success is keeping a winning attitude—and it may be paying off as the billion-dollar brand has grown revenue by nearly 20% year-over-year. A focus on mindset is something other top leaders, the likes of Amazon’s Andy Jassy and Cisco’s Sarah Walker, agree is valuable.
AI may be coming for the C-suite, but Gen Z isn’t scared—they’re inspired. While some executives fret that the rise of AI could make CEOs obsolete, 38% of young workers say they’re more ready than ever to take the top job, nearly double the rate of Gen X, per McKinsey.
And while the job may come with a corner office and a cushy salary, the CEO of the shoe company Brooks Running, Dan Sheridan, has a message for aspiring Gen Z corporate leaders: the job isn’t so glamorous all the time.
“Brooks isn’t perfect—no organization is,” Sheridan told Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast last month. “We’ve got our warts and bruises and things like that…. 80% of the time I love what I’m doing.”
The CEO admits that for around 20% of the time, his job is filled with “things that drive you nuts and things you can’t solve.”
As a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the pressure for Sheridan to have his company succeed is high. The pressure is on and sometimes rough days make him want to give up. However, he says the most important thing he can do as a leader is keep a cool head, reevaluate, and move on.
“I just think as leaders, you have to be optimistic. You have to have a winning attitude,” Sheridan said.
“Otherwise, no one’s going to follow you. Your customers aren’t going to follow you. Your employees aren’t going to follow you, and your owners are probably going to scratch their head and say, what’s going on here?”
The power of a positive attitude
While Sheridan reveals that striking the right balance between optimism and realism is difficult, he says it’s mission-critical for leaders.
“One of the things that I think a lot about in my role is keeping my head above the clouds to see the future—but staying grounded enough in the dirt and the mud to know what’s going on,” he added.
He’s not the first to shout out about the importance of positivity: Other business leaders say it’s the very trait that can help aspiring executives stand out from the crowd.

(NASDAQ:ENPH) signed a new safe harbor agreement with a solar and battery financing company in early August, expected to bring in about $50 million in revenue. The deal strengthens Enphase's role in the third-party ownership (TPO) segment, which includes leases and power purchase agreements for homeowners.
The agreement covers U.S.-made IQ8HC microinverters and ensures eligibility for investment tax credits and domestic content bonuses under current rules. By locking in these incentives now, developers can safeguard projects from possible policy shifts.
Ken Fong, senior vice president and general manager for the Americas and APAC at Enphase, said safe harbor deals are vital to keeping solar projects viable despite changing policy. ""These agreements allow developers and financiers to move forward with confidence, safeguard project economics, and accelerate clean energy deployment,"" he said.

The announcement followed new guidance from the U.S. Treasury and IRS, which scrapped the long-standing ""5% safe harbor"" for large-scale projects. Developers of systems above 1.5 megawatts must now show measurable progress to qualify for credits, while smaller projects remain eligible under the old rules.
The clarification boosted solar stocks on Monday. First Solar Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) jumped more than 10%, while Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) and Nextracker Inc. (NASDAQ:NXT) also advanced.
The policy clarity provides momentum for renewable energy but also imposes tighter standards on large wind projects. Investors seeking sector exposure without single-stock volatility continue to turn to ETFs, which spread risk while capturing upside from clean energy growth.

In today’s high-rate environment, borrowers are looking to land the lowest possible home loan rate. While most choose fixed-rate mortgages, many consider adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) too, which typically offer lower interest rates for an initial period. These days, ARMs are the most popular they’ve been since 2022, accounting for about 10% of all mortgage applications, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Which is better for your situation: a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage?

What is an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)?
An adjustable-rate mortgage, just like it sounds, has a mortgage interest rate that adjusts — or fluctuates across its loan term.
Most ARMs today are known as “hybrid ARM” loans because they have a fixed interest rate for an initial amount of time, followed by adjustment periods — when the interest rate can go either up or down. The initial fixed rate on an ARM is typically lower than what you would pay with a fixed-rate loan.
Some common ARM terms lock in your rate for five, seven, or 10 years and then adjust it annually after the fixed period. Those are often called 5/1, 7/1, or 10/1 mortgages. Other ARM terms are available, such as a 7/6 ARM, which indicates you’d have a fixed rate for seven years and then the interest rate would adjust every six months.
Most ARMs include caps, or limits on how much your interest rate can increase or decrease during the adjustable period. Usually, there will be an initial cap on how much your mortgage can change at the first adjustment, a periodic cap that restricts how much your rate can change at each subsequent adjustment, and a lifetime cap that limits how much your interest rate can change during your entire loan term.
For example, if your rate during the introductory period is 6% and you have a 2/1/5 cap, your rate could only go as high as 8% or as low as 4% at the initial adjustment. Each subsequent adjustment could only change your rate by a maximum of 1%, and overall, your rate could only change by 5% over the loan's lifetime, so your maximum possible interest rate would be 11%.
The exact interest rate fluctuations an ARM will see depend on the margin the lender has assigned to the loan and the benchmark index rate the loan is tied to. These should be detailed in your loan documents.
For example, a benchmark could be an index such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), and your margin could be 2% — meaning your rate would be two percentage points above the SOFR rate.
Most ARMs are based on a 30-year loan term. Some mortgage lenders offer a 15-year ARM — it’s just rarer.
What is a fixed-rate mortgage?
A fixed-rate mortgage is less complicated than an ARM and, therefore, easier to fit into a financial plan. Unlike an ARM, a fixed-rate mortgage has the same interest rate for the life of the loan. That means your mortgage principal and interest payments stay the same until you either refinance your loan, sell the house, or pay the balance in full.
The most common fixed-rate mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, but some lenders offer 10- and 20-year loans or individualized loan terms.
A quick note: With both fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages, your monthly payment can change if your escrow costs (which cover property taxes and home insurance premiums) or your mortgage insurance costs change. This has nothing to do with what type of interest rate or loan you have, though.
Pros and cons of adjustable vs. fixed-rate mortgages
The biggest advantage of an ARM is that it offers a lower initial interest rate and monthly payment than a fixed-rate loan typically does. And if mortgage rates decline later, you could see your rate and payment fall.
On the downside, ARM rates and payments are uncertain, and you could find yourself with a higher rate and payment down the line. Because of this, ARMs can be hard to budget for and put you at a greater risk of foreclosure (because you might have trouble making payments).
Fixed-rate mortgage loans have the advantage of stable rates and payments, which makes long-term budgeting simpler. However, the disadvantage is that interest rates are higher for fixed-rate loans at the outset, and if mortgage rates decline, you would need to refinance the mortgage to take advantage of those lower rates.
Adjustable-rate mortgage terms to know
Before you can decide between a fixed- versus adjustable-rate mortgage loan, you’ll need to understand the terms of the ARM.
You should ask your lender to explain the specifics of any individual loan program you’re applying for, paying special attention to the following:
-
Loan terms. ARM terms are written with two numbers (for example, 5/1 or 7/6). The first number indicates how long the fixed-rate period lasts, and the second number represents how frequently the mortgage rate will change after that fixed period. For instance, a “1” translates to a rate change once per year, and a “6” means the rate shifts every six months. You will also need to ask whether the total loan term is for 15 or 30 years.
-
Index. The index is the benchmark for your interest rate, which can be the SOFR rate or another rate. This will determine the general trajectory of your future rate adjustments.
-
Margin. The margin is the percentage above the index, such as 1% or 2%. Your interest rate is calculated using the index, and then adding the margin.
-
Caps. Rate caps limit the amount your interest rate can increase or decrease initially, at each adjustment, and for the entire loan term. This last one is called the “ceiling,” which is the maximum rate the lender can charge at any time during the term.

How to choose a fixed- vs. adjustable-rate mortgage
While fixed-rate mortgages are the most popular option on the market, an increasing number of borrowers are choosing ARMs these days — likely because today’s rates are relatively high, and they believe rates will decrease in the future.
For the week ending Aug. 8, 2025, nearly 10% of all mortgage applicants were applying for an adjustable-rate loan. The average interest rate difference that week? Nearly a full percent. (The 30-year fixed-rate average was 6.67%. Rates averaged just 5.80% on 5/1 ARMs.)
To determine whether an ARM or fixed-rate mortgage is best for your situation, you’ll need to consider a few factors. First, think about how long you plan to stay in the home. An ARM may make sense if you are fairly certain you will pay off the loan or move before the initial fixed-rate period ends and you risk a rate increase.
An ARM could also work if you anticipate an increase in your budget, such as a promised promotion with a bigger salary or a spouse who plans to return to work soon, ensuring you have the funds to cover higher payments if interest rates rise later. Similarly, if you’re paying an expense now that will disappear, such as student loans, you may also feel more confident that you can afford possibly higher payments in a few years.
Finally, if you think interest rates are likely to decline in the future, an ARM can be an attractive option. In this case, it would offer lower rates now and potentially lower rates in the future. (Just make sure you’re financially prepared in case the opposite happens, and rates rise.)
Ultimately, a fixed-rate loan may be the better choice if you prefer a steady payment or plan to stay in your home for the long term. This also might be the best voice If you have unpredictable income, because predictable monthly mortgage payments can help you budget and plan ahead, regardless of what’s happening in the broader market.

How to qualify for a fixed-rate mortgage vs. an ARM
While the loan terms differ for an adjustable-rate mortgage versus a fixed-rate mortgage, the qualification process is similar. Your lender will review your credit score, income, assets, and debt-to-income ratio, which compares the minimum monthly payment on all debt with your gross (pre-tax) monthly income.
Lenders are often stricter on debt-to-income ratios for ARMs, as they come with higher risks of non-payment.
Most ARMs require a down payment of 5%, though some may allow as little as 3% down. Remember that the higher your down payment, the better your interest rate will typically be.

Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgage FAQs
Is it ever a good idea to choose an adjustable-rate mortgage vs. fixed?
An ARM could be a good choice if you plan to pay off your mortgage or sell your home before the mortgage rate resets. Also, if you can easily afford your mortgage payment with a higher rate in the future, it may be worth the risk of higher rates later to pay a lower rate now.
Why do borrowers choose an ARM instead of a fixed-rate loan when interest rates are high?
When interest rates are low, borrowers tend to want to lock in their rate for the long-term benefit. When interest rates are high, borrowers try to find a way to pay a lower rate. ARM rates are usually lower than fixed rates during the first few years of the loan.
What is the main downside of an adjustable-rate mortgage vs. a fixed-rate mortgage?
The main disadvantage of an ARM is the risk that interest rates can rise, increasing your mortgage payment. This can make payments hard to predict and budget for, and it puts you at a higher risk of foreclosure down the line.
Can you refinance an ARM into a fixed-rate mortgage?
Yes, you can refinance an ARM into either a fixed-rate mortgage or a new ARM. You might want to do this when your initial fixed-rate period is almost up or if you want to remove private mortgage insurance (PMI), for example.
Do you need 20% down for an ARM?
No, you do not need a 20% down payment for an adjustable-rate mortgage. Conventional ARMs typically require just 5% down. Some lenders may offer ARMs with down payments as low as 3%.

First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ:FSLR) rallied alongside its counterparts after the Treasury Department on Friday announced updated rules on solar and wind tax credits that now require companies to have kicked off physical construction before July 5, 2026, to qualify for tax incentives.

“This test focuses on the nature of the work performed, not the amount or the cost,” said the guidance. “Provided that physical work performed is of a significant nature, there is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required to satisfy the Physical Work Test.”
The tax credits, which form part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will phase out clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2027, but provide an exception for projects that commenced by July 5, 2026, a year after the bill was signed into law.

(Reuters) -The S&P 500 benchmark U.S. stock index will end 2025 just below current near-record levels, reflecting tempered optimism amid ongoing concerns over the economic impact of President Donald Trump's global tariffs and uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve rate cuts, according to a new Reuters poll.
Market strategists polled by Reuters showed that concerns about potential stagnation related to tariffs have dampened optimism about Wall Street's rally in AI heavyweights.
""I do not anticipate the United States entering a recession; however, I do expect the economy to experience a slowdown,"" said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth. ""Many employers lack visibility into future conditions and are therefore delaying expansion.""
The S&P 500 will end 2025 at 6,300 points, equivalent to a 2.3% dip from current levels, according to the median estimate of 35 strategists, analysts and portfolio managers polled August 7-19.
The S&P 500 ended Monday at 6,449.15 points, down 0.3% from its record high close on August 14.
Top of mind for U.S. investors, the Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates at its September policy meeting to support economic growth, possibly followed by another reduction by December.
Some 70% of global investors surveyed by BofA Global Research in early August said they expect stagflation - the combination of below trend growth and above trend inflation - in the next 12 months.
The S&P 500 has climbed 9% so far in 2025.
Strategists' estimates have increased since a Reuters stock poll in May, when they expected the S&P 500 to end 2025 at 5,900. But this week's poll forecast is still down from a Reuters poll in February, when they targeted the S&P 500 to end the year at 6,500.
While strategists struggle to predict the stock market, the latest Reuters poll offers a valuable glimpse of Wall Street's cautious sentiment following recent record gains.
A series of deals with major U.S. trading partners, along with extensions of the White House's self-imposed deadlines, has left investors less jittery about Trump's on-again off-again global trade war than they were when his April tariff announcements sent global markets into a slump.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have climbed to record highs in 2025 in large part due to gains in Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and other AI heavyweights. At the same time, S&P 500 sector indexes including healthcare, consumer discretionary, energy and real estate are nearly unchanged for the year.",cc6220bf6817d98a46c7b6f8cb0c79cd,trafilatura

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India's government plans to ban online games played with money, a proposed bill showed on Tuesday, in what would be a heavy blow for an industry that has attracted billions of dollars of foreign investment.
Citing psychological and financial harm it says can be caused by such games, the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill 2025 says that no person ""shall offer, aid, abet, induce or otherwise indulge or engage in"" the offering of online money games and such services.
The 13-page bill, which has not yet been made public but has been reviewed by Reuters, describes an online money game as one played by a user by depositing money in expectation of winning monetary and other enrichment.
The Indian market for such gaming is set to be worth $3.6 billion by 2029, venture capital firm Lumikai says.
Endorsements by top Indian cricketers and other marketing efforts have boosted appeal and investor interest of real money gaming apps such as the popular fantasy cricket games operated by startups Dream11 and Mobile Premier League.
Dream11 commands a valuation of $8 billion while Mobile Premier League is valued at $2.5 billion, PitchBook data shows.
The Indian government has long been concerned about how such games are addictive.
India's IT ministry, which has drafted the bill, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. MPL and Dream11 declined to comment.
In fantasy cricket games on Dream11, users create their teams by paying as little as 8 rupees (10 U.S. cents), with a total prize pool of 1.2 million Indian rupees ($14,000). The apps become more popular during the Indian Premier League season, one of the world's most popular cricket tournaments.
The bill states that anyone who offers such money games could face a jail term of up to three years and a fine.
""Such games often use manipulative design features, addictive algorithms ... while promoting compulsive behaviour leading to financial ruin,"" the bill said.

Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) is one of Monday’s top performers.
Riot Platforms bounced back from the previous day’s losses, adding 8.74 percent to close Monday’s trading at $12.32 apiece, as investors continued to place bets on companies benefitting from the booming digital asset industry.
This followed President Donald Trump’s newly issued executive order last week that could attract more investments in cryptocurrencies and related firms, having allowed the retirement plan 401(k) to invest in digital assets.
Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT), a Bitcoin miner, could largely benefit from the new order on expectations of stronger investor interest, with fund managers now able to tap into alternative investment assets outside the typical stocks and bonds.
Additionally, analysts have already expected the new order to lift many boats in the crypto ecosystem.
In recent news, Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) was able to mine 484 Bitcoins last month, marking an 8 percent increase from 450 Bitcoins in June, and a 31 percent growth year-on-year.

“Yesterday just before the close, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was discussing taking a stake in Intel . The article suggested the plans stemmed from Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s meeting with Trump earlier this week , with funding supposedly to help shore up Intel’s Ohio efforts (currently paused). Bloomberg also indicated that no decisions have been made yet, and that talks could end with no agreement. Both Intel and the administration have at this point supposedly declined comment. Overall though the hope trade on Intel is probably back (for now) as investors wait to see if Trump can Make Intel Great Again (though there is, as always, huge uncertainty around anything this administration does, and we are still not hugely tempted to get involved…).

Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) is one of Monday’s top performers.
Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN) grew its share prices by 11.35 percent on Monday to finish at $15.50 apiece as investors welcomed new tax credit rules for solar and wind energy projects that were less restrictive than investors feared.
Instead of spending at least 5 percent of the project cost, updated guidelines issued by the US government last week said that companies must show that they have kicked off physical project construction before July 5, 2026, to qualify for tax credits.
“This test focuses on the nature of the work performed, not the amount or the cost,” said the guidance. “Provided that physical work performed is of a significant nature, there is no fixed minimum amount of work or monetary or percentage threshold required to satisfy the Physical Work Test.”
Previously, developers had to prove that they were able to spend 5 percent or more of the total cost to qualify for the credits.
The tax credits, which form part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will phase out clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2027, but provide an exception for projects that commenced by July 5, 2026, a year after the bill was signed into law.

They’re even turning to credit to pay for essentials. A recent LendingTree survey found that one-quarter (25%) of buy-now-pay-later users have used these loans to buy groceries.
But some states are struggling more than others. Florida is now one of the most financially stressed states in the country, second only to another Southern state, according to a new report by WalletHub, which defines financial distress as having credit in forbearance or deferring payments due to financial difficulty.
“When you combine data about people delaying payments with other metrics like bankruptcy filings and credit score changes, it paints a good picture of the overall economic trends of a state,” WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo said about the findings.
Here are the five states struggling the most and why people there are having such a tough time.
The top 5 financially distressed states
Texas is the most financially distressed state in the country, followed by Florida, Louisiana, Nevada and South Carolina. The states that are best off? That honor goes to Hawaii, followed by Vermont, Alaska, Oregon and New Mexico.
To determine their ranking, WalletHub compared all 50 states across nine key metrics in six categories, calculating an overall score by weighting the average across all metrics. For example, the ‘credit score’ category is determined by two key metrics: the average credit score as of March earned double weight, while the change in credit score from March 2024 to March 2025 earned full weight.
Once all the numbers were crunched, Texas came out on top — and, in this case, No. 1 means the most distressed or worst off — even though the state has a larger GDP than most countries (ranking ninth on the world stage). And it still has one of the top 10 economies in the U.S.
Texans search Google for ‘debt’ and ‘loans’ at a high rate, “which shows that many people are desperate to borrow, despite already owing money,” says the WalletHub report. They also ranked sixth in the change in number of bankruptcy filings from March 2024 to March 2025, with non-business bankruptcy filings increasing more than 22% in the past year.
Overall, Florida was the second-most financially distressed state in the country, ranking No. 1 in the share of people with accounts in financial distress and No. 2 in the average number of accounts per person that were in distress. Florida had the ninth-worst credit score ranking in the country; one previous WalletHub study found that Floridians have the second-highest credit delinquency rate nationally.
Following in third place was Louisiana, which ranked above Florida for the average number of accounts in distress — taking the No. 1 spot — and above Texas in the ‘loans’ search index ranking (at No. 2). “Around 11.8% of Louisianians also have a credit account in forbearance or with deferred payments, the highest share in the country,” according to WalletHub.
Nevada, coming in at No. 4 overall, had the third-worst credit score ranking in the country (the top spot went to Montana), while South Carolina, at No. 5 overall, ranked highly in the number of people with accounts in financial distress and average number of accounts in distress.
As for the least financially distressed states? Hawaii was the winner here, even though the state had the fourth-worst credit score ranking. But it performed well in all other categories and, unlike Texas, it was the state with the fewest number of people searching Google for ‘debt’ and ‘loans.’

What to do if you’re financially underwater
While states like Texas and Florida may be struggling the most, all states are struggling to some degree. Of the five states that were deemed to be the least financially distressed in the WalletHub study, three of them (Hawaii, Vermont and New Mexico) didn’t fare well on their credit score ranking.
Indeed, the bottom 60% of U.S. households (by income) fall short of the threshold for a minimal quality of life, according to a Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) analysis. (The analysis takes into account essentials, like food and shelter, as well as basic leisure costs, such as streaming subscriptions.)
It points to the fact that wages haven’t kept up with rising costs — for example, medical premiums skyrocketed 301% from 2001 to 2023 and rent jumped by 131%.
If you’re struggling to make ends meet, start by making a budget so you’ll have a clear idea of how you’re spending your money (and where you can cut back).
If you’re behind on paying your bills, be proactive. “Do it before a debt collector gets involved. Tell your creditors what’s going on, and try to work out a new payment plan with lower payments you can manage,” according to the Federal Trade Commission consumer advice.
The same goes for mortgage payments. If you’re struggling, contact your lender before they foreclose on your home. If you’re acting in good faith, your lender may temporarily lower or defer your payments or work with you to extend your repayment period (meaning lower overall payments).
When it comes to credit card debt, you’ll want to make at least the minimum payments each month so your credit score doesn’t take a hit. But since interest rates are so high — averaging around 24% these days — you’ll want to focus on paying this down as soon as possible, along with any other high-interest debts. You can do this through debt-reducing strategies such as the snowball or avalanche methods.
You may also want to seek out additional sources of income, whether that’s taking on a side gig, upskilling or reskilling for a higher-paying role or new job, or looking for passive income such as renting out a room in your home.
Digging yourself out of debt isn’t easy, but there are resources that can help, including low-fee credit counseling services. For housing challenges, you can contact a free, HUD-certified counselor for advice via your local U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development office.",5a7907a3a975c24d610d3e8c089d7fc4,trafilatura

Fish noted how Cisco’s quarterly results were roughly in-line, and that FY26 guide came in below what bulls were hoping for. This is raising questions about “peak growth x peak multiple” being already seen, with second half of 2026 guide implying less than 5%.

However, the firm believes that the narrative for Cisco remains unscathed owing to artificial intelligence.
“However, the narrative here remains unscathed, as Cisco will see the ~$1B AI orders in F2H25 flow into FY26 revenue, further AI-infrastructure spend (including across customer-bases), campus refresh, datacenter refresh & modernization, growing Enterprise & Neoclouds traction, and Splunk cross-sell and cost-synergies. FY26 guide looks about how we anticipated and realistic, particularly for an incoming CFO. The debate from here will be sustainability, and while we remain optimistic around the narrative across multiple fronts, even an upside numbers scenario is already embedded in the stock at these levels.

-
Palantir is getting hit with a big valuation pullback today, and its stock ranks as one of the S&P 500's worst daily performers.
-
Signs of a potential resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war and improving relations between U.S. and China seem to be weighing on the stock.
-
Macroeconomic risk factors may also be causing investors to sell Palantir stock after incredible gains this year.
Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR) stock is under pressure and getting hit with substantial sell-offs in Tuesday's trading. The artificial intelligence (AI) leader's share price was down 5.6% as of noon ET. At the same point in the day's trading, the S&P 500 was down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1%.
While there do not appear to be any immediate, business-specific developments weighing on the company's stock today, there are geopolitical and macroeconomic dynamics that could be factoring into the valuation pullback. Investors taking profits on the heels of an incredible rally this year is likely also a factor in today's sell-off. Even with a significant pullback today, the stock is still up 117% year to date.
Palantir stock sinks amid geopolitical developments
Palantir has seen incredible valuation gains as investors have flocked to AI companies with exposure to the defense industry. Developments that suggest stabilization or relational improvements along geopolitical lines can sometimes cause pullbacks for the company's share price.
President Donald Trump recently made comments expressing optimism about a resolution to the war between Russia and Ukraine. President Trump has recently been pushing for a meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and President Zelenskyy is reportedly open to such a meeting.
Additionally, a report published by Bloomberg announced that Chinese exports of rare-earth minerals have returned to their highest levels since January. Tensions between the U.S. and China have played a significant role in Palantir's valuation run-up this year, and signs of improving relations could continue to dent Palantir's heavily growth-dependent valuation.
Macroeconomic dynamics are likely also a factor
Trading at roughly 253 times this year's expected earnings and 90 times expected sales, Palantir has one of the most growth-dependent valuations of any well-established company on the market. As a result, the company is at risk of seeing big sell-offs in the face of indications that macroeconomic conditions could be weakening.",c80de9d277f56562c13ad0886fc9617d,trafilatura

The competitive landscape is heating up, with each company pursuing distinct strategies to gain an edge. Arm is shifting its focus toward in-house chipmaking, Nvidia is developing new chips to maintain its grip on the crucial Chinese market, and Intel has secured a significant investment, attracting interest from the U.S. government.
Market Analysis on AMD’s Prospects
In the midst of these high-stakes industry developments, financial analysts offered a mixed but generally constructive outlook on AMD’s performance.
Also Read: AMD Acquires Another Company To Expand AI Arsenal
Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider acknowledged AMD’s strength in data center GPUs but warned of potential scaling challenges and high investor expectations that could limit its upside. Schneider projected AMD’s data center GPU revenue to reach $10–11 billion by 2026.
Meanwhile, KeyBanc analyst John Vinh highlighted the successful ramp of the MI355 and increasing demand in the premium desktop and commercial sectors.
Wedbush’s Matt Bryson noted that while the China market remains uncertain, AMD’s momentum in the client and server segments could offset weaker GPU results, with a potential for further upside if China sales eventually resume.
Benchmark analyst Cody Acree underscored the company’s market share gains in data center and client markets, the ongoing ramp of new AI GPUs, and an expected double-digit growth in the third quarter.
Overall, analysts believe AMD is entering the second half of the year with strong growth drivers, though they disagree on whether the current market expectations leave room for substantial upside.
Stock Performance and Outlook
AMD’s stock has surged 42% year-to-date, outperforming both Nvidia’s 35% and Intel’s gain of over 30%. Despite this strong performance, analysts maintain mixed but largely constructive views on the company’s recent results, citing robust data center momentum while tempering expectations due to high valuation.
Competitive Landscape Evolves
In a bold strategic shift, Arm Holdings has moved beyond its traditional licensing model by hiring Rami Sinno, Amazon’s former AI chip director, to lead its in-house chip development.
The company plans to reinvest profits into building complete chips and chiplets to expand its footprint in the smartphone and data center markets, directly challenging rivals like Nvidia, AMD, and Intel.",4ef7285f7e6c520f8d0119f77b2394dc,trafilatura

Just look at natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) specialist Oneok (OKE). Despite delivering solid financial results and enjoying political relevance, Oneok can’t quite get it together in the equities arena. Still, the ugliness in the charts for OKE stock could spell opportunity for intrepid speculators.
Earlier this month, the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based energy company posted second-quarter net income of $841 million, per Barchart content partner AP. On a per-share basis, Oneok delivered earnings of $1.34, matching the consensus estimate by Wall Street analysts. Further, the natural gas specialist generated revenue of $7.89 billion in the period.
Despite the solid results, OKE stock has struggled. Since the disclosure, shares are down 8.5%. Plus, it’s difficult to ignore that visually, the fallout is unsightly. Since the beginning of the year, OKE has declined by more than 27%.
Not surprisingly, OKE stock represented one of the highlights in Barchart’s Unusual Stock Options Volume screener. This data interface showcases the top 500 securities that have generated aberrant transactions relative to prior norms in the derivatives market. Theoretically, the screener can tip off retail investors as to where the smart money may be positioning its funds.
On Monday, total options volume for OKE stock reached 4,924 contracts, representing a 54.89% lift over the trailing one-month average. Interestingly, call volume stood at 4,197 contracts, leaving the put side at only 727 contracts. On paper, this would seem bullish as it implies more traders buying calls than puts.
However, options can be debit or credit based, imposing complexities. A closer look at options flow — which focuses exclusively on big block transactions — showed net trade sentiment slightly favoring the bears. However, last Friday, this metric stood at $136,700 above parity, overwhelmingly favoring the bullish side.
While it’s difficult to make wholesale assumptions, it appears that professional investors don’t anticipate OKE stock falling below the $75 strike price by the Sep. 19 expiration date.
Using Path Dependency to Estimate Where OKE Stock May End Up
While analyzing unusual options activity can be helpful, it’s not the full story. To be quite honest, I’m not sure if there are empirical studies linking the insights of unusual options with predictive power — and that’s probably because such studies are inherently multidimensional. To get a clearer picture of the unknown future, traders may rely on one of two frameworks.
Primarily, the most common approach is known as volatility dependency. By using derivations of the Black-Scholes formula, retail traders rely on implied volatility (IV) to narrow down their range of possibilities for their target security. Essentially, a higher IV ratings lead to wider bands in projections such as the Expected Move calculator, while lower IV ratings lead to narrower bands.
However, one of the biggest concerns that I have about Black-Scholes-derived or influenced metrics is that the formula doesn’t account for how markets actually behave. For example, returns are assumed to be log-normal distributions rather than fat-tailed, skewed and clustered around pockets of volatility. There’s also the obvious vulnerability that it doesn’t account for American-style options, which allow for position exiting prior to expiration.
While I might get skewered for saying this, I believe a better approach is path dependency. Much more common in Slavic countries, path dependency builds forecasts off actual pricing dynamics against like-like conditions. In other words, the math involved in this approach is descriptive rather than prescriptive.
However, the tricky part of path-dependent models is that the input and output variables require epistemological continuity. As such, I convert price action into a binary code of accumulative and distributive sessions. With this approach, all stocks now speak the same language — facilitating cross-sector analysis.
For OKE stock, the takeaway is that in the past 10 weeks, the market voted to buy the security four times and sell six times. During this period, OKE incurred a downward trajectory. For brevity, we can label this sequence as 4-6-D.
Notably, in 68% of cases (going back to January 2019), the following week’s price action results in upside, with a median return of 2.32%. That’s above the baseline probability of 57.23% or the chance that a long position will be profitable on any given week.
Adding to the intrigue, if we were to include the current week’s session into the equation, OKE stock would be charting a 3-7-D sequence. This rare signal has an even greater next-week upside probability of 77.8%.
Intriguing Strategies to Consider
Based on how the next 10 weeks could play out as implied by the flashing of the 3-7-D sequence (which is very similar to the scenario forecasted by the 4-6-D sequence), the most conservative debit-based multi-leg options strategy may be the 70/75 bull call spread expiring Sep. 19. This trade requires OKE stock to hit the $75 short strike price at expiration, which appears to be more than doable (assuming that you believe my forecast).
However, the payout — for a net debit of $325 — is just under 54%. That’s not particularly enticing.
A much more tempting trade is the 75/80 bull call spread expiring Oct. 17. The $80 short strike price is projected in my model to be lower than either the positive or negative pathways. Of course, you would have to assume that my projections are more accurate than volatility-dependent calculations. With a payout of over 170%, it’s going to tempt some folks.
Now, the real [insert Samuel L. Jackson’s favorite word here] is the 75/80 bull spread expiring Sep. 19. My model shows that it’s on the edge of possibility. If you’re a believer, you need to put down $130 for the chance to gain a profit of $370. That’s a payout of almost 285%.
Yeah, there’s a lot to think about when you shift paradigms to path dependency.

Home Depot stock is rising despite the company posting a slight earnings miss with its Q2 report this morning.
-
Revenue rose 4.8% in the second quarter and was in line with Wall Street's forecast.
-
Home Depot announced that it will be raising prices on some items to help offset the impact of tariffs.
Home Depot (NYSE: HD) stock is rising Tuesday following the company's recent earnings report. The home improvement retailer's share price was up 3.2% as of 12:15 p.m. ET and had been up as much as 5% earlier in the session. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was down 0.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite had fallen 1.1%.
Home Depot reported its second-quarter results before the market opened this morning and actually delivered earnings that fell short of the market's expectations. Despite the bottom-line miss, management issued commentary and forward guidance that has investors feeling bullish coming out of the report.
A Q2 earnings miss isn't keeping Home Depot stock down
Home Depot reported non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $4.68 on sales of $45.28 billion in the second quarter. While sales for the period were in line with Wall Street's expectations, earnings per share fell $0.01 short of the average analyst target. The company's revenue increased 4.8% compared to the prior-year period, with total same-store sales up 1% and same-store sales in the U.S. up 1.8%. While the retailer's profit came in slightly weaker than expected, management's guidance suggested a better outlook on margins than some investors had anticipated.
What's next for Home Depot?
With its Q2 report, Home Depot reiterated its guidance for annual sales growth of roughly 2.8%. The target actually fell short of the average analyst estimate's call for sales growth of roughly 3%, but investors seem to be betting that the retailer is being somewhat conservative with its targeting on the heels of solid growth last quarter.
More importantly, management confirmed that it plans to raise prices on some of its goods in order to offset the margin impacts created by new tariffs. Home Depot's guidance along those lines may be playing a significant role in the pullback for the broader market today, with its stated plans to raise prices potentially affirming fears that higher-than-expected inflation seen by wholesalers and producers will start filtering through to the consumer economy. Management's price-raising plans highlight macroeconomic risk factors facing the broader market, but they also suggest a better outlook for the retailer's margins.",1a7ba3aaaee12de1b879b0a94da72b29,trafilatura

The executive chair at Strategy, the company formerly known as MicroStrategy, has loosened its long-held rules on when it will dilute shareholders to buy more Bitcoin.
This week, a new “equity guidance” slide showed the firm will issue stock at far lower market-to-net asset value multiples — or mNAV — than previously promised.
Not even a month ago, Strategy pledged it wouldn’t issue shares under 2.5x mNAV.
mNAV compares a company’s market capitalisation to the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Above 1 means investors are paying a premium. Below 1 means the market values the stock at less than the coins it owns.
Strategy’s aim with the change is to “provide greater flexibility in executing our capital markets strategy,” Saylor said on X on Monday.
Michael Saylor’s scheme
Saylor’s Bitcoin treasury approach is to raise capital to buy more Bitcoin by issuing new shares.
The company’s Bitcoin holdings are worth about $75 billion, making it the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world.
Additionally, Strategy currently trades at about 1.4x mNAV, according to Bitcoin Treasuries — well below its previous 2.5x floor.
Crypto treasury companies have become the big trend of the current cycle. The sector has ballooned into a $112 billion market, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.
It all began in 2020, when Strategy started to build up its Bitcoin treasury back, but lately other players have joined. Those include US President Donald Trump’s media conglomerate, the gaming retailer GameStop, and video streaming platform Rumble.
New rules
Under the old rules, Strategy would have been locked out of issuing stock to fund new Bitcoin buys.
Under the new ones, however, management has much more freedom to tap equity markets at thinner premiums.
For instance, the firm will “actively” issue shares if its mNAV tops 4x, do so “opportunistically” between 2.5x and 4x, and may still issue below that threshold to cover debt, dividends, or “when otherwise deemed advantageous.”
Strategy could even issue credit to repurchase shares if the stock slips below 1x under the new rules.
‘Spiral of doom’
If Strategy is forced to sell shares at thinner and thinner premiums just to service debt, it risks triggering what former Goldman Sachs analyst Dom Kwok called a spiral of doom.
That means dilution eats into shareholder value, shares sink lower, interest payments mount, and the firm could even be forced to sell its vaunted Bitcoin stash to stay afloat, according to Kwok.
The stakes are high because mNAV is the core pitch for the entire crypto treasury sector. In practice, however, many firms are struggling. Of the 167 listed crypto treasury companies, 13%, or about 21 firms, already trade below an mNAV of 1, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.",dc474f878a6a87bdca227d9e262b42ab,trafilatura

The company is positioned to benefit from a historic surge in small, low-cost drones as Washington prioritizes domestic production and accelerates spending on next-generation military platforms.
Needham analyst Austin Bohlig initiated coverage on Unusual Machines with a Buy rating and $15 price forecast, citing its strong positioning as a U.S.-based supplier of NDAA-compliant drone components.

He projected revenue to climb from $10 million in 2025 to $25 million in 2026, as defense contracts ramp and reshoring efforts accelerate demand for small, low-cost unmanned systems.
The analyst called the drone component maker one of the best-positioned domestic suppliers to benefit from the U.S. shift away from Chinese parts.
He argued that the U.S. is entering a historic supercycle for small, low-cost unmanned aerial systems (UAS), fueled by geopolitical conflicts that showcased the strategic importance of First Person View (FPV) ISR and one-way attack drones.
With the reshoring of critical drone components now a national priority, Bohlig sees UMAC poised to capture a meaningful share in the roughly $620 million U.S. component market by 2026.
Bohlig highlighted that recent conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East demonstrated how inexpensive, attributable drones can reshape modern warfare.
In contrast, the U.S. procured only a fraction of the volume deployed abroad, leaving a clear capability gap. The Trump administration has placed unmanned systems at the center of defense strategy, with the fiscal 2026 defense budget and “One Big Beautiful Bill” allocating more than $15 billion to unmanned platforms, including an estimated $2 billion for small UAS.
Bohlig sees the Purpose-Built Attritable Systems (PBAS) program, valued at over $500 million, as the most significant near-term catalyst. With 12 firms bidding and more than half using UMAC’s components, he argued the company is uniquely positioned to benefit.
Financially, Bohlig projects 2025 revenue to grow 79% year-over-year to $10 million, driven by early defense demand and increasing consumer adoption of NDAA-compliant drone components.
He expects a sharper ramp beginning in 2026 as contracts materialize, forecasting 149% growth to $25 million, with enterprise sales rising 255% to $11 million.",69c478d01e41fb866a666c005c389e51,trafilatura

The $3 billion project aims to enhance work efficiency and employee satisfaction.

CEO Jamie Dimon has called the bank's workers back to the office five days a week.
JPMorgan has always been big on tech — an initiative on full display at its new Manhattan headquarters.
America's biggest bank by assets has been promising that its new office tower at 270 Park Avenue will be loaded with ""intelligent technology"" since it announced the project in 2022. New details of the $3 billion project obtained by Business Insider reveal just how tech-forward the building will be.
The 14,000 employees who will be housed at the New York tower will be able to activate coffee machines using QR codes and swipe into the building using biometric palm scanners. Want to preorder food from the dining hall, host a guest, or find a specific conference room? There's an app for that, which JPMorgan is asking employees to download to ""boost your work efficiency.""
The details, gleaned from internal communications shared with Business Insider, offer a glimpse of what it's like to work at the bank behemoth, which earlier this year called back all of its more than 300,000 employees to the office five days a week. JPMorgan has also been spending billions on tech at the direction of CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been seeking to protect the bank from payment apps and other financial startups.
""We have to compete with the best in AI and technology,"" Jamie Dimon said at the bank's 2024 Investor Day.
With some employees' move-in set to start this year and continue into 2026, here's the lowdown on how the bank plans to use tech to keep workers happy and efficient as it calls them back to the office five days a week.
Biometric scanners
Even the way you enter the building will be leveled up using tech. One option to get past the turnstiles — besides your physical or mobile JPM badge — is ""biometric authentication,"" which employees can already enroll in, according to employee communications shared on an internal bank portal.
The bank showed a photo of a scanner that reads your palm. It said the biometric authentication will allow employees to ""breeze from the lobby"" to other parts of the building ""by waving your hand!""
It touted how easy it will be to get where you want to go.
""After passing through the turnstiles, you can take an elevator to The Exchange on 14. From there, you can go up to your floor or take the escalator down to 13 for a bite to eat,"" the bank said, adding, ""If you're a trader, you can take an elevator directly to the trading floors from the lobby.""",744536bea030186f6fa3c42d95a2c8e8,trafilatura

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a big jump in revenues from sweeping tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, and said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt, not to give rebate checks to Americans.
Bessent, speaking in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" said he expected to substantially revise upward his earlier estimate of $300 billion in revenues from the tariffs, but declined to be more specific.
Bessent said he had not spoken with Trump about the idea of using funds from the tariffs to create a dividend for Americans, but stressed that both of them were ""laser-focused"" on paying down the debt.
""I've been saying that tariff revenue could be $300 billion this year. I'm going to have to revise that up substantially,"" Bessent said. ""We're going to bring down the deficit to GDP. We'll start paying down the debt, and then at that point that can be used as an offset to the American people.""
The U.S. economy could return to the ""good, low-inflationary growth"" of the 1990s, Bessent said, but he blamed higher interest rates for problems plaguing some pockets of the economy, singling out housing and lower-income households with high credit card debt.
A cut in the Federal Reserve's key interest rate - which Trump has continually pressed for - could help facilitate a boom or pickup in home building, which would help keep prices down in one to two years, he said.
The U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday reported a small increase in groundbreaking for single-family homes and permits for future construction in July, even as high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty continued to hamper home purchases.
Trump's wide-ranging import tariffs have kept the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates this year, with most central bank policymakers wary of easing borrowing costs until they have more confidence the levies will not rekindle inflation, which has yet to return to the Fed's 2% target.
Recent indications of softening in the job market, however, have largely convinced investors that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point when it meets in mid-September. That expectation has helped bring down mortgage rates in recent weeks.
Bessent has previously said a 50-basis-point cut in rates was warranted.

But Powell's outline of two bigger questions facing the Fed will shape the future of the central bank in ways that will outlast his tenure and mark a key part of his legacy as chair.
Powell's widely anticipated speech on Friday morning will be delivered as the debate over the state of the economy and the possibility of rate cuts heats up.
In interviews with Yahoo Finance on Thursday, Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid and Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack both offered some caution on the need for interest rate cuts as soon as next month, given recent inflation data.
""There's a lot of data we're going to get between now and September, and I walk into every meeting with an open mind about what the right thing to do is,"" Hammack said. ""But with the data I have right now, and with the information I have, if the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates.""
Schmid and Hammack's colleagues at the Federal Reserve Board, Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller, have been among those more vocal about the need for rate cuts. Investors were assigning roughly 69% odds on a 0.25% cut from the Fed on Sept. 17 as of early Friday.
Disagreement over the Fed's next move, however, is only a small part of the backdrop against which Powell is set to speak.
Most notable is pressure from President Trump, who this week called for Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign amid a controversy over two mortgage loans. The Financial Times reported Thursday that the Department of Justice sent Powell a letter calling on the Fed chair to remove Cook from her post.
Trump, who refers to Powell as ""Too Late"" for not cutting rates earlier this year, has regularly commented on Fed policy and said interest rates should be much lower than the current benchmark range of 4.25%-4.50%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also weighed in on monetary policy, saying in an interview earlier this month that the Fed ought to consider cutting rates by 0.50% in September.
""I think that having an independent central bank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well,"" Powell said last month. ""And as long as it serves the public well, it should continue and be respected.""
Powell is also expected to lay out changes to the central bank’s policy framework review, which articulates the Fed’s strategy and commitment to fulfilling its congressional mandate for stable prices and maximum employment.
In particular, the central bank is expected to drop so-called average inflation targeting, a policy put in place pre-pandemic when inflation was running low and Fed officials wanted to avoid deflation.
This strategy has said that if inflation ran below 2% in years past, the Fed would tolerate it running above 2% in the future on the theory that it averages out. Given the recent bout of inflation and the risks it poses to the economy, the Fed is expected to drop that and focus on an inflation target of simply 2%.
Powell signaled the change in a speech in May.
“In our discussions so far, participants have indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the language around shortfalls,” Powell said. “And at our meeting last week, we had a similar take on average inflation targeting.”
The Fed first created its monetary policy framework in 2012, which it adjusts every five years. And just as the changes announced back in 2020 had implications for monetary policy actions over the past five years — the Fed's language shift, it could be argued, kept the lid on rate hikes even as inflation accelerated in 2021 — so too could the changes Powell announces Friday send ripples for years to come.
“While the adoption of the new framework in 2020 was not the primary factor behind the Fed’s delay and the substantial inflation overshoot, it contributed to this outcome,” said Matt Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank
As a result, Luzzetti expects Powell’s speech to restore a more preemptive strategy for monetary policy, along with recognizing risks of supply shocks and a return to a balanced view of inflation and the job market.
James Fishback, CEO of hedge fund Azoria, argued Powell needs to acknowledge what he calls the “tragic mistake” of average inflation targeting.
Powell noted in his May speech that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the 2010s and that the US may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks.
""The economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and our review will reflect our assessment of those changes,” Powell said in a speech in May.
Powell also stressed enhancing the Fed’s formal policy communications, particularly regarding the role of forecasts and uncertainty. Investors will watch for whether the Fed rolls out changes to its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which contains the famous ""dot plot,"" a compilation of each member of the FOMC’s expectations for interest rates that year.

Investors are running into INTC this morning also on President Donald Trump’s administration’s plans of taking a 10% stake in the beleaguered semiconductor firm as well.
More News from Barchart
Despite ongoing challenges, Intel stock has been a lucrative investment in August. Versus the start of this month, it’s up roughly 35% at the time of writing.
Why SoftBank’s Stake Bodes Wells for Intel Stock
Softbank’s investment is bullish for INTC shares as it essentially is a major vote of confidence in the company’s new management and its turnaround strategy at large.
The announcement reiterates Intel’s pivotal role in revitalizing U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and boosts its overall financial stability in the near term.
The capital injection could help INTC’s foundry business to accelerate its push into next-gen chip technologies, which may help attract new customers over time.
Simply put, Softbank’s stake lifts investor sentiment that may translate to significant further upside for Intel shares over time.
UBS Says INTC Shares Could Soar to $40
According to UBS analysts, a federal stake could prove a major tailwind for INTC stock, especially if the U.S. government urges the likes of Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), and Apple (AAPL) to boost their business with Intel.
“An upside case could potentially come to fruition if the U.S. government pushes these companies to engage more immediately with Intel on foundry services,” they told clients in a research note on Tuesday.
In fact, Intel could be worth as much as $40 in the bull-case scenario where its chip manufacturing business is valued similarly to global peers, UBS analysts added.
Their best-case forecast indicates potential for another 50% upside in INTC shares from here.
What’s the Consensus Rating on Intel?
At the time of writing, the consensus rating on Intel stock sits at “Hold” only with the mean target of about $23 indicating potential downside of more than 10% from current levels.",2caa0a47c4203f51acc497a5d6d6e754,trafilatura

Dogecoin's token price is getting hit with bearish pressures today, and news from Home Depot could be at the heart of the sell-offs.

Home Depot says that it will be increasing prices on some items in response to tariffs, which adds to concerns about broader inflationary trends.

If inflation heats up, that will make it harder for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates -- a development that would likely hurt cryptocurrency valuations.
Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is moving lower in Tuesday's trading. The cryptocurrency's token price has fallen 3.7% over the past 24 hours of trading as of 12:55 p.m. ET. Over the same period, Bitcoin is down 2.3%, and Ethereum was down 3.9%.
The cryptocurrency market is getting hit with bearish pressures in today's trading, and Dogecoin is getting hit with sell-offs in conjunction with the trend. While it may seem strange at first glance, it appears recent news from Home Depot is playing a significant role in the latest pullback for the meme coin.
Is Home Depot's latest quarterly report an important sign for Dogecoin?
Home Depot published its second-quarter results before the market opened this morning, and the earnings release appears to be triggering some significant moves in the crypto space. While the company's sales were in line with Wall Street's forecast, and earnings fell just shy of the target, the retailer's management issued commentary that has significant implications for the crypto market and broader U.S. economy.
Home Depot says that it will be hiking prices on some items in response to higher costs that it's facing due to tariffs. The comments from the home-improvement retailer suggests that overall inflation in the U.S. economy could start to accelerate again -- a development that could prove very damaging to cryptocurrency valuations.
What's next for Dogecoin?
Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its Producer Price Index (PPI) report for July. Sequential monthly PPI inflation came in at its highest level in more than three years, which raised concerns that inflation faced by producers and wholesalers would soon start to appear at the consumer level of the economy. Home Depot's recent comments about price increases seem to be adding to those fears. Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen bullish momentum thanks to expectations that the Federal Reserve is poised to deliver significant cuts to interest rates, but that thesis could be dashed if inflation comes in at higher-than-anticipated levels.",175aff14e882784a9125ca7c6f89ff11,trafilatura

The Dell Technologies APJ AI Innovation Hub (AIIH), dedicated to advancing AI for Singapore and the region, is an extension of the Dell Technologies Global Innovation Hub (GIH). Since 2019, Dell has invested over US$ 50 million in the GIH to drive key areas of growth in digital transformation to improve financial services delivery, enhance healthcare, optimise energy efficiency and expand access to quality education through innovative technology solutions.
The AIIH has three key objectives – AI transformation, AI enablement and AI leadership, aligning closely with Singapore's National AI Strategy 2.0.
AI Transformation
Understanding the critical need for support beyond infrastructure, Dell's AIIH provides end-to-end capabilities that bridge the gap between government and enterprises' AI ambitions and successful deployment. The demand for holistic support is supported by recent research, where 62% of businesses in Singapore cited a preference for third-party AI partners that are capable of managing projects from strategy to implementation.
The AIIH team will facilitate collaboration between organisations and partners to validate use cases, creating and testing prototypes out of Singapore for the region.
The hub has developed around 50 AI engineering solution prototypes, workshop modules and data science demo models. Since 2024, over 100 proof-of-concepts, workshops and demonstrations on AI engineering, generative and predictive AI have been conducted — all tailored for enterprises in the APJ region.
Many organisations have used Dell's resources to drive innovation, with several initiatives progressing toward full deployment across various sectors. For example:
Energy sector: Strengthening critical infrastructure resilience to ensure seamless and reliable operations for leading energy providers. Additionally, leveraging digital humans and chatbots to enhance customer engagement and improve customer experiences.
Telecommunications sector: Assisting a leading telecom provider to improve AI development and deployment across their infrastructure, enhancing agility, resilience and overall operational efficiency.
Education sector: Harnessing AI cloud technology to empower leading education providers, enhancing their research capabilities, fostering innovation and driving growth across their ecosystem.
Additionally, the Dell Technologies AI Centre of Excellence Lab is at the forefront of innovation, advancing research and development in AI PCs and edge computing designed for AI-specific use cases and workloads. Complementing the AIIH, the lab is committed to delivering exceptional user experiences while collaborating closely with academic institutions and hardware partners. Together, they conduct AI research and validate proof-of-concepts, ensuring scalable AI solutions can be seamlessly deployed across edge and hybrid environments.
AI Enablement
In line with Singapore's focus on skilling, the AIIH is working with 10 local institutes of higher learning to integrate essential AI skills as part of current programs. These skills include AI engineering, platform engineering, machine learning operations, containerisation and cloud-native architecture.
This effort aligns with Singapore's push towards growing AI talent and expertise. According to Deel research, 47% of organisations in Singapore reported a lack of local AI talent to meet business needs.
By the end of 2025, Dell Technologies experts, through the AIIH, will have trained around 10,000 students and midcareer professionals from among their customers and partners, equipping them with valuable tech skills to thrive in the future. The Dell InnovateFest and SCDF and Dell Innovation Challenge are annual events that unite ecosystem partners and students, providing a platform to showcase their creativity and harness technological innovations for social good. The Dell Technologies Forum Singapore event showcased some of these solutions.
""Our latest research shows that 90% of local enterprises are increasing investment in AI projects over the next 6-12 months. Organisations in Singapore recognise that AI is the foundation of future growth. The Dell Technologies APJ AI Innovation Hub, aligned with Singapore's National AI Strategy 2.0, is powering AI transformation, accelerating AI enablement and driving leadership for Singapore and the region,"" said Andy Sim, Vice President & Managing Director, Singapore, Dell Technologies. ""This is a testament to the impact we can create when we harness the collective capabilities of the tech ecosystem to shape AI for the future.""
AI Leadership
Guided by the vision ""AI for the Public Good, for Singapore and the World"", NAIS 2.0 seeks to empower individuals and communities to use AI with confidence, discernment and trust.
Aligned with Singapore's ambitions, the Dell Technologies APJ AIIH helps:
Organisations leverage Dell's expertise in AI engineering, data science, software development and full stack infrastructure deployment. By doing so, they can accelerate AI adoption, gain access to cutting-edge solutions, improve operational efficiency and unlock new business opportunities.
Industry to contribute to AI technologies and best practices in APJ, in collaboration with the wider tech ecosystem.
Society to advance ethical AI development and governance. Dell Technologies is proud to be a founding member of AI Verify Foundation and an active participant in the IT Standards Committee (ITSC) to spearhead the development of IT standards in Singapore.
""Organisations in Singapore and APJ are adopting AI but vary in AI readiness. The AI Innovation Hub is a trusted partner, offering end-to-end expertise to help businesses trial, deploy and scale AI solutions,"" said Peter Marrs, President, Asia Pacific Japan & Greater China, Dell Technologies. ""Singapore's 60th birthday marks decades of progress and innovation. At Dell Technologies, we support this journey by driving technology that empowers businesses, nurtures talent and enriches lives. The new hub strengthens our commitment to bridge the gap between AI aspirations and real-world applications.""

(Reuters) -Activist investor Ancora Holdings, in a letter to CSX board disclosed on Monday, urged the railroad to pursue near-term merger options or replace CEO Joe Hinrichs.
The activist investor urged the railroad to evaluate potential tie-ups with Berkshire Hathaway-owned BNSF Railway and Canadian Pacific Kansas City in order to determine the best merger partner.
It warned that once Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific start operating as a unified transcontinental network, CSX stands to lose the most.
""If a deal cannot be struck, we assume it will not take us running a proxy contest to ensure a qualified operator replaces Mr. Hinrichs,"" the activist investor said.
Ancora criticized CSX for failing to engage with Union Pacific earlier this year. It also argued that regulators may find it easier to review multiple rail mergers simultaneously.
""Getting something done as early as possible during the pro-business Trump Administration should also be a priority,"" it said.
""Shareholders cannot afford more missteps as CSX plays catch-up in the rail consolidation race,"" Ancora added.
CSX told Reuters it welcomes opportunities to enhance shareholder value and appreciates input from its investors.
The Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, representing over 1,200 CSX workers, urged stakeholders to reject any plan that prioritizes quick profits over long-term safety and service.
""We are not opposed to innovation or progress,"" union President Michael Baldwin said. ""What we are opposed to is a slash-and-burn approach from hedge funds and consultants whose relationship with the railroad ends the moment their profits are secured.""
Ancora's letter, sent privately to the board of CSX on August 6, comes as Union Pacific has signaled its intent to acquire smaller rival Norfolk Southern in an $85 billion deal that would create the first U.S. coast-to-coast freight railroad and reshape the movement of goods and grain nationwide.

The shares fell over 9% to close just under $158, in the fifth straight day of declines. Still, they've more than doubled in value in 2025, leaving Palantir the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the year so far as demand for the data analytics software company's Artificial Intelligence Platform drives record sales.
Short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who voiced concerns about the stock's valuation in a Fox Business interview last Wednesday, said in a report yesterday that he believes the stock has become ""detached from fundamentals"" and would be worth $40.
The report compares Palantir to OpenAI, and posits that if Palantir were to trade at the same price-to-revenue multiple as the ChatGPT maker given Bloomberg consensus projections, Palantir's stock price would be closer to $40. However, ""even that price would leave Palantir among the most expensive [software as a service] names in history,"" Left said.
Left, whose sharp commentary and claimed track record of exposing fraud and overvaluation have earned him the moniker ""The Bounty Hunter of Wall Street,"" has become a controversial figure and faces criminal charges for securities fraud.
Still, he's not the only one who's raised concerns about Palantir's lofty valuation. Of the eight Wall Street analysts with current ratings surveyed by Visible Alpha, just two have issued ""buy"" recommendations versus six ""hold"" ratings, amid some concerns the stock may have climbed too high, too fast, and could be due for a drawback.
Jefferies analysts, who applauded Palantir's strong revenue growth and outlook after the company reported results earlier this month, said they still believe the stock's valuation is ""disconnected from even optimistic growth scenarios."" HSBC analysts, who have a neutral rating for the stock, also warned it might already be ""priced for perfection"" and could struggle to keep up with investors' high expectations.

These include stage four chronic kidney disease and a pacemaker with defibrillator. I am currently independent, cleaning my own home, mowing my yard, gardening, shopping for and preparing my own meals. I enjoy playing bridge, book club, exercise class and volunteer work at church.
My passion is travel and exposure to new cultures, foods and scenic landscapes. I have had the privilege of visiting 45 countries and am now limited to “first-world countries” by my electrophysiologist. I was denied long-term health insurance in my late 50s. Emotionally, my concern over the current administration is influencing my thoughts about allocations.
I have $1 million in my IRA, $700,000 in my personal brokerage account, $500,000 in bank accounts and a $600,000 interest in a family farm. I pay my total credit-card debt every month. In the past, I have stayed firm on my investments through the crises of 1987, 2000 and 2008. Gold is about the only thing missing from my portfolio.
I am now concerned about preserving my “nursing home money.” My income is $120,000 per year which includes $60,000 in Social Security and a pension. As a former teacher, my charitable contributions are made directly from my IRA to charities featuring women, children and education, determined by my tax bracket.
How should my savings be distributed among stocks, bonds, cash, etc?
You’ve kept busy, both volunteering and in your garden, and have not allowed your medical events to define you. You have kept your mind active playing bridge, belonging to a book club, and volunteering at your local church. All of these activities — social, physical and mental — have kept you engaged and healthy.
An older person who is more socially isolated, lonely and disconnected, studies have shown, has a higher risk of chronic illness, depression and dying earlier than perhaps they would otherwise do so. Your life has purpose and you are more than the sum of your parts: being single, 75, and having chronic illness.
In other words, you’re doing all the right things — and I’m not talking about money. But since you asked: Your $1.1 million in your bank account and share in your family farm alone would keep you in long-term care for close to a decade. As would your $120,000 annual Social Security and pension. And you would still have preserved your $1.7 million investments.
Whatever side of the political spectrum you’re on, the administration changes every four years under the constitution, and America has survived a lot of events that others might have wondered at the time if they would be the nation’s undoing, including the Civil War, Great Depression and Great Recession. It can be a good or bad thing to be plugged into the news.
Among the biggest concerns for economists and Federal Reserve officials are the latest jobs numbers and economic growth. GDP expanded in the second quarter after contracting in the first quarter, but that result came with caveats, including people shifting their spending to avoid tariff hikes and a smaller trade deficit as higher tariffs stymied demand for imports.
As to your other concerns: The median cost of a nursing home in the U.S. is just over $10,600 per month, according to Genworth and Carescout’s 2024 Cost of Care Survey. A semi-private room is roughly $9,200. But this can vary depending on the city and state where you live, from $7,000 to $12,000 a month for a private room. It’s not cheap, but you are well prepared.
As to your question about allocation, the more you leave in your IRA and brokerage accounts, the more it will grow over time. At 75, you’re right to enjoy your life, see the world, and ensure you have high-quality, productive downtime. This is the time to live off your savings and income, and enjoy the next chapter of your life.
Holding 50%-plus in equities
Regarding your asset allocation, a “moderately conservative” portfolio would be approximately 50% stocks, 40% bonds and 20% cash for living and emergencies, according to Charles Schwab. Given your income and cash, you could probably be less conservative than that. You are fortunate that you have a six-figure income; given your age, this is substantial.
For the last 60 years, the average peak-to-peak recovery time for a diversified index of stocks in bear markets was roughly 3.5 years, Charles Schwab says. “So, it’s wise to keep 2-4 years’ worth of living expenses in short-term bonds, CDs, or other reasonably liquid accounts. This way, you’ll have access to cash during a downturn if you need it without selling stocks.”
“Consider adding some dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio,” it adds. “They also allow your principal to remain invested for potential growth. Stick with stocks: Make sure you don’t dial back your exposure to stocks too soon. Having a larger allocation of stocks in the early years of retirement can help guard against the risk of outliving your retirement savings.”
Your deposits are insured up to $250,000 at each Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured bank. Think about putting your savings into high-yield money markets or savings accounts, rolling Treasury bills or laddered CDs. You will get more bang for your buck than leaving them in a checking or savings account.
Buying CDs through a brokerage will allow you to spread out the FDIC insurance over various banks. You could purchase a $10,000 CD every month for the next 24 months. If you do not need the money when they mature, you could purchase another CD 24 months out. This helps you lock in the higher CD rates, while also providing you liquidity.
As interest rates go down, bond typically prices go up, and vice versa. For maturities up to 12 months, U.S. Treasuries are known as Treasury Bills, or T-Bills. For 2 years to 10 years, they are Treasury Notes, and for 20 or 30 years, they are Treasury Bonds. In its 2025 forecast, Vanguard projected aggregate bond returns would return 10-year annualized 4% to 5%.
You may have been denied long-term care insurance in your 50s, but if those insurance agents could see you now! At 75, living your best life, traveling the world, maintaining your financial and physical independence. All going well, you may avoid the need for a nursing home altogether and/or only need it towards the end of your journey.
Until then, live life to the fullest and have a ball on your next trip.",b5d9847d7444c314427dd49cc816028d,trafilatura

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), meanwhile, at that point was down by only 0.7%.
Proposals on the table
President Donald Trump is reviewing a draft document detailing recommendations on promoting health in American youth, several media outlets reported that day. Among the suggestions is that the U.S. Surgeon General ""will launch an education and awareness initiative on the impact of alcohol, controlled substances, vaping, and THC on children's health.""
THC is the psychoactive compound in cannabis that gets users high.
The language suggests that such an initiative would focus on the risks and potentially harmful effects of these substances. As current legislative efforts to reschedule marijuana are focused on a ""rescheduling"" of the drug that would make it de facto legal throughout the U.S., this document feels like a step in the opposite direction.
It is currently unknown if Trump has conducted his review. He has not yet commented on it.
Getting Trumped?
Although the president has leaned toward marijuana legalization, recently he has indicated a desire to leave it up to individual states to decide, rather than enact reform on the federal level. This would basically maintain the status quo, which is a patchwork of states that have enacted some degree of legalization, mixed with a handful that have kept the drug fully illegal.
This won't help the cannabis industry, which in my view can only improve significantly with de facto legalization, in addition to reform that allows it to directly access basic financial services.

One in five Americans (20%) doesn’t have savings at all.

While saving is important, it’s not the only way to build wealth. In fact, billionaire Mark Cuban argues that you shouldn’t just save — you should invest instead. GOBankingRates broke down Cuban’s advice on prioritizing investing your money over saving it.
Aggressively Invest Instead
According to Mark Cuban, saving isn’t the best way to make your money work for you. The top 1% doesn’t just save. They aggressively invest in things like real estate and alternative assets (like gold IRAs).
A 2025 CAIS-Mercer study supports this idea. Of the financial advisors surveyed, 92% said they allocate their funds to alternative investments. Nearly all of them (91%) said they intend to increase allocations in the future.
Take Mark Cuban’s Advice With a Grain of Salt
Leaving your money in a savings account, even one with higher-than-normal yields, might not be the best idea. After all, those yields may not even keep up with inflation. This means the value of your savings might fall rather than rise (depending on the account and how much you’re contributing).
But you might still want to have a little saved for emergencies.
“Every individual should have [three to six] months of lifestyle expenses in savings — a checking account and a high-yield money market account. Once they have this money in savings, they should start investing,” said Richard Craft, CEO of Wealth Advisory Group.
You can save money for short-term goals — anything that takes under a year. But if you have long-term goals — anything over a year — investing is generally smarter.

Saving Could Cost You Millions
Say you have a savings account with 4.00% APY and a $50,000 balance. After one year, you’d have roughly $52,000. In 10 years, you’d have around $74,000. This assumes nothing changes in that account — no withdrawals, deposits or changes in yield.
Now, say you invest $50,000 in the stock market instead. According to Investors.com, the stock market has seen an average annual return of 10.8% over the past decade. Assuming average returns and no additional contributions, you’d have nearly $140,000 after 10 years.
That’s nearly double — all because you invested. When you think even longer term, you could potentially be losing out on a lot more than that.",032bfa5a30ca1d4d21ec6f5a7f093016,trafilatura

Whether it's the manufacturing sector or the technology sector, nothing escapes his close scrutiny.
What is remarkable about Cramer is that he has made the stock market very accessible to the average Joe, and his wildly exciting manner of presenting the latest updates keeps the audience hooked to the screens.
His calls on different stocks have generated a lot of noise over the past few years — both when he nailed them and when he failed to gauge the future trends.
Notwithstanding his loud and boisterous manner of presentation, Cramer has earned himself a loyal following over the years.
Retail traders from far-flung towns in the U.S. call Cramer during the show and ask for his advice on the prospects of stocks they are considering. And the popular CNBC host doesn't hesitate to share his opinion, however divergent from conventional wisdom it may be, to try to help his callers navigate the markets.
Jim Cramer eyes crypto market
With several crypto firms going public within the past few years, they have also attracted the attention of the veteran market analyst. Cramer has changed his opinion on crypto over the years. While he was once extremely dismissive of the emerging trend, he has over time come to appreciate the alternative offered by the crypto asset economy.
When the AI cloud company CoreWeave (Nasdaq: CRWV) announced the acquisition of the Bitcoin mining firm Core Scientific (Nasdaq: CORZ) on July 7, he called it ""very positive.""
Nonetheless, Cramer doesn't shy away from dissing crypto stocks he doesn't like at the moment. Despite the impressive public debut of Circle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL), he warned that an established giant like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) could easily outpace the stablecoin firm once it decides to go all in on the asset category.
Now, Cramer has two recommendations in the crypto sector.
On Aug. 14, he discussed two crypto stocks in detail on the ""Squawk on the Street"" show, which we shall dig deeper into.
Jim Cramer talks about Bullish
Launched in 2011, Peter Thiel-backed Bullish (NYSE: BLSH) is a global crypto trading exchange that went public on Aug. 13. It announced on Aug. 19 that it had arranged to receive $1.15 billion of proceeds from its recently completed initial public offering (IPO) in stablecoins, including Circle's USDC, Ripple's RLUSD, and Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial's USD1.",61bea05244cce5ccd18bc012fc7e22f7,trafilatura

A recent Liquid Insight report, published Aug. 14 by strategist Howard Du and his team, warns that the current monetary and inflation landscape is flashing signals reminiscent of the last time the Fed cut rates in a rising inflation environment. “This is a possible but historically rare regime,” they added. The last time it happened was from the second half of 2007 to the first half of 2008, they said in their note titled “Ghosts of 2007.”
At the same time, a separate BofA Global Research note, from the equity and quantitative strategy team, looked at another historical rhyme: between the megacap stocks dubbed the “Nifty 50”—notably Nvidia and other members of the “Magnificent Seven”—and the last time they outperformed the S&P 500 for so many years. (The first Nifty 50 to bear the nickname was a group that ran until roughly 1973, when the game changed for markets because of the onset of the Great Inflation and other factors, including a shift away from the gold standard.)
“Megacaps led for seven years but cracked in July,” wrote the team led by Savita Subramanian, adding that the last memorable run by the largest 50 stocks in terms of market cap was the 1990s lead-up to the dotcom bubble. That was about six years long, a similar duration to the current market pattern.
The analysis from Du’s team notes that the convergence of falling policy rates and accelerating inflation is exceedingly rare, occurring just 16% of the time since 1973. Historically, central banks have slashed rates in response to declining inflation, not rising prices. The bank’s concern centers on the potential for rate cuts this year to push the so-called real policy rate—the Fed rate adjusted for inflation—deeply negative. Such a move, the report warns, could further weaken the U.S. dollar, citing striking similarities to 2007, when the Fed’s easing amid supply-driven inflation triggered currency volatility and set the stage for the financial meltdown.
Meanwhile, Subramanian’s team suggested that the Nifty 50 may be giving way to broader market leadership. Historically, Fed easing, particularly during periods of sticky inflation, has triggered underperformance by megacaps. BofA’s analysts say that, in past recoveries, small-cap and value-oriented stocks have strongly outperformed, benefiting from cash moving out of money-market funds into equities as risk-free returns begin to dwindle.
The notes were written by different teams on subsequent days, digesting the Fed’s likely cuts coming down the pike and the several parallels to the last two major financial crashes of the past 25 years. To be sure, BofA isn’t connecting these two trends to each other specifically, and isn’t predicting another imminent financial crisis. But the ghosts of 2007 are back, and the Nifty 50 is showing wear and tear.
What’s next?
Market conviction for a September rate cut is now running near certainty, with the probability of a 25 bps reduction at the next Fed meeting nearing 100%. This sharp shift follows disappointing July employment numbers and a string of downward revisions to prior job data. Markets are also betting on at least two rate cuts before year-end and forecast the Fed funds rate to fall below 3% by 2026. Meanwhile, BofA’s models suggest that even modest monthly rises in headline CPI will keep year-on-year inflation elevated at 2.9% or higher into December, up from 2.3% to 2.4% in early 2025—an echo, the bank says, of the temporary inflation surges triggered by supply-side shocks during 2007–08.
Du’s team also noted strong parallels in the foreign exchange market, flagging that the U.S. dollar is tracking its weakest year since 1999 and is moving more closely in tandem with 2007 than any other year in half a century. Back then, the dollar’s sharp pre-rate-cut depreciation lingered for months and only reversed as real rates recovered—pain that currency markets may soon reexperience if the Fed proceeds as markets expect. “While the [dollar] is on track for largest year-to-date depreciation since 1999,” Du’s team noted, “the price action in 2025 still has the highest correlation with 2007 out of all years since 1973.”
Subramanian’s proprietary U.S. Regime Indicator, which turned to “Recovery” in July and held steady into August, mirrors previous cycles in which smaller and value stocks led, with high-beta and sector-neutral value factors outperforming the big names by notable margins. Today’s megacaps, while pivotal to market gains in recent years, now exhibit average growth and weakened quality—measured by lower free cash flow margins and fewer highly rated companies—heightening their vulnerability as valuation premiums stretch.
As rates head lower, BofA expects flows to favor value and dividend-oriented stocks, with investor strategies tilting toward Russell 1000 names offering robust but not excessive dividends. Small-cap and value stocks with low P/E ratios and high beta also screen as top performers, in both sector-neutral and unconstrained assessments. Meanwhile, the persistent crowding and high valuations in growth names point to a broadening of opportunities outside megacap growth as risk premiums compress and market leadership tilts.
In summary, BofA’s dual analysis offers both a warning and a road map: The Fed’s imminent rate cut, set against the rare backdrop of accelerating inflation, invokes a historical precedent fraught with risk for the dollar and for financial market stability. Simultaneously, the stage appears set for a major rotation within U.S. equities, away from the megacaps toward broader market segments—a development investors will be closely watching as the Fed’s pivotal September meeting approaches.
If there’s a crash to rival the early 2000s or the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, though, that will be a different story indeed.

What Happened: More than $11 billion has been bet against Meta by increased short interest in the stock this year.
According to a tweet from CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos, Meta's short interest has climbed by 75% in 2025 thanks to the increase short interest from new investors and a 30% year-to-date gain for Meta stock.
The data, which comes from S3 Partners, shows Meta as the stock with the highest gain in short interest at $11.0 billion, which is more than the next five companies combined.
The $11.0 billion is also more than double the 2025 short interest in Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) combined.
For comparison, the short interest gain in 2025 is $2.8 billion for Palantir and $2.2 billion for Microsoft. Bets against Palantir and Microsoft come with both stocks up year-to-date in 2025, including a huge 110% gain for Palantir.
Why It's Important: The increase in short interest in Meta could be for many reasons. Partsinevelos' tweet links the increase to investor betting against Meta's AI and metaverse spending and the negative impact of tariffs and slowing growth could have on the company's stock.
Pressure on advertising rates could be another factor that sends shares lower, especially after the year-to-date gains.
Meta reported its second-quarter financial results in July. Without any negative catalysts between now and the end of October, short sellers may have to wait until the third-quarter results in late October to see shares take a turn down if the report is unfavorable.
Meta has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in 10 consecutive quarters and revenue estimates in 13 straight quarters.
The company's consistent growth has helped the stock performance in recent years.
With more investors betting against the company, the likelihood is that the company's aggressive spending on new hires in the AI field and the continued spending on the metaverse could be negatives for the long term and hurt margins going forward.
META Price Action: Meta Platforms stock is down 2% to $752.27 on Tuesday versus a 52-week trading range of $479.80 to $796.25. Meta stock is up 25.6% year-to-date in 2025.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.54%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -1.37%.
Stock indexes settled mixed on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq 100 falling to a 1.5-week low and the Dow Jones industrials posting a new all-time high. Tuesday’s selloff in chip makers and the Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks weighed on the overall market.
On the positive side, Home Depot recovered from early losses and closed up more than +3% to push the Dow Jones industrials to a new record high after it reported a +3% jump in July comparable same-store sales. Lowes and Target will report their earnings on Wednesday, and Walmart will report on Thursday.
Lower bond yields on Tuesday were supportive of stocks, as the 10-year T-note yield fell -3 bp to 4.30%. US government debt garnered support Tuesday after S&P Global Ratings affirmed its AA+ long-term rating and A-1+ short-term rating on US debt and said the US can maintain its credit strength despite the fiscal hit of its recent spending bill because tariff revenues will “generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes.”
Tuesday’s US housing news was mixed. US Jul housing starts unexpectedly rose +5.2% m/m to a 5-month high of 1.428 million, stronger than expectations of a decline to 1.297 million. However, Jul building permits, a proxy for future construction, fell -2.8% m/m to a 5-year low of 1.354 million, weaker than expectations of -0.5% m/m to 1.386 million.
Diplomatic talks over the war in Ukraine continue to make headway. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said he came away with a commitment from President Trump late Monday to join security guarantees for any peace deal and reserve discussion on territorial swaps with Russia for later. President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon, and European leaders are discussing a plan to send British and French troops to Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.
The focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000 and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July. Also, the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 49.8. In addition, Jul existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.
In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 87% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 54% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 92% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets on Tuesday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 rose to a 4.75-month high and closed up +0.89%. China’s Shanghai Composite fell from a 10-year high and closed down -0.02%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 retreated from a new record high and closed down -0.38%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) Tuesday closed up +8 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -3.2 bp to 4.302%. Sep T-notes rallied Tuesday after S&P Global Ratings said that higher revenues from tariffs will help soften the blow to the US’s fiscal health from the president’s tax cuts, enabling the country to maintain its AA+ long-term credit rating. The weakness in stocks on Tuesday also supported safe-haven demand for T-notes. Gains in T-notes were limited due to concerns that last week’s bearish US July CPI and PPI reports could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month’s FOMC meeting.
European government bond yields on Tuesday were mixed. The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.3 bp to 2.750%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 2.5-month high of 4.756% and finished up by +0.2 bp to 4.740%.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 7% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

-
SoundHound AI stock fell about 11% amid a broader market sell-off rather than company-specific news.
-
The company recently reported strong second-quarter results, but only in a relative sense -- it remains unprofitable.
-
With a beta of 2.8, SoundHound AI is a highly volatile stock.
Shares of SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) took a steep dip on Tuesday. The company, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to provide user-friendly voice control tools, had taken an 11% hit as of 3:07 p.m. ET on a consistent downward trend. There was no company-specific news driving this price drop, just a bearish market day undermining the stock's recent gains.
What's going on?
All kinds of market darling stocks fell on Tuesday as earnings reports from the retail sector showed signs of tariff-based inflation. That's bad news for a stock like SoundHound AI. The company is unprofitable and its stock is trading on long-term revenue growth opportunities instead. Even so, SoundHound AI shares are changing hands at 41 times trailing sales -- after Tuesday's sharp price correction.
Standard operating procedure for growth investors
This is just a normal Tuesday afternoon for richly valued growth stocks and their investors. SoundHound AI is incredibly volatile with a beta rating of 2.8. In other words, the stock tends to move in the same direction as the overall market, but roughly 2.8 times as far in either direction.

SoundHound AI reported strong second-quarter results earlier this month, adding support to the stock's soaring valuation. But earnings are still negative and it will take years to convert its billion-dollar contract backlog into actual revenue.

The retailer and union also will implement a joint training program for suppliers, ensuring they understand and meet expectations for protecting worker rights.

“The renewed global framework agreement reflects years of joint work and shows that lasting change comes from strong implementation and monitoring, not voluntary pledges,” said Atle Høie, IndustriAll general secretary. “It demonstrates a sustainable approach to labor rights, ensuring that trade unions can represent workers effectively and that their voices are heard on the ground in supplier factories.”
The renewed agreement also covers all key International Labor Organization conventions, including Convention 190, which recognizes “the right of everyone to a world of work free from violence and harassment, including gender-based violence and harassment.”
“Renewing our Global Framework Agreement with IndustriAll was one of the first commitments we set ourselves when we relaunched our updated Fashion with Integrity sustainability strategy last year,” said José Antonio Ramos, CEO of Asos. First introduced in 2010 and updated last year, Asos’ Fashion with Integrity strategy outlines the company’s goals and guidelines on sustainability, circularity and human rights, including wages and benefits, forced labor, freedom of association and gender empowerment.
The IndustriAll Global Union represents 50 million workers in 130 countries across multiple sectors, including manufacturing. The union has signed agreements with a number of fashion brands, including H&M, Zara parent Inditex and Esprit, among others. Asos—which represents several brands such as Asos Design, Collusion and Topshop and boasts more than 18 million active customers in more than 200 markets—signed its previous global framework agreement with IndustriAll in 2017.
Asos said that the agreement represents its commitment to ongoing monitoring and due diligence to safeguard workers across the company’s supply chain.
“In the eight years since we signed our original agreement, our relationship with IndustriAll has helped us to improve resilience in our supply chain, mitigate human rights risks and deliver positive long-term change for the people who make our clothes,” Ramos said. “Our new agreement will strengthen our relationship and will be vital in driving further improvements for Asos and for workers in our supply chain.”",d90c7325a99276bb11d8bf302192bab8,trafilatura

Other market indicators showed investor caution. However, it is reasonable to believe Bitcoin's dominance is still solid. As of Tuesday, Bitcoin's dominance is just under 59%, continually cementing its leading position in the sector.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign, but pared gains after minutes from the Fed's latest meeting showed that only two policymakers supported an interest rate cut last month.
Trump cited allegations made by one of his political allies about mortgages Cook holds in Michigan and Georgia, intensifying his effort to gain influence over the U.S. central bank.
Trump has also told aides he is considering attempting to fire Cook, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
“The market has voted with its pocketbook that it doesn't like when the president interferes with the Federal Reserve,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.
Trump has been critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for being too slow to cut rates, and traders expect he will replace Powell with a more dovish appointment when his term ends in May.
But Powell may stay on the board of governors, which would limit how many appointments Trump may make and could crimp plans to form a more dovish composition of policymakers.
“This is just a thinly veiled attempt to get control of the Federal Reserve, because if Powell doesn't step down as Governor when his chair ends, Trump's only appointment is the Kugler seat that he gave to Miran temporarily,” Chandler said.
Trump earlier this month said he would nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a vacant Fed seat after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned.
The greenback came off its lows after minutes from the Fed's July 29-30 meeting showed that the two Fed policymakers who dissented against the U.S. central bank decision to leave interest rates unchanged last month appear not to have been joined by other policymakers in voicing support for lowering rates at that meeting.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, was last down 0.13% on the day at 98.20, with the euro up 0.09% at $1.1657.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.32% against the greenback to 147.2 per dollar.
Traders are focused this week on whether Powell will push back against market expectations for a rate cut at the Fed’s September 16-17 meeting when he speaks at the U.S. central bank’s Jackson Hole meeting on Friday, following a weak jobs report for July.
Powell has said he is reluctant to cut rates on expectations that Trump’s tariff policies will increase inflation this summer.",02afd0293876f45fb4ea2e84a1a4bd5f,trafilatura

A major tech industry investor is plowing $2 billion into a U.S. microchip company.
-
That company isn't AMD, however.
On Tuesday, the No. 1 tech sector, water cooler conversation item was a giant financial company's investment into a major American chip maker.
Unfortunately for shareholders of American Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), their company wasn't the one chosen by the suitor. With many investors surely feeling left out, they assertively traded out of AMD stock, leaving it with a more than 5% loss on the day. The S&P 500 index also declined, but its fall was far less steep at 0.6%.
Taking the decision hard
The company doing the investing was SoftBank, and its target was not AMD but the U.S. company's longtime rival Intel.
After market close Monday, SoftBank announced that they had signed an agreement with Intel to invest $2 billion in the latter's common stock. That shakes out to $23 per each of the chip maker's shares, so it was hardly surprising that Intel vaulted past that level with a nearly 7% rise.
At a stroke, the deal makes SoftBank an important institutional investor in Intel (it'll be the fifth-largest investor overall). All told, it will hold around 2% of the American company.
For better and for worse, chip makers in this country have been flagged as businesses that could help widen the U.S. manufacturing base. This is a key goal of the Trump administration and a leading reason for its recent efforts to levy tariffs on the top trading partners of this country.
Knee-jerk reaction
Intel had been struggling more than AMD recently, so in many ways it's a more appropriate recipient of a chunky investment. That said, $2 billion is a large amount of capital for a company of any size, so that ""shunned fiancé"" feeling is completely understandable. It doesn't, however, change the outlook much for AMD, so perhaps the Tuesday slump will provide a good buying opportunity in the stock.

The Cupertino, California-headquartered company now runs two stores in India — a flagship shop in the country’s financial capital of Mumbai and a store in a southern Delhi mall. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook attended the openings of each in 2023.
Apple’s iPhones account for 5% of India’s more than 700 million smartphone users, according to market research firm Counterpoint. Though India comprises a small portion of revenue compared with the US and China, the world’s most populous country offers huge room for growth, Cook has said. Apple’s revenue in India rose more than 30% to $8 billion dollars in the fiscal year to March 2024, with the bulk of those sales coming from iPhones.
Over the years, Apple has stepped up efforts to win more customers in India, where its iPhones, iPad and MacBook laptops are pricey status symbols that remain unaffordable for many. Those efforts include tie-ups with banks for interest-free installment purchase plans, student discounts and free engravings on some products.
Apple has been expanding iPhone manufacturing capacity in India, part of a shift away from China in the aftermath of harsh Covid shutdowns and Washington’s trade war with Beijing. India accounts for more than a fifth of all iPhones produced, with Apple now making all four models of its iPhone 17 series in the South Asian country ahead of next month’s debut.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports posted the biggest monthly drop in about four years in July, government data showed on Wednesday, as the impact of U.S. tariffs intensified, raising concerns about the outlook for the export-reliant economy.
Total exports from the world's fourth-largest economy dropped 2.6% year-on-year in July in value terms, the biggest monthly drop since February 2021, when exports fell 4.5%.
It was larger than a median market forecast for a 2.1% decrease and marks a third straight month of decline after a 0.5% drop in June.
Despite the plunge in the value of exports, shipment volumes have so far held up as Japanese exporters have avoided major price hikes, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But they would eventually have to pass on costs to U.S. consumers and that would further hamper sales in the coming months,"" he said.
Exports to the United States in July fell 10.1% from a year earlier, with automobiles slumping 28.4% and automotive components down 17.4%.
However, automobile exports fell just 3.2% in volume terms, suggesting Japanese automakers' price cuts and efforts to absorb additional tariffs have partly shielded shipments.
The United States imposed 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts in April and threatened 25% levies on most of Japan's other goods. It later struck a trade deal on July 23 that lowered tariffs to 15% in exchange for a U.S.-bound $550 billion Japanese investment package.
The agreed tariff rate on automobiles, Japan's largest export sector, is still far higher than the original 2.5%, exerting pressure on major automakers and parts suppliers.
Exports to other regions were also weak. Those to China were down 3.5%, the data showed.
Total imports in July dropped 7.5% from a year earlier, compared with market forecasts for a 10.4% fall.
As a result, Japan ran a deficit of 117.5 billion yen ($795.4 million) in July, compared with a forecast of a 196.2 billion yen surplus.
The outcome follows unexpectedly strong growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the April-June quarter, separate data showed last week, fuelled by surprisingly resilient exports and capital expenditure.
Economists said the strong exports growth in GDP data reflected differences in how the impact of price changes is factored in.
Nevertheless, Norinchukin's Minami said that the Japanese economy has so far avoided the worst.
""As the tariff deal has at least reduced uncertainties, the Bank of Japan is likely to resume rate hikes as early as in October,"" he said.",3b0c345c6e232114cd50704e09a7c57f,trafilatura

Neom’s Desert Ski Resort Strains Saudi Prince’s $1.5 Trillion Plan
A broad rally in cryptocurrencies drove Bitcoin to a record on Aug. 14, while pushing Ether to within touching distance of its own all-time high. That momentum — fed by an array of corporate crypto accumulators built in the mold of Michael Saylor’s Strategy — now appears to be dwindling.
Options activity shows traders turning defensive. The put-to-call ratio for Aug. 22 contracts jumped to 1.33 on Deribit, the derivatives exchange, with $3.8 billion in Bitcoin options expiring. The largest open interest is in $110,000 puts, signaling concern over a near-term pullback as traders seek downside protection. Put options offer downside insurance by giving contract holders the right to sell at a certain price.
“What the put-call ratio tells you is that, given high expectation of rate cuts in Sept., the market is more sensitive to the risk of Powell sounding hawkish than dovish,” said Peter Chung, head of research at Presto. “The market gyrations over the last few days is the result of investors positioning themselves for an uncertain outcome of the speech.”
Bitcoin fell 1.1% to around $113,100 as of 7:55 a.m. in New York, extending its retreat to 9% from its record of $124,514. Ether, the second-largest token, slid 1.7% to $4,280.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell’s cautious approach to rate cuts. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said he expects Trump to announce Powell’s replacement by year-end, making Friday’s Jackson Hole address likely his last as Fed chair.
Minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting, released yesterday, underscored that officials still see inflation risks as outweighing employment concerns, even as new tariffs are expected to take time to feed into the economy. That backdrop has reinforced bets that Powell’s tone could temper hopes for aggressive easing.
“The FOMC meeting minutes released overnight indicated that the impact of new tariffs is expected to take time to materialise. Additionally, a majority of members viewed inflation risks as outweighing employment risks, signalling a continued cautious stance on rate cuts,” said Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG Australia Pty.",891c797453372950b4e0a0791d36f982,trafilatura

It offers wireless, broadband, and other communication services to individuals, businesses, and the government. The wireless giant has a high dividend yield of 6.1%, a ,long dividend history, and a clearer picture of cash generation now that the 5G buildout is maturing.
At the same time, the company operates in a saturated U.S. wireless market where adding phone subscribers has become increasingly difficult. As a result, the question arises: Is Verizon stock still a buy for income investors in 2025?
Valued at $183.4 billion, VZ stock has gained 10.8% year-to-date, slightly beating the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) gain of 9.7%.
Dividend Stability: The Key Metric for Income Investors
Aside from a high yield, the most appealing feature of a good dividend stock is its consistent dividend payments and growth. Verizon has increased its dividends over the last 20 years, establishing a reputation for consistent payouts and increases. This continued quarterly payment indicates that the company intends to protect the payout even in choppier operating environments.
Another factor in determining dividend safety is the amount of profits distributed as dividends, which is measured by the dividend payout ratio. Verizon’s forward payout ratio of 55.8% shows a good balance between returning money to shareholders and saving for growth initiatives.
In the second quarter, Verizon reported consolidated revenue of $34.5 billion, up 5.2% year-over-year, boosted by strong wireless service revenue and wireless equipment revenue. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.1% year on year to $12.8 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 6.1% to $1.22.
Broadband remains a growth engine, with 293,000 net additions in Q2. Fixed wireless access (FWA) accounted for 278,000 of the net additions, bringing its total to 5.1 million subscribers. In the earnings call, management stated the company remains on track to reach 8 million to 9 million FWA subscribers by 2028. The upcoming acquisition of Frontier (FYBR) (pending regulatory approval) has the potential to accelerate Verizon’s fiber strategy and expand its broadband footprint.
The company’s free cash flow reached $5.2 billion in the quarter and $8.8 billion year to date, an increase of more than $300 million over the same period in 2024. Free cash flow is arguably the most significant indicator in determining dividend stability. Its current debt-equity ratio is slightly higher at 1.4x. The company is continuing to reduce debt, with few maturities remaining in 2025, and has stated that share buybacks will be considered after meeting long-term leverage targets. Verizon expects to generate free cash flow between $19.5 billion and $20.5 billion in 2025. This should allow Verizon to pay down debt while maintaining dividend payments.
The company raised its annual adjusted EPS growth guidance to 1% to 3%. Analysts predict that Verizon’s earnings will increase by 2.5% in 2025 and 3.04% in 2026. Verizon’s dividend appears secure for now, thanks to strong free cash flow generation, a conservative payout ratio supported by EBITDA growth, and ongoing debt reduction, all of which improve financial flexibility.
Despite these advantages, investors should be mindful of potential risks, such as competitive pressures in the wireless and broadband sectors from AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and cable providers. Furthermore, Verizon’s debt load, while manageable now, remains significant, and interest rate changes may affect refinancing costs.
What Is Wall Street Saying About Verizon Stock?
Overall, on Wall Street, Verizon stock is rated a “Moderate Buy.” Out of the 28 analysts who cover Verizon stock, nine rate it a “Strong Buy,” three suggest it’s a “Moderate Buy,” and 16 rate it a ""Hold.” Its average price target of $48.29 suggests that the stock can increase by 11% over current levels. However, its high target price of $58 implies upside potential of 33.3% over the next 12 months.
Bottom Line: A Solid Pick for Dividend Stability
Verizon stock remains an attractive buy for income-focused investors looking for a high, stable yield backed by strong free cash flow. The company’s network leadership, disciplined financial management, and growth in broadband and private network services all help to ensure the dividend’s sustainability. While growth investors may prefer faster-moving tech stocks, those looking for a high, stable yield with moderate risk will find Verizon a compelling option in 2025.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar fell on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign, but pared gains after minutes from the Fed's latest meeting showed that only two policymakers supported an interest rate cut last month.
Trump cited allegations made by one of his political allies about mortgages Cook holds in Michigan and Georgia, intensifying his effort to gain influence over the U.S. central bank.
Trump has also told aides he is considering attempting to fire Cook, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
“The market has voted with its pocketbook that it doesn't like when the president interferes with the Federal Reserve,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York.
Trump has been critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell for being too slow to cut rates, and traders expect he will replace Powell with a more dovish appointment when his term ends in May.
But Powell may stay on the board of governors, which would limit how many appointments Trump may make and could crimp plans to form a more dovish composition of policymakers.
“This is just a thinly veiled attempt to get control of the Federal Reserve, because if Powell doesn't step down as Governor when his chair ends, Trump's only appointment is the Kugler seat that he gave to Miran temporarily,” Chandler said.
Trump earlier this month said he would nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve out the final few months of a vacant Fed seat after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned.
The greenback came off its lows after minutes from the Fed's July 29-30 meeting showed that the two Fed policymakers who dissented against the U.S. central bank decision to leave interest rates unchanged last month appear not to have been joined by other policymakers in voicing support for lowering rates at that meeting.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, was last down 0.13% on the day at 98.20, with the euro up 0.09% at $1.1657.
The Japanese yen strengthened 0.32% against the greenback to 147.2 per dollar.
Traders are focused this week on whether Powell will push back against market expectations for a rate cut at the Fed’s September 16-17 meeting when he speaks at the U.S. central bank’s Jackson Hole meeting on Friday, following a weak jobs report for July.
Powell has said he is reluctant to cut rates on expectations that Trump’s tariff policies will increase inflation this summer.",02afd0293876f45fb4ea2e84a1a4bd5f,trafilatura

A major tech industry investor is plowing $2 billion into a U.S. microchip company.
-
That company isn't AMD, however.
On Tuesday, the No. 1 tech sector, water cooler conversation item was a giant financial company's investment into a major American chip maker.
Unfortunately for shareholders of American Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), their company wasn't the one chosen by the suitor. With many investors surely feeling left out, they assertively traded out of AMD stock, leaving it with a more than 5% loss on the day. The S&P 500 index also declined, but its fall was far less steep at 0.6%.
Taking the decision hard
The company doing the investing was SoftBank, and its target was not AMD but the U.S. company's longtime rival Intel.
After market close Monday, SoftBank announced that they had signed an agreement with Intel to invest $2 billion in the latter's common stock. That shakes out to $23 per each of the chip maker's shares, so it was hardly surprising that Intel vaulted past that level with a nearly 7% rise.
At a stroke, the deal makes SoftBank an important institutional investor in Intel (it'll be the fifth-largest investor overall). All told, it will hold around 2% of the American company.
For better and for worse, chip makers in this country have been flagged as businesses that could help widen the U.S. manufacturing base. This is a key goal of the Trump administration and a leading reason for its recent efforts to levy tariffs on the top trading partners of this country.
Knee-jerk reaction
Intel had been struggling more than AMD recently, so in many ways it's a more appropriate recipient of a chunky investment. That said, $2 billion is a large amount of capital for a company of any size, so that ""shunned fiancé"" feeling is completely understandable. It doesn't, however, change the outlook much for AMD, so perhaps the Tuesday slump will provide a good buying opportunity in the stock.

The Cupertino, California-headquartered company now runs two stores in India — a flagship shop in the country’s financial capital of Mumbai and a store in a southern Delhi mall. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook attended the openings of each in 2023.
Apple’s iPhones account for 5% of India’s more than 700 million smartphone users, according to market research firm Counterpoint. Though India comprises a small portion of revenue compared with the US and China, the world’s most populous country offers huge room for growth, Cook has said. Apple’s revenue in India rose more than 30% to $8 billion dollars in the fiscal year to March 2024, with the bulk of those sales coming from iPhones.
Over the years, Apple has stepped up efforts to win more customers in India, where its iPhones, iPad and MacBook laptops are pricey status symbols that remain unaffordable for many. Those efforts include tie-ups with banks for interest-free installment purchase plans, student discounts and free engravings on some products.
Apple has been expanding iPhone manufacturing capacity in India, part of a shift away from China in the aftermath of harsh Covid shutdowns and Washington’s trade war with Beijing. India accounts for more than a fifth of all iPhones produced, with Apple now making all four models of its iPhone 17 series in the South Asian country ahead of next month’s debut.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's exports posted the biggest monthly drop in about four years in July, government data showed on Wednesday, as the impact of U.S. tariffs intensified, raising concerns about the outlook for the export-reliant economy.
Total exports from the world's fourth-largest economy dropped 2.6% year-on-year in July in value terms, the biggest monthly drop since February 2021, when exports fell 4.5%.
It was larger than a median market forecast for a 2.1% decrease and marks a third straight month of decline after a 0.5% drop in June.
Despite the plunge in the value of exports, shipment volumes have so far held up as Japanese exporters have avoided major price hikes, said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
""But they would eventually have to pass on costs to U.S. consumers and that would further hamper sales in the coming months,"" he said.
Exports to the United States in July fell 10.1% from a year earlier, with automobiles slumping 28.4% and automotive components down 17.4%.
However, automobile exports fell just 3.2% in volume terms, suggesting Japanese automakers' price cuts and efforts to absorb additional tariffs have partly shielded shipments.
The United States imposed 25% tariffs on automobiles and auto parts in April and threatened 25% levies on most of Japan's other goods. It later struck a trade deal on July 23 that lowered tariffs to 15% in exchange for a U.S.-bound $550 billion Japanese investment package.
The agreed tariff rate on automobiles, Japan's largest export sector, is still far higher than the original 2.5%, exerting pressure on major automakers and parts suppliers.
Exports to other regions were also weak. Those to China were down 3.5%, the data showed.
Total imports in July dropped 7.5% from a year earlier, compared with market forecasts for a 10.4% fall.
As a result, Japan ran a deficit of 117.5 billion yen ($795.4 million) in July, compared with a forecast of a 196.2 billion yen surplus.
The outcome follows unexpectedly strong growth in gross domestic product (GDP) in the April-June quarter, separate data showed last week, fuelled by surprisingly resilient exports and capital expenditure.
Economists said the strong exports growth in GDP data reflected differences in how the impact of price changes is factored in.
Nevertheless, Norinchukin's Minami said that the Japanese economy has so far avoided the worst.
""As the tariff deal has at least reduced uncertainties, the Bank of Japan is likely to resume rate hikes as early as in October,"" he said.",3b0c345c6e232114cd50704e09a7c57f,trafilatura

A broad rally in cryptocurrencies drove Bitcoin to a record on Aug. 14, while pushing Ether to within touching distance of its own all-time high. That momentum — fed by an array of corporate crypto accumulators built in the mold of Michael Saylor’s Strategy — now appears to be dwindling.
Options activity shows traders turning defensive. The put-to-call ratio for Aug. 22 contracts jumped to 1.33 on Deribit, the derivatives exchange, with $3.8 billion in Bitcoin options expiring. The largest open interest is in $110,000 puts, signaling concern over a near-term pullback as traders seek downside protection. Put options offer downside insurance by giving contract holders the right to sell at a certain price.
“What the put-call ratio tells you is that, given high expectation of rate cuts in Sept., the market is more sensitive to the risk of Powell sounding hawkish than dovish,” said Peter Chung, head of research at Presto. “The market gyrations over the last few days is the result of investors positioning themselves for an uncertain outcome of the speech.”
Bitcoin fell 1.1% to around $113,100 as of 7:55 a.m. in New York, extending its retreat to 9% from its record of $124,514. Ether, the second-largest token, slid 1.7% to $4,280.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell’s cautious approach to rate cuts. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently said he expects Trump to announce Powell’s replacement by year-end, making Friday’s Jackson Hole address likely his last as Fed chair.
Minutes from the Fed’s last policy meeting, released yesterday, underscored that officials still see inflation risks as outweighing employment concerns, even as new tariffs are expected to take time to feed into the economy. That backdrop has reinforced bets that Powell’s tone could temper hopes for aggressive easing.
“The FOMC meeting minutes released overnight indicated that the impact of new tariffs is expected to take time to materialise. Additionally, a majority of members viewed inflation risks as outweighing employment risks, signalling a continued cautious stance on rate cuts,” said Tony Sycamore, analyst at IG Australia Pty.",891c797453372950b4e0a0791d36f982,trafilatura

It offers wireless, broadband, and other communication services to individuals, businesses, and the government. The wireless giant has a high dividend yield of 6.1%, a ,long dividend history, and a clearer picture of cash generation now that the 5G buildout is maturing.
At the same time, the company operates in a saturated U.S. wireless market where adding phone subscribers has become increasingly difficult. As a result, the question arises: Is Verizon stock still a buy for income investors in 2025?
Valued at $183.4 billion, VZ stock has gained 10.8% year-to-date, slightly beating the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) gain of 9.7%.
Dividend Stability: The Key Metric for Income Investors
Aside from a high yield, the most appealing feature of a good dividend stock is its consistent dividend payments and growth.

One pundit tracking the stock became less bullish on its future.
-
He knocked down his price target by 37%.
What the stock analysis community giveth, it can also taketh away.
That was the dynamic behind the slide of UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) stock on Tuesday. As in the previous trading session, the big insurer was affected by an analyst's price target move. This time, however, this took the form of a cut rather than a raise. UnitedHealth closed the day down by 1.5% in value, a worse showing than the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 0.6% decrease.
A chop from a bull
The analyst behind the slice was Lance Wilkes from Bernstein SocGen Group. Well before the market open Tuesday, Wilkes took a powerful weed whacker to his UnitedHealth fair value assessment, reducing it to $377 per share; formerly, he believed it was worth as much as $594. Despite the rather drastic adjustment, he maintained his recommendation of outperform (buy, in other words).
According to reports, Wilkes wrote in his UnitedHealth update that he expects the company's performance to remain weak through this year, and has commensurately reduced his earnings estimate and target P/E. For the former, he cut his per-share profitability for full-year 2026 by 13%, and for the latter to 12.5 from the preceding 18.
The analyst also cited sluggish growth in the insurer's key OptumHealth unit as a reason for his price target cut.
Warren likes it
UnitedHealth has landed on many an investor's radar following news last week that Berkshire Hathaway had plonked down $1.6 billion for a stake in the company. Anytime Warren Buffett's investment vehicle buys (or sells, for that matter) a pack of stock for its equity portfolio, the target company becomes a lightning rod for investors.
Buffett and Berkshire surely see a company that has potential to reach. Others might consider it something of a clunky underperformer that's fairly -- or even overly -- valued these days.

Bitcoin dropped 3.2% in the past 24 hours to slip below $114,000, while ether fell 5.3% to under $4,200. XRP tumbled 6.2%, Cardano's ADA slid 8% and the broader crypto market was down 3.2%.
Shares of crypto-related companies, such as bitcoin miners, crypto exchanges and digital asset treasury firms, suffered even bigger losses, with MARA, COIN and MSTR closing today's regular session down 5.7%, 5.8% and 7.4%, respectively.
By contrast, in general, U.S. equities suffered less: the Dow ended flat, the S&P 500 fell 0.59%, and the Nasdaq slid about 1.5%. The disparity underscores how digital assets, which rely heavily on cheap liquidity, are more exposed to shifts in rate expectations than traditional stocks.
Investors now face a pivotal macro catalyst-heavy week.
On Aug. 20 at 2 p.m. ET, the Fed will release minutes from the FOMC meeting held July 29–30, offering insight into policymakers’ tariff and inflation debates. From Aug. 21–23, central bankers gather for the Jackson Hole symposium, with Powell’s keynote set for Aug. 22 at 10 a.m. ET. Together, the minutes and Powell’s speech could define market expectations for the September policy meeting.
Here are some top macro highlights traders will likely watch this week to gauge how the Fed will react during next month's meeting.
Tariffs’ delayed bite
Many companies have absorbed tariff costs to protect market share, but analysts warn they cannot do so indefinitely. Once passed on to consumers, these costs could drive prices higher and force the Fed to wait before cutting.
Sticky inflation data
Despite some cooling, inflation gauges remain elevated. The producer price index, a key wholesale measure, has been hotter than forecast, suggesting persistent pressures that complicate any case for aggressive easing.
Corporate limits
U.S. executives have signaled they will eventually be forced to shift tariff costs downstream. If that happens, consumer inflation could accelerate in the coming months, making a September cut seem premature.
Mixed economic signals
The U.S. economy shows both slowing job growth and resilient consumer demand. This uneven picture could encourage Powell to argue for patience until the Fed has clearer evidence that growth can withstand tariff-driven costs.
Policy uncertainty
Tariffs intersect with fiscal and trade policies in unpredictable ways. That complexity increases the risk of missteps, making a hawkish tone at Jackson Hole more likely.",f898523f8b0beff5ddeb9a3395847f4b,trafilatura

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said energy firms pulled 6.0 million barrels of crude from inventories during the week ended August 15. [EIA/S] [API/S]
That was bigger than the draw of 1.8 million barrels forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll and the decline of 2.4 million barrels that market sources said the American Petroleum Institute trade group cited in its figures on Tuesday.
""We had a decent-sized crude drawdown. We saw a rebound in exports ... That and the strong refinery demand really makes this a bullish report,"" said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital.
On Tuesday, crude prices fell more than 1% - with WTI closing at its lowest level since May 30 - on optimism that an agreement to end the Russia-Ukraine war seemed closer.
""Much of the choppy price action has been driven by daily updates to the Ukraine/Russian negotiations that have gone back and forth from bearish to bullish as far as the impact on future oil balances is concerned,"" analysts at energy advisory firm Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note.
U.S. President Donald Trump conceded that Russian President Vladimir Putin might not want to make a deal.
Russia was the second-biggest producer of crude in 2024 behind the U.S., so any agreement that could ease sanctions on Moscow should boost the amount of Russian oil available for export to global markets.
On Tuesday, Trump said he had ruled out putting U.S. troops on the ground in Ukraine, but said the U.S. might provide air support as part of a deal to end Russia's war in the country.
On Wednesday, Russia said attempts to resolve security issues relating to Ukraine without Moscow's participation were a ""road to nowhere"", sounding a warning to the West as it scrambles to work out guarantees for Kyiv's future protection.
Russia said it expects to continue supplying oil to India despite warnings from the U.S., Russian embassy officials in New Delhi said on Wednesday, adding that Moscow hopes trilateral talks will soon take place with India and China.
Trump has announced an additional tariff of 25% on Indian goods exported to the U.S. from August 27, as a punishment for buying Russian oil.",a66f7662ccdc192849ae062837b7a1b6,trafilatura

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand's central bank cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to a three-year low of 3.00% on Wednesday, and flagged further reductions in coming months as policymakers warned of domestic and global headwinds to growth.
The central bank's dovish tone caught markets offguard and sent the New Zealand dollar tumbling 1.2% to a 4-month low at $0.5817, while two-year swap rates slumped as deep as 2.93% -- their lowest level since early 2022.
The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said the economy had stalled in the second quarter, and lowered its projected floor for the cash rate to 2.55%, from 2.85% forecast in May. Two members of the six-strong policy committee even voted to cut by 50 basis points on Wednesday.
Addressing a press conference, RBNZ Governor Christian Hawkesby said the outlook is data-dependent, though he added that if businesses and consumers remain cautious ""and need more support that might be something that prompts more action.""
The quarter point cut in the official cash rate was in line with a large majority of economists in a Reuters poll, but the central bank's broadly bearish tone around economic risks and rates jolted markets.
""The fact that members gave serious consideration to an outsized 50bp cut is quite telling,"" said Abhijit Surya, a senior APAC economist at Capital economics.
The central bank has slashed rates by 250 basis points since August 2024 to underpin a fragile recovery, though it said ""consumption and investment demand appear to have weakened in the second quarter of 2025, partly in response to heightened trade policy uncertainty"" after a shakeup in U.S. tariff policy in April this year.
The RBNZ forecast in its Monetary Policy Statement that the cash rate will be at 2.71% in the fourth quarter, below a forecast of 2.92% in May. In the first quarter of 2026 it expects it to average 2.55%, from the previously forecast 2.85%.
""It is possible that pessimistic sentiment, together with the initial negative effects of the global tariff shock, have dampened the effects of the reduction in the OCR since last August,"" RBNZ said in its meeting minutes.
TWO MORE RATE CUTS?
Markets quickly moved to narrow the odds on two more cuts, implying a 50% chance of a move in October and over 100% for November.
The bottom is now implied around 2.57%, compared to 2.76% before the RBNZ announcement.
Ten of 12 economists are picking the cash rate to bottom at 2.5%, compared with 2.75% in a broader pre-RBNZ poll last week.
Bank of New Zealand head of research Stephen Toplis said that given the central bank's dovish tone, the BNZ is now forecasting 25-basis-point cuts in both October and November.",1b31f3169b33464c73948986e51ca47d,trafilatura

Earlier on July 7, the US FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Lexeo Therapeutics for its investigational drug, LX2006, which is a gene therapy for Friedreich ataxia/FA.
The designation was based on interim clinical data from two ongoing trials—the Lexeo-sponsored SUNRISE-FA Phase 1/2 trial and the Weill Cornell Medicine investigator-initiated Phase 1A trial. To date, 17 participants have been treated across both studies. The interim data showed that LX2006 was associated with clinically meaningful improvements in cardiac biomarkers and cardiac and neurologic functional measures.

In all participants with available cardiac biopsies, an increase in frataxin expression was observed three months after treatment. This is particularly significant as cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in FA, with cardiac dysfunction accounting for the cause of death in approximately two-thirds of patients.

Bullish, the global digital asset platform behind the BLSH stock ticker, has completed a landmark IPO, becoming the first U.S. public company to settle the majority of its offering proceeds in stablecoins.
The offering, which took place on August 14, raised $1.15 billion — a significant sum for a company bridging traditional finance and the digital asset economy. But what truly set the listing apart was its structure: proceeds were settled using a basket of stablecoins including USDC, EURC, PayPal USD (PYUSD), Ripple USD (RLUSD), and others, all held in custody by Coinbase.
Bullish operates a regulated spot and derivatives exchange, offering deep liquidity powered by a combination of automated market making and traditional central order book systems. The company has been pushing boundaries in market infrastructure, and this IPO structure marks a new chapter in crypto-capital markets.
Jefferies served as the settlement agent for the offering, which utilized the Solana blockchain to mint and record the tokens. According to Bullish, the approach significantly reduced settlement times, improved transparency, and allowed global capital access to the deal.
Bullish leans into stablecoin infrastructure
The company says its use of stablecoins in the IPO was not simply a gimmick but a meaningful statement on the future of financial infrastructure.
""We view stablecoins as one of the most transformative and widespread use cases for digital assets,” said Bullish CFO David Bonanno. He added that the firm already uses stablecoins to power fast, secure international transfers, and hopes the IPO structure will create a broader blueprint for others in the space.
Related: What is Crypto? Cryptocurrency explained
The company’s move aligns with rising institutional interest in blockchain-native capital markets. Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation, called the IPO a turning point: “Internet Capital Markets enable capital to move faster, with greater transparency, and in a globally accessible manner.""
Greg Tusar, VP of Institutional Products at Coinbase, noted that the GENIUS Act, which provides regulatory clarity for stablecoins, had laid the groundwork for such innovation. “The rulebook has changed — and companies like Bullish are showing us what the new normal can look like.”
Bullish shares dip
The majority of tokens were minted on the Solana network, with Jefferies acting as agent with respect to billing and delivery, as per the press release.
On August 20, BLSH shares declined more than 6% to $59.51 — down from their IPO price of $61.56. The stock dipped as low as $57.92 during intraday trading before recovering slightly.",d58e0ce8f78dd0348578f83d940de17a,trafilatura

Consider these situations where Ramsey’s podcast callers should be thriving, but debt is holding them back.
More Than $1 Million in Debt
“Dave Ramsey Show” caller Ryan confessed to having roughly $181,000 in debt, including credit cards, personal loans, student loans, and a car loan, as well as a mortgage on a $767,000 house.
Prior to being out of work for 18 months with a workers’ compensation claim, Ryan was making as much as $220,000 per year. Even so, he’s failed to pay down more than a few thousand in debt. Ryan wanted to consolidate his debt, but his credit score wouldn’t allow it. He asked Ramsey for a solution.
“You’ve given your life away and the way you get it back is you’re gonna have to give up some stuff,” Ramsey said. “Sell your car, sell your stupid house. Get you another one later, when you get your act together.”

The caller argued that his credit wasn’t good enough to buy another home. Ramsey suggested the caller put $140,000 per year toward debt to get out of his current situation.
“But you don’t want any pain, you don’t want to sacrifice,” he said.
Ramsey takes paying down debt seriously and doesn’t take excuses from callers.
Student Loan Debt and Young Egos
James, another caller on “The Dave Ramsey Show,” confessed to having more than $750,000 in debt, including student loans and a $350,000 mortgage, which is held by a family member.
The caller is in law school, poised to take the bar exam, while his fiancé has two years left of medical school and another two years of residency. When she completes her residency, the couple should have a combined annual income of roughly $550,000.
But even with this massive income potential, right now they are essentially broke college students. And Ramsey suggested they start living as such.
“You can’t have a house right now. You have no income,” Ramsey said, after James confessed to two big financial mistakes.
First, James has been living off his student loan money. And he and his fiancé have been living in the house with a deferred mortgage provided by a family member.
“I have not collected any interest nor have I made any payments on the property,” James said.
“Whoever your relative is has helped you step into a bear trap, and bear traps take your leg off,” Ramsey said, reiterating that James should sell the house.",c131cbd1ceb927d854eba35280959d22,trafilatura

NEW YORK (Reuters) -S&P Global Ratings' decision to affirm its U.S. credit rating factored in tariff revenues, but questions remain on the economic outcome of U.S. trade policies that could influence the country's rating in the next few years, the primary analyst on the U.S. said.
S&P on Monday affirmed its ""AA+"" credit rating for the world's number one economy, saying the revenue from President Donald Trump's tariffs had the potential to offset the fiscal hit from his massive tax-cut and spending bill. S&P, which became the first ratings agency to cut the pristine U.S. government rating in 2011, said the outlook on the U.S. rating remains stable.
Lisa Schineller, primary U.S. analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said execution and effects of trade and budget policies will be decisive for future ratings.
""The outcomes of how you execute the budgetary legislation, how the tariff revenue comes, their combined impact on growth and investment that leads to either better or worse or similar fiscal out-turns, that's our focus,"" she told Reuters in an interview.
Nonpartisan analysts have said that the bill Trump signed into law last month could add $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade. Republicans have argued that extending and adding to tax cuts implemented during Trump's first term in 2017 and meant to expire in 2025, will not drive the debt higher.
Schineller said S&P's forecast horizon when assessing the U.S. creditworthiness was about three, four years.
While she did not expect the tax and spending bill as such to lower the U.S. budget deficit, she said tariff revenues expected over that horizon would offset - to a certain extent - the deficit-widening impact of the budget legislation.
""It is a potentially important offset,"" Schineller said.
The Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center, estimates the average effective tariff rate has shot up to 18.6% now from 2.4% in early January.
""It's that large of a change that we feel that will bring in important revenue,"" said Schineller.
The U.S. reported a $21 billion jump in customs duty collections from tariffs in July, but the government budget deficit still grew nearly 20% during that month to $291 billion. The U.S. national debt surged above a record $37 trillion last week.
Ratings agency Moody's in May downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit by one notch, citing rising debt levels and stripping the country of its last triple-A top rating.
That followed a 2023 downgrade by rival Fitch, which pointed to expected fiscal deterioration and repeated down-to-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations.",0bafe17c26e72e0c9f3ec046a3d38682,trafilatura

Second quarter earnings season is coming to a close, and with nearly all of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.
As of Aug. 29, 98% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts now expect S&P 500 companies to report an 11.9% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.
Companies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.
This week, reports are rolling in from Zscaler (ZS), NIO (NIO), Salesforce (CRM), Figma (FIG), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), The Campbell's Company (CPB), Macy's (M), C3.ai (AI), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Broadcom (AVGO), Copart (CPRT), lululemon (LULU), DocuSign (DOCU), and ABM Industries (ABM).
Meanwhile, investors will continue to mull over recent reports, particularly Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, which highlighted last week.
Other companies reported too, including PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M. Smucker (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), and Gap (GAP).
Here are the latest updates from corporate America.
LIVE 325 updatesSalesforce stock falls in tepid reaction to earnings beat
Salesforce (CRM) stock fell as much as 5% after hours after the company reported results in line or slightly better than estimates that failed to wow investors looking for big AI gains.
For the quarter, Wall Street was looking for Salesforce's artificial intelligence efforts to show broader adoption — and monetization. Year to date, the stock has underperformed with a 23% loss.
Salesforce did beat Wall Street estimates and show steady growth: Revenue climbed 9.7% year over year to $10.24 billion, slightly above analyst expectations for $10.13 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 were also above estimates for earnings of $2.78 per share.
For the 2026 fiscal year, Salesforce initiated revenue guidance of $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion and raised the low end of its full-year revenue guidance, which now stands in a range of $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion. Both of those outlooks represent single-digit growth, which lags in comparison to other large-cap tech and AI players.
“It’s not bad — no one is going to say these are bad numbers,” Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance in reaction to the results. “We’re just playing a relative game, where everyone else on a relative basis is way better.”
The cloud software provider also announced a $20 billion increase to its existing share buyback program, bringing the total to $50 billion.

The Silicon Valley startup announced Thursday that several investors, including existing backer Baillie Gifford, added another $97 million to its Series E round. New investors include Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, Nvidia, and Pledge Ventures. Uber, which last month said it would make a “multi-hundred-million dollar” investment in Nuro as part of a broader deal with the electric car maker Lucid, also participated.
Nvidia’s investment follows years of technical collaboration with Nuro. The startup uses Nvidia GPUs for its large-scale data processing and model training, and its latest compute model is built on the Nvidia Drive AGX Thor platform.
The first $106 million tranche of Series E funding was announced in April. Investment accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Tiger Global Management, Greylock Partners, and XN participated in that first block.
Nuro has raised $2.3 billion to date. Its Series E post-money valuation is $6 billion. That’s a 30% drop from its $8.6 billion valuation in 2021 when Nuro raised $600 million in a Series D round.
Much has changed in the past four years for Nuro and the broader autonomous vehicle industry. Like most startups in the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector, Nuro was forced to examine its business model after economic conditions shut off the once-free-flowing tap of capital and ushered in a period of consolidation.
Nuro went through several rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023 before overhauling its business strategy. In 2024, Nuro scrapped plans to own and operate a fleet of low-speed, on-road delivery bots, and instead focused its efforts on licensing its technology to automakers and mobility providers, like ride-hail and delivery companies.
The pivot has appeared to gain some traction — notably in July when Uber announced plans to launch a robotaxi service using all-electric Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro’s self-driving tech. Under the deal, Uber invested $300 million in Lucid and agreed to buy “at least” 20,000 of the EV maker’s Gravity SUVs over the next six years.
Uber also said it would invest an undisclosed “multi-hundred-million dollar” amount into Nuro. One source familiar with the agreement told TechCrunch the amount is more than Uber’s investment in Lucid.
A portion of Uber’s investment has gone toward the Series E round. The remaining investment will be parceled out to Nuro as the company hits certain milestones.",47aba2e5a4c9689e6ff77b9ea5947a13,trafilatura

The companies set up McCormick de Mexico in 1947. Today (21 August), Cholula sauces owner McCormick said it had struck a deal to take its stake in the venture from 50% to 75%.
Brendan Foley, McCormick’s chairman, president and CEO, said the company has had “a long and successful partnership with Grupo Herdez and we look forward to continuing our collaboration”.
He added: “This marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for McCormick in Mexico. With this expanded ownership, we will advance our global flavour leadership and increase our presence in condiments and sauces.”
McCormick said the venture’s annual net sales are around $810m, excluding exports. The business’ products centre on mayo, including McCormick Mayonesa con Jugo de Limones, and it markets other McCormick-branded lines.
The company sees the venture’s sales growing “in the mid-single-digits range” and believes having majority ownership will give the group opportunities to expand further in the “high growth emerging market” of Mexico. McCormick already has a factory in Cuautitlán de Romero Rubio, north of Mexico City.
“Additionally, this transaction creates a strategic platform for scaling our operations and distribution across Latin America,” Foley said.
McCormick sees Latin America as one of the company’s “growth accelerators” and told shareholders at last year’s annual investor day the region was a “large, growing and resilient market” where it planned to “build further scale”.
Publicly listed Mexican group Grupo Herdez said it will support McCormick with sales and distribution.
In a separate statement, Grupo Herdez said the sale of a chunk of its shares in McCormick de Mexico would help the company “pursue other strategic opportunities, while continuing its portfolio reconfiguration”.
Chairman and CEO Héctor Hernández-Pons Torres added: “This transaction will allow Grupo Herdez to continue participating in future growth opportunities while preserving our scale and depth in the Mexican market.”

-
Coty reported an unexpected quarterly loss, which it blamed on retailers being ""cautious.""
-
Like-for-like sales dropped 9% year-over-year.
-
Coty said it expects like-for-like sales to fall in both the current and following quarter before returning to positive territory in the second half of the fiscal year.
Shares of Coty (COTY) plunged nearly 22% Thursday, a day after the cosmetics maker posted a surprise loss and gave weak guidance as retailers pulled back on orders.
The company behind its namesake brand, CoverGirl, Max Factor, and many others reported a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders of $72.1 million and an adjusted decline of $0.05 per share. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for net income of $37.6 million, and an adjusted profit of $0.01 per share. Revenue fell 8% year-over-year to $1.25 billion, but that was better than forecasts. Like-for-like sales dropped 9%.
CEO Sue Nabi said that during the fiscal year, retailers were ""acting with caution in the current environment."" Nabi noted along with retailer restocking, Coty's results were hurt by ""softness"" in U.S. demand, pressure in the mass cosmetics market, and slower fragrance sales after a strong fiscal 2024.
Looking ahead, the company said ""broader macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty is fueling cautious retailer ordering and a more promotional competitive environment."" It sees current quarter like-for-like sales sinking 6% to 8%, and second quarter like-for-like sales down 3% to 5%. The company added that it anticipates those sales will return to positive gains in the second half of the fiscal year.
With Thursday's losses, shares of Coty have lost nearly half their value this year.

While we understand the short-term concerns weighing on the sector, our interest remains on the long-term economics and valuations of our individual portfolio companies. Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, has a history of successfully navigating market volatility and delivering on its free cash flow and profit margin growth objectives from a combination of activity growth and pricing gains. As Schlumberger’s shares have been out of favor for the better part of the past two years, the stock now sells cheaply at just 12X trailing one year earnings compared to its five-year average of 22X.""

-
Coty reported an unexpected quarterly loss, which it blamed on retailers being ""cautious.""
-
Like-for-like sales dropped 9% year-over-year.
-
Coty said it expects like-for-like sales to fall in both the current and following quarter before returning to positive territory in the second half of the fiscal year.
Shares of Coty (COTY) plunged nearly 22% Thursday, a day after the cosmetics maker posted a surprise loss and gave weak guidance as retailers pulled back on orders.
The company behind its namesake brand, CoverGirl, Max Factor, and many others reported a fiscal fourth-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders of $72.1 million and an adjusted decline of $0.05 per share. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for net income of $37.6 million, and an adjusted profit of $0.01 per share. Revenue fell 8% year-over-year to $1.25 billion, but that was better than forecasts. Like-for-like sales dropped 9%.
CEO Sue Nabi said that during the fiscal year, retailers were ""acting with caution in the current environment."" Nabi noted along with retailer restocking, Coty's results were hurt by ""softness"" in U.S. demand, pressure in the mass cosmetics market, and slower fragrance sales after a strong fiscal 2024.
Looking ahead, the company said ""broader macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty is fueling cautious retailer ordering and a more promotional competitive environment."" It sees current quarter like-for-like sales sinking 6% to 8%, and second quarter like-for-like sales down 3% to 5%. The company added that it anticipates those sales will return to positive gains in the second half of the fiscal year.
With Thursday's losses, shares of Coty have lost nearly half their value this year.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) -Chilean lithium producer SQM expects prices and sales volumes to rise in the third quarter, executives said on Wednesday, after the miner missed estimates for second-quarter net profit.
The world's second-largest lithium producer reported a 59% decline in quarterly profit, with lithium prices down around a third year-on-year.
Net profit of $88.4 million missed analysts' estimates of $143.01 million, according to data compiled by LSEG, while revenue of $1.04 billion was broadly in line with the estimate of $1.064 billion.
Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos in a statement said lithium prices had in some cases hit the lower limits of sales contracts, affecting agreed volumes.
Executives on a call with analysts declined to give further details about how the company had adjusted contracts, citing confidentiality.
They predicted an uptick in sales volumes of at least 10% in the third quarter from the second quarter, and pointed to potential supply reductions in China as a good sign for prices.
""We expect that with the recent price recovery in China, our sales price in Q3 should be higher than in Q2,"" said Felipe Smith, SQM's commercial vice president for lithium.
He noted that Asia prices outside of China have also been strengthening, although more slowly.
Global prices for lithium, a critical component of electric vehicle batteries, have plunged nearly 90% from a late-2022 peak, leading producers to slash workforces and pull back on plans.
SQM began laying off 5% of its Chilean workforce in June, and Moody's last month lowered the miner's outlook to ""negative"" due to lithium revenue uncertainty.
SQM also makes fertilizers and industrial chemicals on Chile's Atacama salt flat, one of the highest concentration lithium deposits in the world.
The company said it is on track to finalize a partnership with Chilean state-run copper miner Codelco as soon as September or October. The deal still requires approval from regulators in China, after other countries signed off.
SQM also said it expects approval for a major revamp of its lithium operations in the first half of 2030 as it works to submit an environmental impact report to authorities next year.

The order is valued at approximately Skr450m and includes loaders, trucks and drills, alongside digital monitoring solutions such as a remote monitoring service.
Deliveries are scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2025 (Q3 2025) and extend through Q2 2026.
In June, JCHX Mining Management secured a five-year contract for underground mining operations at KCM.
KCM is undergoing expansion within Botswana's Kalahari Copper Belt, a region noted for its mining prospects.
MMG announced its acquisition of Khoemacau in November 2023, finalising the transaction by March 2024.
The mine, which completed construction of its low-cost operations in June 2021, reached full production by Q4 2022. Khoemacau's annual output is projected at between 43,000 and 53,000 tonnes (t) of copper in concentrate.
The mining process at Khoemacau involves underground extraction using the longhole stoping method. The ore is transported to the Boseto processing plant via a 35km purpose-built haul road. The resulting copper concentrate is then shipped to international customers.
Further studies and drilling for the mine's expansion project indicate a potential production increase to more than 130,000t per annum of copper and five million ounces per annum of silver, leveraging its strategic position in the emerging Kalahari Copper Belt.
Khoemacau employs approximately 1,800 individuals, with 95% of its workforce being local residents of Botswana. The mine has an estimated operational lifespan of more than 20 years.

Narrowing the focus, INTU has also trailed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV), which has gained about 22.7% over the past year. However, INTU’s gains on a YTD basis outshine the ETF’s 6.2% returns over the same time frame.
On July 23, Intuit shares rose 1.2% after the company rolled out new agentic AI capabilities for its Enterprise Suite. The update introduced four AI agents designed to automate functions such as cash flow forecasting and invoice reminders. Built on its GenOS platform, these enhancements are designed for mid-market businesses, aiming to improve productivity and capture a larger share of the $89 billion ERP market.
For the current fiscal year, ending in July, analysts expect INTU’s EPS to grow 26.8% to $14.72 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.
Among the 30 analysts covering INTU stock, the consensus is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on 23 “Strong Buy” ratings, three “Moderate Buy,” three “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.”
This configuration has been consistent over the past months.
On Aug. 15, Citigroup analyst Steven Enders reaffirmed a “Buy” rating on Intuit and raised the price target from $789 to $815, a 3.3% increase, signaling sustained confidence in the company’s market performance.
The mean price target of $817.96 represents a 17% premium to INTU’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $1000 suggests an upside potential of 43%.

S&P Global's flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, increased to 55.4 this month, the highest level since December, from 55.1 in July. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the private sector.
“A strong flash PMI reading for August adds to signs that US businesses have enjoyed a strong third quarter so far,"" Chris Williamson, chief business economist for S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a statement. ""The data are consistent with the economy expanding at a 2.5% annualized rate, up from the average 1.3% expansion seen over the first two quarters of the year.""
The improvement came largely from the manufacturing sector, where the flash PMI surged to 53.3 - the highest since May 2022 - from 49.8 in July and defying economists' expectations for a second month of contraction.
Manufacturing received a bump from new order activity at the highest since February 2024.
The services sector, meanwhile, eased back to 55.4 from 55.7 in July. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the services PMI slipping to 54.2.
The survey's measure of prices paid by businesses for inputs edged up to a three-month high of 62.3 from 61.3 last month, with both the services and manufacturing sectors reporting higher costs and companies citing President Donald Trump's tariffs as the key driver behind the increase.
""Companies across both manufacturing and service sectors collectively reported the steepest rise in input prices since May and the second-largest increase since January 2023,"" the report said. ""Rates of increase accelerated in both sectors.""
The survey's measure of prices charged by businesses for goods and services rose to a three-year high of 59.3 in an indication that companies are increasingly passing along the costs from higher tariffs to consumers.
Employment also improved, the survey showed. The composite employment index for both manufacturing and services rose to 52.8, the highest since January, from 51.5 in July.

Existing home sales rose 2% last month from June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.
Sales edged up 0.8% compared with July last year. The latest sales figure topped the 3.92 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.
Home prices rose on an annual basis for the 25th consecutive month, although the rate of growth continued to slow. The national median sales price inched up just 0.2% in July from a year earlier to $422,400.
That was the smallest annual increase since June 2023. Even so, the median home sales price last month is the highest for any previous July, based on data going back to 1999.
“The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices.”
The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.
This year’s spring homebuying season, which is traditionally the busiest period of the year for the housing market, was a bust as stubbornly high mortgage rates put off many prospective homebuyers. Affordability remains a dauting challenge for most aspiring homeowners following years of skyrocketing home prices.
First-time homebuyers, who don’t have home equity gains to put toward a new home purchase, accounted for 28% of homes sales last month, down from 30% in June, NAR said. Historically, they made up 40% of home sales.
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained elevated this year, although it has been at a nearly 10-month low of 6.58% the last two weeks.
Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in May and June, when the average rate ranged from 6.76% to 6.89%. Mortgage rates eased in July, dropping briefly to 6.67%.
As home sales have slowed, the number of unsold homes on the market has been rising.
There were 1.55 million unsold homes at the end of last month, up 0.6% from June and 15.7% from July last year, NAR said. That’s the most homes on the market since May 2020, early on in the COVID-19 pandemic.
Still, the inventory remains well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic.",d7de2a2da35072cb46120848e5f60d23,trafilatura

Sell a chunk of your company to raise venture capital. Make sales. Raise more venture capital, and make more sales. Repeat until the company goes public, or gets acquired, hopefully for billions either way.
But what if you didn’t get on a fundraising treadmill after taking a first round? What if you structured your company to sprint to profitability through slower, sustainable growth, rather than the reverse — unprofitable growth — as so many VC-backed companies do?
That’s the question that Pukar Hamal, founder and CEO of SecurityPal AI, asked himself after raising a $21 million Series A round in 2021 and, a year later, almost running out of money. The round was led by David Sacks’ Craft Ventures, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz’s Martin Casado and Okta co-founder Frederic Kerrest.
“I started the company back in March of 2020. It’s my second company that I founded,” he said on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast this week.
His previous company, which sold via an acqui-hire, had raised its first capital before product-market fit, he said. That’s pretty common. Founders often raise before they’ve got a product that they know customers will pay well for.
In retrospect, Hamal described that decision as his big “mistake.”
So for SecurityPal, he did the reverse. He waited until the company hit $1 million ARR, which took about a year, and then did his first and only raise, the Series A.
SecurityPal uses AI to speed enterprise security due diligence, which occurs in every large enterprise transaction when signing new IT contracts. SecurityPal promises to shrink the security review from months to days or even hours, helping companies to save money on the process while closing deals faster. It has big-name customers like Airtable, Figma, LangChain, and Grammarly, among others.
But in 2022, he faced a crisis. Interest rates rose and crashed the venture capital market. Raising more funds would be tough. “We were burning a lot of capital,” he said. “We were, like, 14 months away from running out of money.”
It was a wake-up call. Hamal had to drastically cut expenses, which meant a big layoff. That was so painful, he said, that he vowed to do things differently. “We extended our runway, and we tried to drive the company towards cash flow break-even, cash flow positive profitability,” he said.
Although in 2025 VC money is flowing again, especially for AI startups, “we haven’t raised another round,” he said. The reason? He sees now that VC money comes with its own price tag.",690e0a5f461b6f7ad29f4626693d65ef,trafilatura

It sounds daunting, even overwhelming, to consider the total cost of healthcare in retirement. Research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that a 65-year-old couple retiring today may need as much as $351,000 to have a 90% chance of covering their medical expenses in retirement.
But according to Sudipto Banerjee, a global retirement strategist at T. Rowe Price, that widely cited figure is misleading and can create needless anxiety.
""My first point would be not to really focus on ... that one single number,"" Banerjee said in a recent Decoding Retirement podcast. ""It's basically what a couple will spend over 30 years. It's just the sum of that.""
For those approaching retirement, Banerjee explained that the more useful focus is cash flow — understanding your income, your expenses, and how much you'll spend on healthcare each year.
""Healthcare is not something where you retire one day, then you cut a check for $350,000 to someone and it's taken care of,"" he said. ""It doesn’t work like that. It's an ongoing process, and every year you have to make decisions.""
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Rather than obsessing over total lifetime costs, Banerjee recommended a practical two-bucket approach.
In the first bucket, plan for predictable premium costs, and build Medicare Part B, Part D, and supplemental insurance premiums into your regular cash flow. These costs are relatively stable and predictable, making them suitable for budgeting like any other fixed expense.
In the second bucket, maintain a separate cash reserve of $5,000 to $10,000 for deductibles, copays, and unexpected medical expenses. Replenish this fund annually as unpredictable out-of-pocket expenses come up.
""You have a very good idea how much you are going to need for your health insurance premiums, so you can basically build that into your cash flow,"" he said. ""The more trickier part is the out-of-pocket expenses, where you might not know exactly how much you'll need.""
This approach acknowledges that retirement healthcare isn't a single large bill, but a series of ongoing decisions and payments that can be managed systematically.
Another major driver of healthcare costs is Medicare coverage. The choice between traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and adding a Medigap policy can significantly affect both expenses and protection against unexpected bills.
""It's a really important decision,"" Banerjee said. ""When it comes to healthcare in retirement, the choice of plan — whether you go with traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, or add a Medigap policy — deserves a lot of attention.""
For those considering Medigap, Banerjee suggests starting with two questions: Can you afford it? And why do you want it?
""Medigap typically costs more — on average about $2,000 a year — so there's an affordability question,"" he said. ""If you can cover that extra cost comfortably, that's great.""
Banerjee added that many choose Medigap to limit out-of-pocket expenses, since traditional Medicare involves deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing. But Banerjee's research shows average annual out-of-pocket spending for Medigap enrollees is about the same as for those with other coverage — except at the high end of spending, where Medigap offers greater protection.
""People with Medigap tend to use more healthcare,"" he explained. ""They know they have that protection, so they consume more services."" His advice: If you expect Medigap to automatically lower your yearly out-of-pocket costs, understand that may not happen — higher utilization can offset the savings.
This decision is even more critical because switching from Medicare Advantage to traditional Medicare with Medigap later in retirement is ""virtually impossible"" if health issues arise.
Managing the tail risk of long-term care
Long-term care is another wildcard in retirement planning. Many fear they'll one day need nursing home care and won't know how to pay for it, whether through insurance, self-funding, home equity, Medicaid, or a combination of these.
""This is a classic example of what we call tail risk,"" Banerjee said. ""For most people, if you look at the average, people don't spend anything on long-term care out of pocket. But a very small percentage will spend a large amount. And this is sort of a classic case where you would think that it's ... a situation to be addressed by insurance because it's a tail risk.""
The problem, he said, is that ""the long-term care insurance market has not performed or functioned very well over the years ... the policies are very expensive. So people don't want to be spending so much on these policies and never needing the care.""
Financial circumstances often dictate the approach.
Those with lower incomes often use Medicaid as a fallback, while those with higher incomes are often able to self-fund their care. It's the middle market that must weigh protecting assets from Medicaid against paying for coverage they might never use.
And timing insurance coverage is critical. ""You don't want to be too late when you have health issues crop up and your premiums will really go up, and you don't want to get it too early when you are spending on premiums for a long period,"" Banerjee said. ""So I think somewhere between 55 and 65 is a good period to consider long-term care insurance.""
If you expect to stay at home for a while and then move into a continuing care facility, knowing that in advance can help you choose the right long-term care insurance.
Broad ""umbrella"" policies cover almost any living arrangement but cost more, he said. If you've already decided where you'll live, a more targeted policy may be cheaper.
Whatever you choose, compare costs, coverage limits, and benefits — and do your homework before buying.

Home sales rose 2.0% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units from 3.93 million in June, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales would be essentially unchanged from June at 3.92 million units. Sales edged up 0.8% on a year-over-year basis.
NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun saw the data as suggesting that some relief in the factors that have weighed on home sales - high borrowing costs and prices and limited inventory - may be in the offing. The sales pace over the last two years has averaged right around 4 million units a month, a weaker rate than seen even during the 2007-2009 recession that was triggered by a collapse in the housing market.
The average rate on a 30-year-fixed rate mortgage recently fell to the lowest level since last fall at 6.58%, according to data from Freddie Mac, but rates remain appreciably higher than they were coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
With the Federal Reserve widely expected to resume interest rate reductions next month, Yun said mortgage rates may have room to fall further in the months ahead.
“The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,” Yun said in a statement. “Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices. Condominium sales increased in the South region, where prices had been falling for the past year.”
Sales rose month-over-month in the Northeast, South and West but fell in the Midwest.
The median sales price rose 0.2% from a year earlier to $422,400 - the 25th straight year-over-year increase - but slipped from June's record-high level.
The year-over-year price increase was the smallest since June 2023, Yun said.
Total inventory also edged up to 1.55 million units. At the current sales pace, that inventory would last 4.6 months, down from 4.7 months in June.
The share of all-cash transactions was 31%, which Yun described as unusually high. Investors made up 20% of all transactions, up from 13% a year ago.
First-time buyers accounted for 28% of sales in July, down from 30% in June and 29% a year ago.
“Homebuyers are in the best position in more than five years to find the right home and negotiate for a better price. Current inventory is at its highest since May 2020, during the COVID lockdown,” Yun said.

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.
Top 5 Upgrades:
-
Morgan Stanley upgraded HP Enterprise (HPE) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $28, up from $22. The firm believes accretion from the Juniper acquisition and multiple upside is not being priced into the shares.

-
UBS upgraded iQiyi (IQ) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $3.32, up from $1.97. iQiyi's fundamentals could be bottoming out amid a more benign regulatory environment, the analyst tells investors in a research note.

He also detailed how the company’s integration of express and ground networks will change workflows and technology deployment.
FedEx (NYSE: FDX) has temporarily reassigned some experts from its U.S. ground parcel and freight units to Europe to help improve efficiency, Dietrich told investors at the Deutsche Bank Transport Conference.
“Route planning, package efficiency, condensing our stations, in-station efficiencies, all these things are being looked at and implemented. … I think we’re second to none in what we do here in the U.S. So we want to leverage that expertise and bring it to Europe,” he said.
FedEx last year merged divisions at the corporate level into FedEx Express, which makes it possible to share resources across the enterprise. Previously, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services were managed as separate entities.
FedEx has set a target of $1 billion as the next phase of its Drive cost-cutting campaign, after successfully eliminating $4 billion in costs the past two years. Reduced expenditures will be realized through consolidating facilities under the Network 2.0 strategy, as well as streamlining in Europe.
Management said on the June 25 earnings presentation that FedEx expects to take out $150 million in costs from the European business by June 2027, the end of the fiscal year, primarily through network and back-office restructuring. The company last year also announced plans to eliminate between 1,700 and 2,000 back office and commercial jobs in Europe.
The integrated parcel carrier has had difficulty fully integrating its European operation since acquiring TNT Express in 2016, which Dietrich partly attributed to the complexity of European labor regulations and other rules.
Streamlining the European organization has also taken longer than expected because of a major cyberattack on TNT in 2017, damage to one of its four main facilities and cultural resistance to changing the customer experience.
“It was harming us more than helping us in terms of bringing the networks together. Sometimes change is challenging,” said Dietrich, who joined FedEx two years ago after running all-cargo airline Atlas Air.
FedEx said in June that it has reduced the delivery cost per package for two consecutive years and is focused on improving vehicle and in-station productivity, offering new digital tools for customers and growing market share profitably in Europe.
U.S. realignment requires careful planning
Dietrich also provided insight about how FedEx is managing personnel, facilities and technology as it integrates FedEx Express and FedEx Ground into a unified system. Every facility converted to a common operation provides lessons for the next consolidation, he reiterated.
FedEx is deciding location-by-location whether independent contractors from the pre-existing Ground network or employee drivers will handle pickup and delivery of Federal Express packages.
“We have a team of people dedicating significant resources to doing debriefs and downloads — what went well, what did not go so well,” Dietrich said.
A key component of the effort is changing driver behavior in a way that treats workers fairly while without impacting service levels.
“Our couriers, who are used to day-definite [delivery] may have some time-definite requirements on them. And so we’re working together with them on how they can best manage and handle our priority products most efficiently. And there’s opportunities for them to make more money, too. We’ve been reconciling our compensation programs for our contractors and our couriers and so forth, to have the most positive outcome and deliver for our customers,” Dietrich said.
Among technologies FedEx is incorporating for optimizing efficient delivery routes and vehicle mix is a route planning tool from RouteSmart Technologies, which FedEx acquired in February after many years of collaboration, he added.
One of FedEx’s founding principles is that information about a shipment is as important as the shipment itself. As an integrated carrier, all the information about the customer, types of shipments, conveyance, en-route tracking, and billing are all housed under one roof.
FedEx earlier this year formed a data and technology team, which focuses on streamlining the technology used during the package delivery lifecycle; establishing global standards across pickup-and-delivery, linehaul, sort, and clearance operations; and improving digital products and experiences for internal use and customers.
“In this current environment, we’re just looking to take it to the next level. How can we leverage AI and technology not only to help our operations, but to monetize and unlock the value of the significant data that we collect on a daily basis” from 3 million customers and 17 million packages per day, said Dietrich.
FedEx Dataworks, an internal unit tasked with harnessing data to improve efficiency, is involved with some of the next-generation data analytics underway. Dataworks is implementing dynamic scheduling tools at many U.S. surface facilities to match sort staffing with volumes and is introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and proceed directly to vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity, FedEx said in its annual report published on Monday.
Dataworks is also enhancing facility productivity through use of machine learning and algorithms to develop more detailed and accurate volume forecasts.
FedEx is also testing autonomous, driverless technologies for handling large packages that don’t fit on conveyor systems, as well as robotic product sortation systems to sort small packages, according to the annual report.
The company last week named Vishal Talwar, an executive at Accenture Technology, as chief digital and information officer, and president of Dataworks.
Although Dataworks has helped FedEx enhance decisionmaking tools, it hasn’t accomplished its second mission of making money, said parcel industry consultant Satish Jindel in a commentary last week.",cf5d207dee9706fb0def04930ee80c08,trafilatura

Intel Corp. saw its share prices drop by 6.99 percent on Wednesday to finish at $23.54 apiece over concerns about the US government’s increasing interference in private companies.
This came after President Donald Trump announced that the US government was keen on supporting the beleaguered company with financial backing through the CHIPS Act funds, in exchange for a 10-percent stake in the company.

Commenting for the US government, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the equity funding was “not governance.”
“We’re just converting what was a grant under Biden into equity for the Trump administration, for the American people. Nonvoting,” he said.
The financial support followed a meeting between Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan and President Donald Trump earlier this month after the latter criticized the company’s chief for his nationality and alleged threats to national security.
According to Trump, his meeting with Tan turned out well, saying that he was inspired by his rising story.
In a bid to claw back to profitability, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) embarked on a corporate restructuring plan that included the reduction of a significant chunk of its workforce, exiting businesses, and selling stakes at a discount—the latest being a $2-billion share sale to Japan-based SoftBank.

This decision isn’t about politics – it’s about reality. California has created one of the most overregulated, expensive, and risky environments for businesses in America. It’s a system that makes it harder to employ people, harder to keep doors open, and harder to deliver value to customers. The result? Higher taxes, higher fees, higher wages that many businesses simply cannot sustain, and endless regulations that strangle growth. Even when the state announces a budget surplus, it’s built on the backs of ordinary citizens who are paying too much and businesses who are squeezed until they break. At Bed Bath & Beyond, our responsibility is to our customers and our shareholders. We will not participate in a system that undermines both. Instead, we are investing in a California strategy that works: 24-48-hour delivery, and in many cases, same-day service. Californians will continue to get the products they love through BedBathandBeyond.com – but without the inflated costs created by an unsustainable model. We’re taking a stand because it’s time for common sense. Businesses deserve the chance to succeed. Employees deserve jobs that last. And customers deserve fair prices.

LONDON (Reuters) -The BlackRock Investment Institute believes investors should bulk up their exposure to hedge funds, the company said on Thursday.
The research arm of the asset manager suggests investors dedicate up to 5% more of their portfolios from their current levels to hedge fund investments, the highest the institute has ever recommended.
Investors might take money from holdings in developed market government bonds and instead use this money for less risky hedge funds, it said in a note.
Allocators comfortable with a bit more risk could take money from the stocks portions of their portfolios and instead redirect that money at higher risk hedge funds.
The asset manager side of BlackRock, which also acts as a middleman for investors wanting to spend money on hedge funds, oversees $76 billion in hedge fund assets including direct hedge fund investments and hedge fund-related businesses, the company website says.
U.S. President Trump in August signed a White House order directing regulators to expand access to alternative investments to 401k retirement portfolios, like hedge funds, adding a new layer of risk open to ordinary investors.
BlackRock, which lobbied the Trump administration to expand asset options, plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets next year.
The broader hedge fund universe returned 1.1% in July and returns are up 5.2% so far in the year to July 31, figures from PivotalPath showed. Hedge funds are up roughly 8% over the past five years on an annualised basis.
The S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes have both risen roughly 9-10% this year.
JPMorgan's global government bond fund was up around 2% as of July 31, it says on the bank's website.

The funding will primarily support resource development, exploration activities, ongoing project studies, test work, development and permitting, and social and environmental activities at the Kokoseb gold project in Namibia.
Additionally, a portion of the capital will go towards Wia Gold's broader exploration portfolio. The funds will also cover corporate costs, working capital and the expenses associated with the placement.
The placement involved the issuance of 100 million new fully paid ordinary shares at an offer price of A$0.30 per share.
This price represents a 4.8% discount to the last traded price of A$0.315 on 15 August 2025 and a 2.1% discount to the ten-day volume-weighted average price of A$0.306 up to and including that date.
The new shares will rank equally with the company's existing fully paid ordinary shares.
Wia executive chairman Josef El-Raghy said: ""Wia has made significant progress at Kokoseb over the past 12 months, most recently with the mineral resource estimate upgrade to 2.93 million ounces of gold for 89 million tonnes at 1g/t [grams per tonne].
“The strong support for the placement received from both domestic and offshore institutional investors allows the company to continue with its strategy to expand the Kokoseb deposit via an accelerated exploration programme. The scoping study remains on track for completion in the current quarter with many of the elements of a subsequent definitive feasibility study already under way.”
Argonaut Securities acted as the lead manager and bookrunner for the placement, with Tamesis Partners and SCP Resource Finance serving as co-lead managers.
Following the completion of the placement, Wia Gold's cash balance will stand at approximately A$55m.

Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $4.27 for the quarter, an increase from $4.17 in the second quarter of 2024.
Comparable sales also saw a rise of 1.1%.
Lowe's chairman, president and CEO Marvin Ellison stated: ""This quarter, the company delivered positive comp sales driven by solid performance in both Pro and DIY. Despite challenging weather early in the quarter, our teams drove both sales growth and improved profitability.""
The company incurred $43m pre-tax expenses due to the acquisition of the Artisan Design Group (ADG), impacting second quarter diluted EPS by $0.06.
Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding the expenses, for the second quarter rose by 5.6% to $4.33, compared to the previous year.
For the full year 2025, Lowe's anticipates total sales between $84.5bn and $85.5bn, an increase from the previously forecasted $83.5bn to $84.5bn, while comparable sales are expected to range from flat to 1%.
The company projects an operating margin of between 12.1% and 12.2% and an adjusted operating margin between 12.2% and 12.3%.
Diluted EPS is forecasted to be between $12.10 and $12.35 and adjusted diluted EPS between $12.20 and $12.45.
In a strategic move, Lowe's has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Foundation Building Materials (FBM) for $8.8bn.
FBM is set to accelerate Lowe's Total Home strategy, enhancing offerings to Pro customers with expanded capabilities, faster fulfilment, improved digital tools, a robust trade credit platform and cross-selling opportunities.
This acquisition, combined with Lowe's existing services and the recent ADG purchase, aims to create a leading platform to serve the large Pro market, especially in planned spend.
The acquisition of FBM will be financed through a mix of short-term and long-term debt, with Lowe's intending to maintain its current credit ratings.
The transaction is expected to close in Q4 2025, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.
The acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to adjusted diluted EPS in the first full year post-close, excluding synergies.
Ellison added: ""With this acquisition, we are advancing our multi-year transformation of the Pro offering.

This recommendation comes in light of recent increases in Capital Gains Tax (CGT) rates applicable to shares in trading companies, with further tax rate hikes for Business Asset Disposal Relief (BADR) set to take effect next April.
Harris emphasised the importance of prompt action for company owners contemplating a sale, stating that they should “act immediately”.
She noted that there are “legitimate” strategies available to mitigate the impact of rising taxes.
Introduced in the 2008/09 tax year, Entrepreneurs’ Tax Relief aimed to incentivise the establishment of businesses in the UK by reducing the CGT rate on qualifying disposals.
Under this relief, qualifying individuals enjoyed a reduced CGT rate of 10% when selling shares in their personal trading companies, compared to the standard rates of 18% or the higher rate of 28%.
The scheme underwent significant changes in 2018, when it was renamed BADR. The conditions were tightened, and the lifetime allowance was reduced from £10m ($13.45m) to £1m.
Harris commented: “For many years there was a 10% effective rate of Capital Gains Tax that owner managers could benefit from on sale/retirement, but this ended on 5 April 2025, when the rate increased to 14% with the main rate of CGT having increased to 24% from 30 October 2024.
“However, from next April, the rate of tax where BADR applies will be 18%.
“In less than ten years the CGT payable on £2m of qualifying gains has more than doubled.
“We want to highlight this and get people thinking about their options well in advance of any sale.”
Harris indicated that those who are most likely to benefit from such advice include shareholders of trading companies planning to sell within the next one to five years, individuals with shareholdings exceeding £1m, or those who have more than they intend to spend in their lifetime, as well as people wishing to benefit family members from the sale proceeds.
She added: “Business Asset Disposal Relief has been a factor that has influenced how company ownership is structured. People have kept companies outside of a group structure so they can sell them separately, they have given 5% of the shares in their companies to spouses and, in some cases, other family members.
“People with valuable companies need to determine whether their company structure still works for them, given these changes, particularly if their shareholdings are worth more than £1m and more than they would want/need to spend.",7e8093e8fe13a724cc9d3b97a5dc9c4e,trafilatura

Public sector borrowing has climbed to £60bn since April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, which was £6.7bn more than at the same point in the last financial year.
The figure was in line with official forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Borrowing in the month of July was better than had been expected by economists at £1.1bn. It was the lowest figure for the month in three years following stronger self-assessed income tax receipts.
However, consultancy Capital Economics said the improvement in July’s borrowing figures was “not as good as it looks”,
UK economist Alex Kerr said: “Ultimately, today’s release does little to brighten the gloomy outlook ahead of the Budget later this year.”
Elliott Jordan-Doak of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the Chancellor will still have to raise taxes in October.
He said: “The big picture remains that the public finances are in chronically weak condition.
“The Chancellor faces surging gilt yields and a likely productivity downgrade from the OBR in the October forecast round.
“The litany of policy U-turns has only compounded the Government’s fiscal woes. We think the Chancellor will need to resort to ‘sin’ and ‘stealth’ tax hikes, duty increases, and a pensions tax raid in order to meet her fiscal rules if she wants to meet her pledge of keeping headline tax rates unchanged.”
Nabil Taleb, an economist at PwC UK, said Ms Reeves “remains under pressure as she tries to balance weak growth with the fiscal rules”.
“Higher debt servicing costs as a share of total revenues will leave the public finances more exposed to future economic shocks,” he warned.
Debt interest payments reached £7.1bn in July, which was £200m more than last year.

UK borrowing costs surge
The UK’s government borrowing costs remained the fastest-growing among the world’s major economies today after the latest figures on the public sector’s finances.
The yield on 10-year UK gilts – a benchmark for the cost of servicing the national debt – was up nearly six basis points to 4.73pc.
By contrast French and Italian 10-year bond yields were up around five basis points, with eurozone benchmark Germany up four points to 2.75pc.
It was the same story for Britain’s shorter-term two-year and longer 30-year bond yields amid concerns about Britain’s public finances and whether the Bank of England will cut interest rates again this year.

State of Britain’s public finances means writing is on the wall for tax rises
Rachel Reeves is on course to raise taxes by at least £20bn this autumn as surging borrowing costs and public sector pay make another Budget raid inevitable.
While borrowing in July came in below City forecasts, official data showed that on an annual basis, the deficit targeted by the Chancellor was almost £6bn higher than predicted by her budget watchdog.
The shortfall has partly been driven by weaker income tax receipts and higher government spending on salaries and benefits, following the Chancellor’s humiliating about-turn on welfare reform.

US stocks fall ahead of Powell speech
Wall Street’s main indexes opened lower as investors turned cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole Symposium.
Jerome Powell is on Friday due to give a speech at the three-day conference – his last as Fed chairman.
His comments will be closely watched for any signals that US interest rates will be cut next month, following pressure from Donald Trump.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 130.1 points, or 0.3pc, at the open to 44,808.21.
The S&P 500 dropped 14.9 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 6,380.83​ following a tech-led sell-off in recent days.

Retailers tell Reeves tax rises will hit cost of living
Major retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Boots have urged Rachel Reeves not to raise taxes on their sector in the autumn Budget as it could hit living standards.
Some of the county’s biggest chains have signed a letter to the Chancellor sent by trade body British Retail Consortium (BRC).
It warns that further tax rises on businesses could result in the Government breaking its manifesto pledge to provide “high living standards”.
“Labour’s manifesto made a clear and welcome promise to deliver good jobs and higher living standards but if future policy decisions lead to rising prices and fewer jobs, then those commitments are at risk,” the letter reads.
The UK bosses of Aldi, Lidl, B&Q, Currys, Burger King, Ikea, JD Sports, Boots, John Lewis and Primark were also among the signatories – the number of which the BRC is expecting to grow.
Many businesses have seen their labour costs rise thanks to the rate of employer National Insurance being increased in last year’s Budget.
Some retailers have blamed the tax hike for the decision to raise prices in shops, which they say has allowed them to partly mitigate the impact.
Others have resorted to cutting staff or freezing hiring, while some businesses said they were absorbing the higher costs into their profits.
But in the letter signed by more than 60 chief executives, it says: “As retailers, we have done everything we can to shield our customers from the worst inflationary pressures but as they persist, it is becoming more and more challenging for us to absorb the cost pressures we face.”

Rachel Reeves is preparing the ground for the extinction of the middle class
The pitch rolling has started. The propagandists have been unleashed. We are being softened-up for the ultimate betrayal, the most obscene of broken promises, the grossest attack on private wealth in living memory.
If you are a homeowner, I have grim news: Rachel Reeves has just declared war on you. You could pay even more tax, so much so that in some cases you may be forced to sell your house to pay the bill – and then to hand over yet more cash just to be allowed to say goodbye to your beloved family home.
Reeves is considering several options, all abhorrent: an annual proportional wealth tax on the value of homes, large enough to replace stamp duty, council tax and more; the imposition of capital gains tax (CGT) on primary residences for the first time ever, albeit just on more expensive ones at first; an “exit tax” as an alternative to CGT, payable on sale; and a revaluation of council tax, with even higher bands, including a mansion tax.

Morgan Stanley says £20bn Budget black hole ‘not implausible’
Rachel Reeves faces a £20bn black hole in the public finances when she delivers her Budget later this year, according to a Wall Street bank.
Morgan Stanley said there had been a “likely erosion of the chancellor’s fiscal headroom” because the OBR will be forced to downgrade its productivity and growth projections.
The bank’s chief UK economist Bruna Skarica said expectations of a £20bn gap in the public finances “don’t seem implausible to us”.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said it was maintaining its forecast that the Bank of England would cut interest rates in November despite figures showing stronger than expected inflation and private sector growth.
“While today’s number poses hawkish risks for our call for a November cut, we keep it in our base case,” Ms Skarica said.
“Should there be no signs of softening in underlying inflationary pressures in the August inflation reading, nor growth momentum into the September meeting, we would rethink that forecast.”
01:29 PM BST
Higher earners face £7,000 bill if Reeves freezes tax rates
High earners could pay more than £7,000 in extra income tax if Rachel Reeves extends the current freeze on payment thresholds until 2030, a wealth manager has warned.
The Chancellor is widely expected to raise taxes in her Budget in the autumn as she looks for ways to fill a black hole in the public finances that some estimates have put as high as £50bn.
One option is freezing the tax-free personal allowance at £12,570 as well as income tax thresholds for basic, higher and additional rates.
This would drag more people into paying more tax as their wages rise. This effect is known as fiscal drag.
Rathbones said that if the freeze runs until April 2030, someone who earned £100,000 in 2022 could pay £7,077 more in tax than if thresholds had kept pace with inflation.
The additional tax burden would be £5,635 for someone who was on £80,000, £4,632 for those who earned £50,000, and £926 for those on £35,000.
Director Ade Babatunde said: “With the Chancellor searching for ways to plug the nation’s financial black hole, the freeze on income tax thresholds could be dragged out further.
“It’s taxation by stealth: the rates stay the same, but a bigger slice of your pay disappears into the taxman’s coffers.
“And it’s not just income tax. Capital gains, dividend and inheritance tax thresholds are also frozen, quietly pulling more people into the net.
“Coupled with inflation – and with talk of a wealth tax – the rising tax burden has fuelled a surge in clients asking if they can do more to reduce their liability ahead of the Budget.”

US stocks poised to drop amid fears over AI valuations
Just as UK stocks have fallen today, Wall Street indexes have dropped further in the wake of a tech-led sell-off.
Walmart shares were down 2.5pc in premarket trading even as the world’s largest retailer raised its fiscal year sales and profit forecasts, driven by strong demand from shoppers across all income levels.
The company has implemented minimal price hikes compared to competitors and promised to maintain low prices, as well as stocked up on affordable discretionary products to draw in more customers.
Investors are trying to gauge how US tariffs will sales later this year. Oher retailers such as Target and Home Depot painted a mixed picture earlier this week .
Meanwhile, there has been a sharp decline in technology stocks such as Nvidia, AMD, Palantir and Meta in recent days.
Raffi Boyadjian, an analyst at brokerage XM said: “Equities could be more at risk of volatility amid this week’s sell-off in AI-related stocks on the back of renewed doubts about AI valuations.”
In premarket trading, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Palantir were marginally up, while Meta slipped 0.3pc.
Ahead of the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4pc, the S&P 500 fell 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 declined 0.2pc.

Economy throws ‘mixed signals on inflation’
The latest data on Britain’s private sector growth sent “mixed signals” on inflation, an economist has said.
Traders have reduced bets on interest rate cuts after stronger-than-expected inflation figures on Wednesday, following by survey data indicating the UK’s business activity has jumped at its fastest pace in a year this month.
However, Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs pointed to input prices and prices charged rising at a slower pace than in April when Rachel Reeves’s tax raid on businesses came into force.
This could mean inflation will ease towards the end of the year, Mr Jessop said, which could open the door to more rate cuts.
11:55 AM BST
UK borrowing costs jump in blow to Reeves
The cost of UK government borrowing has climbed at the fastest pace among major economies today in a blow to Rachel Reeves after official figures showed the Treasury’s deficit deepened last month.
Gilt yields – a benchmark for the cost of servicing Britain’s national debt – jumped across the piece on bond markets following the latest public sector borrowing data.
Britain’s total current budget deficit – borrowing to fund day-to-day public sector activities – has climbed to £42.8bn since April, which was £5.4bn higher than during the same period in 2024.
This was despite the current budget managing a surplus of £3.3bn in July, which was £1bn better than the OBR forecast earlier this year.
Rising borrowing costs are an issue for the Chancellor as she seeks to balance the nation’s finances. The ONS said the interest payable on central government debt rose to £7.1bn in July.
The yield on 10-year UK gilts has climbed five basis points today to 4.72pc.
David Roberts of Nedgroup Investments said this could also be put down to stronger than expected growth in the private sector in August. This has weakened the case for further cuts to interest rates.
He said: “UK gilts have fallen in price and have lagged international peers – but whether either of those owe their origin to Government failings is debatable.
“What is certain is the economy continues to positively surprise, reducing the chances of further rate cuts and putting upward pressure on gilt yields.”
11:33 AM BST
FTSE 100 drops from record high
The FTSE 100 has fallen from its record high on Wednesday as traders bet that interest rate cuts are less likely.
The UK’s blue-chip index has dropped 0.2pc in the wake of stronger-than-expected figures on both private sector growth in August and Treasury borrowing in July.
The FTSE 100 had climbed above 9,300 for the first time a day earlier as defensive stocks were boosted by concerns about US tech stocks. This was despite figures showing inflation rose faster than expected in July.
Fiona Cincotta of City Index said: “The FTSE 100 is steadying after reaching a record high on Wednesday, benefiting from the rotation out of tech, which saw the Nasdaq fall sharply from its record high.
“While the FTSE’s lack of tech stocks meant it has underperformed in recent years, the recent rotation into value has put the wind in the FTSE’s sails. The FTSE has plenty of value plays which are still relatively cheap.”
Sue Noffke of Schroders added: “Consumer staples, such as personal care, tobacco and drinks companies, together with healthcare groups and pharmaceuticals businesses, were buoyant. Some business services groups also rose.
“What these companies have in common is international revenues and earnings – so they are immune from the implications of the hotter UK inflation print seen today, as well as questions over whether that impacts the path of interest rates from the Bank of England or government fiscal policy in the autumn Budget.”
The FTSE 250 was down 0.5pc by late morning trading.

Pound rises after economy grows
The value of the pound climbed after closely watched survey data showed Britain’s private sector grew at the fastest pace in a year this month.
Sterling gained 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.348 and 0.1pc versus the euro to €1.156 as traders reduced bets on the Bank of England cutting interest rates.
The S&P Global Flash PMI for August showed business activity hit a one-year high this month, as the services industry led a summer rebound.
Money markets indicate there is a 42pc chance of another rate cut in 2025, down from 53pc on Wednesday, when official figures showed inflation rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in July.
Meanwhile, public sector borrowing rose at a slower than expected pace last month in a potential further boost for the economy.
10:46 AM BST
Interest rates ‘to stay on hold this year’
The Bank of England will leave interest rates at 4pc for the rest of the year as the economy remains too strong to justify further cuts, economists have said.
Elliott Jordan-Doak of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the latest PMI data showed the “economy is ticking along at a healthy pace” as private sector activity hit its highest level in a year.
“We think healthy growth and inflation miles above target means the MPC will have to keep rates on hold for the rest of the year,” he said.
Separate data on Wednesday showed that inflation rose faster than expected to 3.8pc in July.
10:24 AM BST
Interest rate cuts ‘less likely’ as economy grows
The Bank of England is less likely to cut interest rates later this year in the face of a strengthening economy, experts have warned.
Ashley Webb of Capital Economics said there was an “increase the chances the Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold in November”.
It comes after the closely watched PMI survey for August indicated that Britain’s private sector has grown at its fastest pace in a year.
Money markets indicate the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will keep rates on hold in September, with a 42pc chance of a cut before the end of the year.
“Overall, at the margin today’s data release may give the hawks at the Bank a bit more support,” said Mr Webb.
“We are still forecasting a 25 basis point cut in November to 3.75pc. But November’s decision will be a close call.”
Thomas Pugh, chief economist at RSM UK added: “Overall, a more positive signal on growth combined with stable input and output cost balances is another reason for the MPC to delay further rate cuts.”
10:00 AM BST
Private sector growth picks up in boost for Reeves
Britain’s private sector activity grew at the fastest pace in a year, a closely watched survey showed, in a boost for Rachel Reeves’s hopes that a strong economy can help balance the nation’s books.
The S&P Global Flash UK PMI showed the UK’s dominant services sector drove growth in August, as new business orders expanded at the strongest pace since October.
However, in a warning sign amid Donald Trump’s tariff campaign, input cost inflation edged up to its highest since May.
Bosses blamed the Chancellor’s tax raid on employers for suppliers passing on the cost of higher National Insurance rates.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global, said: “The services sector has led the expansion, but manufacturing also showed further signs of stabilising.
“It’s evident from survey measures of order books, however, that the demand environment remains both uneven and fragile.
“Companies report concerns over the impact of recent government policy changes, as well as unease emanating from broader geopolitical uncertainty. Goods exports are still falling especially sharply.”

Borrowing costs could fall as Treasury hits targets, says economist
Government borrowing costs could fall as Rachel Reeves shows the first signs of tackling the fiscal deficit, an economist has said after the Treasury hit forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).
Borrowing since April is in line with the OBR’s official forecast following stronger self-assessment income tax receipts and National Insurance contributions.
This has put the fiscal deficit on track to fall from 5.1pc of GDP in 2024-25 to 3.9pc in this financial year, according to private bank Berenberg.
Economist Andrew Wishart said he expects the “tailwinds from strong income tax and VAT receipts will continue to blow”.
He said: “That removes one of the reasons for the OBR to downgrade its forecasts.
“If the OBR avoids downgrading its productivity growth assumption too, the upward revision to the deficit forecast since the spring would just be about £5bn from failing to follow through with spending cuts.
“The fact that the government has taken steps to tackle the fiscal deficit sets it apart from the likes of France and the US.
“Bond investors give the UK little credit for this, with the 10-year government bond yield higher than that of any other developed market and 30-year yields recently hitting a 27-year high of 5.5pc.
“Under the radar, the required fiscal adjustment is beginning to take place. If sustained, that should pare back the risk premium in UK bond prices.”
09:17 AM BST
National Insurance payments jump £2.6bn
Rachel Reeves’s tax raid on employers brought in an extra £2.6bn in July, ONS data suggested.
Central government receipts – the amount of money brought in, typically through taxes – was £100.1bn for the month, up £8.8bn against the same month last year.
This came as compulsory social contributions, which include National Insurance (NI) payments, increased by £2.6bn to £16.3bn.
The Chancellor increased the NI rate for employers rose from 13.8pc to 15pc in April following changes in October’s Budget. She also lowered the threshold at which businesses must pay the tax from £9,100 to £5,000.
Meanwhile, the Government also saw a £2.7bn rise in self-assessed income tax receipts to £15.5bn.
08:57 AM BST
Reeves warned mansion tax risks backfiring
Rachel Reeves has been warned that a “mansion tax” risks backfiring and could raise little or even no money.
The Chancellor is reportedly considering charging capital gains tax on the sale of homes worth more than £1.5m, as she scrambles to fill a hole in public finances that economists fear could be as large as £50bn.
However, Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said a raid on wealthy homeowners could ultimately fail to raise the money she needs.
He said: “It is going to incentivise people to not sell, to try and hold to the next election, to see if it changes. Therefore, it might not generate any additional revenues at all.”

Reeves ‘shouldn’t get carried away’ with July boost
Rachel Reeves has “shouldn’t get carried away” from the latest borrowing figures, despite an improvement in the public finances during the month of July.
The current budget managed a surplus of £3.3bn in July, the ONS said, which was £1bn better than the OBR forecast earlier this year.
However, Britain’s total current budget deficit – borrowing to fund day-to-day public sector activities – has climbed to £42.8bn since April, which was £5.4bn higher than during the same period in 2024.
Thomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said the July figure, which matters for the chancellor’s fiscal mandate, is “much less positive than the headline numbers suggest”.
“The bigger picture is that public borrowing has been roughly in line with the OBR forecast this year, but U-turns on spending cuts and a likely downgrade to the OBR’s growth forecasts mean the chancellor will probably have to raise around £20bn at the budget in the autumn,” he said.
“The good news is that with interest rates likely to be around 4pc at the time of the budget there is plenty of scope for the Bank of England to cut rates to offset the impact of any fiscal consolidation on the economy.”

Britain’s finances ‘chronically weak’ as Reeves plans tax rises
Britain’s public finances remain “chronically weak” as Rachel Reeves prepares to raise taxes in the autumn, economists have warned.
The Treasury borrowed £1.1bn in July, which was less than official forecasts, while in the first four months of the financial year borrowing was in line with predictions by the OBR.
Elliott Jordan-Doak of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the Chancellor will still have to raise taxes in October despite borrowing matching official forecasts.
He said: “The big picture remains that the public finances are in chronically weak condition.
“The Chancellor faces surging gilt yields and a likely productivity downgrade from the OBR in the October forecast round.
“The litany of policy U-turns has only compounded the Government’s fiscal woes. We think the Chancellor will need to resort to ‘sin’ and ‘stealth’ tax hikes, duty increases, and a pensions tax raid in order to meet her fiscal rules if she wants to meet her pledge of keeping headline tax rates unchanged.
“We expect the bulk of those tax hikes to be backloaded towards the end of the forecast period, minimising any short-term growth implications.
“But that will buy the Chancellor only precious little time. The public finances are unsustainable in the long-run and delaying action now increases the risks of needing to make sharper adjustments in the future, which would be more disruptive for economic activity.”

UK stocks lack direction at open
Stock markets in London were mixed at the start of trading after the latest figures showed Britain’s public finances remain heavily reliant on borrowing.
The FTSE 100 edged up 0.1pc to 9,297.34 while the domestically focussed FTSE 250 declined by 0.2pc to 21,851.95.

Tax receipts could explain falling payrolls, says economist
Higher self employment tax receipts could help explain the decline in the number of people on payrolls in Britain, an economist has said.
Staff numbers fell in July to their lowest level since October 2023, the ONS said earlier this month.
Simon French of Panmure Liberum said the latest borrowing figures could offer a clue as to why this has happened.
The ONS said self-assessed income tax receipts hit £15.5bn in July, up £2.7bn on the same month last year.
07:47 AM BST
Reeves ‘remains under pressure’ as borrowing rises
Rachel Reeves “remains under pressure as she tries to balance weak growth with the fiscal rules”, economists have warned.
Nabil Taleb, economist at PwC UK, acknowledged that tax revenues “rose sharply” in July, coming in £9.2bn higher than the same month last year.
However, he warned: “Higher debt servicing costs as a share of total revenues will leave the public finances more exposed to future economic shocks.”
Debt interest payments reached £7.1bn in July, which was £200m more than last year.
“Although tax receipts rose in July, the Chancellor remains under pressure as she tries to balance weak growth with the fiscal rules she has committed to,” he said.
“As the Chancellor prepares for the Autumn Budget, the challenge will be finding creative sources of revenue while treading carefully around the impact on living standards.”
07:33 AM BST
Treasury borrowing ‘not as good as it looks’
The improvement in July’s borrowing figures was “not as good as it looks”, economists have warned.
Capital Economics forecast that the Chancellor will still need to raise taxes by £17bn to £27bn at the Budget later this year to balance the nation’s books.
The Treasury borrowed £1.1bn in July, which was lower than the OBR forecast for £2.1bn and economists’s estimates for £2bn.
However, economists pointed to the cumulative current budget deficit, which overshot the OBR’s forecast by £5.7bn and “is what matters for the Chancellor’s fiscal mandate”.
UK economist Alex Kerr said: “Ultimately, today’s release does little to brighten the gloomy outlook ahead of the Budget later this year.
“The Government’s U-turns on spending cuts and potential upward revisions to the OBR’s borrowing forecasts mean the Chancellor may need to raise £17bn to £27bn at the Autumn Budget to maintain the £9.9bn of headroom against her fiscal mandate.
“And given that she is struggling to stick to existing spending plans and we doubt the gilt market will tolerate significant increases in borrowing, most of that will have to be funded by tax rises.”
07:28 AM BST
Too much spent on covering interest on national debt, says minister
The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said too much taxpayer money is spend on debt interest payments.
The Government spent £7.1bn in July covering the interest payable on central government debt, which was £200m more than in the same month last year.
Darren Jones said: “We’re investing in our public services, and modernising the state, to improve outcomes and reduce costs in the medium term.
“Far too much taxpayer money is spent on interest payments for the longstanding national debt.
“That’s why we’re driving down government borrowing over the course of the parliament – so working people don’t have to foot the bill and we can invest in better schools, hospitals, and services for working families.”
07:25 AM BST
Higher tax and National Insurance ease July borrowing figures
ONS deputy director for public sector finances Rob Doody said: “Borrowing this July was £2.3bn down on the same month last year, and was the lowest July figure for three years.
“This reflects strong increases in tax and National Insurance receipts.
“However, in the first four months of the financial year as a whole, borrowing was over £6bn higher than in the same period in 2024.”
07:18 AM BST
Borrowing lower than expected in July
Borrowing for the first four months of this financial year hit £60bn, which was £6.7bn more than during the same period last year.
However, Government borrowing slowed to a lower-than-expected £1.1bn in July, the ONS said.
Treasury borrowing was £2.3bn less than the same month a year earlier and is the lowest July borrowing figure for three years.
It came after a rise in self-assessed income tax payments helped increase tax receipts for the month.
July borrowing was higher than the £2bn figure predicted by economists.
07:14 AM BST
Good morning
Thanks for joining me. The Treasury has ramped up borrowing so far this year as Rachel Reeves prepares to raise taxes to fill a £50bn black hole in the public finances.
Public sector borrowing has climbed to £60bn since April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, which was £6.7bn more than at the same point last year.
The Treasury’s borrowing figure was in line with official forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which was set up in 2010 when George Osborne was chancellor to analyse Government management of the public finances.
Borrowing in the month of July was better than had been expected by economists at £1.1bn, which was the lowest figure for the month in three years following stronger self-assessed income tax receipts.
The spending comes as Ms Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her Budget in the autumn to balance the nation’s books.
She raised taxes by £40bn at her fiscal event last year but the public purse has come under pressure from rising borrowing costs on debt markets and a failure by the Government to cut public spending. Here is what you need to know.

Second quarter earnings season is coming to a close, and with nearly all of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive.
As of Aug. 29, 98% of S&P 500 index companies have reported results, according to FactSet data, and analysts now expect S&P 500 companies to report an 11.9% jump in earnings per share during the second quarter.
Companies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.
This week, reports are rolling in from Zscaler (ZS), NIO (NIO), Salesforce (CRM), Figma (FIG), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), Dollar Tree (DLTR), The Campbell's Company (CPB), Macy's (M), C3.ai (AI), American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), Broadcom (AVGO), Copart (CPRT), lululemon (LULU), DocuSign (DOCU), and ABM Industries (ABM).
Meanwhile, investors will continue to mull over recent reports, particularly Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, which highlighted last week.
Other companies reported too, including PDD Holdings (PDD), Alibaba (BABA), Okta (OKTA), Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), CrowdStrike (CRWD), Snowflake (SNOW), J.M. Smucker (SJM), Urban Outfitters (URBN), Affirm (AFRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Dell (DELL), Dollar General (DG), and Gap (GAP).
Here are the latest updates from corporate America.
LIVE 325 updatesSalesforce stock falls in tepid reaction to earnings beat
Salesforce (CRM) stock fell as much as 5% after hours after the company reported results in line or slightly better than estimates that failed to wow investors looking for big AI gains.
For the quarter, Wall Street was looking for Salesforce's artificial intelligence efforts to show broader adoption — and monetization. Year to date, the stock has underperformed with a 23% loss.
Salesforce did beat Wall Street estimates and show steady growth: Revenue climbed 9.7% year over year to $10.24 billion, slightly above analyst expectations for $10.13 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 were also above estimates for earnings of $2.78 per share.
For the 2026 fiscal year, Salesforce initiated revenue guidance of $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion and raised the low end of its full-year revenue guidance, which now stands in a range of $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion. Both of those outlooks represent single-digit growth, which lags in comparison to other large-cap tech and AI players.
“It’s not bad — no one is going to say these are bad numbers,” Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance in reaction to the results. “We’re just playing a relative game, where everyone else on a relative basis is way better.”
The cloud software provider also announced a $20 billion increase to its existing share buyback program, bringing the total to $50 billion.

The project, designed to support data centres and AI operations, aims to provide 5GW of power.
The 8000-acre GW Ranch project has been in development since early 2024.
It will combine high-efficiency natural gas turbines with advanced battery storage to ensure a dedicated and reliable power supply.
Its off-grid design aims to eliminate reliance on the electricity grid, offering speed-to-deployment and “five nines” of reliability for digital infrastructure operators.
By bypassing grid interconnection delays and regulatory bottlenecks, GW Ranch is set to deliver 1GW of power by 2028 and 5GW by 2030.
The project also features 1.8GW of energy storage, supported by N+2 redundancy and dual independent pipelines to ensure more than 99.99% uptime.
Pacifico Energy vice-president Constantyn Gieskes stated: “GW Ranch is not just about scale — it is about certainty. Every aspect of the project has been designed to solve problems with the status quo in data center development.
“By building off-grid and working hand-in-hand with local officials, we’re delivering the speed, reliability and responsible development that our customers and communities both demand.”
The project has already initiated permitting with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and will comply with all environmental regulatory requirements.
It has received backing from local officials to ensure a de-risked and accelerated construction process.
Pecos County economic development director Remie Ramos stated: “Pecos County’s continued effort to diversify the local economy directly aligns with the development of GW Ranch.
“The minimal impact of an off-grid data center will increase the county tax base, create new jobs and have an overall positive impact on our county while conserving water and placing no constraints on local infrastructure.”
Pacifico Energy, the US segment of the Pacifico Energy Group, is also developing the 456-MW Ft Spunky project in the Dallas Metro area.

“I think the data coming between now and the September meeting is going to be very consequential,"" Schmid told Yahoo Finance from the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.
""So if we do see patterns and [a] risk to the labor market itself, I think we'll start to consider and weigh the inflation data to the labor data.”
Schmid described the Fed’s current monetary policy stance as ""modestly restrictive.""
For four years, inflation has persistently been above the Fed's 2% target, and recent data suggests it might now be rising further. At the same time, growing evidence indicates a weakening labor market, with the July jobs report pushing markets to anticipate that the Fed will begin cutting rates next month.
The Fed kept interest rates unchanged in a range of 4.25%-4.50% on July 31.
Read more: How jobs, inflation, and the Fed are all related
Schmid's comments on Thursday suggested risks on the Fed's mandate remain more tilted toward inflation remaining too high rather than the labor market softening aggressively.
With investors all but certain the Fed will cut rates in the coming weeks — and with pressures building on the Fed politically to begin a rate-cutting cycle — this view appears to put Schmid among a dwindling number of Fed officials still focused on inflation pressures.
""I think we're seeing and hearing, more importantly, in the [Kansas City Fed's] district, that some [of] the risk of [inflation] is higher than maybe seeing some of the labor numbers come back into line,"" Schmid said.
Last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that while headline inflation was lower than consensus forecasts, on a ""core"" basis prices rose more than expected. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a read on wholesale prices, also showed inflation pressures building.
The July jobs report showed hiring slowed last month, while over 250,000 job additions were revised away from the May and June data.
""We have a lot of things in balance right now in the economy, in my opinion,"" Schmid said.
""And I'm just trying to be very careful to [not] try and do too much. That will create an imbalance.""

Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is a networking equipment and cybersecurity company whose shares have gained 13% year-to-date. However, the stock fell by 7% last week after an analyst downgrade and the firm’s fourth quarter earnings report. The results saw Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) modestly beat analyst estimates, which didn’t generate optimism about AI growth. To make matters worse for the stock, HSBC cut the stock’s rating to Hold from Buy. Cramer revealed that his trust owns Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO):
“My charitable trust owns that, it’s Chuck Robbins, I mean, you know, where is the multiple. . .”

Here are his previous comments about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO):
“People just think that it’s the same old Cisco. Like they didn’t buy Splunk. Splunk gave them visibility, it gave them some really, really good cyber defense works. But it gave them contacts. And Splunk was everywhere. And I don’t think people realize how embedded Splunk was. Now you’ve got a company that could have an Oracle-like revaluation. And the Oracle-like revaluation is stunning.”

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink thinks so here what that means for you and your investments,2025-08-21 16:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.
In his most recent letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink discussed the company’s latest investment strategies and where he envisions the future of investing heading.
One of the most significant developments came in his prediction around portfolio splits, noting that “the classic 60/40 portfolio may no longer fully represent true diversification.”
He believes there is a better standard portfolio coming soon — the 50/30/20 split high-income investors already prioritize, which includes “stocks, bonds, and private assets like real estate, infrastructure, and private credit.”
Fink says BlackRock’s current goal is to bring private asset investments to the masses, freeing these investments from the gatekeeping that has allowed only the wealthiest access.
“Assets that will define the future — data centers, ports, power grids, the world’s fastest-growing private companies — aren’t available to most investors,” Fink wrote. “They're in private markets, locked behind high walls, with gates that open only for the wealthiest or largest market participants.”
Recently, BlackRock has acquired Global Infrastructure Partners, Preqin and HPS Investment Partners, a strategy meant to increase the average investor's access to the traditionally out-of-reach private market — just as they did for ETFs on acquiring iShares.
“Private markets don’t have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate,” Fink continued.
BlackRock’s recent acquisitions underscore Fink’s advice against the 60/40 stock-bond portfolio split. The 50/30/20 split means 20% of a person’s investments are in private assets, which could be good for BlackRock’s business as they move in this new private asset-focused direction.
What does this mean for you?
If the democratization of assets previously reserved for the wealthy and a 50/30/20 split sounds appealing to you, there are options that allow you to increase your investment in private assets like real estate right away.
You can tap into the private real estate market by investing in shares of vacation homes or rental properties through Arrived.
Backed by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived allows you to invest in shares of vacation and rental properties, meaning you could earn passive income from real estate without the hassle of being a landlord.
To get started, simply browse through their vetted properties to find potential investments that appeal to you. Once you find your dream investment property, you can start investing with as little as $100.
But as alternative assets become increasingly accessible, there are also ways to put more of your money into this sector. Accredited investors could consider commercial real estate to further diversify their portfolios.
For years, direct access to this $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector has been limited to a select group of elite investors, but First National Realty Partners (FNRP) has changed that.
FNRP allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, minus the stress of being a commercial landlord.
Gold is another private investment that has become increasingly popular over the past few months, reaching an all-time high of $3,534 on August 8.
If you’re interested in investing in gold, you can open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.
Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold and gold-related assets within their retirement account, combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the safety of gold. This makes it an attractive option for anyone looking to hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.
Some advisors are not as comfortable as Fink is with the 50/30/20 split for the average investor.
Amy Arnott, portfolio strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC that a 20% allocation in private assets is still considered aggressive.
“If you want to keep things very simple, the 60/40 portfolio or a target date fund is a great starting point,” Arnott said.
She noted that the total value of private assets globally is only “about $14.3 trillion, while the public markets are worth about $247 trillion,” which means private assets account for just 6% of the market — not 20%.
If you’re not sure what split you should be investing in, you might want to speak with a financial advisor to help give you peace of mind.

-
SelectQuote beat on earnings and on sales this morning.
-
The insurance information provider earned a profit before paying out dividends for preferred stockholders.
-
Free cash flow was deeply negative, however.
Shares of SelectQuote (NYSE: SLQT) stock, which runs online compare-and-contrasts for choosing health, life, home, and automobile insurance policies, is off to the races Thursday morning, its shares surging 40.5% through 10:25 a.m. ET after soundly beating fiscal Q4 2025 earnings forecasts this morning.
Heading into the report, Wall Street forecast SelectQuote would lose $0.13 per share, and it did lose money -- but only $0.02. Sales were supposed to be $334.1 million, but came in at $345.1 million instead.
SelectQuote Q4 earnings
So the good news is that SelectQuote didn't lose as much money as Wall Street thought it would. The better news, though, is that the only reason SelectQuote lost any money at all is that it paid dividends to holders of senior non-convertible preferred stock.
But for those payments, the company would have earned $12.9 million in profit.
That said, it's worth pointing out that free cash flow at SelectQuote still ran deeply negative in the quarter, as SelectQuote burned about $38 million in cash. (Fiscal Q4 2024 FCF was positive, by the way.)
Is SelectQuote stock a buy?
Investors may not have noticed this last detail just yet, but I admit it does give me pause -- especially in light of all the momentum buying that seems to be happening today.
Valued on GAAP earnings, SelectQuote stock certainly looks cheap enough to buy. With $48 million in trailing earnings and a market capitalization of only $444 million (after the run-up), SelectQuote stock trades for a seemingly low 9.2 P/E ratio. Free cash flow, however, has run negative in four of the past five years, and it's in the red again this year already.
If that number doesn't turn around again in a hurry, well, caveat investor.

The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.58% this week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year mortgage rate declined slightly to 5.69%, from 5.71% a week earlier.
Treasury yields, which mortgage rates closely track, have stayed relatively flat in recent days amid a quieter week for economic data releases. Investors have been closely monitoring inflation and jobs data for clues about the health of the US economy. Lower mortgage rates in recent weeks, after a weak August jobs report, combined with mixed readings on inflation, boosted the odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut next month.

Traders currently see a 77% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut next month, according to CME FedWatch. The Fed doesn’t control mortgage rates directly, though mortgage rates are influenced by market perceptions of the path of benchmark rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will speak on Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, an event Wall Street is closely watching for clues on the direction of interest rates from here.
Mortgage applications have remained stagnant even as rates have held at slightly lower levels. Refinancing activity dropped 3% through Friday from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, and applications to purchase a new home were essentially flat.
“I think there are a lot of people on the sidelines just kind of waiting and seeing,” said Gary Pierce, a mortgage loan officer at Pure Funding in Weatherford, Texas. He thinks rates would need to fall below 6% to bring many would-be homebuyers back to the market.

Even though rates remain elevated, there are some signs that buyers are responding to a softening housing market. Home prices nationwide are nearly flat from a year ago, though regionally, prices are falling in the West and South and rising in the Northeast and the Midwest. Higher inventory levels have also given buyers more negotiating power in many markets.
Existing home sales rose 2% in July from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million homes, according to National Association of Realtors data released on Thursday. That’s a 0.8% improvement from a year ago, though still near historical lows seen since mortgage rates began rising in mid-2022.
“One can say things are a little better today as a buyer compared to, say, a couple of years ago,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist.",bc494295fd090f36a9b491d389642b62,trafilatura

I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Jinfeng Huang. Please go ahead, David.
Jinfeng Huang: Thank you, Irene, and thank you, everyone, for joining Yatsen Holding Limited's second quarter 2025 earnings conference call today. I will begin with a brief macro overview and a summary of our financial results, followed by an update on how our R&D-driven initiatives have supported the healthy development of our brand portfolio. China's beauty industry saw another modest quarter. According to the adjusted data published by the National Bureau of Logistics, beauty sales increased by 2.6% year over year, falling short of the 5.4% growth in total retail sales of consumer goods. Specifically, during May and June, the key promotion period around June, beauty sales rose by 4.4% in May but declined by 2.2% in June.
Despite the uncertain environment, we stayed focused on executing our R&D-driven strategy, anchored in our vision of becoming a world-class pioneer in beauty innovation. We have continued expanding our international innovation network, attracting top global R&D talents, and deepening collaborations across industries, academia, and research institutions. These efforts have laid a solid foundation for both product innovation and brand equity, which in turn supported the rebound in our financial performance. Building on the momentum that began in 2024, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth and achieved non-GAAP profitability for the third consecutive quarter. In 2025, total net revenues grew by 36.8% year over year, significantly exceeding our previous guidance.
Revenues from brands increased 78.7% year over year, driven by an 88.1% growth in the combined revenue from our three major skincare brands, Calanique, Doctor Wu, and Yiflon. Our color cosmetics brands also delivered year-over-year growth of 8% with Perfect Diaries brand back on the growth trajectory. As operating leverage began to take effect, coupled with our efforts to improve efficiency in our operations and marketing spend, we narrowed our net loss margin to 1.8% from 10.8% for the prior year period and achieved a non-GAAP net profit margin of 1.1% for the second quarter of 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP net loss margin of 9.4% for the prior year period.
Let me now walk you through some brands and product highlights powered by our solid R&D infrastructure. Genomics posted strong results, supported by robust product highlights and effective product marketing. Our number one VC7 continues to lead sales, while our upgraded brightening micro mask featuring the brand's micro profusion and active anchor technology ranked number one among premium single-use masks on both Tmall and JD during the June 2018 period. The number two VA Serum also received increasingly positive feedback, particularly on Douyin. In addition to online growth, we began expanding dynamic offline presence, opening experience stores in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Shenzhen by June. These stores are designed to strengthen brand visibility and deepen consumer engagement.
Doctor Wu also benefited from a more diverse and balanced product portfolio. Its purifying renewable essence toner formulated with a gentle acid complex effectively adjusted the antioxidant and the brightening ease of Oly and Acne Protein. This product resonates strongly with its targeted consumers and reinforces the brand positioning as a leader in professional skin renewal. The second quarter also marked a key milestone for Pavidari. Since the launch of the Bio Lip Essence Lipstick in September 2023, Pavidari has embraced a new philosophy of makeup skinification. Building on this, we introduced the third generation biotech technology and applied it to facial makeup. The new BioPhase Essence Foundation provides a flawless finish while supporting the skin barrier.
We also launched the translucent blurring setting powder, powered by the smart lock technology to control oil, combat oxidation, and reduce dullness. These innovations played a key role in putting Togedari back on its growth path. As our commitment to R&D remains essential to our long-term strategy, we continue to strengthen our capabilities and presence in the scientific community. In May, we participated in the 2025 China Cosmetic Science and Technology Conference in Yunnan as a guest speaker and joined a roundtable discussion on emotional skincare at the 2025 International Cosmetics Innovation Conference in Shanghai. In June, our joint laboratory with Regen Hospital unveiled its latest innovation at the 30th International Council of Nurse Congress in Health Care, Finland.
We are also proud of our ongoing social responsibility initiative. During 2025, our Create a Beautiful Life program launched in partnership with the China Women's Development Foundation celebrated the graduation of its first 2025 cohort in Guizhou. Now in its fifth year, the program provides free professional makeup training for low-income women, helping them pursue new opportunities in employment and entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, Doctor Wu has entered the third year of his campus charity tour, promoting scientific skincare education and raising skin health awareness among university students across China. In summary, we are beginning to see tangible results from our long-term focus on R&D. We remain committed to nurturing our brands and delivering exceptional products to our customers.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Donghao Yang, to discuss our financial performance. Thank you, everyone.
Donghao Yang: Thank you, David, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I would like to clarify that all financial numbers presented today are in renminbi amounts and all percentage changes refer to year-over-year changes unless otherwise noted. Total net revenues for 2025 increased by 36.8% to RMB1.09 billion from million for the prior year period.

Gross profit for 2025 increased by 39.5% to RMB850.4 million from million for the prior year period. Gross margin for 2025 increased to 78.3% from 76.7% for the prior year period.

The decrease was primarily due to further improvements in logistics efficiency.
Selling and marketing expenses for 2025 were $722.4 million as compared with $544.7 million for the prior year period. As a percentage of total net revenues, selling and marketing expenses for 2025 decreased to 66.5% from 68.6% for the prior year period.

General and administrative expenses for 2025 were $84.1 million as compared with $119.1 million for the prior year period. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses for 2025 decreased to 7.7% from 15% for the prior year period.
The decrease was primarily driven by lower payroll expenses resulting from a reduction in general and administrative headcount coupled with the leveraging effect of higher total net revenues in 2025. Research and development expenses for 2025 were million as compared with $29.7 million for the prior year period. As a percentage of total net revenues, research and development expenses for 2025 decreased to 3.3% from 3.7% for the prior year period.

Operating loss margin was 5.1% as compared with 17% for the prior year period.
Non-GAAP loss from operations for 2025 was $20.4 million as compared with RMB111.9 million for the prior year period. Non-GAAP operating loss margin was 1.9% as compared with 14.1% for the prior year period. Net loss for 2025 was $19.5 million as compared with $85.5 million for the prior year period. Net loss margin was 1.8% as compared with 10.8% for the prior year period. Net loss attributable to reference ordinary shareholders per diluted ADS for 2025 was RMB0.19 as compared with RMB0.77 for the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income for 2025 was million as compared with non-GAAP net loss of RMB74.9 million for the prior year period.
Non-GAAP net income margin was 1.1% as compared with non-GAAP net loss margin of 9.4% for the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders per diluted ADS for 2025 was RMB0.13 as compared with non-GAAP net loss attributable to Yatsen Holding Limited's ordinary shareholders per diluted ADS of RMB0.67 for the prior year period. As of 06/30/2025, we had cash, restricted cash, and short-term investments of $350 million as compared with $1.36 billion as of 12/31/2024. Net cash generated from operating activities for 2025 was $77.7 million as compared with net cash used in operating activities of $148.2 million for the prior year period.
Looking at our business outlook for 2025, we expect our total net revenues to be between $778.6 million and $880.1 million, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 15% to 30%. These forecasts reflect our current and preliminary view on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change. With that, I'd now like to open the call to Q&A. Operator?
Operator: Thank you. Our first question today will come from Maggie Huang of CICC. Please go ahead.
Maggie Huang: Thanks for taking my question. This is Maggie Huang from CICC. Firstly, congratulations for beating our guidance. And I have two questions. My first question is that as we enter into the second half of the year, how should we expect the change of profitability for both skincare and color cosmetic categories? And how do we intend to strike the balance between promoting new product lines and improving our profitability? And my second question is about competition. So what's our view on the industry competition in Q3 and Q4, particularly the competition from foreign premium brands? That's my two questions. Thank you.
Donghao Yang: Okay. Thank you very much for your question. Well, we've always been trying to track balance between our growth and profitability. And we don't believe that we have to sacrifice one for the other. And especially now our high-end skincare brands are growing even faster than our color cosmetics brands, which tend to have higher gross margin and bottom line. So we're confident that as we grow our business, both in skincare and color cosmetics going forward and especially skincare is showing a much stronger growth momentum. We believe that we can achieve both growth and profitability.
And competition and I think you're right, competition is going to be becoming more and more intense going forward, especially as our high-end skincare brand is growing faster, we do expect to have more competition from the international brands. But in order to drive our growth and strengthen our competing position, we are adopting an R&D-driven growth strategy. So for the last four, five years, we've been one of the most aggressive players in the cosmetics industry to invest heavily in R&D. So now we've built a very, I would say, best-in-class R&D team and R&D infrastructure. If you look at our lab, our R&D center in Shanghai is one of the world-class facilities.
So that's how we view where to drive our future growth and especially to win the competition against the players in the industry.
Maggie Huang: Well, it's very clear. I have no more questions. Thank you very much.
Jinfeng Huang: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Lin Zhang of CITIC Securities. Please go ahead.
Lin Zhang: Thank you for taking my questions. I'm Lin Zhang from CITIC Securities and congratulations on the performance in the second quarter. My first question is for the skincare brands. So I want to ask what are the key drivers behind the rapid growth of skincare brands, for the Calanique and Doctor Wu in the first half of the year? And what is the outlook for the skincare business in the second half year and the next year? And my second question is, in which assets will the company make efforts to continuously improve the profitability? Thank you.
Donghao Yang: Thank you for the question. So for the growth of skincare brand, so we think there are a number of reasons. Primarily it's because of our continued investment in R&D and our gradual systematic upgrade of our R&D capabilities. As a result, we have a very strong pipeline of new product innovations. So just to give you some examples, for example, for Calanique, for the past couple of quarters, we have introduced a series of new products, including on top of very successful VC, we produced the VA serum and also the MicroMask series has been very successful. And we also widened the offering of the MicroMask in terms of different efficacy and we also operated the micro mask recently.
And for Doctor Wu, the new essence toner has been very successful. So we think mainly from the R&D upgrade and also the new product pipeline. And then in terms of outlook, we have provided the guidance for Q3 of 15% to 30%, which will I would think reflect our future outlook in terms of continued trend of our skincare brands in terms of the development. And then on your second question is our efforts to how to improve the profitability. We are continuing to optimize our channel and product mix and at the same time streamline our operating expenses.
But we think most of our brands, some of them given the high growth, we think there's still significant growth potential. And those brands are right now remain well below their respective ceilings. That's why we continue to plan to invest in the brand awareness and brand equity. So especially when there are few product launch. So as a result, we think the profitability improvement will be gradual.
Jinfeng Huang: Okay. As well, just to add on to Irene's point, we do see clear opportunities to further improve profitability across several dimensions. First, we will continue to optimize our product mix by driving premiumization and hero products with stronger margins. Second, we're improving marketing efficiency through data-driven CRM and better ROI discipline, shifting spending towards higher return channels. Thirdly, we are enhancing supply chain and operational efficiency to reduce costs and improve scale leverage. And lastly, as top-line growth continues, we expect to gain operating leverage across fixed expenses. So altogether these initiatives give us confidence in steadily expanding profitability while maintaining growth.
Lin Zhang: Thank you. That's very clear. Thank you very much.
Operator: This will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.
Irene Lyu: Thank you again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us at Yatsen Holding Limited directly. Our contact information for IR in both China and the U.S. can be found in today's press release. Thank you and have a great day.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-dow-stocks-set-soar-155500380.html,25d64493957bd9f0bf7271fdb7d710c1,These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2025 and Beyond,These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2025 and Beyond,2025-08-21 16:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), and WaltDisney(NYSE: DIS) are some of the country's most popular consumer brands. They also happen to make up a tenth of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI).
I have nothing against the other 90% of the stocks make up the widely tracked 30-stock index, but I'll stick with Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Disney. They are three of the Dow 30 stocks that I think are positioned well to soar for the rest of 2025 and beyond. Let's take a closer look.
1. Amazon
It's hard to believe that the world's leading online retailer didn't punch its card to get into the Dow 30 until last year, but it's up a brisk 28% since the induction 18 months ago. The index is up less than 15% in that time, so the Amazon expedition is paying off so far for the Dow 30.
Amazon's inclusion comes as growth slows for the dot-com icon. It has an applause-worthy run of growing its net sales by 9% or better in each of its first 28 years of trading, but it's been clinging to the low end of that range in recent years. Its top line has risen by 9% to 12% in each of the last three years, and it kicked off 2025 in uninspiring fashion when net sales climbed a mere 8.6% higher. It seemed as if the Dow 30 was too late on Amazon, but last month we saw a surprising acceleration of growth.
Net sales rose 13% for Amazon's second quarter, which it announced at the end of last month. An 11% increase for its North American segment sales was nice, but the 16% jump in its international business -- fueled partly by a sluggish dollar -- was even better. The real star continues to be its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, up 18% for the quarter. It's just 18% of the revenue mix for Amazon, but it brought in more than half of the company's operating profit.
The bottom line fared even better. Net income per share rose 33% to $1.68 a share. It was another double-digit percentage earnings beat for Amazon. Three months ago the e-tailing behemoth was forecasting just a 4% increase in operating profit on a 7% to 11% year-over-year bump in net sales. Business keeps accelerating for Amazon.
The stock isn't cheap if you consider that it's trading for nearly 30 times next year's earnings. It's fetching nearly 4 times trailing net sales, a stiff multiple for retail stocks but a bargain if you focus on the AWS business that also makes it a tech services company. You have to like how Amazon is starting to accelerate its business again. Its guidance for the current quarter calls for net sales to rise 10% to 13%. The way it blew the cover off the ball last time, it shouldn't surprise anyone if its top line finds a way to rise in the mid-teens for the first time in three years. It's putting the ""magnificent"" in the ""Magnificent Seven.""
2. Coca-Cola
Turning to a bubbly stock, Coca-Cola is the undisputed global leader in the realm of pop. It's also a global juggernaut among beverage stocks with 30 different brands generating more than $1 billion in annual sales each. You didn't think that Coca-Cola was just about the namesake beverage, did you?
Coca-Cola is a high-margin business with a long string of positive profit surprises. It's not just a reliable source of sugary escapism or hydration. Income investors collecting today's 2.9% yield know that they can bank on this Dividend King to continue boosting its payouts the way it has for 63 straight years. With a trailing payout ratio of 69%, there is more than enough wiggle room to stretch that streak to 64 next year.
There are some legitimate concerns about soda consumption trends, but Coca-Cola loves to climb that wall of worry. Revenue should climb for the fifth year in a row in 2025.
3. Disney
I couldn't write about my favorite Dow 30 stocks without mouse droppings. Disney is the global entertainment leader that also happens to operate the world's most popular theme parks. It's a historical laggard. It has delivered just three fiscal years of double-digit revenue growth in this millennium. This might not seem to make it a good time to invest in Disney, but the future is brighter than its storied past.
Disney is getting back into a good groove at the multiplex after putting out the world's three biggest movies last year. Its theme parks have been generating strong results coming out of the pandemic. Disney+ is now profitable, dramatically boosting the media stock's bottom line. Its latest tweak -- today's launch of the new ESPN streaming service -- is another sign that a company that many figured would be disrupted is doing the disrupting. At 18 times forward earnings it's also the cheapest of these three stocks. It's time to come home to the House of Mouse.
Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?
Before you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

In an updated report, SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (NASDAQ:SBET) said it purchased another 143,593 ETH at an average price of $4,648 for a total of $667 million.

In other news, SharpLink Gaming, Inc.

Revenues also declined by 29 percent to $697,291 from $981,272 in the same comparable period.

(NYSE:LMT) reported $1.8 billion in charges in the second quarter, led by a classified Aeronautics program and two Rotary and Mission Systems projects, prompting Bank of America Securities (BofA) analyst Ronald J. Epstein to trim his outlook.
The analyst reaffirmed a Neutral rating and lowered his price forecast to $480 from $495, citing ongoing program challenges and limited near-term catalysts.
Epstein said the recurring charges, which follow roughly $2 billion recorded in 2024, have shaken investor confidence. The latest write-downs included $950 million tied to a classified Aero effort, $570 million on Canada's Maritime Helicopter Program, and $95 million related to Turkey's utility helicopter program.

Together, the charges cut $5.83 per share from quarterly earnings. Additional hits came from a $66 million NGAD asset write-off and a $103 million tax adjustment, partly offset by state tax benefits.
The bright spot remains the Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) unit, which Epstein identified as the primary driver of potential upside. Programs such as Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) remain in high demand as the U.S. and allies replenish stockpiles. MFC's backlog rose 4% from 2024 and 25% over two years, signaling a strong pipeline.
However, he added, supply chain constraints limit how fast the segment can scale, meaning it cannot fully counterbalance headwinds elsewhere.
Looking ahead, BofA lowered its adjusted EPS forecast for 2025 to $21.95 from $27.30. Projections for 2026 and 2027 were also reduced slightly.
Epstein set his price forecast at $480, down from $495, based on a 12x EV/EBITDA multiple on 2026e, a level he sees as capped at Lockheed Martin's 10-year historical average while the company works through margin pressure and tax headwinds.
Epstein flagged additional risks, including a potential $4.6 billion IRS tax dispute, program execution challenges, and budget-related uncertainty around the F-35. While long-term demand for missiles remains supportive, Epstein said Lockheed Martin may remain in the penalty box until management resolves program issues and restores investor confidence.

Mortgage rates have dropped sharply since hitting 7.08% in May, pressured by a surging inventory of homes for sale. The 30-year mortgage fell to a 10-month low at 6.55% last week, adding to losses after a poor July jobs report stoked more economic uncertainty. The crosscurrents are slowly shifting buyer fatigue from affordability issues to tariff-fueled inflation.
A new Bright MLS survey confirms weakening demand and deteriorating sentiment. It concludes both buyers and sellers are holding back and successful transactions are ""more likely to be because people need to buy or sell, rather than that they want to buy or sell."" Nearly three-quarters of agency respondents reported at least one buyer who chose to pause their home search, compared to less than two-thirds at the same time last year.

In addition, just 32% of buyers walking away did so because they were frustrated by failed offers, typical in a strong seller's market. That percentage recorded a major drop from last year's 56%. Affordability issues are also fading, with respondents citing ""other financial issues"" and ""general uncertainty"" more frequently, compared to 2024 when ""affordability"" and ""high mortgage rates"" dominated buyer worries.
On the other hand, prospective homebuyers must be thrilled to see mortgage rates finally headed lower.

Traders expect the S&P 500 to move about 0.8% in either direction through the end of the week, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday likely to be a driving force behind that move.
-
Stocks jumped more than 1% the day of last year's Jackson Hole speech, when Powell signaled the Fed was ready to cut interest rates for the first time in 4 years.
-
Analysts earlier this week expressed concern that investors were overly optimistic about the likelihood of a September rate cut, but expectations and stocks have drifted lower in recent days.
Wall Street was on edge Thursday, with stocks trading lower as investors awaited what could be a pivotal policy speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
Powell is scheduled to speak Friday morning at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. Investors will be scrutinizing Powell’s address for signs that the Fed is ready to resume cutting interest rates in September after nine months on hold.
Powell’s speech is the biggest event of the week for the stock market, and traders are positioning themselves accordingly. Options pricing suggests investors expect the S&P 500 to move about 0.8% in either direction through the end of this week. That’s nearly twice the S&P 500’s average daily move over the past month.
Will History Repeat Itself at Jackson Hole?
At last year’s Jackson Hole, Powell declared the Fed was ready to begin cutting interest rates more than a year after policymakers hiked rates for the 11th and final time in their post-pandemic policy tightening campaign.
“The time has come for policy to adjust,” Powell said. “With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labor market.”
It was the news Wall Street was hoping for. The S&P 500 jumped more than 1% to trade just shy of an all-time high. Though for investors last year, seeing was believing; it wasn’t until mid-September, when the Fed cut rates for the first time, that the index finally broke its previous record.
Rate Cut Expectations—and Stocks—Are Falling
Evercore ISI analysts warned in a note on Sunday that Powell’s speech could deliver stocks a rough patch if Wall Street finds his comments inadequately dovish. “For a market that was eager to embrace '50 in Sept’, a balanced view could catalyze a near term -7% to -15% pullback into October,” the analysts wrote, referring to recent speculation that the Fed could make a jumbo, 50 basis point (bps) cut next month.",5467c203be57e439db671b3a00c27e38,trafilatura

""I firmly believe that there will be a dominant Bitcoin treasury company in each capital market in the world,"" Myers said in a statement published by the London Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Myers is known in the crypto industry for developing a model on unlocking Bitcoin's ""full potential valuation,"" that went on to inspire Michael Saylor's ""Bitcoin 24"" framework. Saylor subsequently implemented this playbook at Strategy, the software firm whose work with Bitcoin has since spurred digital asset treasuries extending to other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB, and XRP, among others.
For Myers, the goal is to position Smarter Web as the UK analogue of Bitcoin treasury leaders such as Metaplanet in Japan and Strategy in the United States, characterizing their move as a ""compelling outlook.""
In June, the company disclosed that Myers had invested about £970,000 in its fundraising round while serving as a part-time consultant on a £12,000 annual fee. His shift to a full-time post formalizes that commitment, supporting Smarter Web's plan to hold reserves in both cash and Bitcoin, a policy it says can strengthen its balance sheet but one that also exposes investors to volatility and regulatory risk.
Smarter Web did not immediately return Decrypt's request for comment.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-slow-reporting-crashes-feds-170044626.html,1901a21bece57f1cc00338c4a4e12da7,Tesla is slow in reporting crashes and the feds have launched an investigation to find out why,Tesla is slow in reporting crashes and the feds have launched an investigation to find out why,2025-08-21 17:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"NEW YORK (AP) — Federal auto safety regulators are investigating why Tesla has repeatedly broken rules requiring it to quickly tell them about crashes involving its self-driving technology, a potentially significant development given the company's plans to put hundreds of thousands of driverless cars on U.S. roads over the next year.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing on Thursday that Tesla's reports on “numerous” incidents involving its driver assistance and self-driving features were submitted far too late — several months after the crashes instead of within five days as required.
The probe comes two months after the electric vehicle maker run by Elon Musk started a self-driving taxi service in Austin, Texas, with hopes of soon offering it nationwide. The company also hopes to send over-the-air software updates to millions of Teslas already on the road that will allow them to drive themselves.
Investors enthusiastic about such plans have kept Tesla stock aloft despite plunging sales and profits due to boycotts over Musk's support for U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe.
The safety agency said the probe will focus on why Tesla took so long to report the crashes, whether the reports included all the necessary data and details and if there are crashes that the agency still doesn't know about.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, but the agency noted that the company has told it the delays were “due to an issue with Tesla’s data collection,"" which Tesla says has now been fixed.
The new investigation follows another probe that began in October into potential problems with Tesla's self-driving technology in foggy weather and other low visibility conditions, which has been linked to several accidents including one death. That probe involves 2.4 million Tesla vehicles.
The crash reporting rule for vehicles using Level 2 driver-assistance software, or those that require drivers to pay full attention to the road, was implemented in 2021. Since then Tesla has reported 2,308 crashes when the software was used, the vast majority of the more than 2,600 reported by all automakers, according to agency data. The numbers are skewed by the fact that Tesla is by far the dominant maker of partial self-driving vehicles in the U.S.
The company has been offering robotaxi rides in Austin to only a select group of riders, but said it will allow any paying customer to hail its cabs starting sometime in September, according to a Musk post on X earlier this month. Tesla has also begun allowing limited robotaxi service in San Francisco with a driver behind the wheel as a safety check to conform with California rules.",3c26f0c9a614724d70133978b3101dad,trafilatura

The Bollingbrook, Ill.-based retailer has appointed Martin Brok and Stephenie Landry to its board of directors and as members of its audit and compensation committees. The appointments take effect Sept. 1.

Brok is the founder and chief executive of MB Capital Advisors and operating partner at Advent International, though is well known from his time as global president and chief executive officer of Sephora. Prior to that, he was president of Starbucks for Europe, Middle East and Africa and was the global COO of direct-to-consumer at Nike.
Landry worked as the chief operating officer at Honor Technology, and held a bevy of positions at Amazon prior.
“We’re thrilled to welcome Martin and Stephenie to our board of directors,” said Kecia Steelman, president and CEO of Ulta Beauty, in a statement. “Martin is an accomplished, strategic leader with deep international experience in the areas of retailing, merchandising, and brand strategy, while Stephenie has strong operational and digital innovation expertise and sustainability leadership. Their transformative track records and strategic vision will be invaluable as we navigate our next chapter of growth.”
The appointment comes as the beauty retail landscape deals with seismic shifts. Once dominated by both Ulta and Sephora (key competitors for share of mind and wallet in the prestige market), Amazon is now the largest beauty retailer in the U.S., as reported. Abroad, the U.K. appears to be the latest frontier, with Ulta acquiring Space NK just years after Sephora reentered the geography in 2023.
Brok was pivotal to that debut, having architected Sephora’s acquisition of Feelunique in the U.K. and Zalando in Germany. At the time of his departure in 2022, it was “due to a divergence of views,” an internal memo said.
It’s the latest in a slew of big moves from Steelman, who took the helm of Ulta at the top of the year. Geographically, she’s overseeing expansions into Mexico and the Middle East. On the personnel front, she’s named Lauren Brindley its chief merchandising and digital officer, Kelly Mahoney its chief marketing officer, and also announced the ending of its partnership with Target Corp.

Yet too many fleets treat it like an afterthought. If you’re not planning fuel alongside your routes, you’re not running in the most effective way—you’re running blind. And in this market, blind spots cost real money.
The fleets that win don’t chase cheap pumps either. They engineer a fuel plan that ties directly into dispatch. They understand how IFTA works, they use their fuel card data, and they decide before they roll where those gallons are coming from. That’s how you stop bleeding profit at the pump.
Why Some Carriers Overspend on Fuel
It’s not always the pump price that kills you. It’s the lack of a system.
Here’s what happens too often:
-
Drivers fueling wherever the tank runs low.
-
Picking stations out of convenience, not price.
-
Filling up without thinking about base price or state tax.
One week of that might not feel like much. But stretch it over a month, and you’re talking thousands in lost margin. Worse, your costs become unpredictable. If you don’t know your true fuel cost per mile, you can’t price loads confidently.
Fuel strategy is margin strategy. The carrier with a plan makes more from the same miles than the one winging it.
Understanding IFTA Before You Pick a Pump
Some small carriers misunderstand IFTA, and it’s costing them.
Here is a way to break it down plain and simple: you don’t pay fuel tax where you buy fuel—you pay based on where you burn it.
Example: You fuel in Missouri, where pump prices look cheap. Then you run most of your miles in Illinois, where taxes are high. Guess what? You still owe Illinois that higher tax difference.
That’s why the pump sign is misleading. What matters is the base price:
Base Price = Pump Price – State Tax
That’s the number you should be comparing along your route. Smart carriers check base prices before dispatch, not at the pump.
Building Fuel Into Your Route
Don’t wait for the low-fuel light. Don’t leave it up to chance. Build fuel stops into your load plan the same way you schedule pickup windows or HOS breaks.
Here’s how:
1. Identify Fuel Zones
Look at your pickup and delivery points, then overlay fuel tax zones and card discounts. Ask yourself:
-
Where are the low base-price states?
-
Which high-tax states should I avoid fueling in?
-
Do I have card discounts along this corridor?
Sometimes, topping off earlier—before entering a high-tax state—saves you hundreds. Thinking ahead always beats reacting.
2. Use Your Fuel Card Tools
If you’ve got Comdata, EFS, or RTS, you’ve already got route-specific fuel data. Most carriers don’t even check it. Big mistake.",37abb921a864267c1151810c66ade142,trafilatura

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Elon Musk and his social media company X Corp have reached a tentative agreement to settle a lawsuit filed by former Twitter employees who said they were owed $500 million in severance pay.
Attorneys for X Corp and the former Twitter employees reported the deal in a Wednesday court filing, in which both sides asked a U.S. appeals court to delay an upcoming court hearing so that they could finalize a deal that would pay the fired employees and end the litigation. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Musk fired approximately 6,000 employees after his 2022 acquisition of Twitter, which he rebranded X. Several employees sued over their terminations and severance pay, and other lawsuits are still pending in courts in Delaware and California.
The settlement would resolve a proposed class action filed in California by Courtney McMillian, who previously oversaw Twitter's employee benefits programs as its ""head of total rewards,"" and Ronald Cooper, who was an operations manager.
A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed the employees' lawsuit in July 2024, and they appealed to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Court of Appeals. The 9th Circuit had been scheduled to hear oral arguments on September 17.
Attorneys for Musk and McMillian did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
The lawsuit argued that a 2019 severance plan guaranteed that most Twitter workers would receive two months of their base pay plus one week of pay for each full year of service if they were laid off. Senior employees such as McMillian were owed six months of base pay, according to the lawsuit.
But Twitter only gave laid-off workers at most one month of severance pay, and many of them did not receive anything, according to the lawsuit. Twitter laid off more than half of its workforce as a cost-cutting measure after Musk acquired the company.

On August 11, 2025, Bernstein upgraded Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) from 'Market Perform' to 'Outperform', reducing its price target from $4 to $3. The target reduction reflects the 38% single-day decline following disappointing quarterly results. However, the investment firm remains bullish on the company, dismissing the speculation that the company’s Global Distribution System business is structurally broken. Looking ahead, the analyst expects stabilization in SABR’s booking growth, with potential acceleration in 2026 from agency migrations.
Meanwhile, Bernstein highlighted the company’s Passenger Service System contracts, which remain secure, with major clients like American and LATAM airlines locked in until the mid-2030s. Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR)’s lack of major debt maturities until 2027 further stabilizes its short-term growth. The analyst projects a return to profitability this year, forecasting EPS of $0.14, driven by anticipated industry-wide GDS volume growth.
Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) leverages AI and cloud technology to enhance travel intelligence, predicting disruptions and personalizing travel experiences. It is included in our list of the most oversold stocks.
While we acknowledge the potential of SABR as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. — Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack said Thursday that the case for cutting interest rates in September would be a hard one to make given recent economic data.
""There's a lot of data we're going to get between now and September and I walk into every meeting with an open mind about what the right thing to do is, but with the data I have right now and with the information I have, if the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates,” Hammack told Yahoo Finance at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.
Hammack, who said the Fed needs to ""stay laser focused"" on bringing inflation down to its 2% target, joined her colleague, Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid, in describing the current stance of monetary policy as ""modestly restrictive.""

Hammack also indicated the central bank should gain more clarity around the impact tariffs have on inflation before determining whether to cut rates, views echoed by her colleagues, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee and Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic, last week.
""I'm not seeing any signs of potential significant downturns [in the economy], and to me, that's what would require us to move into an easy stance of policy, rather than our currently modestly restrictive stance, so I don't think we have far to go. I think it could be quite some [time],"" said Hammack.
With investors still expecting the Fed will cut rates in the coming weeks — and with pressures building on the Fed politically to begin a rate-cutting cycle — this view puts Hammack and Schmid among those Fed officials still focused on inflation pressures.
Last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that while headline inflation was lower than consensus forecasts, on a ""core"" basis prices rose more than expected. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a read on wholesale prices, also showed inflation pressures building.
""My biggest concern is that inflation has been too high for the past four years. Right now, it's been trending in the wrong direction, and so I think it's really important that we stay modestly restrictive to make sure that we can bring inflation back under control,"" Hammack said.
The July jobs report showed hiring slowed last month, while over 250,000 job additions were revised away from the May and June data, pushing down three-month average payroll growth to just 35,000 per month.",37a73352d226dfdd9c26a188e72b2c6e,trafilatura

See what is happening with TGT stock here.
Here are some key analyst takeaways.
-
DA Davidson analyst Michael Baker reaffirmed a Buy rating, while reducing the price target from $125 to $115.
-
RBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Shemesh reiterated an Outperform rating, while raising the price target from $104 to $107.
-
JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers maintained a Neutral rating and price target of $117.
-
Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman reiterated a Market Perform rating and price target of $110.
Check out other analyst stock ratings.
DA Davidson: Target's results were not good; they were ""less worse than expected,"" Baker said in a note. The pressure on the stock was triggered more by the CEO change, rather than the core business, he added.
The decision could be the right one, as the new CEO Michael Fiddelke has been with Target for 22 years and was with the company during the last few difficult years, as well as during the years when the company thrived, the analyst stated. Fiddelke's focus will be on merchandising style and design, store experience and using AI to boost the pace of decision making, ""make sense to us,"" he further wrote.
RBC Capital Markets: Target's competitive positioning ""has worsened in key areas"" and the leadership transition spells an opportunity for the company to address these issues, Shemesh said. ""We’re hopeful that the Company announces a reinvestment cycle and re-bases 2026 EPS lower, which in our view would make the story attractive to investors,"" he wrote.
There could be some resistance to this strategy, since the current CEO, Brian Cornell, will remain with Target as executive chair of the board and the incoming CEO was part of the strategic planning over the past few years, the analyst stated. He raised the adjusted earnings estimates for 2025 and 2026 from $6.85 per share to $6.92 per share and from $7.41 per share to $7.67 per share, respectively.
JPMorgan: Target's second-quarter results were broadly in line with expectations, with comps and earnings slightly better, Horvers said. Inventory was up only 2% year-on-year at the end of the second quarter, after ending the first quarter up 11%.
The new CEO is scheduled to take office on Feb. 1, 2026, and is likely to focus on ""better execution and higher urgency,"" the analyst stated. Fiddelke's strategies include ""enhancing Target's reputation as an on-trend retailer, providing a more consistent customer experience, and leveraging technology to improve efficiency throughout the business,"" he further wrote.",fc76d25cbd903a0dab9dd5061570eb0b,trafilatura

If you’ve managed to save $1,000 or more (on top of an emergency fund) experts explained some of the best things to do with it next year.
Prepare For a New Economic Environment
The smartest thing to do is to think ahead to plan for the new economic environment, according to Jack Fu, co-founder and managing director at Draco Capital Partners. “In 2026, interest rates may be relatively higher, and market volatility might be more common compared to previous years.” Additionally, “geopolitical change and supply chain adjustment” could continue to create an uncertain investing climate.
On the positive side, Fu said that if the Federal Reserve begins to cut rates, capital may flow back into equities and growth-oriented assets. AI and renewable energy investment trends may also bring new areas of growth.
Find Out: The $50 Mistake Warren Buffett Says Everyone Should Avoid
Invest It Wisely
If you’re bringing $1,000 in savings into 2026 that you don’t need for an emergency fund, you should definitely consider investing it, Fu said.
“If you have no high-interest debt, think about dividing it between low-risk, short-term assets (like money market funds or high-yield savings) and long-term growth investments (like ETFs or stocks) to balance liquidity and long-term appreciation,” he recommended.
Take Risk Tolerance Into Consideration
However, Fu said a lot depends upon the individual investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon.
“For those investors seeking stable returns, consider investment-grade bond ETFs as insulation against inflation,” he said.
For those with a longer time horizon, placing some of the money in actively managed ETFs could allow an investor to “potentially profit from more opportunities than passive index funds.”
Pay Down High-Interest Debt
If you hold money in savings but you’re also carrying any high-interest debt, you might be surprised that it makes more sense to pay down the debt first, Fu said.
“Usually, the interest rate on unsecured debt is much greater than the return you can realistically anticipate from investing, so I’d prioritize paying off the debt.”
Though it may not feel like money going out is an “investment,” Fu said, “This is a sure return equal to the interest saved without taking on investment risk.”",f06c7be3aa115ac466e939b18be64271,trafilatura

The Bentonville behemoth saw second-quarter e-commerce sales grow 26 percent in the U.S., inching up from the “low-20 percent growth range” delivered over the prior four quarters.

According to chief financial officer John David Rainey, deliveries fulfilled from the store increased almost 50 percent from the year prior, with same-day delivery continuing to accelerate.
Approximately one-third of deliveries from store in recent weeks were completed in three hours or less, and 20 percent of those deliveries reached customers in 30 minutes or less.
Three-hour-or-less expedited delivery has been a major priority of the Walmart team since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the company first debuted its Express Delivery service across nearly 2,000 total stores.
As of May 2025, expedited delivery has since been expanded to more than 4,500 U.S. stores. Worldwide, Walmart now offers same-day delivery out of more than 6,500 stores.
“Our customers are responding to our delivery speeds. We see billions and billions of units at a high growth rate being delivered same day,” said John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., during the call. “I’m excited about what the team has done to lean into speed. We’re now covering 93 percent of the country under three hours. We think that will be 95 percent by the end of the year. So our reach is getting better, our speed is improving and customers love being able to deliver with speed.”
Walmart has been able to achieve a rare feat by making its e-commerce operation profitable, achieving profitability for the second straight quarter. Rainey said profitability continued to increase in the second quarter, with progress made on improving net delivery costs and more momentum in advertising as Walmart Connect saw revenues increase 31 percent.
Furner also said the merchandise mix offered online “has been better,” pointing to apparel as a strong point for general merchandise.
Like the Walmart U.S. branch, Sam’s Club also saw 26 percent e-commerce growth, with club-fulfilled delivery representing nearly 50 percent of this increase, even while curbside pickup was up double-digits.
The retail giant’s international presence saw e-commerce growth of 22 percent, with the company again highlighting the strengths of store-fulfilled pickup and delivery in powering that expansion.",9b627b46cf44cee102c541be6a6ce9e0,trafilatura

But that’s not growth—that can mean chaos. Real, sustainable growth comes from clarity. And clarity only comes when you know your numbers inside and out. If you’re not tracking, reviewing, and executing off your data, you’re not scaling—you’re just guessing. And in this industry, guessing will sink you faster than a slow freight week.
The carriers that last aren’t the ones chasing every load. They’re the ones using data to sharpen decisions, protect margins, and grow with intention. Let’s break down the key numbers you need to track, how to make sense of them, and how to actually use them to build a fleet that lasts.
“Visibility Before Velocity”
You can’t manage what you don’t measure. And you sure can’t grow what you don’t understand. Before you even think about expansion, ask yourself:
Do I know my all-in Cost Per Mile (CPM)?
Can I show my net profit per truck for the past 90 days?
Do I know which lanes actually make money and which just burn time?
Am I tracking which brokers pay consistently—and which ones waste my time?
If the answer is anything less than a clear “yes,” hit the brakes. Scaling without data is like flooring it without a fuel gauge. You might move fast, but you won’t move long.
Five Core Metrics That Drive Smarter Growth
You don’t need a fancy TMS subscription or a data analyst on payroll. What you do need is consistency, discipline, and a basic spreadsheet. These five numbers will tell you whether you’re ready to grow—or just asking for headaches.
1. Revenue Per Mile (RPM)
RPM is the pulse of your freight. It’s not about what you gross—it’s about what you keep per mile.
Track both loaded RPM and all-miles RPM. Why? Because deadhead miles and bad routing eat profits alive. Example: you might haul a load at $2.80/mile from Dallas to Atlanta, but if you deadhead 200 miles after, that “good load” looks a whole lot worse.
Smart carriers break RPM down by lane, by broker, and by truck. That’s how you know what to double down on—and what to cut loose.
2. Cost Per Mile (CPM)
This is your break-even line. And it’s non-negotiable.
Your CPM includes fuel, maintenance, insurance, payroll, tolls, ELD fees, trailer rentals—everything.
Here’s why it matters: if your all-in CPM is $1.95 and your RPM is averaging $2.10, your margin is razor thin. Add another truck with the same costs and one bad breakdown? You’re underwater.
Track CPM monthly. It’ll show you if your growth is adding margin—or just adding stress.
3. Net Profit Per Truck
Forget gross—it’s a vanity number.
The only number that matters is what each truck actually nets after all expenses. That’s the number that tells you whether your model works.
If Truck 1 grosses $28,000 in a month but only nets $1,800, adding Truck 2 isn’t a solution—it’s doubling the problem. Fix the first truck before you clone it.
4. Load History by Broker and Lane
Keep track of every single load:
Broker name
Origin and destination
Linehaul rate
Accessorials
Total RPM
Any issues (detention, reschedules, lumpers)
Patterns will jump out fast:
Which brokers value your time
Which lanes deliver consistent RPM
Which zip codes are freight deserts
That becomes your freight map. And the cleaner it is, the less risky growth becomes.
5. Deadhead Miles and Down Time
Silent killers of profitability. Ignore them at your own risk.
Deadhead miles burn fuel and destroy your all-mile RPM. Track them. Set a percentage target. Cut them.
Downtime is just as bad. Every hour your truck sits is an hour it’s not earning. Track delays by customer and location.
Even trimming these by 10% can boost profit—without running one extra mile.
Profit Point: It’s not about running harder—it’s about running smarter.
Four Questions Before You Add a Truck
Am I profitable with one truck? If you’re not netting consistent profit per truck, you’re not ready to scale—you’re ready to fix. If your margin is under $0.25 per mile, growth will bury you.
Do I have repeatable systems? Dispatch, payroll, compliance, maintenance—if those aren’t smooth now, adding more trucks will only magnify the problems. Build the system first. Scale second.
Do I have freight consistency? Load boards are fine when you’re just starting, but if 90% of your freight still comes from random brokers, you don’t have a foundation. Growth needs lanes and relationships you can count on.
Can I handle a 15% rate drop? Rates fall. Always. Stress test your numbers. If a 15% drop wipes you out, don’t grow yet. Build the buffer first.
Execution Tip: You don’t grow because you feel ready—you grow because the numbers prove you’re ready.
Tactical Moves: Making Data Part of the Routine
Monthly Scorecard Track: revenue, RPM (loaded and all miles), CPM, net profit per truck, load count, deadhead %, and maintenance costs. Review every 30 days.
Weekly Load Log One spreadsheet, every load. Date, broker, origin/destination, linehaul, fuel surcharge, accessorials, RPM, issues. Review weekly. That’s your data truth.
Growth Benchmarks
Don’t scale until:
Operating ratio below at least 85%
Deadhead under 12%
Maintenance stable for 2+ months
Quarterly Lane & Broker Audits Audit lanes for net profit. Audit brokers for reliability. Cut the ones that drain margin. Strengthen what works.
Leverage Important Tools Truckstop (lane history & capacity insights), SONAR Blue to Blue (spot rate trends), and even Google Sheets for custom scorecards. No excuses not to track.
Final Word
Trucking is a margin game. And in a margin game, data is the edge.
Don’t grow just because someone offers you more freight. Don’t grow because your cousin wants to drive. Grow because your numbers prove your model works—and your systems can carry the weight.
Every mile you’ve already run has the answers. Your data shows what works, what leaks, and what you should double down on.
The fleets that make it? They don’t confuse motion with progress. They get one truck running clean, consistent, and profitable—and then they duplicate it. That’s how five-truck carriers stay alive long after others flame out.
Guessers burn out. Trackers grow. Which one are you?
Let the numbers lead the way. That’s how smart fleets grow—and stay grown.",a83ebc91447c8a2af5d8ef382962ef1f,trafilatura

“We’re thrilled to welcome Martin and Stephenie to our board of directors,” said Kecia Steelman, president and CEO of Ulta Beauty, in a statement. “Martin is an accomplished, strategic leader with deep international experience in the areas of retailing, merchandising, and brand strategy, while Stephenie has strong operational and digital innovation expertise and sustainability leadership. Their transformative track records and strategic vision will be invaluable as we navigate our next chapter of growth.”
The appointment comes as the beauty retail landscape deals with seismic shifts. Once dominated by both Ulta and Sephora (key competitors for share of mind and wallet in the prestige market), Amazon is now the largest beauty retailer in the U.S., as reported. Abroad, the U.K. appears to be the latest frontier, with Ulta acquiring Space NK just years after Sephora reentered the geography in 2023.
Brok was pivotal to that debut, having architected Sephora’s acquisition of Feelunique in the U.K. and Zalando in Germany. At the time of his departure in 2022, it was “due to a divergence of views,” an internal memo said.
It’s the latest in a slew of big moves from Steelman, who took the helm of Ulta at the top of the year. Geographically, she’s overseeing expansions into Mexico and the Middle East. On the personnel front, she’s named Lauren Brindley its chief merchandising and digital officer, Kelly Mahoney its chief marketing officer, and also announced the ending of its partnership with Target Corp.

Yet too many fleets treat it like an afterthought. If you’re not planning fuel alongside your routes, you’re not running in the most effective way—you’re running blind. And in this market, blind spots cost real money.
The fleets that win don’t chase cheap pumps either. They engineer a fuel plan that ties directly into dispatch. They understand how IFTA works, they use their fuel card data, and they decide before they roll where those gallons are coming from. That’s how you stop bleeding profit at the pump.
Why Some Carriers Overspend on Fuel
It’s not always the pump price that kills you. It’s the lack of a system.
Here’s what happens too often:
-
Drivers fueling wherever the tank runs low.
-
Picking stations out of convenience, not price.
-
Filling up without thinking about base price or state tax.
One week of that might not feel like much. But stretch it over a month, and you’re talking thousands in lost margin. Worse, your costs become unpredictable. If you don’t know your true fuel cost per mile, you can’t price loads confidently.
Fuel strategy is margin strategy. The carrier with a plan makes more from the same miles than the one winging it.
Understanding IFTA Before You Pick a Pump
Some small carriers misunderstand IFTA, and it’s costing them.
Here is a way to break it down plain and simple: you don’t pay fuel tax where you buy fuel—you pay based on where you burn it.
Example: You fuel in Missouri, where pump prices look cheap. Then you run most of your miles in Illinois, where taxes are high. Guess what? You still owe Illinois that higher tax difference.
That’s why the pump sign is misleading. What matters is the base price:
Base Price = Pump Price – State Tax
That’s the number you should be comparing along your route. Smart carriers check base prices before dispatch, not at the pump.
Building Fuel Into Your Route
Don’t wait for the low-fuel light. Don’t leave it up to chance. Build fuel stops into your load plan the same way you schedule pickup windows or HOS breaks.
Here’s how:
1. Identify Fuel Zones
Look at your pickup and delivery points, then overlay fuel tax zones and card discounts. Ask yourself:
-
Where are the low base-price states?
-
Which high-tax states should I avoid fueling in?
-
Do I have card discounts along this corridor?
Sometimes, topping off earlier—before entering a high-tax state—saves you hundreds. Thinking ahead always beats reacting.
2. Use Your Fuel Card Tools
If you’ve got Comdata, EFS, or RTS, you’ve already got route-specific fuel data. Most carriers don’t even check it. Big mistake.",37abb921a864267c1151810c66ade142,trafilatura

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Elon Musk and his social media company X Corp have reached a tentative agreement to settle a lawsuit filed by former Twitter employees who said they were owed $500 million in severance pay.
Attorneys for X Corp and the former Twitter employees reported the deal in a Wednesday court filing, in which both sides asked a U.S. appeals court to delay an upcoming court hearing so that they could finalize a deal that would pay the fired employees and end the litigation. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Musk fired approximately 6,000 employees after his 2022 acquisition of Twitter, which he rebranded X. Several employees sued over their terminations and severance pay, and other lawsuits are still pending in courts in Delaware and California.
The settlement would resolve a proposed class action filed in California by Courtney McMillian, who previously oversaw Twitter's employee benefits programs as its ""head of total rewards,"" and Ronald Cooper, who was an operations manager.
A federal judge in San Francisco dismissed the employees' lawsuit in July 2024, and they appealed to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Court of Appeals. The 9th Circuit had been scheduled to hear oral arguments on September 17.
Attorneys for Musk and McMillian did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
The lawsuit argued that a 2019 severance plan guaranteed that most Twitter workers would receive two months of their base pay plus one week of pay for each full year of service if they were laid off. Senior employees such as McMillian were owed six months of base pay, according to the lawsuit.
But Twitter only gave laid-off workers at most one month of severance pay, and many of them did not receive anything, according to the lawsuit. Twitter laid off more than half of its workforce as a cost-cutting measure after Musk acquired the company.

On August 11, 2025, Bernstein upgraded Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) from 'Market Perform' to 'Outperform', reducing its price target from $4 to $3. The target reduction reflects the 38% single-day decline following disappointing quarterly results. However, the investment firm remains bullish on the company, dismissing the speculation that the company’s Global Distribution System business is structurally broken. Looking ahead, the analyst expects stabilization in SABR’s booking growth, with potential acceleration in 2026 from agency migrations.
Meanwhile, Bernstein highlighted the company’s Passenger Service System contracts, which remain secure, with major clients like American and LATAM airlines locked in until the mid-2030s. Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR)’s lack of major debt maturities until 2027 further stabilizes its short-term growth. The analyst projects a return to profitability this year, forecasting EPS of $0.14, driven by anticipated industry-wide GDS volume growth.
Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR) leverages AI and cloud technology to enhance travel intelligence, predicting disruptions and personalizing travel experiences. It is included in our list of the most oversold stocks.

JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. — Cleveland Fed president Beth Hammack said Thursday that the case for cutting interest rates in September would be a hard one to make given recent economic data.
""There's a lot of data we're going to get between now and September and I walk into every meeting with an open mind about what the right thing to do is, but with the data I have right now and with the information I have, if the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates,” Hammack told Yahoo Finance at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.
Hammack, who said the Fed needs to ""stay laser focused"" on bringing inflation down to its 2% target, joined her colleague, Kansas City Fed president Jeffrey Schmid, in describing the current stance of monetary policy as ""modestly restrictive.""

Hammack also indicated the central bank should gain more clarity around the impact tariffs have on inflation before determining whether to cut rates, views echoed by her colleagues, Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee and Atlanta Fed president Raphael Bostic, last week.
""I'm not seeing any signs of potential significant downturns [in the economy], and to me, that's what would require us to move into an easy stance of policy, rather than our currently modestly restrictive stance, so I don't think we have far to go. I think it could be quite some [time],"" said Hammack.
With investors still expecting the Fed will cut rates in the coming weeks — and with pressures building on the Fed politically to begin a rate-cutting cycle — this view puts Hammack and Schmid among those Fed officials still focused on inflation pressures.
Last week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed that while headline inflation was lower than consensus forecasts, on a ""core"" basis prices rose more than expected. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a read on wholesale prices, also showed inflation pressures building.
""My biggest concern is that inflation has been too high for the past four years. Right now, it's been trending in the wrong direction, and so I think it's really important that we stay modestly restrictive to make sure that we can bring inflation back under control,"" Hammack said.
The July jobs report showed hiring slowed last month, while over 250,000 job additions were revised away from the May and June data, pushing down three-month average payroll growth to just 35,000 per month.",37a73352d226dfdd9c26a188e72b2c6e,trafilatura

DA Davidson: Target's results were not good; they were ""less worse than expected,"" Baker said in a note. The pressure on the stock was triggered more by the CEO change, rather than the core business, he added.
The decision could be the right one, as the new CEO Michael Fiddelke has been with Target for 22 years and was with the company during the last few difficult years, as well as during the years when the company thrived, the analyst stated. Fiddelke's focus will be on merchandising style and design, store experience and using AI to boost the pace of decision making, ""make sense to us,"" he further wrote.
RBC Capital Markets: Target's competitive positioning ""has worsened in key areas"" and the leadership transition spells an opportunity for the company to address these issues, Shemesh said. ""We’re hopeful that the Company announces a reinvestment cycle and re-bases 2026 EPS lower, which in our view would make the story attractive to investors,"" he wrote.
There could be some resistance to this strategy, since the current CEO, Brian Cornell, will remain with Target as executive chair of the board and the incoming CEO was part of the strategic planning over the past few years, the analyst stated. He raised the adjusted earnings estimates for 2025 and 2026 from $6.85 per share to $6.92 per share and from $7.41 per share to $7.67 per share, respectively.
JPMorgan: Target's second-quarter results were broadly in line with expectations, with comps and earnings slightly better, Horvers said. Inventory was up only 2% year-on-year at the end of the second quarter, after ending the first quarter up 11%.
The new CEO is scheduled to take office on Feb. 1, 2026, and is likely to focus on ""better execution and higher urgency,"" the analyst stated. Fiddelke's strategies include ""enhancing Target's reputation as an on-trend retailer, providing a more consistent customer experience, and leveraging technology to improve efficiency throughout the business,"" he further wrote.",fc76d25cbd903a0dab9dd5061570eb0b,trafilatura

If you’ve managed to save $1,000 or more (on top of an emergency fund) experts explained some of the best things to do with it next year.
Prepare For a New Economic Environment
The smartest thing to do is to think ahead to plan for the new economic environment, according to Jack Fu, co-founder and managing director at Draco Capital Partners. “In 2026, interest rates may be relatively higher, and market volatility might be more common compared to previous years.” Additionally, “geopolitical change and supply chain adjustment” could continue to create an uncertain investing climate.
On the positive side, Fu said that if the Federal Reserve begins to cut rates, capital may flow back into equities and growth-oriented assets. AI and renewable energy investment trends may also bring new areas of growth.
Find Out: The $50 Mistake Warren Buffett Says Everyone Should Avoid
Invest It Wisely
If you’re bringing $1,000 in savings into 2026 that you don’t need for an emergency fund, you should definitely consider investing it, Fu said.
“If you have no high-interest debt, think about dividing it between low-risk, short-term assets (like money market funds or high-yield savings) and long-term growth investments (like ETFs or stocks) to balance liquidity and long-term appreciation,” he recommended.
Take Risk Tolerance Into Consideration
However, Fu said a lot depends upon the individual investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon.
“For those investors seeking stable returns, consider investment-grade bond ETFs as insulation against inflation,” he said.
For those with a longer time horizon, placing some of the money in actively managed ETFs could allow an investor to “potentially profit from more opportunities than passive index funds.”
Pay Down High-Interest Debt
If you hold money in savings but you’re also carrying any high-interest debt, you might be surprised that it makes more sense to pay down the debt first, Fu said.
“Usually, the interest rate on unsecured debt is much greater than the return you can realistically anticipate from investing, so I’d prioritize paying off the debt.”
Though it may not feel like money going out is an “investment,” Fu said, “This is a sure return equal to the interest saved without taking on investment risk.”",f06c7be3aa115ac466e939b18be64271,trafilatura

The Bentonville behemoth saw second-quarter e-commerce sales grow 26 percent in the U.S., inching up from the “low-20 percent growth range” delivered over the prior four quarters.

According to chief financial officer John David Rainey, deliveries fulfilled from the store increased almost 50 percent from the year prior, with same-day delivery continuing to accelerate.
Approximately one-third of deliveries from store in recent weeks were completed in three hours or less, and 20 percent of those deliveries reached customers in 30 minutes or less.
Three-hour-or-less expedited delivery has been a major priority of the Walmart team since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when the company first debuted its Express Delivery service across nearly 2,000 total stores.
As of May 2025, expedited delivery has since been expanded to more than 4,500 U.S. stores. Worldwide, Walmart now offers same-day delivery out of more than 6,500 stores.
“Our customers are responding to our delivery speeds. We see billions and billions of units at a high growth rate being delivered same day,” said John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., during the call. “I’m excited about what the team has done to lean into speed. We’re now covering 93 percent of the country under three hours. We think that will be 95 percent by the end of the year. So our reach is getting better, our speed is improving and customers love being able to deliver with speed.”
Walmart has been able to achieve a rare feat by making its e-commerce operation profitable, achieving profitability for the second straight quarter. Rainey said profitability continued to increase in the second quarter, with progress made on improving net delivery costs and more momentum in advertising as Walmart Connect saw revenues increase 31 percent.
Furner also said the merchandise mix offered online “has been better,” pointing to apparel as a strong point for general merchandise.
Like the Walmart U.S. branch, Sam’s Club also saw 26 percent e-commerce growth, with club-fulfilled delivery representing nearly 50 percent of this increase, even while curbside pickup was up double-digits.
The retail giant’s international presence saw e-commerce growth of 22 percent, with the company again highlighting the strengths of store-fulfilled pickup and delivery in powering that expansion.",9b627b46cf44cee102c541be6a6ce9e0,trafilatura

But that’s not growth—that can mean chaos. Real, sustainable growth comes from clarity. And clarity only comes when you know your numbers inside and out. If you’re not tracking, reviewing, and executing off your data, you’re not scaling—you’re just guessing. And in this industry, guessing will sink you faster than a slow freight week.
The carriers that last aren’t the ones chasing every load. They’re the ones using data to sharpen decisions, protect margins, and grow with intention. Let’s break down the key numbers you need to track, how to make sense of them, and how to actually use them to build a fleet that lasts.
“Visibility Before Velocity”
You can’t manage what you don’t measure. And you sure can’t grow what you don’t understand. Before you even think about expansion, ask yourself:
Do I know my all-in Cost Per Mile (CPM)?
Can I show my net profit per truck for the past 90 days?
Do I know which lanes actually make money and which just burn time?
Am I tracking which brokers pay consistently—and which ones waste my time?
If the answer is anything less than a clear “yes,” hit the brakes. Scaling without data is like flooring it without a fuel gauge. You might move fast, but you won’t move long.
Five Core Metrics That Drive Smarter Growth
You don’t need a fancy TMS subscription or a data analyst on payroll. What you do need is consistency, discipline, and a basic spreadsheet. These five numbers will tell you whether you’re ready to grow—or just asking for headaches.
1. Revenue Per Mile (RPM)
RPM is the pulse of your freight. It’s not about what you gross—it’s about what you keep per mile.
Track both loaded RPM and all-miles RPM. Why? Because deadhead miles and bad routing eat profits alive. Example: you might haul a load at $2.80/mile from Dallas to Atlanta, but if you deadhead 200 miles after, that “good load” looks a whole lot worse.
Smart carriers break RPM down by lane, by broker, and by truck. That’s how you know what to double down on—and what to cut loose.
2. Cost Per Mile (CPM)
This is your break-even line. And it’s non-negotiable.
Your CPM includes fuel, maintenance, insurance, payroll, tolls, ELD fees, trailer rentals—everything.
Here’s why it matters: if your all-in CPM is $1.95 and your RPM is averaging $2.10, your margin is razor thin. Add another truck with the same costs and one bad breakdown? You’re underwater.
Track CPM monthly. It’ll show you if your growth is adding margin—or just adding stress.
3. Net Profit Per Truck
Forget gross—it’s a vanity number.
The only number that matters is what each truck actually nets after all expenses. That’s the number that tells you whether your model works.
If Truck 1 grosses $28,000 in a month but only nets $1,800, adding Truck 2 isn’t a solution—it’s doubling the problem. Fix the first truck before you clone it.
4. Load History by Broker and Lane
Keep track of every single load:
Broker name
Origin and destination
Linehaul rate
Accessorials
Total RPM
Any issues (detention, reschedules, lumpers)
Patterns will jump out fast:
Which brokers value your time
Which lanes deliver consistent RPM
Which zip codes are freight deserts
That becomes your freight map. And the cleaner it is, the less risky growth becomes.
5. Deadhead Miles and Down Time
Silent killers of profitability. Ignore them at your own risk.
Deadhead miles burn fuel and destroy your all-mile RPM. Track them. Set a percentage target. Cut them.
Downtime is just as bad. Every hour your truck sits is an hour it’s not earning. Track delays by customer and location.
Even trimming these by 10% can boost profit—without running one extra mile.
Profit Point: It’s not about running harder—it’s about running smarter.
Four Questions Before You Add a Truck
Am I profitable with one truck? If you’re not netting consistent profit per truck, you’re not ready to scale—you’re ready to fix. If your margin is under $0.25 per mile, growth will bury you.
Do I have repeatable systems? Dispatch, payroll, compliance, maintenance—if those aren’t smooth now, adding more trucks will only magnify the problems. Build the system first. Scale second.
Do I have freight consistency? Load boards are fine when you’re just starting, but if 90% of your freight still comes from random brokers, you don’t have a foundation. Growth needs lanes and relationships you can count on.
Can I handle a 15% rate drop? Rates fall. Always. Stress test your numbers. If a 15% drop wipes you out, don’t grow yet. Build the buffer first.
Execution Tip: You don’t grow because you feel ready—you grow because the numbers prove you’re ready.
Tactical Moves: Making Data Part of the Routine
Monthly Scorecard Track: revenue, RPM (loaded and all miles), CPM, net profit per truck, load count, deadhead %, and maintenance costs. Review every 30 days.
Weekly Load Log One spreadsheet, every load. Date, broker, origin/destination, linehaul, fuel surcharge, accessorials, RPM, issues. Review weekly. That’s your data truth.
Growth Benchmarks
Don’t scale until:
Operating ratio below at least 85%
Deadhead under 12%
Maintenance stable for 2+ months
Quarterly Lane & Broker Audits Audit lanes for net profit. Audit brokers for reliability. Cut the ones that drain margin. Strengthen what works.
Leverage Important Tools Truckstop (lane history & capacity insights), SONAR Blue to Blue (spot rate trends), and even Google Sheets for custom scorecards. No excuses not to track.
Final Word
Trucking is a margin game. And in a margin game, data is the edge.
Don’t grow just because someone offers you more freight. Don’t grow because your cousin wants to drive. Grow because your numbers prove your model works—and your systems can carry the weight.
Every mile you’ve already run has the answers. Your data shows what works, what leaks, and what you should double down on.
The fleets that make it? They don’t confuse motion with progress. They get one truck running clean, consistent, and profitable—and then they duplicate it. That’s how five-truck carriers stay alive long after others flame out.
Guessers burn out. Trackers grow. Which one are you?
Let the numbers lead the way. That’s how smart fleets grow—and stay grown.",a83ebc91447c8a2af5d8ef382962ef1f,trafilatura

Following the lead of at least a dozen other states and the District of Columbia, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison sued the social media company over claims that it intentionally causes minors to become habitually dependent on its platform and contributes to a decline in their mental health.
In a redacted 96-page complaint that makes similar allegations to those filed by other states, Ellison accused TikTok of deliberately taking advantage of children’s underdeveloped ""neurological reward systems"" that it says drive desire and motivation.
“Children’s developing brains are no match for TikTok’s sophisticated mix of ‘digital nicotine’ and deception,” the lawsuit states.
A spokesperson for TikTok said the lawsuit is based on ""misleading and inaccurate claims"" that fail to recognize its robust safety measures.
""Teen accounts on TikTok come with 50+ features and settings designed to help young people safely express themselves, discover and learn. Through our Family Pairing tool, parents can view or customize 20+ content and privacy settings, including screen time, content filters, and our time away feature to pause a teen’s access to our app.""
According to the complaint, TikTok's addictive features help it collect highly personal data about its minor users, including their location, interest, beliefs, and viewing or purchasing habits — which it then uses to keep them on the platform, where it can sell highly targeted advertising space.
Minnesota’s complaint alleges violations of Minnesota’s Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act, and Money Transmission Act. It asks for a judge to fine the company up to $25,000 for each alleged violation and permanently block TikTok from engaging in the allegedly harmful activities.
A consolidated group of similar claims brought by parents of minor TikTok users is also pending in a federal multi-district litigation in California.
The specific features identified as additive in Minnesota’s complaint include its recommendation engine, which draws upon a user’s unique data to serve personalized content, as well as its infinite scroll feature, push notifications, and image-distorting filters.
The lawsuit also targets TikTok LIVE for use of a virtual currency system it calls unlicensed and says it leads children to make impulsive purchases.
TikTok sells icon-based virtual currency to its users, which can be sent as gifts to live streaming users, then converted to real currency. TikTok takes a cut of the transactions, which netted the company $1.7 billion during one quarter in 2023, the suit claims.",cc8b2103ba0bfcf2bde17cc5340ee449,trafilatura

(NASDAQ:MNDY) shares are trading lower on Thursday.
The firm is facing growth concerns as SEO-driven traffic declines and rising marketing costs point to potential self-serve headwinds.
Bank of America Securities Matt Bullock downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral, lowering the price forecast from $240 to $205.
Also Read: This Maplebear Analyst Turns Bearish; Here Are Top 3 Downgrades For Thursday
Bullock downgraded the stock after reviewing web traffic trends by channel.
He noted that SEO-driven visits fell 23.5% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, with the decline worsening to 25.3% in July, likely due to Google’s broader rollout of AI Overviews.
Since less than 30% of signups come from Google, he built a framework using Similarweb data to gauge growth impact.
Bullock said that while shares are already down 30% since the second quarter earnings, ongoing fundamental challenges and AI-driven search risks make risk/reward balanced.
The analyst is not calling for a 2025 revenue guide miss but trimmed 2026 revenue estimates and cut his price target to $205 from $240.
Bullock warned that if July 2025 traffic declines persist, Monday.com could see meaningful self-serve headwinds in the second half of 2025 and 2026.
Extending July’s traffic trends forward, Bullock’s analysis implies a 5.2% decline in self-serve gross ARR added in 2026, translating to about a 2-point drag on total gross ARR added for that year.

Subway named Tracy Gehlan as president of its Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) division.
Gehlan previously served as senior vice president EMEA and chief operating officer international at Hertz Global Holdings. She also

If you were planning to undertake a Roth IRA conversion this year, the newly introduced One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) won’t necessarily impact you directly.
However, the bill has an indirect impact that could make a Roth IRA conversion more or less attractive, depending on your age and income.
Here’s a closer look at how this sweeping new tax bill could change your approach to a Roth IRA conversion this year.
New senior deduction
Perhaps the most noteworthy aspect of the OBBB is the new deduction for seniors across America. Taxpayers who are 65 or older can now claim an extra $6,000 as a tax deduction above their standard deduction and additional standard deduction, effectively reducing their tax liability.
This senior deduction is per filer, so a couple filing together could get up to $12,000 in additional deductions as a result of the new tax act.
In theory, the deduction could save you money and provide you with greater tax-free room during a Roth IRA conversion.
That’s because any cash converted from your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA is regarded as regular income, meaning you will pay taxes on it during the process.
Effectively, the senior deduction could make a Roth IRA conversion more attractive. However, there are some limitations on the deduction that could make it less attractive depending on your income and time horizons.
Although this new senior deduction may seem attractive, it isn’t permanent, and it isn’t available to everyone.
The full deduction is only applicable for those who earn $75,000 or less individually, or $150,000 or less as a couple. Beyond those thresholds, the deduction amount is gradually phased down and fully phased out at $175,000 for individual taxpayers, and $250,000 for couples.
If you attempt a Roth IRA conversion and the cash you convert pushes your adjusted gross income (AGI) over these thresholds, then your deduction could be impacted.
If you earn a relatively high income and are looking to convert a large amount, you could even eliminate the senior deduction completely, missing out on valuable tax savings.
For example, if a married couple had a household income of $140,000, and they were considering a $20,000 Roth IRA conversion, that move would push their AGI to $160,000, placing them beyond the $150,000 threshold for the new senior deduction, meaning they would not receive the full $12,000 deduction that was previously available to them.
That means the effective cost of converting to a Roth IRA could be higher than expected — not only because of the added taxable income, but also because you’d lose a valuable deduction in the process.
High-income households and backdoor Roth IRA contributions
With that being said, there are still ways for high-earners to access the benefits of a Roth IRA — in particular, that tax-free withdrawal come retirement.
Roth IRAs don’t allow joint filers making above $246,000 or individuals making more than $165,000 in modified adjusted gross income to make contributions. But there’s no rule stopping you from contributing to a traditional IRA and then converting it into a Roth IRA.
With that said, be careful if you have any other non-Roth IRAs, including those that may have rolled over from an existing 403(b) or 401(k). As far as the IRS is concerned, under pro-rata rules, all of your non-Roth IRAs will be assessed as one sum to determine the taxes owing on your after-tax IRA contribution.
This can torpedo your potential tax savings if you aren’t careful.

The bottom line
You might consider spreading out your Roth IRA conversion over multiple years. For instance, instead of converting $20,000 this year, you could convert $7,000 every year for the next three years, maintaining your eligibility for the new tax deduction.
However, the senior deduction is only available for tax years 2025 through 2028, which means you have a limited window to maximize tax savings while converting to a Roth IRA account.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Miner and trader Glencore will aim to produce nearly 1 million tons of copper annually at its planned El Pachon and Agua Rica projects in Argentina over the next 10 to 15 years, the company's CEO in the Latin American country said on Thursday.
Argentina does not currently produce any copper, but several major miners are proposing projects that could make the country an important global supplier.
Glencore earlier this week applied for its Argentina projects to qualify for the government's Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), saying it would spend $4 billion to develop Agua Rica and $9.5 billion to develop El Pachon.
Glencore's Argentina CEO Martin Perez de Solay said he anticipated initial production of 500,000 metric tons of copper a year from the projects, and that El Pachon in particular was poised for significant growth in output.
""Glencore could be producing close to 1 million tons of copper in Argentina in 10 to 15 years,"" he said at an event organized by the Council of the Americas.
He did not give a timeframe for production to start, but said he anticipated strong prices by the time the copper went on the market and global copper demand was likely to reach 35 million tons by 2035.
De Solay said seven of the main projects in Argentina could produce 2 million tons of copper annually in 10 years, with investment ranging from $35 billion to $45 billion.
""Two-thirds of the investment remains in Argentina, so it's essential for the foreign exchange balance,"" de Solay said
He estimated that the output could yield $20 billion a year in exports.
Argentina has not produced copper since the closure of the Bajo de la Alumbrera mine in 2018.

(Reuters) -Big first-day gains by recent high-profile U.S. listings have raised questions over whether Wall Street banks — wary of volatility and economic uncertainty from sweeping U.S. tariffs — are pricing them too cautiously, benefiting investors but causing issuers to miss out.
The 20 biggest U.S. IPOs this year — among them software maker Figma and stablecoin issuer Circle — averaged a first-day pop of 36%, a Reuters calculations using data compiled by LSEG showed.
That was much higher than the 15% to 20% rise that analysts considered the sweet spot, enough to reward investors for taking the risk without underpricing the offering.
If the 20 listings were priced closer to this range, it could have netted the companies $6.1 billion more in proceeds, a separate analysis of Dealogic data showed.
Banks are often accused of underpricing IPOs to avoid embarrassing flops. But underwriters are more cautious because IPOs on hold for years due to higher interest rates are looking to debut amid tariff worries and choppy retail demand, according to four analysts, two venture capital executives and two industry experts.
""In today's market, conservative IPO pricing is a strategic choice designed to build positive momentum and long-term brand equity (for issuers),"" said Lukas Muehlbauer, research analyst at IPO research firm IPOX.
A solid debut also makes it easier for companies to tap follow-up capital, he said.
Shares of Figma popped 250% and Circle 168% in their debuts. Crypto exchange Bullish closed its first session nearly 84% above the IPO price.
The companies and their lead underwriters either declined to comment or did not respond to requests seeking comment.
'BROKEN' PROCESS
Market turmoil sparked by Trump's global trade war soured the chances of a blockbuster first quarter for deals, but optimism over his deregulatory policies and expectations of interest-rates cuts have helped the S&P 500 hit new records, reviving the IPO market.
While modest pricing may draw investors in choppy markets, critics said it would be at the expense of issuers, who may raise less capital.
""IPO pops are a reminder that the process remains broken,"" said Phil Haslett, co-founder of EquityZen, one of the largest pre-IPO stock platforms.
""The traditional roadshow is designed to secure commitments from institutional investors, largely failing to account for what we see as significant levels of retail investor demand.""
That blind spot leaves banks guessing how retail buyers will respond on day one, increasing the chances of sharp trading swings.",3b0e2e4cd341405ac92ba553cde48376,trafilatura

In today's big story, BI's Hugh Langley exclusively reports on Google ramping up the pressure on workers to use AI for everything — or risk falling behind. Googlers told Hugh how they feel about it.
What's on deck:
Markets: Infamous market bear Michael Burry appears to have flipped his stance on stocks.
Tech: Hundreds of Microsoft employees are comparing compensation in a giant spreadsheet, BI exclusively reports.
For Googlers, the message is clear: use AI to make yourself more productive — or get left behind.
Some are excited about it, others are doing it grudgingly, one Google engineer told Hugh. Either way, their boss needs them to do it.
Google is under pressure. In an all-hands meeting last month, CEO Sundar Pichai said that as rival companies leverage AI, Google needs to rise to the challenge if it wants to compete, employees who heard the remarks told BI.
In a frank blog post, GitHub's CEO said developers have a choice: embrace AI, or ""get out of your career.""
The rivals are becoming lean, mean, and increasingly machine. These directives apply as much to the companies as to their workers. If they fall behind their competitors — as a worker may fall behind a colleague — they risk never catching up.
The future of the software engineering profession will be a tale of the haves and have-nots.
That's according to Meta's chief technology officer. ""The engineers who master the tools to the point that they can't themselves be replaced by the tools command a premium,"" he said on Monday.
Google seems to know this — and it's watching its engineers closely. Pichai said in June that engineers' weekly productivity hours are up 10% thanks to AI.
Some companies are tracking employee AI use on a more granular level. Three providers of worker-tracking software told BI they've seen a sharp rise in demand over the past two years. Companies want their workers to use AI, and they aren't taking risks.
It can be an unpleasant message to hear. Few people enjoy receiving instructions that come with stark warnings. That said, the Google employees who spoke with BI seem on board.
""It seems like a no-brainer that you need to be using it to get ahead,"" one engineer told Hugh.
In Google's internal message board, BI found more skeptical remarks: ""You know a technology works and is great when you're forced to praise it to maintain your livelihood.""
In this race, it seems there is no medal for second place. In the end, there may only be the companies that kept up, and the ones that didn't.

1. JPMorgan's new HQ blurs the lines between work and life. The bank's new Midtown Manhattan office is filled with a luxury gym, a massive food hall, a 24/7 grab-and-go option, and more. Headhunters, consultants, and management experts told BI those wrap-around perks reinforce Wall Street's work-as-life culture, though.
2. Don't lose faith in major tech stocks. This week's sell-off is likely driven by anticipation of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at Jackson Hole on Friday, wealth manager Jeremy Hartle told BI. UBS said it's still confident in the sector despite the selling.
3. The ""Big Short"" investor seems to have done a 180. Michael Burry, one of the market's most famous bears, appears to have overhauled his stock portfolio, according to an update from his firm last week. He's swapping bearish puts for bullish calls, and is betting on ailing companies like Lululemon to execute a turnaround, portfolio gurus told BI.
3 things in tech
1. How much Microsoft employees say they make. It's review season at the software giant, and employees are comparing notes on compensation in a large spreadsheet, BI's Ashley Stewart exclusively reports. With 850 entries and counting, here's what employees across cloud, AI, and other teams have said they earn in salary, stock, and bonuses.
2. Inside Meta's massive AI restructuring. Alexandr Wang, the leader of Meta Superintelligence Labs, announced the biggest reorganization of the company's AI operations in a memo sent to employees. Most team leaders will report to Wang, and the company will dissolve yet another major AI unit.
3. It's not just AI talent: Google is paying the big bucks for celebs. Google flexed its marketing might with a star-studded Pixel event, featuring cameos from ""Call Her Daddy"" podcaster Alex Cooper, NBA star Steph Curry, and more. The tech giant also announced a new partnership with Curry, who will serve as its ""Performance Advisor"" across its various products.
3 things in business
1. Sin City's sluggish summer. Las Vegas is in the middle of a vibe shift. Since gambling has expanded to other cities and consumers are starting to expect more high-end experiences, Vegas is losing some of its appeal to the more budget-conscious thrill-seekers. But it's not dead yet.
2. Target's new CEO has a plan to get the retailer back on track. In its earnings call, Target announced COO Michael Fiddelke will take over as CEO in February. Fiddelke, who spent the past quarter leading a new acceleration effort, laid out a three-part plan that he said is based on ""knowing what makes Target Target.""
3. TJX's secret weapon to keep prices low. As other retailers have started passing tariff costs onto consumers, the company behind T.J.

(Reuters) -President Donald Trump's administration is expected to rule on a growing backlog of requests from small oil refiners seeking relief from U.S. biofuel laws as early as Friday, but will delay a decision on whether larger refiners must compensate by boosting their own biofuel blending, according to two sources familiar with the planning.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Friday will announce decisions on some of the 195 pending small refinery exemption requests that date back as far as 2016, the sources said. The rulings will not be a sweeping win for small refiners, and will include some partial denials of waivers, according to one of the sources briefed on the decisions.
The administration is also expected to issue a supplemental rule as early as next week to seek public comment on whether larger refiners should make up for the exempted gallons in a process known as reallocation, the source said.
How the administration deals with exemption requests and the reallocation issues will have consequences for the oil and agricultural industries, and impact the price of commodities from gasoline and renewable diesel to soybeans and corn, along with the companies that produce them.
In the past, widespread exemptions without reallocation have sent renewable blending credit prices lower, denting prices for corn-based ethanol and soybean-based biofuel.
The EPA and White House did not respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool or by the tradable credits, known as RINs, from refiners who do. Small refiners can petition the EPA to receive an exemption if they can show financial hardship.
The EPA has a mounting backlog of such requests going back years - the result of political indecision and legal wrangling across multiple administrations. Both the agriculture and the oil industries are keen for resolution.
Granting exemptions without forcing other refiners to make up the difference increases the supply of credits and puts downward pressure on their prices.
Farm and biofuel groups have lobbied the EPA to limit the number of exemptions and to force other refiners to make up for exempted gallons.
The oil industry is strongly opposed to reallocation, arguing it creates an uneven playing field and imposes burdensome regulatory costs.
The EPA said earlier this year that it would force larger refiners to make up for future exempted gallons, but was silent on how it would treat exempt gallons from the dozens of backlogged requests.",3de781d795b709016ae30d3ed130fa20,trafilatura

The market being targeted by these improvements, however, may or may not be interested when these vehicles become available.
Although a risky bet, Ford stock's low valuation already prices in most (if not all) of this risk.
Big news from Ford Motor Company(NYSE: F): The automaker's investing another $5 billion in its electric vehicle business, hoping to drive much-needed sales growth while simultaneously fending off would-be Chinese competitors. The company made the announcement last week.
And, kudos. Most long-term shareholders would agree Ford needs to do something -- anything -- to light a fire under its lethargic stock. Ford shares are still priced where they were in 2002, after all, even if decent dividends have been paid for most of the meantime.
What's not clear is if this is the best move Ford could make at this time to get shares moving again. Here's what investors need to know about the plan.
This investment rethinks its electric vehicles from the ground up
The company's already in the EV business, to be clear. It makes a handful of hybrids, although its highest-profile electric vehicles are arguably its all-electric F-150 Lightning and a pretty cool all-electric Mustang called the Mach-E.
With the exception of their batteries and electric motors, however, these EVs are still designed and manufactured rather similarly to ordinary combustion-powered automobiles. Ford's $5 billion plan includes a whole new kind of assembly line specifically for electric vehicles. And not just one. This assembly line will be capable of supporting the manufacture of several different kinds of vehicles including a light pickup truck with a targeted starting price point of around $30,000.
More than half of the $5 billion investment, however, will be made in the lithium batteries required by all electric vehicles. Ford says its new battery tech can lower the size and cost of EV batteries by around one-third without sacrificing any range per charge, solving one of the EV industry's biggest lingering problems.
Ford's existing EV business isn't exactly thrilling ... or profitable
As exciting as this decision may be, again, it's not exactly Ford's foray into the electric vehicle market. It's the company's second (and perhaps third) chapter. And its story to date hasn't exactly been thrilling. The aforementioned Mustang Mach-E became available in 2021, while the F-150 Lightning and a new delivery van reached the market in 2022. A few more Ford-made hybrids have been unveiled since then as well. Yet, Ford only sold $3.9 billion worth of electric vehicles last year, down 35% year over year, and only accounting for about 2% of its total top line of $185 billion. Its EV arm also lost a little over $5 billion in 2024, on an operating basis.
It's a concern simply because it's difficult to determine if the challenge is a lack of production scale, a lack of demand, or a combination of both.
The ambitious goal may be aimed at the wrong market
Ford will almost certainly do it right. But, figuring out how to make an affordable and marketable electric vehicle may be of little actual benefit to shareholders.
Simply put, Americans as a whole are anything but stoked about battery-powered automobiles. A recent survey performed by the American Automobile Association (which you know as AAA) indicates that only 16% of U.S. adults are likely or very likely to purchase a fully electric automobile. That's down from 2024's figure of 18%, marking three years of declines from 2022's 25%. Conversely, the number of American consumers who are unlikely or very unlikely to purchase an EV has grown from 51% to 63% during that four-year stretch.
Ford isn't just a U.S. company, to be clear. It also makes and markets vehicles overseas -- even if largely through partnerships -- where EVs are considerably and increasingly more marketable. For instance, the International Energy Agency believes that 80% of China's new automobile sales will be EVs by 2030, versus only about half of the country's new-car sales now.
Ford is mostly an American company though, where it produces roughly two-thirds of its total sales and very nearly all of its profits. And, while the U.S. company's electric vehicle production know-how and battery technology could be utilized elsewhere, it's difficult not to notice the American-ness of its $5 billion plan. The EV production facility in question is located in Louisville, Kentucky, while the new-tech lithium batteries will be manufactured in Marshall, Michigan. Let's also not look past the fact that the one vehicle Ford has touted that will be made by this new assembly line is a low-cost pickup truck, which, of course, is wildly more popular here than anywhere else in the world.
This is (almost) an all-in bet on the company's future
Given the American-centric nature of Ford's big investment in EVs, largely aimed at a market that isn't exactly in love with battery-powered vehicles, the concerns being voiced are understandable.
Although the cost doesn't quite present the existential crisis that some analysts are hinting at, it is a sizable bet for any struggling company that only clears about $5 billion in net income per year and is sitting on more than $100 billion in long-term liabilities. If Americans don't come around on electric vehicles by the time they start coming off of Ford's new assembly line in 2027, the company's current challenges will only worsen. As such, there's no room for any error here, including errors in judgment as to the future marketability of EVs in the United States. That's why any interested investor will want to think very carefully before plowing into a new stake in this carmaker.
Still, with Ford shares priced at only about 8 times next year's expected per-share earnings of $1.40 and a trailing dividend yield of just over 5%, it seems most (if not all) of this risk is already priced in. It wouldn't be unreasonable to find a little bit of room in your portfolio for Ford stock at this time. You just might want to contain your risk by keeping any position in this name smaller than you might normally take on.

Derby and Howard Schneider
NEW YORK/JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming (Reuters) -Federal Reserve officials appeared lukewarm on Thursday to the idea of an interest rate cut next month, as investors geared up for U.S. central bank chief Jerome Powell's speech to the annual Jackson Hole conference in Wyoming.
""I walk into every meeting with an open mind,"" Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said in an interview with Yahoo Finance on the sidelines of the three-day symposium, which is hosted by the Kansas City Fed. ""But with the data I have right now and with the information I have, if the meeting was tomorrow, I would not see a case for reducing interest rates,"" Hammack said.
Speaking on CNBC, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said, ""I think we're in a really good spot and I think we really have to have very definitive data to be moving that policy right now.""
In a separate public appearance, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he still has a rate cut penciled in for this year, but added that any forecast is surrounded by uncertainty and ""I'm not stuck on anything.""
Meanwhile, Chicago Fed leader Austan Goolsbee acknowledged the upcoming meeting is ""live"" and could bring a change in interest rate policy, although he noted mixed economic data and recent unexpectedly high inflation data give him pause about the prospect of an imminent easing in interest rates. ""The last inflation report that came in, where you saw services inflation, which is probably not driven by the tariffs, really start shooting up, is a danger, it's a dangerous data point,"" he said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
One Fed official, Boston Fed President Susan Collins, speaking in a Wall Street Journal interview, took a different path and highlighted job market challenges. She said if the data going into the next Fed meeting shows “the risks of worsening labor market conditions relative to those risks of elevated inflation…then it may be appropriate soon to begin dialing back” interest rates.
The Fed officials spoke ahead of Powell's highly anticipated keynote address on Friday, which investors hope will offer firm clues on whether the central bank plans to cut rates at its September 16-17 meeting.
Financial markets are betting that the Fed will lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the meeting next month, and it's possible that Powell will in fact send such a signal.
Unexpectedly weak July hiring data coupled with big downward revisions to hiring in May and June bolstered hopes of a coming reduction in borrowing costs. Futures markets currently put a 70% probability on a quarter-percentage cut next month in the Fed's policy rate, currently set in the 4.25%-4.50% range.",eb50117c0319a2a2644525a056140b5d,trafilatura

That has helped AI stocks continue to rocket higher and higher.
Of course, that upward trajectory won't last forever, but that doesn't mean there aren't opportunities to benefit while it does. For investors seeking great long-term exposure to this burgeoning industry, leaders like Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) can provide it. Here's why these three AI stocks are still a buy in 2025.
It's not only a great Q2 performance that makes Meta a must for AI investors
The headline figures for Meta's second quarter were undeniably impressive. It crushed analysts' top- and bottom-line expectations in the second quarter, and management forecasted a strong performance in the third quarter, too. Whereas the analysts' consensus forecast for Q3 revenue is $46.3 billion, Meta is guiding for sales in the range of $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion.
What really caught my attention, though, was Mark Zuckerberg's comment on the earnings conference call. The Meta CEO said his company has ""begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. The improvements are slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence -- which we define as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way -- we think is now in sight.""
Meta is clearly developing into an AI leader that's leveraging the technology to increase user engagement. Daily active users on Meta products have increased every quarter, from 3.07 billion in Q2 2023 to 3.48 billion in Q2 2025. Monthly active users on Threads, for example, are growing rapidly, rising to over 400 million users from 350 million in April, narrowing the gap between it and X.
The company's progress in developing generative AI (and other AI tools) is no small achievement, and it could go a long way in distinguishing the company from its peers. There's no denying the company's leadership and allure as an AI investment option.
What's in a name? ASML stock smells just as sweet as its more recognizable peers
Forget the fact that you may not recognize its name as readily as AI hardware titans like Nvidia and Broadcom. The fact is that ASML plays a crucial role in the manufacturing of AI-capable semiconductors. As the world's only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, it is in a class by itself. These vital systems are capable of printing features on microchips at smaller sizes and higher densities than any rival's equipment. As such, they are the only lithography systems that can be used to produce the industry's most sophisticated and powerful microchips, such as those used in AI applications.
While ASML has a competitive advantage as the only manufacturer of EUV systems, it's not resting on its laurels. The company continues to innovate, and its newest EUV system, the Twinscan EXE:5200B, is already receiving interest from major chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel.
Some investors are skittish about ASML's near-term outlook as the rollout of those new systems may extend deeper into 2026. For that reason, shares of ASML are now available at a discount. Whereas its five-year average operating cash flow multiple is 36, shares are now changing hands at 23.1 times operating cash flow. With the stock sitting on the discount rack, now's a great time for investors to act.
Nvidia's a great option for risk-averse AI investors
It seems almost impossible to have a conversation about the AI sector without Nvidia's name popping up. The company invented the graphics processing unit (GPU) and has long dominated that niche of the chip industry. And today, GPUs -- most of them Nvidia designs -- provide the key parallel processing power in the data centers where most AI computing workloads are handled.
The critical role that Nvidia plays is evident in the company's financials. In the first quarter of its fiscal 2026, Nvidia reported revenue of $39.1 billion for its data center business -- a year-over-year increase of 73%.
Because of its dominant position among semiconductor stocks, Nvidia is a great option for investors looking to add an AI position while also keeping their portfolio risk reasonable. The fact that the company effectively prints money makes it even more compelling for risk-averse investors.
Trading at 58 times trailing earnings, Nvidia stock may seem pricey, but the stock often trades at a high multiple. Compared to its five-year average P/E of 69.7, today's valuation looks a lot more palatable -- and perhaps even like a bargain.
Which AI opportunity is right for you?
For a low-risk AI investment option, Nvidia stock is a great option at this point, while those interested in a generative AI leader will want to gobble up Meta stock. But investors who see the appeal of a company that has a monopoly on hardware that's vital to the production of AI chips will want to pick up some shares of ASML.
Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?
Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:

(Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission named a senior military judge as enforcement director on Thursday, in what legal sources said was an unconventional pick for the top job policing Wall Street.
Margaret ""Meg"" Ryan, a senior judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, will take up the position on September 2, the SEC said in a statement.
In the statement, she said: ""I look forward to joining the Commission in its important work to ensure that the Division is true to the SEC’s mission in taking action on behalf of investors harmed by those who break the securities laws and providing an effective deterrent against fraudulent and manipulative activities in our financial markets.""
Relatively little known among securities lawyers, Ryan has an unusual background for SEC enforcement director. The role has typically been filled by former criminal prosecutors or agency lawyers expert in securities laws.
Ryan will lead a 1,400-person division expected to take a lighter touch in policing securities markets under SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, who has criticized SEC enforcement as heavy-handed.
During the Biden administration, the regulator levied record penalties against Wall Street rule-breakers and pursued major cryptocurrency firms.
Ryan was on a list of potential Supreme Court nominees that Trump published in his 2016 presidential campaign. She clerked for conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and former judge and well known conservative Michael Luttig.
Previously an active-duty marine, Ryan deployed to the Philippines and Saudi Arabia, according to past congressional testimony and a profile on Harvard Law School's website. In 2006, Republican President George W. Bush nominated her to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
She is a graduate of University of Notre Dame Law School, where she finished first in her class, the SEC said.
Sam Waldon, who has been acting director of enforcement since January, will return to his previous role as chief counsel for the division.

Dive Brief:
-
DoorDash has added a loyalty program option to its commerce platform as part of a handful of upgrades launched Wednesday, the company said in an email.
-
Merchants can choose between a visit-based or spend-based rewards structure and customers can accrue points if they order off of a restaurant’s website, app, DoorDash marketplace or in-store.
-
The addition of a loyalty program closes a product gap between DoorDash and its smaller competitors. Uber Eats and Grubhub have offered the ability for merchants to create loyalty programs using their apps for years.
Dive Insight:
The addition of a loyalty program could help independent and small restaurant chains boost customer engagement as many large chains already have robust loyalty programs. DoorDash’s feature doesn’t require any point-of-sales integration and can replace a restaurant’s existing program. This also puts DoorDash in more direct competition with restaurant loyalty providers.
One merchant said within the first month of launching its DoorDash omni-channel loyalty program, 22,000 customers enrolled. These customers have 1.3 times higher frequency in online ordering than non-loyalty customers, helping turn new customers into regulars, John Schall, owner of El Jefe’s Taqueria, said in a statement.
The loyalty program will likely also boost orders made on DoorDash, which continues to grow total orders. During Q2, consumers placed more than 760 million orders with DoorDash, an increase of 20% year over year, according to an earnings release.
Additional updates to DoorDash’s commerce platform include access to a free website built and maintained by DoorDash, built-in CRM tools to send out personalized email and SMS campaigns and an all-in-one dashboard to monitor marketplace and direct orders, loyalty programs and marketing tools.
The company will likely roll out additional tools for merchants in the near future. Earlier this year, it acquired hospitality software company SevenRooms, which provides various marketing, operations and guest experience tools.
DoorDash also rolled out new plans for the Commerce Platform, with tiers for merchants to choose from. The plans include:
-
Starter ($0 per store/month): A free branded website and commission-free online ordering (but (2.9% + $0.30 payment processing fee applies)
-
Boost ($54 per store/month): Includes everything in Starter, plus automated emails
-
Pro ($249 per store/month): Includes everything in Boost, plus a branded mobile app, customizable marketing tools, and a cross-channel loyalty program",46ff036d17fcdbffad85acecc9d9c92a,trafilatura

On Tuesday, Japanese investment giant SoftBank announced it had taken a $2 billion stake in Intel, with plans to help supercharge the struggling chipmaker’s revival. The deal, which gives SoftBank control over roughly 2% of Intel’s outstanding shares, comes as the US government explores a deal to take as much as a 10% stake in the Santa Clara, California, firm.

Chip Stack
That’s a lot of a lot. Intel needs it all and maybe more. While it’s technically the only major designer and manufacturer of leading-edge chips in the US, the company has largely failed to convince tech players that its Gaudi AI Accelerator chips could serve as a viable alternative to Nvidia’s popular GPUs, while its expensive foundry business has completely failed to compete with industry titan TSMC. The company has reported a total net loss of around $3.7 billion through the first half of the year, after a staggering $18.8 billion net loss in fiscal 2024, and has openly flirted with exiting the foundry business if it fails to secure a major client soon.
Enter SoftBank. According to sources who spoke with the Financial Times, the two sides discussed several versions of a deal — including one in which SoftBank would have acquired Intel’s foundry business outright — but ultimately agreed on a $2 billion investment that gives Intel a major financial lifeline amid its search for clients and its capital-intensive push to catch up to TSMC’s manufacturing capacity. Crucially, it also places Intel into SoftBank’s growing AI ecosystem:
-
SoftBank is already the majority owner of British chip designer Arm and is a leading investor in OpenAI, which is working to reduce its reliance on key supplier Nvidia. Last week, Reuters reported that current and former OpenAI employees were looking to sell up to $6 billion worth of shares to a SoftBank-led group of investors.
-
SoftBank and OpenAI also have ambitious plans to expand AI infrastructure in the US, primarily through the $500 billion “Project Stargate” initiative the two firms announced earlier this year with Oracle.
Central Intel-igence: Of course, SoftBank isn’t the only player to notice that Intel is struggling. The company scored roughly $10.9 billion in grants and low-interest loans from the US government via the Biden-era Chips and Science Act, and now the Trump administration wants to get an equity stake in exchange for that. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made clear in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that the White House isn’t seeking voting or governance rights in Intel, however. The idea comes after the president earlier this month publicly called for the resignation of new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan (who happens to be a former SoftBank board member) over alleged ties to the Chinese government. After a White House meeting with Tan this week, the president said Tan has an “amazing story” — one that, apparently, he prefers the US government to be a part of.

","Energy Transfer Stock May Be Down , but Is it Out ? ",2025-08-21 19:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Units of Energy Transfer(NYSE: ET) have stumbled this year, declining by more than 10%. The energy midstream giant has woefully underperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which has rallied nearly 10% so far this year.
The master limited partnership's (MLP) underperformance may have some investors wondering whether it's time to get out of their investment. Here's a look at what has weighed on the midstream giant, and whether it has the fuel to rise again.
A speed bump
Energy Transfer is coming off a strong year. The MLP produced a company-record $15.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) last year. That was at the high end of its guidance range, and up 13% from 2023's level.
The pipeline company also generated a record $8.4 billion in distributable cash flow in 2024, a 10% year-over-year increase. Energy Transfer capitalized on strong market conditions and got a boost from acquisitions (Crestwood in late 2023 and WTG Midstream in the middle of last year).
However, the midstream giant's growth rate has slowed considerably this year. It has generated nearly $8 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $5.5 billion of distributable cash flow through the first half of 2025, representing increases of 4% and less than 1%, respectively. Those sluggish growth rates are due largely to a lack of catalysts. Energy Transfer has completed fewer growth capital projects and isn't getting as big a boost from recent acquisitions. Additionally, market conditions have been more volatile this year.
As a result of these factors, Energy Transfer currently expects its adjusted EBITDA to be at or slightly below the lower end of its $16.1 billion-$16.5 billion guidance range. That implies less than 4% growth compared to 2024.
A reacceleration is on the way
While Energy Transfer is benefiting from fewer growth catalysts this year, the momentum should shift as it heads into 2026. The MLP is investing $5 billion in growth capital projects this year, with the bulk of these projects entering service through the end of next year. It has recently completed two new gas processing plants and has another scheduled for completion in the second quarter of next year.
Energy Transfer is also wrapping up construction on its Nederland Flexport NGL expansion. Additionally, the company is building both phases of the Hugh Brinson Pipeline, which should enter service at the end of next year. These and other projects should fuel a substantial increase in its earnings and cash flow in 2026 and 2027.
Meanwhile, Energy Transfer has recently secured several more growth projects. The most notable is the Desert Southwest expansion of its Transwestern Pipeline. The $5.3 billion project should enter service by the end of the decade. Energy Transfer also approved projects with in-service dates in 2027 and 2028. As a result, it now has visible earnings growth into the next decade.
Energy Transfer has many more expansion projects under development. It's getting closer to approving the long-delayed Lake Charles LNG export project. The MLP is also working on several potential projects to supply gas to new power plants and data centers. Securing these and other projects would further enhance and extend Energy Transfer's growth outlook.
Additionally, Energy Transfer is currently in the strongest financial position in its history. That puts it in an excellent position to continue making acquisitions as the right opportunities emerge.
While Energy Transfer hasn't made a deal this year, its affiliated MLP Sunoco LP has agreed to buy Parkland for $9.1 billion. Sunoco expects the deal to boost its earnings by more than 10% in the first year. As a major Sunoco investor, Energy Transfer's financial results will benefit from this deal when it closes later this year.
Definitely not out
Energy Transfer's slowing growth in 2025 has weighed on its unit price. However, a growth reacceleration appears to be right around the corner. Because of this, the recent dip in the unit price appears to be a compelling buying opportunity for those who are comfortable receiving the Schedule K-1 federal tax form that the MLP sends investors each year.
In addition to the upside potential as its growth engine reaccelerates, investors can lock in the MLP's more than 7.5%-yielding distribution, which should steadily grow in the coming years as its income rises. These catalysts potentially position investors to earn a high-octane total return from here.

And below, I'm going to focus on what I think are some of the best deals available.
Three stocks that trade at less than $100 per share and can be bargain buys right now include Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA). A couple are facing concerning headwinds, but here's why they can all be great long-term investments.
Pinterest
Pinterest is a popular social media site where people go for ideas related to just about anything. Whether it's home renovation projects, baking, or recent shopping hauls, there's a ton of content to sift through. The platform is particularly popular with Gen Z, which Pinterest says accounts for more than 40% of its monthly user base.
Entering this week, shares of Pinterest have been trading around $35, and that's with the stock rising 24% since the start of the year. And yet, it's still a cheap buy, trading at just 13 times its trailing earnings.
Its price/earnings-to-growth multiple, or PEG, is around 0.8. That's based on analyst expectations over the next five years, and it implies that Pinterest is one heck of a cheap growth stock.
The company's top line rose by 17% in its most recent quarter (which ended on June 30), to just under $1 billion. Monthly active users rose by 11% to 578 million. With a market cap of only $24 billion, Pinterest is a business that could get a whole lot more valuable given how popular it is with younger audiences. It can be a terrific long-term buy.
United Parcel Service
There's not much growth happening for United Parcel Service these days. The logistics company is battling significant macroeconomic headwinds due to tariffs. It's trading at less than $90, and the last time you could have bought the stock at a much cheaper price than that was in 2013.
UPS is facing some near-term challenges, but it's hard to not like the business over the long haul. The world of e-commerce is still getting bigger, and demand for global shipments isn't likely to slow down. There may be short-term adversity, but if you're a long-term investor, you don't need to worry too much about UPS given its dominance in the industry.
The company is making tough but smart decisions, such as scaling back on volume from Amazon in an effort to improve profitability. And it is profitability, not simply sales, that should drive decisions. Although it may not be a popular move and it may hurt the top line, if it improves profit margins, that could be a big win in the end.
UPS is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 13, and in the long run it could have plenty of upside as economic conditions improve.
Comcast
Rounding out this list of cheap stocks is media and tech company Comcast. It's trading around $34, and its P/E is less than 6 -- an astoundingly low valuation for one of the largest entertainment companies in the country.
Its high debt load (around $100 billion) is undoubtedly turning away a lot of risk-averse investors. But with Comcast spinning off many cable TV networks later this year, that could help reduce costs and allow it to focus on higher-growth opportunities in areas such as streaming. The business may have become too bloated, and simplifying its approach could work well for investors.
Overall, Comcast still has excellent brands in its portfolio, and it's highly profitable, with an operating margin of around 20% over the past six months. I'm optimistic that by becoming leaner, the business can be better positioned for growth in the future. At such a cheap valuation, it may be too tempting to pass up since it offers an excellent margin of safety.

In yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major indexes ended mixed, with the Nasdaq 100 dropping to a 1-1/2-week low. The Magnificent Seven stocks retreated, with Nvidia (NVDA) falling over -3% and Meta Platforms (META) dropping more than -2%. Also, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped more than -5% after GF Securities downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy. In addition, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) cratered over -42% after the drugmaker released study results of its experimental weight-loss pill showing that nearly a third of patients discontinued treatment, raising concerns about potential side effects. On the bullish side, Intel (INTC) climbed more than +6% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after SoftBank Group agreed to buy $2 billion worth of the chipmaker’s shares.
Economic data released on Tuesday showed that U.S. July housing starts unexpectedly rose +5.2% m/m to a 5-month high of 1.428 million, stronger than expectations of 1.290 million, while building permits, a proxy for future construction, fell -2.8% m/m to a 5-year low of 1.354 million, weaker than expectations of 1.390 million.
Fed Governor Michelle Bowman on Tuesday held firm on her stance about cutting interest rates, saying she hadn’t changed her view after dissenting from the majority of the Fed board in July on the need for a rate cut. “The story is out there, and that’s that. I haven’t changed my views,” Bowman said during an interview on Bloomberg Television.
Today, market watchers will pay close attention to the publication of the Fed’s minutes from the July 29-30 meeting, which will provide insight into the Fed’s stance on interest rates and the economy and could shed more light on the decision by Fed Governors Waller and Bowman to support a rate cut.
Also, market participants will hear perspectives from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic throughout the day.
On the earnings front, retailers such as TJX Companies (TJX), Lowe’s (LOW), and Target (TGT), as well as notable companies like Analog Devices (ADI) and Estee Lauder (EL), are slated to release their quarterly results today. Investors will closely watch retail earnings for clues on consumer sentiment and tariff effects.
On the economic data front, investors will focus on U.S. Crude Oil Inventories data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists expect this figure to be -0.800M, compared to last week’s value of 3.036M.
Investor attention for the remainder of the week is squarely focused on the Kansas City Fed’s annual Economic Policy Symposium, which begins Thursday evening in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Chair Jerome Powell, in remarks on Friday, is expected to outline the central bank’s new policy framework. Investors are watching to see whether Powell confirms the market’s pricing for a September rate cut or pushes back by stressing that incoming data before the next policy meeting could change the outlook. They’re also seeking signals about the longer-term path of Fed cuts heading into next year.
U.S. rate futures have priced in an 82.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 17.1% chance of no rate change at the September FOMC meeting.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.300%, down -0.05%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.01% this morning, paring earlier losses, supported by strength in defensive sectors. Personal care and utility stocks outperformed on Wednesday. At the same time, defense stocks continued to drop as optimism over progress toward a peace settlement in Ukraine weighed on the sector. U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington could provide air support to Ukraine as part of a peace deal, but ruled out deploying troops on the ground. Data from Eurostat released on Wednesday confirmed that the Eurozone’s annual inflation rate held steady at 2.0% in July, unchanged from the prior month. Separately, data from the Office for National Statistics showed that Britain’s annual inflation rate rose to an 18-month high in July, increasing the likelihood that Bank of England policymakers will refrain from lowering rates next month. Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday that the trade deal between the U.S. and the EU is broadly in line with the central bank’s baseline assumptions, though uncertainty remains in key sectors such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. On the monetary policy front, Sweden’s Riksbank kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 2.00%, as expected, while noting it sees some likelihood of a rate cut later this year. Investor focus later this week will turn to the Fed’s Jackson Hole economic symposium for signals on the rate outlook. In corporate news, Alcon (ALC.Z.IX) plunged over -9% after the medical device manufacturer cut its full-year net sales guidance.
U.K. CPI, U.K. Core CPI, Germany’s PPI, Eurozone’s CPI, and Eurozone’s Core CPI data were released today.
U.K. July CPI rose +0.1% m/m and +3.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of -0.1% m/m and +3.7% y/y.
U.K. July Core CPI rose +0.2% m/m and +3.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m/m and +3.7% y/y.
The German July PPI came in at -0.1% m/m and -1.5% y/y, weaker than expectations of +0.1% m/m and -1.3% y/y.
Eurozone’s July CPI was unchanged m/m and rose +2.0% y/y, in line with expectations.
Eurozone’s July Core CPI fell -0.2% m/m and rose +2.3% y/y, in line with expectations.
Asian stock markets today closed mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +1.04%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.51%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index reversed earlier losses and closed higher today on remarks from the country’s foreign ministry that investors viewed as a sign of potential progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Sentiment improved in the afternoon session after China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, responding to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments, reiterated Beijing’s hope that the U.S. would cooperate with China to implement the consensus reached by the two presidents and pursue “positive outcomes” in economic talks based on equality, respect, and reciprocity. Mr. Bessent signaled on Tuesday that the U.S. is satisfied with the current tariff set up with China. “We have had very good talks with China. I imagine we’ll be seeing them again before November,” he said. Also aiding sentiment, China’s industry ministry said it convened a meeting with solar industry representatives, the second in two months, urging the sector to tighten regulations and curb excessive competition among firms. Meanwhile, China left benchmark lending rates unchanged for the third straight month on Wednesday as authorities signaled they are in no hurry to roll out monetary stimulus despite a series of recent disappointing economic data. The one-year loan prime rate remained at 3.0%, while the five-year rate held steady at 3.5%, according to the People’s Bank of China. The official People’s Daily stated in a commentary that China “must continue to exert efforts in macro policies and increase them at an appropriate time to promote the continued implementation of existing and established policies while maintaining policy continuity and stability.” In corporate news, Pop Mart surged over +12% in Hong Kong after the toy company posted an approximately 400% year-over-year jump in first-half net profit.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply lower today, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street. Technology, heavy industry, and video game stocks led the declines on Wednesday. Domestic trade data added to the downbeat mood. Government data released on Wednesday showed that Japan’s exports in July posted the biggest drop in more than four years, falling for a third consecutive month as the impact of U.S. tariffs intensified, heightening concerns over the outlook for the export-reliant economy. Shipments to the U.S. dropped 10.1% year-over-year, dragged down by weakness in automobile exports. Capital Economics’ Marcel Thieliant said that Japan’s July exports data indicate that U.S. tariffs are beginning to “bite.” “We expect softer external demand to result in slower export growth over the coming quarters,” Thieliant added. At the same time, Japan’s monthly core machinery orders, a key leading indicator of capital spending, unexpectedly rose in June, snapping a 2-month decline. Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds remained under pressure on Wednesday as worries grew over the nation’s debt burden and the government’s rising deficit spending. In other news, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday that documents memorializing trade deals with Japan and South Korea are “weeks away” from being ready. In corporate news, SoftBank Group slumped over -7% following a steep selloff in U.S. technology shares, while concerns over its investment in Intel continued to weigh on the company. Investor focus remains on Japan’s national core CPI data for July, scheduled for release on Friday, for clues on whether the Bank of Japan will raise rates again this year. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +3.84% to 25.15.
The Japanese July Trade Balance stood at -117.5B yen, weaker than expectations of 196.2B yen.
The Japanese July Exports fell -2.6% y/y, weaker than expectations of -2.1% y/y.
The Japanese July Imports fell -7.5% y/y, stronger than expectations of -10.4% y/y.
The Japanese June Core Machinery Orders came in at +3.0% m/m and +7.6% y/y, stronger than expectations of -0.4% m/m and +5.0% y/y.

And to the dismay of some fans, the chain's new logo now ditches the barrel itself.
Or rather, the drawing many have associated with Cracker Barrel over the years. The man leaning on that barrel is also gone, as are the words “Old Country Store.” Instead, the new emblem features a simpler design with just “Cracker Barrel” written on a gold background, which also has a semi-updated shape.
“Anchored in Cracker Barrel’s signature gold and brown tones, the updated visuals will appear across menus and marketing collateral,"" the Tennessee-based company wrote in a Tuesday announcement. Cracker Barrel added that its logo is ""now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and word mark that started it all.”
According to Cracker Barrel, this latest look marks the brand's “fifth evolution” of its logo to date. It was unveiled as part of a campaign from the company called “All the More,” which also advertises some new fall menu items.
Cracker Barrel has been working on a wider rebrand for some time. Beyond a new logo, that's included remodeling its country-style restaurants and retail stores. The company began ramping up this overhaul last year by swapping out older, more antique-filled designs with lighter paint and modern furniture.
Founded in 1969, Cracker Barrel operates nearly 660 locations across the U.S. today. Those attached to the chain's previous look have been quick to express ire about both the new logo and restaurant remodels online.
“Our values haven’t changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven’t changed,” Cracker Barrel said in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Thursday. The company added that the man on its former logo, known as Uncle Herschel, “remains front and center in our restaurants and on our menu,"" as he represents “The Herschel Way,” which is “the foundation of how our 70,000 plus employees provide the country hospitality for which we are known.”

U.S. employers are increasingly de-emphasizing the retention of executives as a key priority in making decisions about executive benefits, a new study suggests.
Just two years ago, 84% of respondents to an annual survey by benefits adviser NFP identified retention as a major factor in making such decisions. In 2024, that proportion declined to 71%. This year it plummeted again, to 58% of the 260 participating executives.
Company financials, which 44% cited as a major factor impacting executive benefits decisions in 2023, increased to 58% this year, tying with retention.
NFP characterized this recalibration during a time of economic turmoil as a sign of maturity rather than retreat. “Organizations are aligning executive benefit strategies with today’s realities: tighter budgets, growing demand [for executive talent] and the need to retain top talent without overextending financial resources,” the study report said.
To be sure, most (85%) of those surveyed said their company “can’t afford” to lose top talent.
However, nearly every respondent (97%) said they were at least somewhat concerned about the economy. That’s pushing companies to rebalance their approach to executive compensation, according to the report.
“Although retention remains a priority, financial discipline has regained equal footing in overall strategy,” wrote Tony Greene, president of executive benefits for NFP, in his foreword to the report. “The post-pandemic generosity that once defined these [pay] packages is giving way to a more measured, sustainable model.”
The report put a spotlight on nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which it said offer a “rare combination”: cost-effective design for employers and tax-advantaged flexibility for key employees. A large majority (83%) of survey participants said their companies offer some type of deferred compensation.
While retention remains the top reason companies offer NQDCs, they are also doing so to stay competitive with peer companies, support long-term executive retirement planning and help top talent take greater control of their financial future.
Among survey respondents whose companies offer NQDCs, 82% said they have at least a moderate impact on plan success. Additionally, 63% said bank-owned and corporate-owned life insurance plans have at least such an impact.
Perhaps surprisingly, only 29% of surveyed executives said they completely understand their benefits, while 54% said they mostly understand but still have questions. And 18% said they mostly find their benefits confusing.
The survey found that employees who understand their benefits are significantly more likely than those who lack clarity on their investment options to be extremely committed to their employer (65% vs. 36%).",888ddb3d77fe3fc292cb8cd50854936e,trafilatura

The integrated energy company announced that it discovered a massive amount of oil—nearly 11 billion barrels—off the coast of Guyana. To put it simply, this is the largest oil discovery anywhere in the world in the last 15 years. In the region, XOM has three active projects, combinedly producing at a rate of roughly 650,000 barrels per day. XOM expects a total of eight projects in the region to be online by 2030, which will produce a total of 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (MMBoE/D).
In the Permian, the energy giant is employing advanced technology to get much more oil out of each well, thereby improving oil recovery. From the most prolific basin, XOM is expecting to produce 2.3 MMBoE/D by the end of this decade, suggesting a surge from the current 1.6 MMBoE/D.
CVX & FANG’s Solid Permian Footprint
Like XOM, Chevron CVX and Diamondback Energy, Inc. FANG also produce significant volumes of oil and natural gas from the Permian.
Chevron has a strong footprint in the Permian. With more than 2 million net acres of land, CVX has been operating in the basin for more than 100 years.
Diamondback Energy is a pure-play Permian operator. FANG has a huge inventory of oil and gas wells, thereby showcasing a solid production outlook.
XOM’s Price Performance, Valuation & Estimates
Shares of XOM have declined 1.2% over the past year against the 2.9% rise of the industry.

From a valuation standpoint, XOM trades at a trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) of 6.98X. This is above the broader industry average of 4.29X.

Why Oneok’s (OKE) Post-Earnings Meltdown May Spell Opportunity for Contrarian Options Traders
Today, we’re going to look at a Bear Put spread trade that assumes MRVL will continue to move lower since breaking through the 50-day moving average.
A Bear Put spread is a bearish trade that also benefits from a rise in implied volatility.
The maximum risk for a Bear Put spread is limited to the premium paid while the maximum potential profit is also capped.
The maximum profit is equal to the width between the strikes less the premium paid.
MRVL BEAR CALL SPREAD
To create a Bear Put spread, we buy an out-of-the-money put and then sell another put further out-of-the-money.
Buying the October 17 put with a strike price of $70 and selling the $65 put would create a Bear Put spread.
This spread was trading for around $2.20 yesterday. That means a trader buying this spread would pay $220 in option premium and would have a maximum profit of $280.
That represents a 127.27% return on risk between now and October 17 if MRVL stock falls below $65.
If MRVL stock closes above $70 on the expiration date the trade loses the full $220.
The breakeven point for the Bear Put spread is $67.80 which is calculated as $70 minus the $2.20 option premium per contract.

To date, there are more than 15 million cryptocurrencies, giving investors virtually endless choices. But given how risky and volatile crypto is as a whole, it may be wise to keep things simple. Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) has been around for a decade and is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.
Ether, the native token for the Ethereum network, has been on a tear lately; its market price has almost tripled since April, and it's beginning to approach its all-time high, set back in 2021 at the peak of a previous crypto bull market.
But things have changed since 2021, and the coin's recent rally may have some serious legs. Here are three reasons why it's one of the best cryptocurrencies you can invest $100 in right now.
1. Regulatory tailwinds
To start, look no further than the regulatory tides lifting all the cryptocurrency boats. The Trump administration has been a tremendous ally to the cryptocurrency industry by:
Peeling back regulatory scrutiny and litigation against companies in the industry.
Planning to establish a federal Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile via executive order.
Helping to pass the Genius Act, which is aimed at establishing clearer regulatory frameworks for digital currencies and their real-world applications.
These moves are a step toward making cryptocurrencies a mainstream asset.
2. Institutional money flowing in
Institutional interest is gaining steam as the regulatory climate thaws. Corporations, banks, and investment funds have substantial buying power.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the creation of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last summer. These ETFs hold Ether on behalf of the fund's investors, giving people a simple way to invest without having actual custody of the tokens. That means no need to fuss with wallets or seed phrases. Since then, more $12 billion has flowed into U.S. spot Ether ETFs.
Additionally, President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that would pave the way for retirement accounts like 401(k)s to have access to alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies. With time, this could spark further interest in Ether and other cryptocurrencies. There are more than $40 trillion in total U.S. retirement assets, and even a tiny fraction of that going into digital assets could mean a massive inflow of funds.
3. The Ethereum network is evolving
Smart contracts could eventually play a significant role in society. A smart contract is a digitally coded agreement that automatically executes an action under the specified conditions. A blockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger system, an ideal avenue for smart contracts. The Ethereum blockchain is currently the largest, by a wide margin, based on its total locked value, with more than $121 billion in smart contracts. The next closest are Tron and Solana, with just over $8 billion and $6 billion, respectively.
To stay on top, the Ethereum network has a roadmap for upgrades. Previously, the Merge transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system. This reduced the network's energy consumption, improved its security, and set the stage for several planned upgrades.
Those upgrades include the Verge, Purge, and Splurge, which will make the network more efficient, lower transaction fees, and enhance scalability, enabling nodes to run on smaller hardware devices, such as smartphones. While there is competition from other blockchains, and Ethereum isn't the best at everything, its current size and continuous improvements bode well for its future as a pillar of the digital economy.
Ether's price outlook looks promising
It's anyone's guess how high Ether's price will go, and it's bound to be volatile. That said, Ethereum looks like a strong buy for long-term investors. The token's price still hasn't cleared its all-time high from back in 2021, something Bitcoin did at the beginning of last year. Additionally, its fully diluted market value is still just a quarter of Bitcoin's.
That doesn't mean that Ether is bound to catch Bitcoin, but Ethereum is the world's largest blockchain, and its valuation doesn't reflect that yet. Smart contracts could see increased adoption during the next several years as regulatory barriers fall, which, along with continued inflows from investors and institutions, could drive Ethereum's usage and Ether's price higher over time.

","With Grand Theft Auto 6 Slated for May 2026 , Is Take - Two Interactive Stock a Steal in 2025 ? ",2025-08-21 19:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software(NASDAQ: TTWO) is approaching arguably the biggest release in its history with Grand Theft Auto (GTA) VI. The company announced a launch date of May 26, 2026 for the title.
Take-Two reportedly spent over $1 billion to create the game. While that's a substantial sum, the previous entry in the franchise, GTA V, has pulled in around $10 billion in sales since its debut in 2013.
With the arrival of GTA VI on the horizon, is now the time to buy Take-Two shares? To address this question, here's a deeper look into the company.
Take-Two's game looks like a winner
The success of the Grand Theft Auto series is critical to Take-Two. Upon GTA V's launch, the franchise accounted for nearly 70% of the company's sales in its 2014 fiscal year.
More than a decade later, GTA products still represented 15% of revenue in Take-Two's fiscal first quarter, ended June 30. The company produced $1.5 billion in Q1 sales, a 12% year-over-year increase.
Indications already suggest that GTA VI will be a hit. Fan anticipation for the game is high. Its second trailer, released in May, is the biggest video launch of all time, according to Take-Two, with 475 million views in the first day. For comparison, 2024's Deadpool & Wolverine movie trailer reached 365 million views in the first 24 hours, which made it the most-watched film trailer in history at the time.
In addition, GTA V remains among the top three best-selling video games of all time, accounting for over 215 million units sold. The entire GTA franchise has achieved sales of 455 million units. In contrast, Minecraft has sold around 300 million units.
Take-Two's strengthening financials
The company has additional irons in the fire aside from GTA VI. Two other successful franchises are launching new titles in September. The sports game NBA 2K26 comes out on Sept. 5, and the looter-shooter Borderlands 4 arrives Sept. 12.
The releases are expected to boost revenue in the fiscal second quarter, ending Sept. 30, to a range between $1.65 billion and $1.7 billion. That would be a strong increase from sales of $1.3 billion in the prior fiscal year.
With the impending titles and Take-Two's excellent Q1 sales, the company raised its fiscal 2026 revenue outlook to between $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion, up from fiscal 2025's $5.6 billion.
Despite the sales growth, Take-Two's business isn't profitable. It exited fiscal Q1 with a net loss of $11.9 million. However, that figure is a substantial reduction from the $262 million loss in the prior year, which is a sign that the company has a shot at turning a profit soon.
In fact, Take-Two achieved operating income of $21.6 million in fiscal Q1. That's a dramatic turnaround from the previous year's operating loss of $184.9 million.
A tailwind to Take-Two's ability to achieve profitability lies in digital content sales. People are overwhelmingly opting for digital downloads instead of buying a physical game disc, and digital products deliver higher profit margins to Take-Two.
In fiscal Q1, digital sales represented 98% of the company's $1.5 billion in revenue. When GTA V was released, digital comprised only 16% of revenue. This means GTA VI is likely to contribute greater profit than its predecessor.
Evaluating whether to buy Take-Two stock
Given Take-Two's many positives and the imminent release of Grand Theft Auto VI, the company looks like a worthwhile investment. But the stock is up 26% this year through the week ending Aug. 15. You have to wonder if now's the best time to scoop up Take-Two shares.
To assess the situation, let's examine the stock's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which measures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of revenue generated over the trailing 12 months.
The chart shows that Take-Two's P/S multiple has increased steadily over the past year, indicating that shares are not cheap. This suggests that the anticipated sales boost from upcoming popular titles, including GTA VI, may already be priced into the stock.
Of course, if sales of GTA VI exceed expectations, Take-Two's share price is likely to rise. One approach to address the situation is to use dollar-cost averaging. Purchase some shares now, and gradually build your position over time, which takes the guesswork out of whether to buy now or wait for the stock price to dip.
Since the video game sector's sales surpass the film, music, and book-publishing industries combined, and considering the enduring popularity of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, investors have strong reason to anticipate that GTA VI will be a key driver of Take-Two's revenue growth next year.

This development comes as the mine's executives shared insights during a recent press tour of the site, according to a Reuters report.
The RIGI, which was launched in October under President Javier Milei, aims to stimulate investments through July 2026, with a potential one-year extension. It offers extensive tax breaks and access to international dispute courts for investments exceeding $200m.
Minas Argentinas executive director Martinez Ricardo Martinez emphasised the importance of the RIGI for “legal security” and highlighted the necessity for stable mining regulations.
Following discussions with the government, Minas Argentinas, part of Aisa Group and the owner of Gualcamayo, has recalibrated its initial $1bn investment proposal to align with RIGI requirements.
The mine, which was on the brink of closure when purchased by Minas Argentinas in 2023, currently produces 50,000–55,000oz of gold annually through secondary recovery methods.
The ambitious plan for Gualcamayo includes the construction of a new mine, a pressure oxidation plant and a 50MW solar park to power the operations.
The proposed Carbonatos Profundos mine will be situated beneath the existing one, targeting gold production from sulphides. The company predicts annual output of 120,000oz of gold from 2029, with an estimated 17-year lifespan and potential exports worth $400m a year.
Gualcamayo's new mine and processing plant construction is due to begin in 2027. Martinez noted that the mine possesses three million ounces (moz) of economically viable gold reserves, a fraction of the 5moz of certified resources discovered on just 3% of the 40,000-hectare property, leaving the majority unexplored.
Despite a decline in gold production across Argentina due to ageing mines and depleting high-quality ore, gold remains the country's leading mining export, representing 68% of the total.
In a related development, Argentina's Government officially approved Rio Tinto’s $2.5bn (£1.85bn) Rincon lithium mining project under the RIGI in May.
The Rincon project is located in Salar Del Rincón, Salta province, Argentina.

That said, there's more to the story here than meets the eye. Here are three reasons why, if you are considering buying an S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index clone, you might be better off buying this Invesco ETF like there's no tomorrow instead.
1. Equal weighting matters theoretically and practically
The S&P 500 index is constructed by a committee. It includes 500 or so of the largest and most economically important U.S. companies, picked using specific criteria. The stocks that make the list are weighted by market cap, so the largest companies have the biggest impact on the index's performance. It is a well-constructed index that does a good job of tracking the U.S. economy and, secondarily, the U.S. stock market.
If you look at the past decade, the S&P 500 index has easily outdistanced Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF. But if you look back to roughly the inception of Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, it has actually beaten the S&P 500 index on both price-only performance and total return, which assumes dividend reinvestment. There's clearly something going on here, noting that Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF's 0.2% expense ratio is actually kind of high for an exchange-traded fund.
Using equal weighting makes a performance difference over time. The key is that equal weighting means every stock has the same impact on performance, good and bad. So the upside is limited from large companies today, but so will be the downside when today's hot stocks slump. Effectively, equal weighting increases diversification while market-cap weighting leads to heavy concentrations in hot stocks.
If you are a long-term investor and want to be in the market, but are worried about the frequent excesses of the market, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF will be a great pick for you despite the elevated expense ratio.
2. The ETF's valuation levels are extreme right now
The first point is a big-picture view of things. Getting down to something a little more specific to today, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF's valuation levels are way more attractive than those of the S&P 500 index.
The S&P 500 index's average price-to-earnings ratio is currently around 27.6. The price-to-book value ratio is 5. Alone, those numbers don't mean much. The importance shows up when you compare them to Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight's 19.3 P/E ratio and 2.9 P/B ratio. The S&P 500 is expensive right now, as its performance has been driven by a small number of very large technology stocks. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF isn't nearly as expensive, which positions it better when those tech giants falter.
3. Technology is less than half as important for this ETF
The final reason to buy the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is very granular and it goes back to the technology sector. The S&P 500 index's weighting in technology is roughly 34% today. Step back and think about that for a second. If you buy the S&P 500, you are putting a third of your portfolio in technology stocks. That's a very heavy weighting, or, to think of it another way, a very big bet on technology stocks. This is the kind of imbalance that market cap weighting leads to.
The Invesco S&P 500 ETF's weighting in technology stocks is only about 14%, less than half as much exposure to a sector that is hot right now. But Wall Street history tells investors that hot sectors eventually cool off. There's another number to look at here, though.
Nine of the top 10 holdings in the S&P 500 index are technology-related, if not directly in the tech sector. These top 10 holdings account for nearly 39% of assets. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF's top-10 list contains a mix of industries and only accounts for about 3% of the ETF's assets. This all goes back to the equal-weighting methodology, but the difference is clearly important and pervasive when it comes to what you are buying.
Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight is hidden in plain sight
Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is a unique way to get exposure to the broader market. What it does isn't rocket science; it is a pretty simple approach to investing. But history suggests equal weighting works and that it leads to a materially different portfolio than you would get if you'd just bought an S&P 500 index ETF. If you are a long-term investor, going with Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF could be a very wise choice as the S&P 500 rockets higher on the backs of a very small number of large stocks.

Remote working from abroad has surged, and hotels are recalibrating services to meet the demands of a growing demographic of professionals seeking “work from anywhere” experiences.
The boom in working from anywhere
Recent data from Totaljobs shows remote working abroad has jumped from 8.5% in 2023 to 13.25% in 2025, a rise of 56%. This growth is expected to see more than seven million people working from outside their home country this year.
Many stay for one or two weeks, though companies such as Twilio allow up to 90 remote working days per year, with individual trips capped at 28 days.
Hotels revamp rooms and public spaces for remote work
Hotels, especially luxury brands like Four Seasons, have received increasing numbers of requests from guests for office-style setups—second screens, printers, tech support and coffee-break delivery are now often in demand.
Some properties are remixing their communal areas into co-working zones, replacing formal restaurants with cafés furnished with office tables and chairs.
This reflects a wider industry shift to make hotels suitable for blended work-and-leisure (""bleisure"") stays.
How remote workers are embracing mobility
Professionals are building their own mobile offices. Nathaniel Okenwa of Twilio carries a portable monitor, keyboard and mouse to recreate his home-office setup wherever he travels—from Bali to New York.
Similarly, Jess Farnham works remotely from Bali and New York according to her employer’s flexible policies—logging on in the early hours before enjoying leisure activities in the afternoon.
This lifestyle enables greater personal flexibility without sacrificing productivity.
Ongoing trend of work-centric hospitality
The shift toward flexible work-friendly hospitality aligns with broader industry trends.
Crowne Plaza has rolled out “blended travel” upgrades across many properties—creating social spaces, meeting rooms and wellness partnerships to support guests merging professional and personal goals.
Analysts anticipate that hotels providing better functionality for remote workers can capture a growing segment of guests seeking mobility, productivity and quality of stay.

The growth comes despite a minor impact from foreign exchange rates on total company comparable sales, which increased 1% and 1.4% in the US.
Net earnings remained stable at $4.6bn. Adjusted diluted earnings per share saw a marginal increase from $4.67 to $4.68.
Home Depot chair, president and CEO Ted Decker stated: ""Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations. The momentum that began in the back half of last year continued throughout the first half as customers engaged more broadly in smaller home improvement projects.""
The company expects total sales growth of 2.8% and comparable sales growth of 1% for fiscal 2025.

Diluted earnings per share are expected to decline by roughly 3% from $14.91 in fiscal 2024, while adjusted diluted earnings per share may see a 2% decrease from $15.24.
Capital expenditures are estimated to be around 2.5% of total sales.
At the close of Q2, Home Depot operated 2,353 retail stores and 800 branches, employing more than 470,000 across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, ten Canadian provinces and Mexico.

Moving goods safely and efficiently depends on more than just trucks and warehouses. The way products are packaged plays a vital role in keeping them protected, reducing waste, and ensuring smooth delivery worldwide.
ISO standards for packaging logistics set the rules that help companies achieve all of this with consistency and confidence.
What ISO means for packaging and logistics
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) creates global rules that industries everywhere can follow. In packaging logistics, these standards focus on how products are packed, labelled, stored, and transported.
Two of the most widely used are:
-
ISO 9001 – a quality management standard that ensures packaging and transport meet customer requirements.
-
ISO 14001 – an environmental management standard that promotes sustainable packaging and reduced waste.
For companies, following these standards builds trust with clients, avoids costly mistakes, and supports greener business practices.
Key standards shaping packaging operations
ISO offers detailed guidance designed for the challenges of packaging and transport:
-
ISO 780 – handling symbols like “fragile” and “keep upright” that are understood globally.
-
ISO 18602–18604 – environmental packaging standards covering reuse, recycling, and recovery.
-
ISO 4178 – tests packaging against stacking, vibration, and shock during transit.
-
ISO 22982 – cold chain packaging rules for items like food and medicine that must stay at controlled temperatures.
These standards make packaging safer, more durable, and more efficient. For example, a food exporter using ISO cold chain packaging ensures goods arrive fresh, while a manufacturer shipping electronics can rely on ISO shock-testing rules to avoid damage.
Standards for global safety and trade
Beyond protecting products, ISO standards also support secure and reliable global supply chains:
-
ISO 668 – defines container sizes and strength, ensuring cargo fits standard shipping systems worldwide.
-
ISO 28000 – addresses supply chain security, helping logistics firms manage risks like theft or disruption.
-
ISPM 15 – although not ISO, this wood packaging rule is critical. It requires wooden pallets and crates to be treated against pests before international shipping.
Together, these standards make international trade smoother by reducing delays at borders and ensuring shipments meet recognised safety levels.
Why ISO matters for the packaging industry
For the global packaging sector, ISO standards are practical tools, not paperwork. They deliver real benefits, including:
-
Clear communication through standard symbols and labelling.
-
Product safety by testing packaging for strength and reliability.
-
Sustainability with rules that reduce waste and encourage recycling.
-
Global compatibility so packaging works across borders and transport systems.
-
Trust and resilience by improving supply chain security.",719ae51ce46740cd2cfd4aef58100b51,trafilatura

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to signal whether September will bring the first rate cut of the year. If he hints at a cut, that is seen as a boon for Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins.
Powell’s speech on Friday “could potentially shape the outlook for the rest of 2025,” Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, the crypto exchange, told DL News. “If he signals that rate cuts are back in September with more to follow, markets will likely rally across the board.”
Jackson Hole, the Fed’s annual retreat in Wyoming, is one of the most closely watched events on the central bank calendar. Powell used the forum last year to telegraph a shift toward easing.
For crypto, the gathering carries outsized weight. Digital assets are highly sensitive to liquidity conditions, and Fed policy largely determines how much capital is available.
The event comes as the crypto market trembles just below the $4 trillion mark.
Bitcoin briefly dipped below $113,000 on Wednesday, down from a record $124,500 touched on August 14. Ethereum dropped to $4,100, while XRP and Solana were down about 10% and 7% respectively over the past week.
Shares of digital asset companies followed suit with crypto exchange Coinbase down nearly 6% and investment firm MicroStrategy over 7%.
Other equities fell less sharply as the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% and the Nasdaq 1.5% while the Dow closed flat.
The divergence underscores how digital assets, reliant on speculative liquidity, are more exposed to shifts in interest rates than other investments.
“The recent market selloff is a direct consequence of escalating geopolitical tensions and a growing fear that the Fed will disappoint investors in Jackson Hole,” Kyle Chasse, founder of venture capital firm MV Global, told DL News.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to signal whether September will bring the first rate cut of the year. If he hints at a cut, that is seen as a boon for Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins.
Powell’s speech on Friday “could potentially shape the outlook for the rest of 2025,” Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, the crypto exchange, told DL News. “If he signals that rate cuts are back in September with more to follow, markets will likely rally across the board.”
Jackson Hole, the Fed’s annual retreat in Wyoming, is one of the most closely watched events on the central bank calendar. Powell used the forum last year to telegraph a shift toward easing.
For crypto, the gathering carries outsized weight. Digital assets are highly sensitive to liquidity conditions, and Fed policy largely determines how much capital is available.
The event comes as the crypto market trembles just below the $4 trillion mark.
Bitcoin briefly dipped below $113,000 on Wednesday, down from a record $124,500 touched on August 14. Ethereum dropped to $4,100, while XRP and Solana were down about 10% and 7% respectively over the past week.
Shares of digital asset companies followed suit with crypto exchange Coinbase down nearly 6% and investment firm MicroStrategy over 7%.
Other equities fell less sharply as the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% and the Nasdaq 1.5% while the Dow closed flat.
The divergence underscores how digital assets, reliant on speculative liquidity, are more exposed to shifts in interest rates than other investments.
“The recent market selloff is a direct consequence of escalating geopolitical tensions and a growing fear that the Fed will disappoint investors in Jackson Hole,” Kyle Chasse, founder of venture capital firm MV Global, told DL News.

Saving for retirement is a massive financial goal. Not only do you need to save a sizable amount of money now, but the consequences of not doing so can be severe. With the decline of defined-benefit plans — in which employees receive a steady paycheck in retirement thanks to employer-funded pensions — the responsibility to save for retirement has shifted primarily to the individual.
Planning for retirement is a big responsibility, but it isn’t a one-size-fits-all journey. Retirement savings looks different depending on your age, income, and financial priorities. The latest data on average retirement savings by age offers a snapshot of how Americans are preparing for the future, which you can use as a benchmark to help you measure your own progress.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Average retirement savings by age
Knowing how much you should save for retirement is one thing, but actually doing it is another. If you’re behind on retirement savings, you aren’t alone.
Here’s a look at the average and median retirement savings by age as of 2022, according to data from the Federal Reserve:
According to T. Rowe Price, you should have 1 to 1.5 times your gross income saved for retirement by age 35. So, for example, a 35-year-old earning $60,000 would be on track if they had about $60,000 to $90,000 in retirement savings.
Looking at these averages, it appears that Americans are generally on track for retirement. However, average numbers can be inflated by high-net-worth individuals, which is why median figures offer a clearer picture.
As the data show, the average 67-year-old retiree has $609,230 in retirement savings. But the median retiree — which may be a more accurate representation — has less than a third of that, at $200,000.
While retirement assets can include more than just a 401(k), the balance of this account can often be a good initial measure of your retirement savings health. Here’s some recent data (as of Q4 of 2024) from Fidelity, which breaks down the average 401(k) balance by age:
What to do if you’re behind on retirement savings
It’s possible that you find these statistics more stress-inducing than helpful. If that’s the case, try not to worry and, instead, focus on what you can do to improve your savings. The following strategies can help accelerate your retirement savings at any point in your life.
-
Prioritize your 401(k) match: If money’s tight and you can’t maximize your retirement accounts, that’s okay. But do whatever you can to get your employer’s matching contribution, if they offer it. For example, if your employer’s 401(k) matches up to 5%, strive to contribute at least 5% to capitalize on that free money.
-
Contribute to an IRA: If you’re maxing out your workplace retirement plan and still have cash to spare, you can save more for retirement with an IRA. Keep in mind that Roth IRA contributions may be limited if your income exceeds certain thresholds.
-
Make catch-up contributions: If you’re at least 50 years old, you can make up for lost time with catch-up contributions to your retirement accounts. Catch-up contribution limits vary by account type. For instance, as of 2025, catch-up limits for 401(k)s and 403(b)s is $7,500. For IRAs, it’s $1,000.
-
Build a better budget: If you’re struggling to put money away for retirement, you may need to review your budget. See if you can reduce your monthly expenses and divert more cash toward retirement savings. This does two things: It helps you get used to a more affordable lifestyle, and it frees up more money for your 401(k) or IRA.
-
Work longer: If you’re able to continue working past traditional retirement age, you can continue saving for retirement and shorten the amount of time you’ll need to rely on your retirement savings. However, you’ll generally need to make required minimum distributions (RMDs) beginning at age 73, though some exceptions apply if you’re still working.
-
Delay Social Security: If you can afford to delay Social Security benefits for a period of time, you’ll receive larger payments. Social Security benefits increase by a certain percentage each month you delay taking them, up to age 70.
Retirement savings FAQs
How many people have $1,000,000 in retirement savings?
According to 2022 data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, roughly 54.3% of U.S. households have retirement account assets. Of those, 4.6% have assets totalling more than $1 million. Taken together, this data shows that about 2.5% of all U.S. households have more than $1,000,000 in retirement savings.
What is the average 401(k) balance at age 65?
According to data from Fidelity, the average 401(k) balance for those ages 65 to 69 is $251,400.
What is a good monthly retirement income?
A good monthly retirement income varies by cost of living, net worth, age, and other factors. For a general guideline, the 4% rule says you can safely withdraw 4% of your retirement savings each year. For example, say you have $1 million in retirement savings. According to this rule, you can safely withdraw 4% of this amount, or $40,000, per year. This breaks down to about $3,300 per month.",795f1ed4c1f488bbc7530cdb336f380d,trafilatura

UPDATE: Aug. 20, 2025: This story has been updated to include comment from Proper Hospitality.
Dive Brief:
-
Santa Monica Proper was accused of not paying its workers the minimum wage in Santa Monica, California, according to a class action lawsuit filing in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, obtained by Hotel Dive.
-
The suit alleges that the luxury hotel has paid its workers below the minimum wages set forth by the Santa Monica Hotel Workers Living Wage Ordinance, which mandates tiered annual wage increases for hotel workers in the city.
-
Hotel worker wage ordinances are in effect across several California cities. Elsewhere in the state, hotel associations are fighting a $30 minimum wage set to take effect in tandem with the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
Dive Insight:
The Santa Monica Hotel Workers Living Wage Ordinance, which was enacted in 2016, mandates a wage of $19.73 per hour from July 1, 2023; $20.32 per hour from July 1, 2024; and $21.01 per hour from July 1, 2025 — all of which the lawsuit claims Santa Monica Proper has failed to pay.
“This shortfall not only undercuts their livelihoods but highlights the glaring hypocrisy of a luxury establishment profiting handsomely while skimping on fair pay for those who make it shine,” the suit reads, going on to point out that the high-end hotel, which has rooms ranging from $650 to $2,400 a night, “pays some of its employees less than what it charges for a bowl of hummus.”
In an email to Hotel Dive, Proper Hospitality refuted the lawsuit’s claims.
“Santa Monica Proper Hotel operates under a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the union representing our team members, and we have honored that agreement from day one,"" a spokesperson said. “Our compensation and benefits are highly competitive, and our team receives comprehensive health care coverage and retirement pension contributions—benefits that go above and beyond what the Santa Monica Hotel Worker Living Wage Ordinance requires.""
The suit’s plaintiffs, Chelsea Kupitz and Eric Block, are employees at the hotel. The suit’s attorneys and hospitality union Unite Here did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Santa Monica is one of several California cities with a minimum wage ordinance specifically for hotel employees. In 2023, workers represented by Unite Here Local 11 filed an initiative for what was then considered the highest minimum wage in the country: $30.",590a78d6866e697e6eb235a033d03569,trafilatura

Today, however, the race has accelerated.
Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to achieve exponential processing power, compared to other computers, which process information in bits (either zero or one). With advances in hardware, networking, artificial intelligence (AI), and commercialization, the global quantum computing market is getting closer to being a $12.6 billion market by 2032. This has piqued investors’ interest in this emerging technology.
Which companies will lead the race ahead? Let’s find out.
Quantum Computing Stock #1: IonQ
With a market cap of $11.9 billion, IonQ (IONQ) is a pure-play quantum computing company that designs, builds, and operates quantum computers. The company’s goal is to make quantum computing practical and commercially viable, while also laying the groundwork for future quantum networks.
While IONQ stock is down 11% year to date, it has returned 410% over the past year.
In the second quarter, the company reported revenue of $20.7 million, which was 15% higher than expected. The highlight of the quarter was the $1 billion equity investment closed in July, representing the largest single investment in quantum computing and networking history. This financing increased IonQ’s pro forma cash balance to $1.6 billion, giving it the financial flexibility to carry out its aggressive expansion plans. However, it raised concerns about share dilution and the timeline for profitable growth.
At the same time, IonQ is investing heavily in growth. In the second quarter, R&D spending increased by 231% year on year to $103.4 million, reflecting significant investment in scaling quantum networking and computing capabilities. This resulted in a net loss of $177.5 million, although management stressed that this was due to strategic scaling rather than operational weaknesses.
Besides the U.S., IonQ is rapidly expanding its global presence through strategic partnerships with Japan and South Korea. Aside from government collaborations, IonQ highlighted a 20x speedup in quantum-accelerated drug development with AstraZeneca (AZN), Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS, and Nvidia (NVDA), combining hardware access with hybrid workflows.
Furthermore, IonQ’s acquisitions of Lightsynq, Oxford Ionics, and Capella Space Corporation provide the foundation for the industry’s most ambitious quantum roadmap. The company aims for 800 logical qubits by 2027, with an ambitious goal of 80,000 logical qubits by early 2030. For 2025, IonQ increased its full-year revenue guidance to between $82 million and $100 million, in line with consensus estimates. Analysts further project revenue increase of 87% to $170.9 million in 2026.
Looking ahead, IonQ’s long-term goals go far beyond selling standalone quantum computers. Management described the company’s vision as a seamlessly connected quantum ecosystem in which quantum processors, sensors, and communication endpoints interact securely across terrestrial and space networks.
CEO Niccolo de Masi emphasized that IonQ has a competitive advantage derived from decades of R&D and vertical integration, allowing it to lead as the industry transitions from theory to commercialization. He stated, “We were first to operate on all three of the Google, Amazon, and Microsoft public clouds five years ago. Looking forward, we believe our unit economic advantages will underpin IONQ’s long-term market share leadership.”
With a fortified balance sheet, an expanding global presence, and a growing ecosystem of commercial and government partners, IonQ is positioning itself to be a clear leader in this field.
Overall, on Wall Street, IONQ is a “Moderate Buy.” Among the eight analysts covering IONQ stock, four rate it a “Strong Buy,” one gives it a “Moderate Buy” rating, while three suggest a “Hold.” Its average price target of $49.57 suggests the stock can rally 36% from current levels. The high price estimate of $70 implies upside potential of 94% over the next 12 months.
Quantum Computing Stock #2: D-Wave Quantum
Valued at $5.7 billion, D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) is a quantum computing company that takes a very different approach than most other players in the industry. Instead of developing gate-based quantum computers like IonQ, IBM, or Google, D-Wave focuses on quantum annealing, a technique used to solve optimization problems.
D-Wave stock has surged 84% year-to-date, outperforming the broader market. The stock has also returned an eye-catching 1,567% over the past year.
Customers can access D-Wave’s quantum computers via the Leap cloud platform, which provides real-time access to its most recent machines, such as the Advantage system with over 5,000 qubits.
In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue came in at $3.1 million, up 42% year-over-year. A key contributor to this increase was $1 million in revenue from the Advantage2 quantum processing unit (QPU) upgrade at the Jülich Supercomputing Center. Bookings surged as well, totaling $1.3 million, a 92% increase from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted gross margin stood at 71.8%, down slightly from 73.1% in the year-ago period.
D-Wave emphasized that its growing sales pipeline is increasingly dominated by large enterprises and Global 2000 companies. Over the last four quarters, D-Wave has collaborated with over 100 revenue-generating customers, including nearly two dozen Forbes Global 2000 firms from the commercial, government, and research sectors. Given its aggressive R&D spending, the adjusted net loss stood at $25.3 million, compared to $20 million a year earlier.
One of the quarter’s highlights was D-Wave’s record cash balance of $819.3 million, which was fueled by $400 million raised from the company’s fourth at-the-market equity program and $99.3 million from warrant exercises, among other things. Despite increased net losses, management emphasized that D-Wave is poised to be the “first independent publicly held quantum computing company to achieve sustained profitability.”
Interestingly, the company believes it can accomplish this with significantly less funding than its competitors, owing to its hybrid business model of quantum cloud services, system sales, and expanding enterprise partnerships. Analysts predict a revenue increase of 178.2% in fiscal 2025, followed by a 55.9% increase to $38.3 million in fiscal 2026.
Overall, Wall Street rates D-Wave’s stock a “Strong Buy.” Among the 11 analysts covering the stock, nine rate it a “Strong Buy,” one rates it a “Moderate Buy” and one says it is a “Hold.” The stock’s average target price of $21.20 suggests upside potential of 39% from current levels. Plus, its high-end estimate of $30 suggests it has the potential to rally up to 96% over the next 12 months.

Stock Soars As Lee Doubles Down
That kind of conviction has caught Wall Street's eye. Ethereum recently traded near $3,679, up 40% over the past month, even while still 24% below its 2021 high. BMNR has rocketed over 725% year-to-date, peaking at $135 in July before settling near $58. For a company once synonymous with Bitcoin mining, the pivot has been nothing short of explosive.
For Lee, who has made a career out of contrarian calls, the message is clear: Ethereum's utility—staking rewards, smart contracts, and scaling—outweighs Bitcoin's static ""digital gold"" narrative. Institutional investors may be starting to agree. As Lee himself argues, ETH is fast becoming a Wall Street favorite, offering yield and real-world functionality that Bitcoin can't match.
Whether Ethereum can overtake Bitcoin in market dominance remains an open question. Indeed, it has a long way to go. Between Aug. 11–15, Ethereum spot ETFs saw a record $2.85 billion inflow—the largest weekly gain ever.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs drew $548 million.
U.S.-listed ETH ETFs now hold $28.15 billion (5.34% of ETH's market cap), compared with Bitcoin's $151.98 billion (6.54% of BTC's market cap).",f6b402b03ac0d81f99d1e5b00651fd31,trafilatura

The STH RP, which reflects the average acquisition price of coins moved within the past 155 days, is a key metric for gauging near-term investor positioning.
Bitcoin has historically treated the STH RP level as support during bull markets, often retesting it during corrections of 20% to 30% before resuming upward momentum.
Since February, BTC has consistently held above this level, with the most recent test in April marking the cycle low at $76,000, a move that coincided with market stress following the announcement of President Trump's new tariffs.
Realized Price (RP) itself, which reflects the average acquisition price across the entire coin supply, has also continued trending upwards. This increase, alongside the rise in STH RP, signals that investors are actively accumulating coins at progressively higher prices, reinforcing structural support for the market.
In fact, over the past seven days, both the RP and STH RP have risen by more than 1%, underscoring continued inflows and conviction among buyers.
These dynamics reflect an important backdrop for the current correction: while short-term volatility has pressured price action, the rising cost basis of investors suggests that new capital continues to enter the market at elevated levels, absorbing selling pressure and maintaining bitcoin’s longer-term bullish structure.

(Reuters) -TJX Cos raised its annual profit forecast on Wednesday, betting on resilient demand for apparel and home furnishing at its off-price retail stores, sending its shares about 6% higher.
The company also beat estimates for second-quarter sales and profit as budget-conscious shoppers flocked to discount stores to sidestep uncertainties around how the Trump administration's tariffs will impact prices going ahead.
""The treasure hunt shopping model, which blends value with surprise-and-delight, continued to keep traffic strong and consumers engaged with the brand,"" Emarketer analyst Suzy Davidkhanian said.
""While its closest peer set, department stores, continue to face margin pressure and store closures, TJX delivered margin improvement and continued to grow its footprint, cementing its healthy position in a mixed economic climate.""
Analysts have also said off-price retailers such as TJX-owned TJ Maxx, Ross Stores and Burlington Stores could avoid any direct hit from China tariffs in the near term due to their expansive sourcing strategies.
TJX can offset cost pressures even if the current U.S. import tariffs remain for the rest of the year, the company said on Wednesday, thanks to its vast sourcing strategy that allows it to replenish inventory dynamically.
""Their (TJX) ability to raise inventories has always been strengthening as the consumer has slowed down and has pulled back somewhat so far this year,"" said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager of equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, which invests in the company's stock.
TJX expects earnings per share for fiscal 2026 to be between $4.52 and $4.57, compared with its previous view of $4.34 to $4.43.
The company now expects comparable store sales growth of 3%, versus its prior forecast of 2% to 3%.
Net sales of $14.4 billion for the quarter ended Aug. 2 exceeded expectations of $14.13 billion, while earnings per share of $1.10 beat estimates of $1.01, according to data compiled by LSEG.
TJX's quarterly margins rose 0.3 basis points to 30.7%.

The Quantum Computing Race Is On: These 2 Stocks Appear Poised to Lead
However, the toy maker stock has slightly lagged behind the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLY) nearly 24% return over the past 52 weeks.
Despite posting better-than-expected Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.30 and revenue of $980.8 million, Hasbro shares fell marginally on Jul. 23. Investors were concerned about a 16% drop in consumer products sales, driven by U.S. retailers delaying orders amid tariff uncertainty. Additionally, the company still expects around $60 million in incremental tariff-related costs and relies heavily on China for nearly 50% of its sourcing, which, despite plans to reduce to 40% by 2027.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect HAS’ adjusted EPS to grow 21.5% year-over-year to $4.87. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 12 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Strong Buy.” That’s based on 10 “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” and one “Hold.”
This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with eight “Strong Buy“ ratings on the stock.
On Jul. 24, JPMorgan raised Hasbro’s price target to $94, maintaining an “Overweight“ rating.
As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $89. The Street-high price target of $95 implies a potential upside of 18.7% from the current price levels.

Dive Brief:
-
Claire’s has paused store closures in light of a deal, announced Wednesday, to sell its North America operations. The retailer had plans to shutter 700 stores and was mulling liquidation of its entire 1,500-store footprint in North America.
-
An affiliate of private equity firm Ames Watson has agreed to acquire the tween accessories retailer, including its intellectual property, for $104 million in cash plus a $36 million seller note, per court documents.
-
The firm will also assume certain liabilities, including cure costs, and pay some rent and wages for “a significant number of [Claire’s] employees.” Claire’s filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.
Dive Insight:
This deal will come as a surprise to some, given how Claire’s struggled for months to find a buyer, before and after heading back to bankruptcy court this month. The retailer previously filed under Chapter 11 in 2018.
“The Debtors left no stone unturned in their sale and marketing process,” the company told the court Wednesday, noting that it had “entered chapter 11 with multiple letters of intent and worked tirelessly with these counterparties since the Petition Date to convert the letters of intent into binding bids and, ultimately, an asset purchase agreement.”
Claire’s reached out to 160 potential financial and strategic firms and executed more than 60 non-disclosure agreements, per court documents.
“That effort was a success,” the company also said, and urged the court’s approval.
The development changes a lot. A couple of weeks ago, Claire’s initiated plans to close 700 locations, including all Walmart shop-in-shops and Icing stores, and warned that its entire fleet in the U.S. and Canada could ultimately shutter. With Ames Watson’s agreement to acquire at least 795 Claire’s stores in North America — and potentially as many as 950 — nearly all store employees plus many at the retailer’s headquarters will keep their jobs, per court documents.
The deal — which comes with a “fiduciary out” if Claire’s gets a better offer — also allows the retailer to fully pay down its asset-based loan, per court documents.
Ames Watson co-founder Lawrence Berger in a statement called Claire’s an “iconic brand.” The private equity firm also owns or has invested in Lids, Champion, South Moon Under and Fanatics, among other brands.",ef2e4a745185ad4c4ac956c54ef0d42a,trafilatura

Consumer discretionary stocks are outperforming the broader market, with sector-focused ETFs outpacing the S&P 500 over the past year.
-
Uber's proven business growth makes the stock look downright cheap.
-
Fiverr's profits are expected to soar over the next year, and its cash profits are already strong.
Consumer goods stocks have been hot recently, despite the looming shadows of inflation and unpredictable tariffs. The Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VOO) posted a total return of 17.6% over the past year, as I write this on Aug. 18. That's well above average for the popular S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracker. But its sister fund in the consumer goods sector, the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSEMKT: VCR), saw a total return of 22.7% over the same period.
In other words, cyclical consumer goods stocks are beating the broader market these days, largely without any help from artificial intelligence (AI) market darlings.
But there's still room to grow in this booming market, even in the red-hot consumer discretionary sector. I'm particularly interested in two leaders in the gig economy right now. Read on to see why you might want to grab some Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) and Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR) shares in August 2025.
Uber still rules the road
Let's start with ride-sharing veteran Uber.
First and foremost, Uber's business is thriving. In the recent second-quarter report, revenue rose 18% year over year with stable average revenues per user. In other words, the company is boosting its top-line results by earning more ride-share requests, not by increasing service prices.
At the same time, Uber's operations are growing more efficient. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 35% and free cash flow jumped 44% higher.
And that's not the whole story. Uber also plans to put 20,000 self-driving vehicles in use over the next six years -- a drop in the ocean of more than 7 million drivers, but an important step toward a safer and more profitable future.
The stock has gained 27% over the last year, without becoming expensive. You can get Uber shares at the affordable valuation ratios of 16 times earnings and 4.1 times sales. That's a bargain in this economy.
Don't judge Fiverr's book by its P/E cover
Then there's freelance service wrangler Fiverr. If you thought Uber's stock was affordable, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Sure, Fiverr's stock trades at a rich price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 50.0, but that's an outlier. Fiverr suddenly looks undervalued when you base your analysis on cash gains instead of after-tax accounting profits, with a price to free cash flow ratio of 9.3. And if you include growth expectations in your earnings review, Fiverr's forward P/E ratio stops at 8.5. From either one of these perspectives, Fiverr is hanging out in Wall Street's bargain bin.",d01176c4f3e69040ebb5a185fcf97a95,trafilatura

First, the retailer released its Q2 2025 results, which revealed it is still facing substantial sales headwinds. Next, the company said it will soon have a new CEO—its first chief executive change in over a decade.

And Wall Street isn’t reacting favorably to either bit of news, based on how TGT shares are reacting in premarket trading as of the time of this writing. The stock price is currently down nearly 10% to just above $95 per share. Here’s what you need to know.
Target’s disappointing Q2 2025
Today, Target announced its second quarter 2025 results before markets opened. Those results came in slightly ahead of the already low investor expectations, but they were also still down from the same period a year earlier.
For its Q2 2025, Target reported the following:
-
Earnings per share (EPS): $2.05
-
Revenue: $25.21 billion
As CNBC notes, those figures actually came in slightly above LSEG analyst expectations, which were expected EPS of $2.03 and expected revenue of $24.93 billion.
Yet those small beats weren’t enough to discourage investors from dumping the stock. Target reported several other metrics that show the company is still struggling.
The company revealed that its net sales were down 0.9% for the quarter, with comparable sales decreasing by 1.9%. Its net income for the quarter was $935 million, which was down significantly from the $1.19 billion in net income in the same quarter a year earlier. Likewise, its revenue of $25.21 billion for the quarter was also down from a year earlier, when net revenue totaled $25.45.
The company also maintained its current full fiscal 2025 forecast of adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of between $7 and $9. This forecast expects the company to see “a low-single digit decline in sales.” The company previously cut back its initial full-year forecast back in May.
Meet Target’s new CEO, Michael Fiddelke
In addition to announcing its Q2 2025 results, Target also revealed that it would be getting a new CEO. The company announced that its current CEO, Brian Cornell, will be stepping down from the role in February 2026. On February 1, its new CEO, Michael Fiddelke, will take the reins. Cornell has been Target’s CEO since 2014.",0cc44cf988ae09ce1a03bde364344b1b,trafilatura

The second-largest cryptocurrency is now up nearly 30% year-to-date, testing bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance in a way not seen since late last year. This time, however, ether is taking market share rather than ceding it, the report said.
Spot ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a surge of demand. Cumulative net inflows now top $13 billion, up from just $2.6 billion in April, analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert wrote.
As ETF balances grow, flows are playing a more direct role in price dynamics, the analysts said.
Ether treasury firms have also joined the bid, with large purchases beginning in May. Their collective holdings now hover near $10 billion at current market values, while the equity valuations of these companies have expanded alongside ether’s rally, the report noted.
Blockchain data shows large wallets accumulating ether while smaller investors trim exposure. Ether balances on centralized exchanges continue to decline, signaling a shift of supply back on-chain. This dynamic could be amplifying the latest leg higher, creating a squeeze-like effect, the report added.
While the rally has been sharp, the bank's analysts caution it isn’t purely technical. On-chain activity has picked up, reinforcing the move with stronger fundamentals. Combined with a macro backdrop that resembles a “goldilocks” environment, neither too hot nor too cold, ether's resurgence could have legs, particularly with supportive regulatory signals and bullish narratives in play.

But the new open models of AI matter more,2025-08-21 21:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"ChatGPT maker OpenAI made headlines this month with two major launches: the release of two so-called open weight models and the debut of the long-anticipated next generation Chat-GPT 5. While most of the media and industry buzz focused on the latter, it’s the open models, and the rapidly advancing ecosystem around them, that could make a bigger difference for everyone from researchers to small businesses.
The idea of open versus closed (or proprietary) models is familiar to anyone who has worked in software, and the definition is the same when it comes to AI. According to our partners at the Open Source Initiative (OSI), open source AI means anyone can look at how the model works, change it, use it, and share it freely without needing to ask for permission. OpenAI’s new open weight models don’t entirely meet this definition, but they are still in position to deliver the most impact for many businesses.
A Morning Consult report from 2013 identified cost and privacy as the primary barriers to AI adoption for small businesses. The arrival of open models has the potential to address both concerns: they can be deployed offline, enabling greater data privacy, and they are free to use.
Proprietary AI models often deliver stronger performance, but they require costly infrastructure and must run on an external provider’s servers, which requires a business to hand over its data. Open source models, by contrast, are improving quickly, and as they narrow the performance gap. Already, it is possible to run certain models locally, or even on a laptop or within a company’s own walls—options that can offer a powerful, self-managed alternative in the right circumstances.
Why should businesses care?
AI is becoming a lot more practical for Main Street businesses. What’s new isn’t just that open models can be a fixed-cost asset instead of a metered service. It’s that these self-hosted, affordable models are getting good—really good! Small businesses can now keep customer data in-house, avoid surprise price hikes, and spin up niche copilots like a “local operations assistant” or a “custom cake-order concierge” on their own terms, without needing to be AI experts or train models themselves.
Open models also come with built-in transparency. Business owners can get a direct view of how the AI works, and the ability to store data in-house offers a surer way to meet compliance obligations. This is particularly important in an era where centralized data storage systems have been the targets of data breaches.
Having full control over the AI stack also means businesses can adapt and integrate models into the parts of their operations that matter most, such as loyalty programs, supply chain workflows, or customer support scripts, without worrying about vendor lock-in or shifting API terms. That kind of control turns AI into a strategic asset and helps businesses create more tailored, differentiated experiences.",8a04fc590c56aaca9ca64214bcd6441c,trafilatura

Nu Holdings is adding customers at a high rate in all of its regions.
-
It's expanding into a high-income customer base and into new markets.
-
It's also scaling profitably, with a large addressable market in gross profit.
Online bank Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU) released another fabulous earnings report last week, demonstrating solid growth. It's becoming a financial powerhouse, an upstart challenging the legacy banks and succeeding.mNu stock jumped after the report, and it's up 26% year to date. Is there still time to buy?
Disrupting finance in Latin America
Nu is an all-digital bank based and Brazil and serving Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. It reports robust growth every quarter, and it has tremendous growth opportunities.
Customers keep coming
Nu added 4.1 million new accounts in the 2025 second quarter, ending the period with 123 million accounts, or 17% more than last year. It has 60% of the adult population in Brazil, 13% in Mexico, and 10% in Colombia.
Revenue increased 40% year over year in the quarter, driven by new additions as well as cross-selling. Average revenue per active customer (ARPAC) rose 18% over last year to $12.20 as customers add new and more expensive products, and the longer customers are on the platform, the higher the average, with customers active for 96 months averaging $27.30.
Profits are soaring
Nu is scaling profitably, with its all-online platform leading to lower costs. It has kept its cost to serve stable at around $0.80, and the efficiency ratio is down to 28% from 32% last year. Gross profit increased 78% year over year, and net income increased from $487 million last year to $637 million this year.
Many growth drivers
Nu is still in its early stages, and it has multiple growth drivers that should keep it in growth mode for the foreseeable future.
New customers
Although a majority of the adult population in Brazil is already on the platform, Brazil is the largest country in Latin America, and it adds more new accounts there monthly than in its newer markets. However, those markets are growing faster. It's still a small presence in Mexico and Colombia, with a long growth runway. Credit card accounts increased 11% over last year, for example, but they increased 52% in Mexico and 34% in Colombia.
High-income customers
Nu's low fees attract the mass customer at high rates, but it's making inroads into the affluent population, whose large deposits and high spending are much more lucrative. It has 3 million high-income customers, a 13% increase over last year.",abfc7da593fdf55e2ff9d1d6f2014dc4,trafilatura

Narrowing the focus, MAS’ underperformance is also apparent compared to the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 2.2% over the past year. Moreover, the ETF’s 9.9% returns on a YTD basis outshine the stock’s gains over the same time frame.

The company’s revenue was $2.1 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $2 billion. MAS expects full-year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.90 to $4.10.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect MAS’ EPS to decline 1.7% to $4.03 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It beat or matched the consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on another occasion.
Among the 22 analysts covering MAS stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on seven “Strong Buy” ratings, 14 “Holds,” and one “Moderate Sell.”
This configuration is less bullish than a month ago, with eight analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy.”
On Aug. 6, RBC Capital analyst Michael Dahl maintained a “Hold” rating on MAS and set a price target of $71.
The mean price target of $74.61 represents a marginal premium to MAS’ current price levels. The Street-high price target of $85 suggests an upside potential of 14.1%.

Shares of Wynn Resorts fell marginally following its Q2 2025 results on Aug. 7 as the company reported weaker-than-expected adjusted EPS of $1.09. The weakness was driven by its Macau operations, where adjusted property operating profit declined 9.5% to $253 million, hurt by softer VIP hold.

The divergence in behavior follows a series of recent key events, including a spot ETF filing and a high-profile corporate acquisition.
A capitulation event was spotted on August 15 with 271.41 million DOGE sold at a loss, according to Santiment data.
A capitulation event is when investors sell their token at a loss amid volatile price regimes.
Dogecoin experienced a 16% correction between August 13 and 14, resulting in a local bottom formation on August 15. But retail investors, often swayed by ephemeral price moves, sold their tokens at a loss on August 15.
The profitability of short-term holders who purchased Dogecoin tokens in the past month reached 9% on August 19, further highlighting the capitulation.
Over the same period, however, whales holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE acquired more than 330 million DOGE at a discount, bringing their total holdings to 26.73 billion.
""This looks like the community shaking out short-term price chasers while long-term believers add to their stacks,"" Jordan Jefferson, Founder and CEO of Dogecoin app layer DogeOS, told Decrypt.
However, this divergence is not a cause for concern, he argued. “Supply is moving into steadier hands that care about Dogecoin’s future rather than the daily chart,"" Jefferson explained.
Dogecoin ETF incoming?
This dynamic between short and long-term holders is playing out against the backdrop of several major headlines.
On August 16, Grayscale filed an S-1 for a spot Dogecoin ETF.
Though the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has since delayed its decision, this move, coupled with the announcement of a Trump family-backed company acquiring a Dogecoin mining firm, has injected both institutional legitimacy and speculative hype surrounding Dogecoin.
SEC Punts on Trump Media Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Decision, Plus XRP and Dogecoin Funds
Jefferson believes this split is a key differentiator in how retail and institutional investors process information.
""Headlines move fast, and retail speculators chase them,"" he stated, noting that whales, in contrast, ""see past that, recognizing that DOGE is stepping onto institutional rails while also moving into real-world applications.""
This long-term view enables large investors to capitalize on short-term price weakness to accumulate for the future.
Rather than pointing to the future downside, Jefferson argued that the capitulation and accumulation signal a healthy consolidation phase for Dogecoin.",ed293b60872b99bffc20fa488a75bff4,trafilatura

In a trading update yesterday (19 August), the maker of protein powders, bars and nutrition drinks provided a provisional estimate of its earnings for its financial year that recently closed on 31 July.
Applied Nutrition anticipates revenue to have increased by 24% to £107m ($144.4m). The figure exceeds market forecasts of £100m.
The company attributed the growth to “strong” trading in the second half of the year, which contributed around £60m to its revenue.
Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) are projected to rise by 19% from £26m in the prior year.
Additionally, net cash is expected to reach £18.5m, surpassing the market consensus of £16.6m.
The company, which went public in October, credited its performance to the continued execution of its “multi-pillar, global growth strategy”.
Looking ahead, Applied Nutrition expects revenue for the financial year ending 31 July 2026 to also surpass market expectations.
The board expressed confidence in the company’s B2B-focused business model, stating that its core strengths will “continue to drive sustained revenue growth and strong profitability over the long-term”.
Applied Nutrition plans to release its audited results for the year ended 31 July on or around 10 November.
Thomas Ryder, the CEO of Applied Nutrition, said: ""We are proud to report that we have exceeded the guidance we gave at our IPO, with our first full-year results expected to come in ahead of market expectations.""
Applied Nutrition offers four product ranges – Applied Nutrition, ABE, BodyFuel and Endurance – with over 100 products sold in more than 85 countries.
The company operates a US division to support sales through retailer Walmart. It has marketing tie-ups with English and Scottish football clubs, professional boxers and MMA athletes.

In the August 15 Market on Close livestream, John Rowland, CMT, and team walked through why the current market setup deserves your attention — and how to prepare using Barchart’s tools.
What “Mag-7 Concentration” Actually Means
The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) is market-cap weighted, so larger companies move the index more. And there aren’t too many bigger companies than the “Magnificent Seven” group of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA).

Palo Alto Networks Stock is a Favorite of Value Investors After Its Latest Results
Recently, multiple outlets pegged the Mag 7’s combined weight at around ~34% of the S&P 500 — an all-time high.
Concentration cuts both ways:
-
When they rally, the index flies — even if many other stocks tread water.
-
When they wobble, the whole index can roll over, even if breadth elsewhere looks OK.
Recent data also shows how the cap-weighted S&P has outpaced its equal-weight cousin, which keeps every stock weighted the same, underscoring how much leadership rests in a few names.
The “Probabilities” Discussion from the Show
In the clip, we reference a UBS note flagging that when Mag-7 weight crossed certain thresholds (~27.5% and ~34%) in the past, the S&P 500 went on to stage a short rally before falling roughly ~13% over the next two months — i.e., a textbook “correction.” That doesn’t guarantee a drop this time, but it’s a risk marker worth respecting. That’s particularly true since UBS and many others have already been vocal about concentration risks in 2025.
Another caution light comes from the equity risk premium (ERP). ERP is the expected return of stocks over risk-free Treasuries, and it has now slipped toward multi-decade lows, meaning stocks are expensive relative to bonds and forward returns can be thinner. That’s been highlighted by Bloomberg and others this summer.
None of this screams “go to cash.” It does argue for:
-
Smarter entry timing;
-
Diversification beyond the biggest names;
-
And a plan if market leadership stumbles.",180868e2309963993876f56a869ef78c,trafilatura

For many new retirees, it’s also when costly financial mistakes can set the stage for decades of money problems. Aaron Channing has seen these mistakes firsthand. As a partner and private wealth advisor at Fortivus Wealth Group, a Northwestern Mutual Private Client Group, he works with clients navigating the transition from earning to spending their nest eggs.
Be Aware: 6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early
Read Next: 5 Cities You Need To Consider If You're Retiring in 2025
The mistakes he sees aren’t just about poor planning. They’re about failing to adjust to a completely different financial reality. Here are the four biggest money mistakes Channing said new retirees make in their first year.
Many new retirees make a dangerous assumption. They think they can keep the same aggressive investment approach that worked during their earning years.
“A common oversight among new retirees is neglecting to shift their investment approach to reflect their new financial reality,” Channing explained. “Continuing with a high-risk strategy in retirement can expose assets to unnecessary volatility, which may be harder to recover from without a steady income.”
The problem is timing. During working years, aggressive growth strategies make sense because you have decades to recover from market downturns. You also have a steady paycheck to keep adding money to your accounts.
Retirement changes everything. You no longer have decades to recover from losses. You also don’t have earned income to build accounts back up after market crashes.
“Transitioning to a more conservative investment strategy doesn’t mean abandoning growth entirely,” Channing shared. “Instead, it involves rebalancing the portfolio to prioritize capital preservation and reduced exposure to market fluctuations.”
The key is finding the right balance for your specific situation. Someone planning frequent travel or large discretionary spending needs a different allocation than someone focused on maintaining a modest lifestyle.
“This is why working with a financial advisor is so valuable,” Channing said. “Advisors serve as impartial experts who can tailor recommendations to align with a retiree’s specific circumstances, helping to ensure that their investment strategy supports both short-term needs and long-term financial security.”
The freedom of retirement often triggers a spending urge that can derail even well-planned budgets. New retirees frequently celebrate this milestone with expensive purchases they’ve been dreaming about for years.
“It’s common for individuals transitioning into retirement to feel compelled to make a significant purchase, such as a vacation home, luxury vehicle or other high-ticket item,” Channing said. “These decisions are often driven by a desire to celebrate a milestone or fulfill a long-held aspiration.”
The problem isn’t the desire for nice things. It’s the timing and impact on fixed retirement income.
“Such purchases can place considerable strain on retirement finances, especially when income becomes more fixed and predictable,” Channing explained.
There’s a simple solution. If the purchase is truly essential or deeply meaningful, consider making it during your working years when income is still active and flexible.
“Alternatively, exploring less costly options that still meet the underlying need can help preserve retirement savings while still providing satisfaction,” he suggested.
The key is adjusting your budget before making major purchases, not after. Many new retirees buy first and figure out the financial impact later, which can create lasting problems.
Impatience often drives one of the costliest mistakes new retirees make. Many people start withdrawing from retirement accounts or claiming Social Security benefits as soon as they’re eligible, despite not knowing the full impact of this move.
“One of the most common financial missteps in early retirement is accessing retirement accounts or claiming Social Security benefits prematurely,” Channing said. “Without a clear understanding of the tax implications and optimal timing, early withdrawals can trigger higher tax liabilities and significantly shorten the lifespan of retirement savings.”
The consequences extend far beyond immediate tax bills. Early withdrawals can affect decades of future income.
“This can be especially detrimental if the funds are needed to last for several decades,” Channing warned.
Retirees who can delay tapping into Social Security and other retirement accounts, particularly beyond their full retirement age, can benefit from delayed retirement credits.
“These credits can substantially increase monthly Social Security payments for life, offering a more secure and predictable income stream,” Channing explained. “Additionally, postponing withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts allows those investments to continue growing, potentially improving long-term financial outcomes.”
Every year you delay Social Security past full retirement age adds about 8% to your monthly benefit until age 70. For someone entitled to $2,000 monthly at full retirement age, waiting until 70 could mean an extra $640 per month for life.
Healthcare costs often blindside new retirees who assume Medicare will cover everything they need. This assumption can be financially devastating.
“Many retirees mistakenly assume that health insurance or Medicare will fully cover long-term care expenses,” Channing said. “In reality, these programs often fall short, leaving individuals vulnerable to significant out-of-pocket costs if they face an unexpected illness or injury that limits their independence.”
The financial impact goes beyond just medical bills. Inadequate planning can force difficult choices about quality of care and your living arrangements.
“Without proper planning, healthcare and long-term care expenses can strain retirement finances, forcing retirees to settle for limited care options or compromise their preferred living arrangements,” Channing explained.
Personal income sources like pensions, Social Security and investment income may help cover ongoing costs. Government programs such as Medicaid or veterans’ benefits can provide additional support.
“Long-term care insurance is another valuable tool, offering broad coverage at a relatively low premium,” Channing said.
The key is planning before you need care, not after. Once health issues arise, insurance options become limited and expensive.
“Whether through insurance, income planning or a combination of resources, preparing for healthcare and long-term care needs is essential to maintaining both financial stability and quality of life in retirement,” he said.

Its footprint spans 54 countries and territories, delivering a wide range of solutions, including commercial and personal property and casualty insurance, personal accident and supplemental health coverage, reinsurance, and life insurance.
Over the past year, shares of CB have experienced a mild decline, lagging the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which climbed 14.3% during the same period. Year-to-date, the stock remains in a negative territory, failing to match the SPX’s 9% gain.

Even when compared to the broader financial sector, CB trails the S&P 500 Financials Sector SPDR (XLF), which recorded a 19.5% gain over the last 52 weeks. Year-to-date, CB has not been able to keep pace with XLF’s 8.8% growth.
Chubb has been struggling to keep pace with the broader market, pressured by a rotation out of defensive stocks, rising competition in property insurance, and persistent macroeconomic headwinds. That weakness resurfaced after the company released its second-quarter results on July 22. Even though the insurer posted strong numbers, shares slipped almost 3.1% the following trading day as investors shrugged off the beat and focused instead on broader market trends.
Net premiums written, a key top-line metric closely watched by insurance investors, rose 6.3% year-over-year (YOY) to $14.2 billion. Core operating EPS for Q2 2025 reached $6.14, surpassing analyst expectations of $5.98 on a non-GAAP basis and marking a 14.1% increase from the previous year. The muted market response had less to do with Chubb’s performance and more to do with the current investment climate. With defensive names out of favor, even a strong quarter wasn’t enough to capture Wall Street’s attention.
Looking ahead, analysts project Chubb’s EPS for fiscal year 2025, ending in December, to decline by 4.2%, reaching $21.57 on a diluted basis. Nevertheless, the company holds an impressive track record of consistently exceeding consensus estimates over the past four quarters.",673261db5513fadefbd53cae048c5ca7,trafilatura

India and China: US Tariffs Turn Rivals Toward Friendship in Major Geopolitical Shift
The Financial Times reported last month that the fast-fashion company had filed for an IPO in Hong Kong; the fast-fashion company has notoriously struggled to find a sound landing location for the IPO it has reportedly pursued in two other markets: New York and London. Its U.S. IPO attempt faced scrutiny over its alleged involvement with forced labor, while its London IPO filing has faced regulatory hurdles, according to CNBC.
New York or London could have provided an air of credibility to the company, which in Western markets has caught backlash from multiple directions—shoppers, consumer organizations and governments alike. It has also struggled to garner approval for an offshore IPO from Hong Kong; although Shein has been based in Singapore since 2021, it was founded in Nanjing, China, in 2008, and Chinese regulators still require companies with strong ties to the country to go through a review process before listing in any global market.
But now that it has applied to list on the Hong Kong exchange, it has gone as far as consulting lawyers to discuss the creation of a mainland China-based parent company, per Bloomberg’s report.
If the parent entity is created, Shein’s other operations—in Singapore and in global markets—would become subsidiaries of that entity.
Sources reportedly noted that while discussions have begun, moving Shein’s headquarters back to China is not a guarantee. Those familiar with the matter said moving back could be advantageous because it would mean that the company’s income would be taxed directly in China.
Shein has long faced scrutiny from global regulators, including U.S. officials who say that the company’s ties to the Chinese government are already concerning. Recent policy changes, like President Donald Trump’s decision to collapse the de minimis exemption for parcels inbound from Hong Kong, have also been aimed at stunting Shein and its competitors’ business models. That decision has been reinforced by the passage of Republicans’ megabill, which will see the total collapse of de minimis from all countries in 2027.

Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a Stifel company, acted as financial advisor to Capitalise.ai. Financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.
Founded in 2015, Capitalise.ai developed a system that lets users turn everyday text into executable trading strategies.
The company’s technology supports real-time and historical data analysis spanning equities, crypto, FX, futures and options. Its tools have been used by a range of traditional finance brokers and exchanges.
Kraken said it will begin rolling out Capitalise.ai’s features on its Kraken Pro platform later this year. The move is designed to lower the technical barriers to advanced trading, giving users the ability to design, backtest and automate strategies without writing code.
“This acquisition gives Kraken Pro clients a powerful new way to act on ideas in real time—testing, optimizing, and executing bespoke strategies with unprecedented speed and confidence,” said Shannon Kurtas, head of exchange at Kraken, in the release.
Co-founders Amir Shiovich and Shahar Rabin, along with key engineering staff, will join Kraken’s Pro business unit as part of the deal.

Should You Snap Up CRM Here ? ,Starboard Value Is Betting Big on Salesforce Stock . Should You Snap Up CRM Here ? ,2025-08-21 21:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Activist Starboard Value has once again set its eyes on Salesforce (CRM). The hedge fund that first shook-up Salesforce management three years ago just doubled down hard, boosting its stake by nearly 50% in the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Aug. 14. Starboard now holds approximately 1.3 million shares as of June 30, a dramatic surge from 849,679 shares at the end of Q1, when it had already increased its position by a notable 52%. In fact, Starboard's latest move comes at a strategic time.
CRM stock has been battered this year as investors flee due to slowing revenue growth, shaky execution of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies, and aggressive acquisition spending. These are the exact same red flags that triggered the activist uprising in late 2022 and early 2023, when Starboard teamed up with Third Point, ValueAct, and Elliott Management to demand better margins and operational efficiency.
Most of those activists cashed out and disappeared by mid-2023 after Salesforce delivered improved results and added board oversight. But Starboard, which is known for circling back when companies backslide on their promises, appears ready to ramp up the pressure again. The hedge fund's latest aggressive stake increase sends a clear message that Salesforce still has some room to improve its efficiency and profitability. That said, would it be wise to load up on CRM shares now?
About Salesforce Stock
Based in California, Salesforce has been a powerhouse in cloud computing ever since its founding in 1999. Over the years, it has not only pioneered the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model but also secured its dominance in the customer relationship management (CRM) space. Now, Salesforce is busy doubling down on AI, channeling big investments into tools that enhance customer engagement and boost sales team productivity. At the heart of this strategy is Agentforce, unveiled at Dreamforce 2024.
The platform promises to automate customer interactions, enabling businesses to scale their services while reducing their reliance on human labor. To further strengthen this vision, Salesforce announced plans this May for an $8 billion all-cash acquisition of Informatica, a leader in AI-powered cloud data management. Informatica’s strength lies in bringing together and cleaning data across silos, exactly the kind of backbone Salesforce needs to unlock the full potential of agentic AI.
If completed, this would be Salesforce’s most significant buy since the $27.7 billion Slack deal in 2021. But not everyone is cheering. While the Informatica acquisition was well received in the analyst community, the company’s aggressive spending, coupled with slowing revenue growth, has made some investors uneasy.
Valued at about $235 billion by market capitalization, CRM stock has pulled back 33% from its 52-week high of $369 and is down almost 27% in 2025. By contrast, the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has returned a modest 9% so far this year.
Salesforce Beats Q1 Estimates
Salesforce kicked off fiscal 2026 with an impressive start. The company’s first-quarter earnings report published on May 28 topped Wall Street’s expectations and underscored how central AI and Data Cloud have become to its growth story. Revenue climbed 8% year-over-year (YOY) to $9.8 billion, edging past consensus estimates of $9.7 billion. What really stood out, however, was the strength of its AI and Data Cloud business, which has quickly become a significant growth engine.
Annual recurring revenue from the unit surpassed the $1 billion milestone, surging more than 120% from last year, with nearly 60% of the company’s top 100 deals now including AI and Data Cloud. The momentum extended to Agentforce, which is already proving its worth. Since its launch, the AI platform has secured over 8,000 deals, with half of these being paid, while processing over 750,000 customer requests. By automating workflows, Agentforce has helped cut case volume by 7% YOY.
Profitability remained a steady anchor. GAAP operating margin rose to 19.8% from 18.7% a year ago, while non-GAAP margin held firm at 32.3%, slightly above last year’s 32.1%. Adjusted EPS shot up 6% annually to $2.58, comfortably beating estimates of $2.54. Salesforce also prioritized shareholder returns, distributing $3.1 billion through $2.7 billion in buybacks and $402 million in dividends, signaling confidence in its long-term growth prospects.
Looking ahead, management is staying upbeat. For fiscal Q2, Salesforce is guiding for adjusted EPS of $2.76 to $2.78 on revenue between $10.11 billion and $10.16 billion. For the full year, the company lifted its outlook, calling for $11.27 to $11.33 in adjusted EPS and revenue between $41 billion and $41.3 billion, implying 8% to 9% growth.
What Do Analysts Think About Salesforce Stock
After Starboard Value increased its stake in Salesforce, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria upgraded CRM stock to “Neutral” from “Underperform”, maintaining a $225 price target. While still maintaining a cautious stance, Luria emphasized that Starboard’s increased presence could intensify pressure on Salesforce to focus on core growth, maintain margins on the upswing, and avoid expensive, dilutive acquisitions.
At the same time, Stifel analyst Parker Lane trimmed his price target to $325 from $375 but reiterated a “Buy” rating. Lane sees a path for the stock to regain momentum if Salesforce can deliver steadier core performance and lift its AI and Data Cloud contributions meaningfully above the $1 billion mark.
Overall, Wall Street appears highly bullish on CRM stock, with a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 50 analysts offering recommendations, a majority of 36 analysts advocate a “Strong Buy,” two give a “Moderate Buy,” 11 advise a “Hold,” and the remaining one suggests a “Strong Sell.” The average analyst price target of $349.69 represents potential upside of 42%, while the Street-high target of $440 suggests a 79% rally from current levels.
Final Thoughts
With activist pressure from Starboard Value back in the picture, Salesforce may once again find itself pushed to sharpen its focus and boost profitability. The hedge fund has previously forced the company to be more disciplined, and with its return, hopes are rising for better efficiency and stronger execution. Moreover, considering the company’s solid fundamentals, growing momentum in AI and Data Cloud, and Wall Street’s bullish outlook, Salesforce appears to be a stock worth keeping on the radar.

Brian Cornell will be replaced next year by Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer, the company said on Wednesday.
Cornell helped re-energize the company when he became CEO in 2014, but has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive retail landscape since the Covid pandemic.
Sales at Target, which has almost 2,000 stores across the US, fell more than expected in the first quarter of 2025, and the retailer warned earlier this year that sales will continue to slip through the rest of the year. Target said people were scaling back spending over worries about the impact of tariffs and the state of the economy. The company also said customer boycotts affected sales.
The company scaled back many DEI initiatives in January after they came under attack by conservative activists and the White House.
The retreat created a backlash, and a poll in February found that Americans had changed their shopping habits and abandoned some stores in response to corporations shifting their policies to align with the Trump administration.
The Guardian reported in July that many Black Americans were boycotting stores including Target and Amazon, and earlier this year more than 250,000 people signed a pledge to boycott Target after the Rev Jamal Bryant, pastor of New Birth Baptist church in Georgia, called for a 40-day “Target Fast” that started at the beginning of the Lenten season.
The company had previously come under fire in 2024 after it reduced its collection of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride month, in response to rightwing criticism.
Target reported a 21% drop in net income in second quarter of this year. Sales were down slightly and the company reported a 1.9% dip in comparable sales – those from established physical stores and online channels. The company has seen flat or declining comparable sales in eight out of the past 10 quarters including the latest period.",650bcb54133c3dab520da367ce47290b,trafilatura

Where to Invest When Nothing Looks Cheap examined the pockets of investing where investors might find reasonably priced investments.
“‘Markets are expensive,’ says Charles Shriver, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price and co-chair of the firm’s Asset Allocation Committee. ‘We have more modest return expectations looking over the next 12 months,’” Morningstar contributor Sarah Hansen wrote.
I couldn’t agree more with the above quote.
I’ve held a significant amount of cash over the past few weeks, waiting for the steep price American consumers and companies will pay as a result of the White House’s implementation of global tariffs to reveal themselves.
That’s yet to happen, but the day of reckoning will soon be upon us. Expect the economic numbers to get worse in Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. But I digress.
Morningstar’s article pointed to four areas of relative opportunity in the markets: value stocks, international stocks, small-cap stocks, and high-yield bonds. Three of the four are part of the Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF’s (AVDV) investment strategy.
The ETF just hit its 47th new 52-week high of the past 12 months. If you’re a passively-active investor, you might want to consider allocating some of your portfolio to AVDV for the next 3-5 years. Here’s why I feel this way.
Before I get into the positives of investing in this particular ETF, let’s consider the basics of AVDV.
Avantis launched the ETF in September 2019. It has $11.45 billion in total assets invested across 1413 holdings. Its annualized total return since inception through July 31 is 11.62%. The ETF’s benchmark, the MSCI World ex USA Small Cap Index, has a five-year annualized total return of 9.50% over the past five years through July 31.
While it’s not quite the same comparison period, it’s pretty close. Over 200 basis points higher than its benchmark, it’s easy to see why it continues to hit new 52-week highs.
Here’s what the ETF’s summary prospectus has to say about its investment strategy:
“The fund seeks to achieve higher expected returns by selecting securities of companies with higher profitability and value characteristics, as well as smaller market capitalizations relative to others within the fund's small cap investment universe.
“To identify the desired market capitalization companies with higher profitability and value characteristics, the portfolio managers use reported and/or estimated company financials and market data including, but not limited to, shares outstanding, book value and its components, cash flows from operations, and accruals.”
From its summary prospectus, in addition to what you can observe from the above quote, the ETF won’t invest in a stock that has a market cap higher than the highest market cap in the benchmark. As of Sept. 24, 2024, it was $10.2 billion.
As a result, AVDV’s average market cap is $1.96 billion, about one-quarter the size of the foreign small/mid value category average of $8.30 billion. You’re going to find micro-cap stocks among the 1413 holdings.
Most importantly, the fund charges 0.36%, a very reasonable fee for an actively managed international ETF.
Now let’s get into the fund’s holdings.
Some ETFs claim to be diversified, but their top 10 holdings account for over 50% of the net assets. AVDV is not such a beast. Its top 10 accounts for just 8% of the ETF’s total assets.
Here’s a blurb about its weighting methodology from the summary prospectus:
“To determine the weight of a security within the portfolio, the portfolio managers use the market capitalization of the security relative to that of other eligible securities as a baseline, then overweight or underweight the security based on the characteristics described above [valuation and profitability metrics mentioned in summary prospectus and from earlier quote].”
Essentially, they add together the market caps of all 1413 stocks and then divide each market cap by the total to get an initial weighting. The portfolio managers then overweight or underweight each stock.
So, for example, if there were 100 stocks in an ETF’s portfolio with a total value of $200 billion, and one stock had a market cap of $4 billion, the initial weighting would be 2% [$4 billion divided by $200 billion]. The portfolio managers would then decide whether to make the final weighting higher or lower than 2%.
That’s an illustrative example. In the case of AVDV, there are 1413 stocks; the weightings are all much smaller. For example, the top holding, Marks & Spencer Group (MAKSY), whose primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange, has a market cap of 7.28 billion British pounds ($9.81 billion). That’s at the high end of the inclusion eligibility.
Given the large number of holdings, the key to delivering above-average investor returns lies more with the sector and country weightings than with individual stocks.
AVDV’s top three countries by weight are Japan (32%), the UK (12%), and Canada (10%). The top 10 countries account for 86% of the total assets, with 14% invested in 41 other countries.
As for sectors, the top three are industrials (24%), materials (19%), and financials (18%). Technology is down at 4%. This weighting allocation is not uncommon for international small-cap funds. So, if you're looking for a significant tech contribution, AVDV probably isn’t for you.
While AVDV is up 24% in the past year, its five-year return is just less than 78%, about 10 percentage points less than the S&P 500. Reversion to the mean suggests that the ETF could close the gap in the next five years.
I just returned from a two-week trip in Ireland and Spain. Of the top 10 holdings, I engaged with two of them -- I went to Marks & Spencer in Belfast and saw Iveco Group (IVCGF) trucks everywhere I went in Spain -- so you will know a number of the names in the portfolio. However, with 44% of the total assets invested in Asia Pacific and 42% in Europe, American investors won’t know most of the holdings unless they spend a lot of time in either region.
Don’t let that dissuade you. AVDV is the best deal going at the moment.

Diplomatic talks over the war in Ukraine continue to make headway. President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon, and European leaders are discussing a plan to send British and French troops to Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.
The focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000, and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July. Also, the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 49.8. In addition, Jul existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.
In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 84% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 92% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.

Here the new problem with the U . S . economy , she says","Meredith Whitney famously called the 2008 financial crisis . Here the new problem with the U . S . economy , she says",2025-08-21 22:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Nearly two decades ago, financial analyst Meredith Whitney was labeled the “Oracle of Wall Street” for her bearish views on banks ahead of the global financial crisis.
Featured in “The Big Short” book on that crisis, author Michael Lewis likened her to E.F. Hutton at the time — she talked, people listened — though she got no mention in the movie by the same name.
The CEO and founder of the Meredith Whitney Advisory Group has been spotting trouble on the horizon again, saying the U.S. faces a “bifurcated economy” driven by the high-end consumer.
In a Tuesday interview with MarketWatch, Whitney stood by a prediction she made earlier this year, that over 50% of U.S. households – many living paycheck to paycheck – faced a second recession of losing jobs, after one in 2022-2023 when stimulus checks ended.
“To me, the weakest portion of the U.S. economy, which employs over 20% of U.S. workers, is hospitality and leisure,” she said. Those jobs generally pay under $60,000 and may see the biggest hits when employment numbers start to worsen and tariffs start to weigh, she added.
“I think employment is going to be a really big pickle,” Whitney said, adding that stagflation — rising jobless numbers and sticky inflation — is a “real possibility.” That’s as college graduates are having an incredibly difficult time in getting first jobs, just as student debt payments resume, which she notes is straining multiple generations.
Whitney turned bullish on dollar stores like Dollar General DG and Dollar Tree DLTR late last year, “thinking the worst was over,” but moved away from that view in May. “I think the dollar stores are going to be challenged -– we’ll see in a couple of weeks when they report -– because their customer base will be the most economically challenged,” she said.
She now prefers “higher-end retailers” like Home Depot HD, Lowe’s LOW and Walmart WMT. Those companies “don’t scream ‘high end,’ but we argue that the fact that more of their customers are homeowners, and homeowners and the high end are the only households with a financial safety net, is significant,” Whitney told clients in a separate note.
Whether or not consumers continue to spend comes down to home ownership, according to Whitney, who said homeowners increasingly began to tap into their home equity a little over a year ago, reversing a 17-year cycle of declining equity-home loans.
“So from a peak of around $700 billion, that went down closer to $250 billion to $240 billion and that’s now increasing. And home equity is actually the fastest growing loan category of any consumer-loan product,” with credit cards, student and auto loans flat, she said.
She’s bullish on companies in that space of home equity, personal loans and cash-out refinances. Those include Rocket RKT, SoFi Technologies SOFI and Affirm Holdings AFRM — those stocks have doubled or more this year.
Whitney believes the housing market itself is headed for its worst market in decades — in terms of activity — backing up a prediction she made a month ago. “Existing-home sales are tracking under 4 million on an annualized basis and that’s the worst in over 25 years. Buyers are looking for steep discounts and sellers are not willing to make those discounts,” she said.
The trouble is that an estimated 60% of homes are owned by those over 55, who aren’t selling, partly as lower-cost downsizing options are limited, she said. “So either these folks have no mortgage or a small mortgage and the capital gains that they have to take and the costs that are required to move are prohibitive,” she said, adding that boomers may not be as wealthy as many think.
Stuck with limited alternatives, they are tapping tapping into equity in their homes, accounting for 41% of total home equity debt, she said..
That, of course is counterintuitive because individuals tend to get more conservative with money as they age, but are now struggling with increasing costs of owning a home – property insurance has risen well north of 60% over the past five years, she noted.
“Given the fact that 60% of homes are owned by seniors, that is the clear issue with affordable housing, because there’s just an inventory lock,” said Whitney.
U.S. stocks SPX DJIA COMP have opened mixed following Tuesday’s losses driven by big technology names. Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y are inching up and oil CL00 is also positive.

The buzz
Target TGT named a new CEO as it beat earnings expectations in the second quarter.
Lowe’s LOW hiked its full-year guidance and said it was buying Foundation Building Materials for $8.8 billion.
Minutes of the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting are due at 2 p.m., with an appearance by Fed. Gov. Christopher Waller at 11 a.m. ahead of that. Later, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak.
Tuesday was notable in other ways, such as a burst of energy for value plays, while momentum stocks sagged, as the chart shows. That “smells a lot like the clean-out in the AI trade we saw last January, when the release of DeepSeek drove a temporary market panic over the outlook in the space,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.

Brian Cornell will be replaced next year by Michael Fiddelke, Target’s chief operating officer, the company said on Wednesday.
Cornell helped re-energize the company when he became CEO in 2014, but has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive retail landscape since the Covid pandemic.
Sales at Target, which has almost 2,000 stores across the US, fell more than expected in the first quarter of 2025, and the retailer warned earlier this year that sales will continue to slip through the rest of the year. Target said people were scaling back spending over worries about the impact of tariffs and the state of the economy. The company also said customer boycotts affected sales.
The company scaled back many DEI initiatives in January after they came under attack by conservative activists and the White House.
The retreat created a backlash, and a poll in February found that Americans had changed their shopping habits and abandoned some stores in response to corporations shifting their policies to align with the Trump administration.
The Guardian reported in July that many Black Americans were boycotting stores including Target and Amazon, and earlier this year more than 250,000 people signed a pledge to boycott Target after the Rev Jamal Bryant, pastor of New Birth Baptist church in Georgia, called for a 40-day “Target Fast” that started at the beginning of the Lenten season.
The company had previously come under fire in 2024 after it reduced its collection of LGBTQ+-themed merchandise for Pride month, in response to rightwing criticism.
Target reported a 21% drop in net income in second quarter of this year. Sales were down slightly and the company reported a 1.9% dip in comparable sales – those from established physical stores and online channels. The company has seen flat or declining comparable sales in eight out of the past 10 quarters including the latest period.",650bcb54133c3dab520da367ce47290b,trafilatura

Where to Invest When Nothing Looks Cheap examined the pockets of investing where investors might find reasonably priced investments.
“‘Markets are expensive,’ says Charles Shriver, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price and co-chair of the firm’s Asset Allocation Committee. ‘We have more modest return expectations looking over the next 12 months,’” Morningstar contributor Sarah Hansen wrote.
I couldn’t agree more with the above quote.
I’ve held a significant amount of cash over the past few weeks, waiting for the steep price American consumers and companies will pay as a result of the White House’s implementation of global tariffs to reveal themselves.
That’s yet to happen, but the day of reckoning will soon be upon us. Expect the economic numbers to get worse in Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. But I digress.
Morningstar’s article pointed to four areas of relative opportunity in the markets: value stocks, international stocks, small-cap stocks, and high-yield bonds. Three of the four are part of the Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF’s (AVDV) investment strategy.
The ETF just hit its 47th new 52-week high of the past 12 months. If you’re a passively-active investor, you might want to consider allocating some of your portfolio to AVDV for the next 3-5 years. Here’s why I feel this way.
Before I get into the positives of investing in this particular ETF, let’s consider the basics of AVDV.
Avantis launched the ETF in September 2019. It has $11.45 billion in total assets invested across 1413 holdings. Its annualized total return since inception through July 31 is 11.62%. The ETF’s benchmark, the MSCI World ex USA Small Cap Index, has a five-year annualized total return of 9.50% over the past five years through July 31.
While it’s not quite the same comparison period, it’s pretty close. Over 200 basis points higher than its benchmark, it’s easy to see why it continues to hit new 52-week highs.
Here’s what the ETF’s summary prospectus has to say about its investment strategy:
“The fund seeks to achieve higher expected returns by selecting securities of companies with higher profitability and value characteristics, as well as smaller market capitalizations relative to others within the fund's small cap investment universe.
“To identify the desired market capitalization companies with higher profitability and value characteristics, the portfolio managers use reported and/or estimated company financials and market data including, but not limited to, shares outstanding, book value and its components, cash flows from operations, and accruals.”
From its summary prospectus, in addition to what you can observe from the above quote, the ETF won’t invest in a stock that has a market cap higher than the highest market cap in the benchmark. As of Sept. 24, 2024, it was $10.2 billion.
As a result, AVDV’s average market cap is $1.96 billion, about one-quarter the size of the foreign small/mid value category average of $8.30 billion. You’re going to find micro-cap stocks among the 1413 holdings.
Most importantly, the fund charges 0.36%, a very reasonable fee for an actively managed international ETF.
Now let’s get into the fund’s holdings.
Some ETFs claim to be diversified, but their top 10 holdings account for over 50% of the net assets. AVDV is not such a beast. Its top 10 accounts for just 8% of the ETF’s total assets.
Here’s a blurb about its weighting methodology from the summary prospectus:
“To determine the weight of a security within the portfolio, the portfolio managers use the market capitalization of the security relative to that of other eligible securities as a baseline, then overweight or underweight the security based on the characteristics described above [valuation and profitability metrics mentioned in summary prospectus and from earlier quote].”
Essentially, they add together the market caps of all 1413 stocks and then divide each market cap by the total to get an initial weighting. The portfolio managers then overweight or underweight each stock.
So, for example, if there were 100 stocks in an ETF’s portfolio with a total value of $200 billion, and one stock had a market cap of $4 billion, the initial weighting would be 2% [$4 billion divided by $200 billion]. The portfolio managers would then decide whether to make the final weighting higher or lower than 2%.
That’s an illustrative example. In the case of AVDV, there are 1413 stocks; the weightings are all much smaller. For example, the top holding, Marks & Spencer Group (MAKSY), whose primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange, has a market cap of 7.28 billion British pounds ($9.81 billion). That’s at the high end of the inclusion eligibility.
Given the large number of holdings, the key to delivering above-average investor returns lies more with the sector and country weightings than with individual stocks.
AVDV’s top three countries by weight are Japan (32%), the UK (12%), and Canada (10%). The top 10 countries account for 86% of the total assets, with 14% invested in 41 other countries.
As for sectors, the top three are industrials (24%), materials (19%), and financials (18%). Technology is down at 4%. This weighting allocation is not uncommon for international small-cap funds. So, if you're looking for a significant tech contribution, AVDV probably isn’t for you.
While AVDV is up 24% in the past year, its five-year return is just less than 78%, about 10 percentage points less than the S&P 500. Reversion to the mean suggests that the ETF could close the gap in the next five years.
I just returned from a two-week trip in Ireland and Spain. Of the top 10 holdings, I engaged with two of them -- I went to Marks & Spencer in Belfast and saw Iveco Group (IVCGF) trucks everywhere I went in Spain -- so you will know a number of the names in the portfolio. However, with 44% of the total assets invested in Asia Pacific and 42% in Europe, American investors won’t know most of the holdings unless they spend a lot of time in either region.
Don’t let that dissuade you. AVDV is the best deal going at the moment.

Diplomatic talks over the war in Ukraine continue to make headway. President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon, and European leaders are discussing a plan to send British and French troops to Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.

On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.
In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil.

Here the new problem with the U . S . economy , she says","Meredith Whitney famously called the 2008 financial crisis . Here the new problem with the U . S . economy , she says",2025-08-21 22:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Nearly two decades ago, financial analyst Meredith Whitney was labeled the “Oracle of Wall Street” for her bearish views on banks ahead of the global financial crisis.
Featured in “The Big Short” book on that crisis, author Michael Lewis likened her to E.F. Hutton at the time — she talked, people listened — though she got no mention in the movie by the same name.
The CEO and founder of the Meredith Whitney Advisory Group has been spotting trouble on the horizon again, saying the U.S. faces a “bifurcated economy” driven by the high-end consumer.
In a Tuesday interview with MarketWatch, Whitney stood by a prediction she made earlier this year, that over 50% of U.S. households – many living paycheck to paycheck – faced a second recession of losing jobs, after one in 2022-2023 when stimulus checks ended.
“To me, the weakest portion of the U.S. economy, which employs over 20% of U.S. workers, is hospitality and leisure,” she said. Those jobs generally pay under $60,000 and may see the biggest hits when employment numbers start to worsen and tariffs start to weigh, she added.
“I think employment is going to be a really big pickle,” Whitney said, adding that stagflation — rising jobless numbers and sticky inflation — is a “real possibility.” That’s as college graduates are having an incredibly difficult time in getting first jobs, just as student debt payments resume, which she notes is straining multiple generations.
Whitney turned bullish on dollar stores like Dollar General DG and Dollar Tree DLTR late last year, “thinking the worst was over,” but moved away from that view in May. “I think the dollar stores are going to be challenged -– we’ll see in a couple of weeks when they report -– because their customer base will be the most economically challenged,” she said.
She now prefers “higher-end retailers” like Home Depot HD, Lowe’s LOW and Walmart WMT. Those companies “don’t scream ‘high end,’ but we argue that the fact that more of their customers are homeowners, and homeowners and the high end are the only households with a financial safety net, is significant,” Whitney told clients in a separate note.
Whether or not consumers continue to spend comes down to home ownership, according to Whitney, who said homeowners increasingly began to tap into their home equity a little over a year ago, reversing a 17-year cycle of declining equity-home loans.
“So from a peak of around $700 billion, that went down closer to $250 billion to $240 billion and that’s now increasing. And home equity is actually the fastest growing loan category of any consumer-loan product,” with credit cards, student and auto loans flat, she said.
She’s bullish on companies in that space of home equity, personal loans and cash-out refinances. Those include Rocket RKT, SoFi Technologies SOFI and Affirm Holdings AFRM — those stocks have doubled or more this year.
Whitney believes the housing market itself is headed for its worst market in decades — in terms of activity — backing up a prediction she made a month ago. “Existing-home sales are tracking under 4 million on an annualized basis and that’s the worst in over 25 years. Buyers are looking for steep discounts and sellers are not willing to make those discounts,” she said.
The trouble is that an estimated 60% of homes are owned by those over 55, who aren’t selling, partly as lower-cost downsizing options are limited, she said. “So either these folks have no mortgage or a small mortgage and the capital gains that they have to take and the costs that are required to move are prohibitive,” she said, adding that boomers may not be as wealthy as many think.
Stuck with limited alternatives, they are tapping tapping into equity in their homes, accounting for 41% of total home equity debt, she said..
That, of course is counterintuitive because individuals tend to get more conservative with money as they age, but are now struggling with increasing costs of owning a home – property insurance has risen well north of 60% over the past five years, she noted.
“Given the fact that 60% of homes are owned by seniors, that is the clear issue with affordable housing, because there’s just an inventory lock,” said Whitney.
U.S. stocks SPX DJIA COMP have opened mixed following Tuesday’s losses driven by big technology names. Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y are inching up and oil CL00 is also positive.
Need to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but to get it delivered once to your email box. The emailed version will be sent out at about 7:30 a.m. Eastern.
The buzz
Target TGT named a new CEO as it beat earnings expectations in the second quarter.
Lowe’s LOW hiked its full-year guidance and said it was buying Foundation Building Materials for $8.8 billion.
Minutes of the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting are due at 2 p.m., with an appearance by Fed. Gov. Christopher Waller at 11 a.m. ahead of that. Later, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak.
Tuesday was notable in other ways, such as a burst of energy for value plays, while momentum stocks sagged, as the chart shows. That “smells a lot like the clean-out in the AI trade we saw last January, when the release of DeepSeek drove a temporary market panic over the outlook in the space,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.

It's probably as close to free money as you'll get. The only thing you need to do to earn dividends is own the stock that pays them.
But sometimes people get the wrong idea -- that dividend stocks are ultra-conservative investments, suitable for retirees or those only looking for passive income. Nope, dividend-paying companies can also deliver price appreciation, especially companies that continually increase their dividends.
Fortunately, you don't need to find these stocks yourself. Instead, consider an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(NYSEMKT: VIG), which currently yields over 1.6% and has delivered total annualized returns of 12% for the past decade.
But is the ETF a buy right now, at a time when the broader stock market is at all-time highs? Here is what you need to know.
Breaking down precisely what is in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF
An ETF is simply a bucket of individual stocks trading under one ticker symbol. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF comprises 337 stocks, so when you own a share, you're becoming a part owner in hundreds of individual companies. The primary benefit of an ETF such as this one is that you're instantly diversified, so you're not putting too many eggs in too few baskets.
The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is incredibly well-rounded, both by market sector and the companies within it. For instance, five sectors have double-digit representation in the ETF:
Source: Vanguard; chart by author.
Some of the world's largest companies are technology and financial businesses, and happen to pay and raise dividends, so it makes sense that these sectors would carry a higher representation than others. To add some color to this, here are the ETF's top 10 individual holdings:
Source: Vanguard; chart by author.
This top 10 represents a combined 33% of the fund, so they undoubtedly move the needle, but not so much that they alone can collapse the ETF if something happens to one of them. Among this list are top-notch stocks in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, weight-loss drugs, and e-commerce. These dividend stocks are anything but boring.
A well-rounded composition may benefit the ETF if the ""Magnificent Seven"" stumbles
The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is a bit more well-rounded than the S&P 500 index, which carries hefty exposure to the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks.
According to research by The Motley Fool, these stocks currently represent 34% of the index, up from just 12.3% a decade ago. As excited as investors are about AI and how it could affect the world over the coming decade and beyond, the increasingly higher weighting in the broader stock market creates concentration risks that investors shouldn't ignore.
Unfortunately, it's hard to get around this heavy representation, because these companies are going to show up in many market indexes and investment funds due to their massive multitrillion-dollar valuations.
However, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF includes only two Magnificent Seven stocks, Microsoft and Apple. In other words, the ETF is a great way to diversify your portfolio since you probably already have plenty of exposure to the Magnificent Seven companies, either directly or through other funds.
Should you invest in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF now?
The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF primarily contains large-cap companies, so it's unlikely the ETF would be a bargain while the broader market is doing so well.
But that doesn't mean it's not a buy. The ETF's blended five-year annualized earnings growth rate is 12.8%, and it trades at a blended price-to-earnings ratio of 25.1. Using the price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) to weigh the ETF's valuation against its earnings growth, the current ratio, about 2.0, is reasonable enough for long-term investors here, assuming the companies within the ETF continue to sustain that growth.
The value isn't compelling, so I probably wouldn't want to chase the ETF much higher from these prices. Still, it's never a bad idea to buy quality companies at reasonable prices, and these dividend-raising blue chip companies certainly earn that quality distinction. Consider nibbling on the ETF here, while saving some cash in case broader market volatility creates some better buying opportunities in the future.
Should you buy stock in Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF right now?

Lu Gong: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Throughout the second quarter and the summer season, we delivered a diverse lineup of content, the current leadership in total drama viewership market share according to Enlightened. Our robust offerings were highlighted by three original blockbuster dramas that generated IG popularity index scores of over 10,000, namely Field, Bingjianxian, Coroner's Theory, Caoxilu, and the Thriving Land, Shiwanwu. Among them, Field and the Coroner's Diary resonated especially well with female viewers, while the Thriving Land captured the hearts of audiences of all ages and genders. These blockbusters further solidified our dominance in both the female and realistic genres. The performance of our variety shows was equally impressive.
In the summer season, iQIYI accounted for four of the top five spots in our Enlightened total viewership list. The highly anticipated return of our flagship IP, The King of Stand Up Comedy Season two, and the season and the wrap of China 2025, Xinhua Chang, generated impressive viewership with The King of Stand Up Comedy Season two commanding the industry's highest viewership market share in its category in the summer. The strong performance of our premium content drove our key operating metrics in the summer, reflecting our commitment to delivering high-quality, diverse stories while continuing the user experience across our platform.
Building on the strong momentum of our content ecosystem, we are proactively exploring new opportunities to foster sustainable long-term value creation and achieve meaningful progress in our experience business and overseas business. Let me begin with our experience business. We are focusing on two key areas: IP-based consumer products and offline experiences. We are leveraging our extensive and unique IP collection to enhance our competitive edge and tap into the booming IP merchandising market. In the first half of the year, our self-operated live table trading cards achieved over RMB100 million in GMV with popular IPs such as lobbying prevailing, Huai Ruuding field setting new sales records.
We will also bring our IPs to offline experiences like IT land and immersive centers following an asset-light strategy. Currently, two IT labs in Yongzhou and Kaibong are in development, while over 50 immersive shelters are already operating in around 30 cities nationwide. Our business outside Mainland China continues to show strong growth momentum. In the second quarter, both subscriber base and revenue from the membership services reached record highs. We have now established four major operating regions: Southeast Asia, North America, Japan and Korea, and The Middle East and North Africa. We have meaningfully enhanced our brand influence and expanded our global recognition by combining premium C-pop content with targeted localized operations, unlocking exciting opportunities for further growth.
Now let's dive into the details of our business performance in Q2, starting with content, which serves as a foundation of our business. We maintained our leadership of the core long-form drama category, securing the top spot in total viewership market share for four consecutive quarters according to Enlightened data. Our performance in the second quarter was driven by our diverse content offering highlighted by an enhanced lineup of female-oriented dramas. Notably, Field achieved an IT popularity index score of over 10,000, topping the Enlightened list. Our original series Demon Hunter's Romance, Wiltu, is an in-house production that achieved a peak IGA popularity index score of over 9,800 thanks to its perfect blend of traditional Chinese tales and arts.
Other standout titles include Dream with a Dream, Wishing a Dream, Shuju and Yemeng, and the lobbying pavilion from our Roma theme heartbeat shelter, Ganjingqiu Chang, which scored over 9,600 and 8,900 for popularity index respectively. We also broadened our appeal with multiple suspense and realistic scenarios including The Secret Path, Jamie Zhao Leong, and two dramas from our suspense shelter, Breaking the Shadow, and Life for Life. The Secret Path and Breaking the Shadow were especially well received by large screen viewers, ranking among the top five most-watched titles on TVs. Our premium content has won high recognition from the industry.
In the latest Magnolia Award, one of the most prestigious honors of Chinese dramas, 13 titles produced by or broadcasted on iQIYI received an impressive total of 29 nominations with four titles winning a combined eight awards. Notably, our original drama To the Wonder With Other Time from our microcosm shelter, Mission Yucha, received the highest honor, the Best TV Series Award, along with the International Communication Award and Best Cinematography Award. Additionally, City of the City, Chengdu Cheong, won the special award and We Are Criminal Police, Xinjiang, received both the Grand Prix and the Best Original Screenplay Award. Moving on to micro dramas, a valuable complement to our content ecosystem.
More people are tuning into iQIYI to watch micro dramas. In the second quarter, gross average daily viewing time and unique visitors have shown double-digit sequential growth. Our library boasts a diverse collection of about 15,000 titles forming a strong portfolio of micro dramas. Since the second quarter, we have shifted our strategy focus on consistently delivering premium micro dramas through original production and licensing, aiming to drive user growth and accelerate revenue expansion. Our internal data indicates that premium micro dramas can consistently outperform across key metrics, including subscriber conversion, viewing time, user engagement, and retention. Developing premium content is our core strength.
Built upon years of experience in producing long-term video blockbusters, our expertise in content production and advanced technology can be seen as applied to premium micro dramas. Additionally, our extensive IP collection provides us with a unique resource for success in IP adaptation. In Q2, we made great strides with original micro dramas and launched multiple titles that performed exceptionally well with audiences, including In Is Capable, A Scrouching Love, How Dare You, Chong Le Kitong, and For My Dearest Xiaocheng Zhu.
Notably, How Dare You, our first IP-adapted micro drama, hit a new milestone by reaching a peak iQIYI popularity index score of 5,500, a historical high for our platform, and even outperformed the licensed hit My Sweet Home in both average daily unique visitors and revenue from new subscriptions in the first week of release. Its success extended beyond numbers, broadening the typical micro drama audience and attracting a younger and more diverse demographic. It's a great example of how we are successfully developing IP across multiple formats. The strong reception of this micro drama drove reservations for the long-form generation and the second season of the animation based on the same IP.
It also increased rewatch of the animation's first season, showing the power of strategic IP development to drive engagement across formats. Turning to movies, we have dominated this category in viewership market share for fourteen consecutive quarters according to Enlightened data. In the second quarter, we launched over 10 major titles catering to a diverse range of audiences with a variety of genres, including crime, female realistic, martial arts, comedy, and action. Standout titles included the licensed movie Detective Chinatown 1900 and the original movie The Only Way in Chinese New. We have been actively innovating our movie business model to drive long-term industry growth.
This quarter, we were the first in the industry to use the revenue-sharing model typically seen with online films for newly released theatrical movies. This approach includes revenue potential for titles with limited box office performance. A great example is our pilot project Trapped Daften Shop, which generated over RMB28 million in revenue-sharing income on our platform, the highest for any movie title this year. Remarkably, this amount even surpassed its box office revenue share, showcasing the potential of this model to amplify returns. For variety shows, our focus on delivering top titles has yielded great results.
According to Enlightened data, iQIYI released five S-plus rated variety shows in the first half of the year, the highest among all long-form video platforms, with four of them being original productions. Our flagship IP, Five Plus Season five, made a strong comeback with a record-high IT popularity score, surpassing member revenue expansion and its current status as a nationally renowned IP. Additionally, the competition formats in the latest season of the wrap of China 2025 strongly connected with the audience, driving the popularity index score to over 9,500 and setting a new record for the show. For animations, we continue to improve our original production capabilities.
Revenue from Over the Divide Reals, Shenguochesha, has consistently ranked as our top-performing Chinese animation during the same period on our platform. Moving on to our content strategy and pipeline. For long-form dramas, we focus on crafting top-notch premium stories that balance high commercial value with innovation and artistic excellence. At the same time, we are committed to delivering a steady, diverse slate of content that resonates with our broad audience to elevate engagement. We are also reducing episode counts for a tighter, more compelling viewer experience. For the summer season, we introduced female-oriented key titles such as Corona's Diary and The Wanted Detective Improvoke.
Among them, Corona's Story stood out as another in-house produced original that delivered exceptional performance, surpassing the IT Popularity Index score of 10,000. Its attractive growth generated a strong word-of-mouth buzz, further cementing its success. In addition, we also prepared a variety of new titles and our drama shelter brands, notably the Thriving Land, a realistic theme drama from our masterpiece shelter, Zaja Quchang, which exceeded our IGA popularity index score of 10,000 within just four days of its release, driven by its compelling storyline that resonated with a broad audience. Its popularity also extended beyond our platform, topping both the industry's Enlightened data and traditional TV station charts.
Other highlights from our suspense filter include Justifiable Defense and That App Shuyunbigu. In our upcoming fourth quarter, we are excited about our lineup of anticipated titles, including 8,000 Miles of Clouds and More, Legend of the Magnet, Born with Luck, Fox's Spirits, Matchmaker, Swallow and Beloved, A Strange Tale of Tang Dynasty, and Speed and Last Runway. For micro dramas, we are focused on premium titles. We released two to three premium titles each week during the summer season, including Sorbet of the Ruoxigua, Moment of Romance, The Wars, Revenge, Story of Zhao Yue, Zhao Yue Fei, and others. Shifting to movies, we are aiming to build a vibrant ecosystem for original production with three key projects.
First, our blockbuster project, where we team up with top filmmakers to deliver standout theatrical hits. Second, the Sleeper Hit Projects for Tianjinhua, where we partnered with rising directors to create bold, so article films that blend commercial appeal with fresh ideas. And third, the emerging film projects, is an innovative collaborative approach for original online movies and a minimum guarantee and a revenue-sharing model designed to spark creativity. Looking ahead, our original production pipeline features several titles for theatrical release, including crime, action movie, The Shadow's Edge, action comedy, Enough is Enough Get Now Measure, The Shadow's Edge and Buffon Zhui, and The Skin Pinot.
Notably, The Shadow's Edge, Buffon Zhui recently premiered in shelters, achieving an impressive initial box office of over RMB300 million within just five days. For online original productions, we launched Ultimate Mission and Never a Safe QiDong with upcoming titles such as Heroes of War Cable, Replacement, Wiguo, Wings of Dread, WeiQi, Wanmi, Weiqi, and others. Additionally, we have enriched our lineup by bringing licensed theatrical movies to our platform as the second window, such as Mega Heat Neutra two and highly anticipated upcoming titles like Amalice, She's Got No Name, Jiangyuanong, and Li Qingro, Chang Li Zhi.
Notably, Ne Zhi too has extended its success from to the online domain, becoming the first movie to exceed our popularity index score of 10,000 on our platform. For variety shows, we are committed to delivering top-tier content, enhancing the value of our multiple-season IPs. In the summer season, our eagerly awaited show, The Drag of China 2025, and the team of Santa Comedy Season two made a strong return. In addition, our new observation-related show, Her Prime, Zhejiang Jia, resonated positively with audiences entering the fourth quarter.
We are thrilled to bring forth new seasons of our acclaimed IP, such as the Blooming Journey Season two, Yoruba Park, and High Young Summer Season, along with the company of 18 new IP from Get Together. For animations, we are committed to elevating our original projects. Key original animations launched during summer include Over the Divine Realms, Shengbo Zishan, Embers, Yujin, Xingzhou, Demons Accession, Mo Yinji. Our highly acclaimed original production Love Between Fairy and Devil, Challenge, has returned with a second season in July and received positive feedback.
For children's content, we are dedicated to turning beloved IP into a fully immersive ecosystem, delivering experiences that grow with families and offer something special for every stage of the parent-child journey. For the second half of the year, we will launch a number of key original productions, including a new season of our classical IP Girl Squad Season four and a brand new IP, Carmen and Birds for the track. Moving on to membership services, we are focused on building a membership experience that connects with our broad audience, powered by a vibrant content ecosystem and the best-in-class services. By constantly enhancing the ads and variety of what we offer, we are delivering even more value to our members.
One notable highlight is our family-oriented ice diamond plan, which integrates an Express package that grants early access to show finals as part of its exclusive privilege. This approach has proven to be a key catalyst in driving new subscriptions and upgrades to the premium channel. In Q4, 78% of new Star Diamond subscription revenues come from upgrades. Additionally, our ad-supported basic membership plan provided an attractive option for price-sensitive viewers to further enhance the member experience. We have launched over 10 bundled membership plans to foster a stronger connection within the member community and support revenue growth. Looking ahead, we are focused on expanding these bundled membership initiatives to reach even more audiences.
We also made meaningful strides in improving perceived membership value. A highlight of the quarter is our country's experience programs. This program enables content lovers, brand advertisers, and more to get virtual seats, essentially granting membership access for binge-watching content. This feature has driven higher engagement and amplified the popularity of key titles on our platform. So far in 2025, seed purchases have already tripled the total from 2024, with show lovers accounting for the majority. Beyond that, we made membership even more rewarding this quarter by allowing members to gift the express package to friends and launching a dedicated channel for members to redeem points for projects.
On top of that, we hosted 12 VIP-only events, including fun meetups, advanced screenings, and live variety show recordings. Moving on to the advertising business. In the second quarter, brand ads benefited from enhanced premium variety shows offering and seasonality. Our flagship content continued to be highly attractive to advertisers during the first half of the year. Our premium market shows led the industry in both the total and average number of advertisers attracted in Q2. Other revenue from key advertisers delivered double-digit growth annually and sequentially. Notably, several key industries are showing positive recovery trends, with food and beverage and communication services achieving double-digit annual and sequential growth in Q2.
Looking ahead, we will sharpen our focus on maximizing ad sales from premium variety shows, dramas, and our drama sales rep brands. We see exciting potential in multiple-season variety shows. For example, ad revenue from the King of Thunder, our comedy season two, doubled compared to its first season. Additionally, we are capitalizing on new budgets for micro and short dramas, micro shows, and customized programs. Early sales of micro shows are encouraging, opening new marketing opportunities. We have also introduced product placements within micro dramas and are preparing to launch dedicated ad products for our micro drama shelter. Additionally, we are boosting monetization on smart TVs and expanding ad inventory with innovative formats.
For performance ads, strengthening relationships with existing clients while capturing budgets from high-growth sectors is our focus. In Internet services, we expanded our advertiser base by bringing in new partners for e-commerce. We utilized programmatic advertising to maximize opportunities during the June 18 shopping festival. In the education sector, we expanded our advertiser base to include wellness management services and other industries, driving year-over-year doubling in revenue. Moving forward, we will harness AI to optimize both advertising materials and placement strategies, unlocking even greater budget opportunities. In fact, AI-powered video ads saw a 20% increase in click-through rates compared to those created without AI.
Moving on to technology and products, we are committed to harnessing AI to transform entertainment experiences, amplifying content value, and enhancing user engagement. In the second quarter, we introduced the industry's first AI-powered iJump Talkout feature, redefining viewer engagement with long-form video by offering faster-paced micro drama-like experiences. With a simple swipe up or down on a mobile phone, users can effortlessly skip between key plots without missing any captivating moments. This feature is now available for over 2,300 dramas and variety shows on our main iQIYI mobile app and has quickly become a popular feature for binge-watching and rewatching favorite shows, clearly boosting user engagement.
Another pioneering example is Touhou World, launched in early 2024 as an industry-first AI agent-based NPC data platform, realizing our vision of AI-powered human-machine interaction. Featuring over 102,000 NPC agents from our most popular content, it engaged fans 24/7 in new and exciting ways. As I know, it's total an AI agent acting as a personal assistant offering support like video search, recommendation, and cloud insights. These innovations are transforming fan engagement and creating new value for our content. Beyond that, we harness AI to upgrade content production. A good example is our application of AI to streamline digital asset production.
On the set of The Great Nobody two, Dao Wanbei Huang Zhao, AI boosted the efficiency of digital asset generation by over 10 fold, cutting costs and shortening production time. For the pre-production for romance dramas, we achieved a breakthrough in qualitative script analysis, now supporting in-depth evaluation of the leading characters, dramatic relationships, and interactions. In addition to that, AI also helps in identifying unneeded plans. Moving on to our business performance in reaching outside of Mainland China. Overseas business continues its strong growth momentum with membership revenue and membership scale expanding for eight consecutive quarters.
In Q2, membership revenue grew by around 35% annually, driven by standout performances in markets like Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and the five Spanish-speaking regions, all reporting annual growth over 80%. Average daily subscribers reached an all-time high during the quarter. The outstanding performance is anchored in our exceptional content lineup, especially as C-drama popularity continues to grow globally. The original C-drama Field topped popularity charts in 15 overseas markets on premiere day. The winner Nimis doubled version of our dream, missing our dream set a new record for the highest daily revenue in its language segment on release day.
Corona's Diary achieved the highest popularity ranking in 13 overseas markets and led Google Trends in five markets within its first week, expanding its domestic success internationally. On top of the long-form video, we have been expanding our offering by introducing micro dramas overseas since March and have gained strong momentum. Membership revenue attributed to micro dramas surged month by month during the second quarter. By June, micro dramas ranked as the second largest category attracting new subscriptions in Indonesia, Korea, and Brazil. Our original micro drama In Is Capable Squelching Love gathered widespread international acclaim, expanding the reach and influence of our micro dramas beyond the domestic market.
Building on the initial success, we plan to ramp up original micro drama production overseas in the second half of the year. Expanding beyond content, we continue to amplify the global influence of C-pop through offline marketing events such as fan meetings and media conferences that spotlight Chinese celebrities. In the second quarter alone, we hosted three events that drew widespread engagement from users, media partners, and advertisers. Looking ahead, we are gearing up to scale these events internationally, further driving the reach of Chinese content globally. In summary, we are committed to building a beloved national brand and strengthening our market leadership with exceptional user experiences and a wide brand company ecosystem.
At the same time, we are focusing on innovation and investing in key growth areas such as AI applications, micro dramas, experience business, and global expansion, all with the goal of driving sustainable long-term success.
Jun Wang: Thanks, Mr. Gong, and hello, everyone. Let me walk you through the key numbers for the second quarter. In the second quarter, the total revenues were RMB6.6 billion. The membership services revenue reached RMB4.1 billion, down 9% annually, primarily due to our lighter content slate compared to the same period last year. The online advertising revenue was $300 million, decreased by 13% annually. During the quarter, some advertisers adjusted their advertising and promotion strategies in response to macro pressures. The accounts and distribution revenue reached RMB436.6 million, down 37% annually, primarily due to the decrease in other transactions. Other revenues increased by 6% annually to RMB829.3 million. Moving on to costs and expenses.
We have maintained a disciplined cost and expense management. The accounting cost was RMB3.8 billion, representing a saving of 8% annually, primarily due to a lighter accounted slate in the quarter. And the total operating expenses were RMB1.4 billion, representing a saving of 3% annually. Turning to profits and cash flows. The non-GAAP operating income was RMB58.7 million. The non-GAAP operating income margin was 1%. As of the end of the second quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and long-term restricted cash included in prepayment and other assets, totaling RMB5.1 billion. In addition, the company had a loan of US$522.5 million to PAG recorded under amount due from rogue parties.
We continue to improve our capital structure. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total principal amount of US$85 million of the 2028 notes for cash, and the outstanding principal balance remaining for the 2028 notes is $208 million as of the end of the second quarter. As we continue to optimize our debt structure, our net interest expense decreased by 33% compared to the same period last year. For detailed financial data, please refer to our press release on our IR website. Now we will open the floor for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. Your first question comes from Maggie Yeh with CLSA.
Maggie Yeh: Regarding the recent change of policy in China's long-form video industry, could management share with us your thoughts on the potential impact to the company? Thank you.
Operator: I'll invite our Chief Content Officer, Xiaobui Wang, to take this question. The introduction of the new policies represents a significant positive development for the overall long-form video industry, which we and the entire industry welcome and fully support. These policies bring benefits across multiple aspects. First, the time cycle from content production and review to broadcast can be effectively shortened, allowing content to reach audiences more quickly. This not only improves scheduling stability but also ensures that the content aligns more closely with current social sentiment and resonates with the audience. Additionally, it also enhances the efficiency of the company's capital utilization. Second, these policies enhance the flexibility of content creation, providing creators with greater creative freedom.
This, in turn, can significantly boost the content appeal and promote greater content diversity. Third, the policies could strengthen the synergy between online video platforms and traditional TV networks. More content can benefit from simultaneous online and linear TV broadcasting, expanding distribution channels for quality production, stabilizing content distribution prices, and enhancing the reach and influence of content. This is beneficial for both online video platforms and traditional broadcasters. Last but not least, after the release of these new policies, it is sending a strong signal, and that signal can attract more talent and capital into the content production, driving the healthy and vigorous development of the entire industry. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Zhiking Zhang with CICC.
Zhiking Zhang: Thanks, management, for taking my question. You mentioned a great number of hit dramas and variety shows during the summer seasons in your prepared remarks. We have also noticed that recently, Austin Stone has achieved the ICT popularity index of over 10% and received excellent reviews. Could the management provide an overview of the content performance this summer? Additionally, considering the impact of the new regulations, what's your future content strategy? Thank you.
Operator: The CEO is taking the first part of the question. He is commenting on the new policies. After the release of the policies, I think from the company standpoint, we will promote innovation in different aspects of content production. For example, seasoned multi-season content and also different formats of innovative dramas can be produced in the future. And then next, we'll invite our Chief Content Officer, Xiaobui Wang, to take the rest. During this year's summer season from June to August, we delivered outstanding performances across drama, variety shows, film, and micro dramas. Three of our original drama blockbusters, namely Field, Coroner's Diary, and Describing Lines, all achieved ITE popularity index scores of over 10,000.
For micro drama, How Dare You hit a new milestone for ITE Popularity Index score. And for variety shows, returning flagship titles such as The King of Stand Up Comedy Season two and The Wrap of China 2025 led the market. Last but not least, on the film front, the theatrical release, The Shadow's Edge recently surpassed RMB300 million in box office revenue, and the third-party market forecast predicted total box office revenues to exceed RMB1 billion. All of these once again demonstrate the audience's strong affection for premium content that further demonstrated our strength in producing popular tier content.
In the future, benefiting from the new policies for the industry, we aim to strengthen our content strategies across different categories. For the long-form dramas, we will continue to focus on premium productions with high commercial value. And like CEO Lu Gong mentioned earlier, not only will we focus on innovations for long-form video dramas, but we will also improve our innovations for short dramas as well. For long-form video dramas, we will leverage our five major drama theaters to comprehensively cover key content genres such as suspense, romance, realistic, and comedy. For the production side, we'll focus on creating innovative contemporary storylines with tighter pacing and greater viewer appeal.
In terms of content promotion, we'll place a stronger emphasis on creativity, buzzworthiness, and emotional resonance, adopting strategies that better engage younger audiences. For micro drama, our approach for premium quality production is expected to attract more users who previously did not watch micro dramas to the content genre. We'll continue to apply our long-form drama development expertise, expand collaborations with top creators, and produce more flagship titles while exploring serialized formats. On the monetization side, beyond our existing membership and free models, we will actively explore opportunities such as content distribution, branded content integration, and IT merchandising development. Beyond dramas, we're also striving for breakthroughs across different other categories.
For variety shows, our focus remains on the flagship multi-season IPs, while continuing to explore innovative content formats. For films, we're working on a comprehensive framework to strengthen our original film projects through our three strategic initiatives, namely blockbuster project, Sleeper hit project, and an immersion film project. These efforts will expand our market share in online video online movie streaming, enhancing our influence in theatrical releases, and strengthen synergies between IT's online and offline platforms. For animation and children's content, we will continue to improve our original production capabilities, focusing on high-quality domestic animations while enhancing the monetization of children's content. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jijie Zhu with
Jijie Zhu: I will translate the question myself. This year, we have seen that iQIYI is preparing for the offline theme park, at the same time selling related iQIYI products during the broadcasting of some top key dramas. Could you share about these strategies in the future? And how do you think of this market size? Thank you.
Operator: Our CEO, Lu Gong, is taking this question. So for IT's experience business, we have two key areas: IP-based consumer products and offline experiences. For IT consumer products, in the past, we fully operated in IT licensing, but the percentage of GMV is relatively low in the whole market. So starting this year, we're now transitioning to a self-operation, building a consumer product system that includes planning and design, manufacturing, and sales. Right now, we're starting to test the waters starting from the collectible cards. And then also we're testing the waters for different sales channels. So we will expand that effort in the future. For the offline experiences, overall, we take an asset-light approach to this strategy.
It mainly has two parts: the immersive theaters, which now is a licensed model that we operate with different stores, now has over 30 cities, have more than 50 stores. For IT land, we also take the asset-light approach and we support in terms of content management and technology. In addition to the games and experiences based on our IPs, we also have the derivative products, the IT consumer goods that we'll be selling in the stores. Collectively, it will create synergy for our overall experience business. Right now, we have the Yangzhou and Otto, Taifeng locations are in development. By the end of this year, we will probably have more locations to be announced. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thomas Chong with Jefferies.
Thomas Chong: Good evening, management. My question is about our debt management plan. Can management share more color about this? Thank you.
Operator: Thanks. Our CFO, Jun Wang, is taking this question. As you probably noticed, for our debt, we have two parts: overseas U.S. Dollars and domestic RMB. As of the end of the second quarter, you will notice that the outstanding balance for the 2028 convertible notes is only $208 million. Currently, the company has sufficient cash to meet the debt obligation if the CP holders decide to provide to us. In terms of the domestic debt denominated in RMB, you probably noticed in the past few quarters, the long-term loan versus short-term loan has significantly improved. Currently, the portion is like fifty-fifty in terms of our outstanding loans as a whole.
Overall speaking, the capital structure now is pretty healthy enough to support our daily operations and also the long-term development and growth in the future. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Ms. Yu for closing remarks.
Lu Gong: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. See you next quarter. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you.
Jun Wang: Thank you.
Operator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

In its latest report, Citron Research said PLTR will remain “overvalued” even if it crashed to just $40 per share. Adding fuel to its share price decline was Sam Altman’s comment that the AI market is in a bubble right now.

Michael Burry is Betting Big on This 1 S&P 500 Stock That’s Down 40% in 2025
Palantir stock has tanked sharply from its all-time high of about $190 in recent sessions. At writing, it’s down well over 20% versus that high.
Palantir Stock’s Valuation Can’t Be Justified
Despite recent weakness, PLTR shares’ forward price-earnings (P/E) multiple remains north of 400x – an unsettling valuation even for the highest-risk investors.
And while Palantir sure is growing at an exciting pace, with revenue coming in up 48% on a YoY basis in its latest reported quarter, that P/E ratio, nonetheless, suggests investors expect the growth rate to sustain forever.
In reality, however, the Denver-headquartered firm may be hard-pressed to record a similar growth rate come next year, if for no other reason than the law of large numbers.
Goldman Sachs Warns of Further Downside in PLTR Shares
Investors should also note that Goldman Sachs analysts raised their price target on Palantir shares by more than 50% this week, and yet, they landed on $141 only.
The investment firm’s upwardly revised price objective still indicates potential for another 4% downside in PLTR stock from here, reinforcing just how overvalued it really is at current levels.
Additionally, Palantir’s high relative strength rating and beta of more than 2.5x further substantiates that it’s super vulnerable to sharp corrections when sentiment turns.
Therefore, it would be a smart decision to pick other, more reasonably valued AI stocks over PLTR.
Palantir Is No Longer in Favor With Wall Street Analysts
Wall Street analysts widely agree with the cautious stance on Palantir due to valuation concerns.
The consensus rating on PLTR shares currently sits at “Hold” only with the mean target of about $156 now finally above its current trading price again.",35753956c2070984df0af12057b77fc8,trafilatura

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. In the second quarter, equity markets experienced one of their most turbulent periods in recent history. Small-cap stocks managed a rebound in the quarter, recovering from declines at the beginning of the year.

In its second-quarter 2025 investor letter, the Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund highlighted stocks such as Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MMSI). Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MMSI) is a single-use medical products manufacturer. The one-month return of Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MMSI) was 3.17%, and its shares lost 4.15% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On August 19, 2025, Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MMSI) stock closed at $87.15 per share, with a market capitalization of $5.161 billion.
Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund stated the following regarding Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MMSI) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
""Merit Medical Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MMSI) designs, manufactures, and markets single-use medical devices for interventional, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures, primarily in cardiology, radiology, oncology, and endoscopy. The stock lagged due largely to tariff concerns following the Liberation Day announcement, impacting sentiment given its global footprint and exposure to China. While earnings results beat expectations, earnings per share (EPS) guidance was lowered due to increased tariff-related costs. Management expects to mitigate about half of this impact by 2026 through manufacturing and operational initiatives. Despite this near-term margin pressure, we believe nothing has fundamentally changed with the company as it continues to exceed revenue guidance. We remain confident in the company’s long-term outlook.""

As SoFi Launches International Money Transfer Services, How Should You Play SOFI Stock?
Following today’s rally, Gaxos stock is up nearly 75% versus its low set on Aug. 11. Year-to-date, however, the penny stock remains down more than 30% at writing.
Why the Art-Gen Launch Is Meaningful for Gaxos Stock
The Art-Gen announcement is meaningfully positive for GXAI stock because it signals a shift toward scalable, high-margin, recurring revenue.
Integrating top-tier AI models with proprietary enhancements positions Gaxos at the forefront of the booming generative artificial intelligence market.
The platform’s ease of use, premium creative capabilities, and subscription model offer significant monetization potential, while CEO Vadim Mats’ focus on commercial scalability and shareholder value reinforces investor confidence as well.
All in all, with demand for AI-enabled content creation surging, Art-Gen could drive rapid user adoption, revenue growth, and long-term upside, making the launch strategically constructive for Gaxos shares.
The Case Against Buying This Penny Stock at Current Levels
While the launch of Art-Gen sure is bullish for GXAI, investors should remain wary of loading up on it mostly because it’s a penny stock vulnerable to manipulation schemes like “pump and dumps.”
More importantly, Gaxos stock has low liquidity and limited institutional ownership, which may amplify the aforementioned risk.
Another major red flag for serious investors is that GXAI shares do not currently receive coverage from Wall Street analysts as tracked by Barchart. What it means is that it’s devoid of essential scrutiny, earnings forecasts, and valuation benchmarks.
Without analyst coverage, investors lack independent insight into fundamentals, making it harder to assess long-term viability.
The lack of Street coverage also indicates limited institutional interest and raises questions about transparency and governance as well – none of which bodes well for Gaxos stock.

The Haifa-based carrier (NYSE: ZIM) said net income for the three months ended June 30 was $24 million, down from $373 million in the second quarter of 2024, while diluted earnings per share of $.19 fell from $3.08.
Zim’s business model is heavily leveraged toward spot container rates on trans-Pacific routes from Asia to the United States, which have tumbled in the wake of President Donald Trump’s global trade reset.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) totaled $472 million, down 38% y/y. Operating income (EBIT) was $149 million, against $468 million. Adjusted EBIT was $149 million, compared to $488 million in the second quarter of 2024.
Revenues declined 15% to $1.64 billion, off 15% y/y.
“Amid market disruptions and volatility, we continued to leverage our upscaled capacity and improved cost structure in Q2,” said President and Chief executive Eli Glickman, in an earnings release. “In this highly uncertain market environment, our focus is controlling what we can to position Zim for sustainable and profitable growth over the long term.”
Container volume in the second quarter decreased 6% to 895,000 twenty foot equivalent units (TEUs). The average freight rate per TEU trailed year-ago levels by 12% at $1,479.
Glickman said Zim’s modern fleet, averaging 6.5 years per vessel, and agile commercial strategy will enable the company to respond quickly to demand changes across trade lanes.
Zim raised its full-year guidance for adjusted EBITDA between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion, up from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion, and adjusted EBIT between $550 million and $950 million, from $350 million to $950 million.

The discussions are ongoing and the final amount could change, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. Bloomberg News previously reported Anthropic was in advanced discussions to raise up to $5 billion in the round at a $170 billion valuation. The amount increased significantly due to strong investor demand, the people said.

Investment firm Iconiq Capital is leading the round, Bloomberg News has reported. Other expected participants include TPG Inc., Lightspeed Venture Partners, Spark Capital and Menlo Ventures, according to people familiar with the matter. Anthropic has also held discussions with the Qatar Investment Authority and Singapore’s sovereign fund GIC about joining the round.
Anthropic declined to comment.
Anthropic, founded in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, has positioned itself as a reliable, safety-conscious firm that users can trust. The new funding will fuel Anthropic’s competition with OpenAI and Elon Musk’s xAI, each of which has raised billions in capital this year to finance their investments in data centers and talent for building AI models.
The new financing would mark a significant jump in valuation for the company and cement its status as one of the world’s leading AI developers. Anthropic was valued at $61.5 billion in a $3.5 billion round led by Lightspeed earlier this year.

Focusing more closely, the generator maker stock has also outpaced the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 18.7% increase over the past 52 weeks.
Shares of Generac Holdings jumped 19.6% on Jul. 30 after the company posted better-than-expected Q2 2025 results, with adjusted EPS of $1.65 and revenue of $1.06 billion. Strong demand for home standby generators drove a 6.6% rise in residential sales, boosted by shipments to Puerto Rico, while its commercial and industrial segment grew 5.2% year-over-year.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect Generac Holdings’ adjusted EPS to grow 4.4% year-over-year to $7.59. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It topped the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 22 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 13 “Strong Buy” ratings, eight “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.”
On Jul. 30, J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Strouse reiterated a “Hold"" rating on Generac Holdings and set a price target of $165.
As of writing, the stock is trading above the mean price target of $192.35. The Street-high price target of $250 implies a potential upside of 28.1% from the current price levels.

The attack mirrors a string of social engineering attacks over the past year and contributes to an already woeful year in terms of hacks and scams, with crypto investors losing $3.1 billion in the first half of 2025.

The market is now closed. The indexes finished the day well off of their session lows, but the Dow (+0.04%) was the only index in the green. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (-0.24%), Russell 2000 (-0.28%), and Nasdaq (-0.68%) declined. However, all the indexes made strides towards the end of the day.
In the S&P 500, Analog Devices (ADI) held out to be the index's best-performer after reporting earnings. It was joined by McKesson Corp (MCK) and Medtronic (MDT) . Here were the top ten performers of the day:
On the flip side, Intel (INTC) was the worst stock in the index (and in the Nasdaq 100!) It was joined by Target (TGT) and Jacobs Solutions (J) , among others. Here were the top ten losers of the day:
Update: 2:26 p.m. ET
Afternoon Headlines: Sony tariffs, Google's new Pixel, FOMC Minutes
We're heading into the end of the trading day. Here are the there stories to know this afternoon:
Sony is raising the price of the PlayStation 5 in response to tariff uncertainty.
Google's new Pixel series phone is making apparent the one technical advantage it has over competitors like Apple and Samsung: AI and price.
FOMC minutes show that worries about tariff-related inflation had surpassed risks to the labor market, a key ingredient in why most Fed Governors voted to hold rates.
In other swings happening today:
U.S. equities might be down, but gold (+0.91%) is well in the green. In fact, it's just barely off its intraday highs, within earshot of $3,400.
Ethereum (+5.77%) is also on the move after a 10%+ decline; it's one of the few 'retail-flavored trades' that have been holding up in light of AI bubble concerns.
The U.S. 10Y (-0.39%) is down to 4.293% as Fed officials descend on Jackson Hole, WY for the central bank's annual symposium.
Update: 12:15 p.m. ET
Mid-Day Movers: Analog Devices, Target, Regeneron, Intel, Palantir
We've already touched on tech's big declines, but what else is going on in the index? Now that we're over the mid-day hump, we'll take the magnifying glass to the top movers (and losers) today.
Analog Devices
In a day where semiconductor companies are down, Analog Devices (ADI) (+3.5%) is in the unique position of being up. In fact, it's the top stock in the Nasdaq 100 right now (and the #2 stock in the S&P 500). The company's quarterly earnings report is to credit for the modest pop, with strong results and higher guidance buoying the stock today.
Target
Today's most-anticipated earnings report wasn't one that anybody had high hopes for. I guess you could say that they didn't hit the Target (sorry.) That's probably why it's on the other end of the market; the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 today is Target (TGT) (-7.48%), with same-store sales continuing to decline. To read more, scroll down to our section about the Target Turnover.
Regeneron
The pharmaceutical company Regeneron (REGN) (+3%) is jumping after the Food & Drug Administration indicated that it would extend the review period for the company's EYLEA HD injection, crediting a 'recent inspection of a third-party manufacturer' for a change in decision.
Intel
It sucks being the main character, but chipmaker Intel (INTC) (-6.3%) has been making the most of it. Amid murmurs that the White House is going to convert the company's CHIPS Act money into equity, Intel scored a cool $2 billion investment from SoftBank. But today, it's down amid reports that they're shopping for even more investors, dangling discounted equity as a carrot.
Palantir
The secretive AI company powering some of the stock market's most absurd gains seems to be cooling off. Palantir (PLTR) (-4%) is off its intraday lows, but still among the worst-performing components in both the S&P and Nasdaq today. Some analysts have warned that the stock, which some have called 'the most overvalued of all-time' is set for a pullback. It's on track for its sixth straight session, down 20% over that period of time.
Update: 11:08 a.m. ET
Why Is the Nasdaq Doing So Poorly?
Stocks are now near session lows, led by the Nasdaq Composite (-1.63%). The S&P 500 (-0.97%) also isn't doing so hot. Why?
Well, it kind of speaks for itself:
We've seen this one before... AI picks are sagging yet again, off to a downright horrendous start to the morning.
At last look, Palantir (PLTR) (-8.7%) is having another near-double digit day of losses. It's one of the worst-performing stocks on the market today again.
It's followed by AI hardware plays like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (-4.02%), Broadcom (-3.37%), and Nvidia (NVDA) (-3.14%).
And other than that, other big tech plays like Tesla (TSLA) (-3.55%), Amazon (AMZN) (-2.49%), Google (GOOGL) , and Meta (META) are all down more than 2% this morning.
Really, the only way that things could be worse for you right now is if you're in the unfortunate position of having a portfolio mostly built exclusively out of retail popular stocks. More on that later.
Update: 10:32 a.m. ET
The Berkshire Comeback Begins?
When Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett said he'd retire at the end of 2025, handing the chief job to long-time successor Greg Abel, the conglomerate's shares started to sag. Things might finally be turning a corner. Our very own Charley Blaine has the latest on the company's latest moves.
Maybe it's just déjà vu, but we've seen this picture a lot recently: Dow up, everybody else down. This morning, the Dow (+0.11%) is the only index in the green. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (-0.22%), Nasdaq (-0.59%), and Russell 2000 (-0.78%) are in the red.
If you're wondering how we got here, blame tech. Yesterday, we touched on how mega-cap tech and AI names dragged down the broader market.
Many such cases. It has been the reason for the pullback in recent days. And today, it's the same deal. In fact, from the looks of it, it might well be worsening this morning if the numbers at the starting gun are any indication.
Update: 7:43 a.m. ET
Futures Flat Before the Open
Futures started to the downside, but have been trending up all morning. All four major U.S. indexes are pointing to either a modest loss or gain at the open, with the S&P 500 down just 9 bips before the market open.
Update: 7:12 a.m. ET
Target Taps COO for Top Job in Exec Shakeup
Target (TGT) was once the envy of retailer for its beloved stance among the millennial crowd. No longer. In fact, it's hard to remember the last time that the hypermarket saw sales growth at all. Today, in its latest earnings showing, it reported that comparable sales fell 1.9% year-over-year.
That's why it's looking within for the solution, tapping COO Michael Fiddelke to become the company's next CEO. He has worked at the company for 20 years. He will take over in Feb. 2026.
The company's once-magnificent stock has been lapped by wholesale competition such as Walmart (WMT) and ecommerce names like Amazon (AMZN) , both of which offer a wider range of product at different price points.
Those giants are also known to steer clear of a controversy; the same can't be said for Target, which tried to 'both sides' its way out of a culture war sparring match. In the end, it simply frustrated everybody.
Target's exceptionally bad few years fall on management. Its lost its Tar-jhay again might ultimately lay at his feet of this long-time employee.
Update: 7:01 a.m. ET
Earnings Today: TJX Companies, Lowe's, Analog Devices
There are just 51 earnings set for today, per Nasdaq, but the retail sector is set to make them count. Firms like TJX Companies (TJX) , Lowe's Companies (LOW) , and Target (TGT) are set to dominate the discussion today.
Per TipRanks, these are the top ten earnings reports of the day, sorted by market capitalization:
Economic Data
Today will be another day of calm before the storm on Friday: Jackson Hole. There, Fed President Jerome Powell is expected to serve up the premier piece of central bank commentary this year.
In the meantime, investors will be treated to a handful of reports today, including speeches from the Fed's Waller and Bostic. We'll also get a look at the FOMC Minutes, arguably the most important nugget of insight that we'll get on the economic side today.

Instead of gravitating toward established tech giants, market participants are turning their attention to more speculative names, with Quantum Computing (QUBT) standing out as one of the most discussed companies in this emerging space.
On Thursday, Aug. 14, Quantum Computing released its fiscal 2025 second-quarter report which highlighted several developments, including a strategic partnership with NASA, inclusion in the Russell 2000 index, and photonic qubit progress. Despite these headlines, QUBT stock fell nearly 4% on the day.

This is because, during the quarter, the company recorded $61,000 in sales alongside a net loss of $36.5 million, underscoring that Quantum Computing remains effectively pre-revenue with no clear path to sustained profitability. While the industry often experiences irregular sales patterns, the company’s limited traction with enterprise customers points to more conceptual ambition than practical adoption. For now, investors are largely betting on potential rather than tangible results.
About Quantum Computing Stock
Based in Hoboken, New Jersey, Quantum Computing is an integrated quantum optics and nanophotonic technology firm. Carrying a market capitalization of roughly $2.37 billion, its operations focus on developing machines for quantum computing, reservoir computing, and applications in remote sensing, imaging, and cybersecurity, leveraging advanced integrated photonics and non-linear quantum optics.
Over the past year, QUBT stock has surged 2,223%, a meteoric rise that dwarfs the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has gained 14% over the same period. However, in 2025 alone, QUBT stock has fallen nearly 14%. So far in 2025, the broader index has climbed 9%, highlighting the volatility inherent in speculative tech plays.
Valuation metrics emphasize this divergence. QUBT trades at 6,813 times forward sales, far exceeding industry norms. Such figures reinforce that the stock is priced for future breakthroughs rather than present results.
A Closer Look at Quantum Computing’s Q2 Earnings
On Aug. 14, Quantum Computing reported its Q2 2025 results, wherein revenue amounted to $61,000, a 67% decline from the prior year. The figure also came in below analysts' expectations of $100,000.",92ff54808826a044f53388164f584f8a,trafilatura

The dollar fell from a 1-week high today and turned lower on political risks and concerns about Fed independence after President Trump called for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign amid a probe into two personal mortgages. FHFA Director Pulte wrote a letter to Attorney General Bondi suggesting Ms. Cook may have committed a criminal offense by allegedly falsifying bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms.
The dollar initially moved higher today after EUR/USD fell to a 1-week low when ECB President Lagarde said she sees slower growth in the Eurozone. The weakness in stocks today has also boosted some liquidity demand for the dollar. In addition, the dollar has support due to speculation that last week's stronger-than-expected July PPI report could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month's FOMC meeting, as expectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut in September fell to 84% area from 93% before the report.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 84% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) today is up by +0.09%. The euro recovered from a 1-week low today and turned higher after the dollar retreated when President Trump said Fed Governor Lisa Cook ""must resign"" now due to allegations of mortgage fraud.
The euro initially moved lower today on comments from ECB President Lagarde, who said the Eurozone economy is likely to see slower growth this quarter, with questions over global trade remaining despite recent trade deals with the US reducing uncertainty.
President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon, and European leaders are discussing a plan to send British and French troops to Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. The outcome could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.
Swaps are pricing in a 7% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) today is down by -0.35%. The yen is climbing today due to weakness in the dollar. Also, higher Japanese government bond yields have strengthened the yen's interest rate differentials and boosted the yen after the 10-year JGB bond yield rose to a 16-year high today of 1.621%. In addition, lower T-note yields on Tuesday were supportive of the yen. Today's Japanese economic news was mixed for the yen as Jun core machine orders unexpectedly increased, but July exports posted their largest decline in almost 4.5 years.
Japanese trade news was mixed as Jul exports fell -2.6% y/y, weaker than expectations of -2.1% y/y and the largest decline in almost 4.5 years. However, Jul imports fell -7.5% y/y, a smaller decline than expectations of -10.0% y/y.
Japan Jun core machine orders unexpectedly rose +3.0% m/m, stronger than expectations of a decline of -0.5% m/m.
December gold (GCZ25) today is up +27.30 (+0.81%), and September silver (SIU25) is up +0.378 (+1.01%). Precious metal prices recovered from early losses today and moved higher due to a weaker dollar and lower T-note yields. Also, an increase in US political uncertainty and concerns about Fed independence has boosted safe-haven demand for precious metals after President Trump called for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign amid allegations of mortgage fraud. Gold continues to have safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Fund buying of precious metals continues to support prices after gold holdings in ETFs rose to a 2-year high last Friday, and silver holdings in ETFs reached a 3-year high on Tuesday.
Precious metals initially moved lower today as signs of progress in peace talks over Ukraine have curbed some safe-haven demand. Also, today's hawkish UK July CPI report may keep the BOE from cutting interest rates and is bearish for precious metals. Silver prices were undercut today due to concerns over industrial metal demand after ECB President Lagarde said the Eurozone economy is likely to see slower growth this quarter.
UK Jul CPI rose +3.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of +3.7% y/y and the fastest pace of increase in 1.5 years. Jul core CPI also rose +3.8% y/y, stronger than expectations of +3.7% y/y.

TJX beat forecasts for sales and earnings this morning and raised guidance through the end of the year.
-
TJX's forecast is now ahead of analyst forecasts.
-
TJX stock costs more than 30 times earnings -- earnings growing at only single-digit rates.
TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX), owner of retail brands including TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, jumped 6.6% through 9:45 a.m. ET Wednesday after beating analyst forecasts for fiscal Q2 2026 earnings.
Heading into the report, analysts forecast TJX would earn $1.01 per share on less than $14.2 billion in sales, but TJX reported $1.10 per share on sales of $14.4 billion.
TJX Q2 earnings
TJX grew same-store sales 4%. Factoring in sales from newer stores, total sales growth reached 7%. Earnings growth was twice as good as sales -- up 15% year over year.
The company accelerated both sales and earnings growth between Q1 and Q2. H1 sales so far are up only 6%, and earnings 7%.
CEO Ernie Herrman pronounced himself ""extremely pleased"" with the numbers, noting sales, profit margins, and earnings are all growing ""above our plan,"" leading management to raise guidance.
Is TJX stock a buy?
Not all the news is good. While Herrman says, ""The third quarter is off to a strong start,"" TJX is still only guiding for 2% to 3% same-store sales growth in Q3, and earnings will be only about $1.18 per share, up 3.5% year over year and below analysts' forecast for a $1.22 quarterly profit.
On the plus side, TJX says earnings will grow 6% or 7% through the end of this fiscal year, to $4.52 to $4.57 per share, helped by better-than-expected profit margins. That's more than the $4.51 per share Wall Street forecast, and as much as an $0.18 improvement over previous guidance.
Still, a value investor can wonder: Is 3% sales growth, or even 7% profit growth, enough to justify TJX's rich 31-times-earnings valuation? No. It is not.

The startup said it also acquired the remaining 75% stake in its joint venture with SK, gaining full ownership of manufacturing operations for its silicon battery material in South Korea.
The Woodinville, Washington-based company makes silicon-carbon composite material or SCC55, which can replace graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries, enabling them to charge more quickly and hold more energy.
Demand for electric vehicles and advanced technologies has driven steady investor interest in the battery materials sector, with multiple companies competing to attract funding.
Venture capital firms are also increasingly targeting alternative battery materials companies, which have the potential to reduce the cost and size of battery packs, similar to the technology developed by Group14.
The company did not reveal the valuation for its latest funding in its statement, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters it was higher than the startup's value of more than $1 billion in a 2022 round.
The battery materials manufacturer had secured $614 million in its extended series C round in 2022, and the latest series D funding brings the total equity raised to more than $1 billion, the company said.
The new round, series D, also saw participation from existing investors such as Porsche Investments, ATL, OMERS, Decarbonization Partners, Lightrock Climate Impact Fund and Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund.
The battery active material (BAM) factory in South Korea produces Group14's SCC55 at EV scale. The company now fully owns three BAM factories, with the other two located in Washington.
""We're strengthening regional battery supply chains and safeguarding our customers from global trade uncertainty,"" CEO Rick Luebbe said.

Traders and investors are awaiting the annual Kansas City Federal Reserve Economic Policy Symposium that moves into full swing Thursday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to give an update on the Fed’s monetary policy framework on Friday morning.
More News from Barchart
Powell’s speech could give the market a new perspective on how much Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) support there is to lower U.S. interest rates in September.
Following are some of the arguments that have been put forth by monetary policy doves (who want lower U.S. interest rates sooner) and hawks (who want no U.S. interest rate cuts anytime soon). Then I’ll give you my prediction for Friday’s Powell speech.
The Dove Case on Interest Rate Cuts
-
The surprisingly weak U.S. employment report for July showed a modest increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 4.2% from 4.1% the previous month. While the headline number showed a small increase, the jobs growth was surprisingly minimal, with only 73,000 jobs added — and there were downward revisions to job gains in the May and June reports.
-
Other major central banks are starting to lower, or leaning toward lowering, their interest rates, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The U.S. Fed does not want to get behind the curve on global central bank monetary policy easing.
-
Recent U.S. inflation reports have been mostly tame. The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report rose 2.7% annually. That’s just slightly above what the Federal Reserve wants to see for annual inflation.
-
The “Too late Powell” nickname from President Donald Trump gained some credence following the July jobs report. Trump’s needling of Powell for not lower U.S. interest rates faster may well have pushed Powell into a more dovish posture, to be revealed at Jackson Hole.
The Hawk Case on Interest Rate Cuts
-
The hotter-than-expected July Producer Price Index reading of up 3.1%, year-over-year, raised eyebrows.
-
Most of the recent U.S. economic data has been upbeat, which supports a steady U.S. monetary policy stance.
-
U.S. tariffs are a wild card. While the tariffs have so far not sparked problematic inflation, there is the distinct possibility inflation will fire up in the coming months, as U.S. consumers may have to scramble to buy a shorter supply of goods on store shelves. Also, higher tariffs on imported goods to the U.S. suggest manufacturers and retailers will pass along those increased costs to consumers.

You pay yourself the massive investment management fees and bonuses, adding to your stockpile of billions in net worth. In addition to whatever gains you're able to extract from the market, of course.
The owners and managers of one particular fund were able to do just that--Renaissance Technologies.
What is Renaissance Technologies?
If you're unfamiliar with the hedge fund space, and even if you are familiar with it, you wouldn't be blamed for not knowing the name Renaissance Technologies. It's famously known for a highly secretive, primarily high-frequency, quantitative investing approach.
Founded in 1982 by James Simons, a former National Security Agency (NSA) codebreaker and mathematics professor, Renaissance Technologies managed several funds in the early eighties before focusing on its flagship Medallion Fund starting in 1988.
Simons was estimated to be worth over $31 billion at the time of his death in 2024 at the age of 86.
While they definitely don't sit on a beach, Renaissance investment managers were able to take the billions they earned to make the premier Medallion Fund into an employee-only (current and former) fund in 2005.

Since then, the fund has been closed to outsiders and has maintained an aura of secrecy about its operations and strategies, adding to its mystique.
The Medallion Fund reportedly manages over $71 billion in assets under management, or AUM, and has an even larger footprint due to its high use of leverage and rapid turnover of positions.
However, Renaissance's main claim to fame is its spectacular annual returns. Gains on the order of +60% are not uncommon for the quantitative powerhouse. It has beaten all other quantitative hedge funds in history, with net annual returns of around 39% and gross returns over 66%.
Renaissance intentionally keeps the amount of money it manages on the low side, as its strategies work better under limited volumes, translating to better returns on a smaller amount of AUM.

Signs of progress in peace talks over the Ukraine war are weighing on crude prices. President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon.

The rule announced Tuesday by the Bank of Thailand is meant to help combat the huge criminal industry of online scams, which makes billions of dollars annually and is especially active in Southeast Asia. In many countries there is increasing pressure on banks to play a more active role in safeguarding the assets of customers targeted by scammers.
The new measure aims to curb financial fraud by preventing criminals from receiving and transferring a large amount of money at one time, and enabling timely freezing of illicit funds in order to increase the chances that victims will be able to recover at least some of their money, according to Daranee Saeju, the bank's assistant governor for Payment Systems Policy and Financial Consumer Protection.
The daily transfer limit will be applied to transfers in three different tiers: under 50,000 baht ($1,537), under 200,000 baht ($6,147) and above 200,000 baht ($6,147), depending on each customer’s risk profile and the banks’ assessment under know-your-customer, or KYC, rules.
Customers with established records of responsibility can continue transferring at their usual levels.
This measure will be implemented for new mobile banking and internet banking customers by the end of this month and for existing customers by the end of this year.
Thailand has around 12 million mobile banking users, according to a report Wednesday in the Bangkok Post newspaper. It said previous central bank safeguards capped mobile banking transfers at 50,000 baht ($1,537) per transaction — with facial recognition required — and 200,000 baht ($6,147) per day in total.
In June alone this year, 24,500 scam cases related to money transfers were reported to the authorities, causing total losses of 2.8 billion baht ($86.1 million) — an average of 114,000 baht ($3,504) per case. The largest single fraudulent transfer amounted to 4.9 million baht ($150,591), the Post reported, citing the central bank.
On average, scammers needed only three minutes to siphon off half of the stolen funds, while victims typically took 19–25 hours to report the crime, the newspaper reported.
For the first six months of this year, children under 15 were involved in 78,468 financial scam cases, while victims over 65 years of age accounted for 416,453 cases, it said.",eed9c5a207d93ec12b377d6300f1f45d,trafilatura

The news the retail industry has been anticipating for months was finally announced on Wednesday: Target CEO Brian Cornell is finally stepping down after 11 years at the helm and will be replaced by his operations chief Michael Fiddelke in February.
But another piece of news the industry is looking for—Target returning to sales growth—will have to wait. Target reported yet another quarter of weak financial results, with comparable sales down 1.9%, and the cheap-chic retailer reaffirmed its expectation that sales will decline by a low single-digit percentage this year, projecting a third year in a row of declines.
In recent years, after a torrid run that included Target making massive market share gains during the pandemic, the retailer has stagnated even as archrival Walmart has soared. Analysts say that Target has lost some of its magic touch. That is, the hip but affordable merchandise; fun, well-kept stores; and attentive customer service that helped it stand out and steal a lot of market share from rivals, notably department stores, in the not too distant past.
“Target, which used to be very attuned to consumer demand, has lost its grip on delivering for the American shopper,” Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, wrote in a research note. Those problems have included a resurgence of out-of-stocks (a problem that was plaguing Target when Cornell took the reins in 2014 but had been overcome); long wait times at checkout registers; and what Saunders says are increasingly messy stores. Adding to Target’s woes were its flip-flops on the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) issue. The retailer attracted the ire of conservatives who threatened boycotts, but then angered many shoppers and employees when it curtailed some of its efforts.
Fiddelke, who started at Target two decades ago and went on to become finance chief and then COO, acknowledged those problems on a call with reporters on Wednesday, according to CNBC. He has three main goals: reestablish the “Tar-zhay” magic with customers, improve customer experience, and make better use of technology to make operations more efficient and less costly. He’ll also have to rally the troops: The Wall Street Journal recently reported that a companywide survey in June found that 40% of Target workers didn’t have confidence in its future.
Though Fiddelke, 49, extolled the value of knowing Target deeply, shares fell 10% in morning trading on the news of his appointment. Citi analyst Paul Lejuez said investors were “hoping for an external CEO” with fresh eyes. Meanwhile GlobalData’s Saunders said Target needs a CEO who can cut through the groupthink he says has impeded innovation. Target’s stock is down 64% since its all-time high four years ago. (During that time, Walmart shares have more than doubled.)",4b3c9fa51be66054d8219808962818e3,trafilatura

Two 52-week highs, actually:

And then the stocks tumbled, about 14.5% for each class, just about every day until early August.
The bottom came Aug. 4, when the A shares closed at $692,690 and the B shares at $459.11.

Since then, both Berkshire classes are up about 5.7%, not too shabby a gain over roughly 10 days.
The lesson: Don't count out Berkshire Hathaway.
What drove the stock down?
Buffett's retirement announcement.
The decision, at the very end of Berkshire's annual meeting, probably surprised a lot of fans who forgot he was 94.
Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, were a fantastic team of money managers who made billions for Berkshire on such stocks as Apple (AAPL) and American Express (AXP) . (Munger passed away at 99 in November 2023.)
Indeed, Berkshire's 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which show buys and sells, are required reading for serious investors.

If someone as legendary as Buffett suddenly abandons the fray, that's a known unknown.
Greg Abel, Buffett's named successor, is not known as a stock picker, the Motley Fool notes.
But he is a seasoned operating manager. He has been chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which owns multiple utilities across the Midwest and West. And Berkshire also runs giant businesses like the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad.
Buffett in fact noted that Abel isn't afraid to dig into operational problems, something the boss didn't like to do all that much.
Tech stocks soared after the market's April bottom
Lots and lots of money managers started chasing the hot stocks, including:
-
Nvidia (NVDA) , up 102.8% since the low.
-
Palantir Technologies (PLTR) , up 139% from the low.
-
Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (META) . up 56% from the low.
-
Microsoft (MSFT) , up 48% from the low.
-
Broadcom (AVGO) , 139%.
And Berkshire? Up only single digits.
That makes sense. You don't chase losers. Until losers stop falling. As Berkshire Hathaway did on Aug. 4. And, if you're a value investor, like Buffett, you don't chase hot stocks.

Focusing more closely, the security and engineering company stock has also outperformed the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 18.5% return over the past 52 weeks.
Shares of Leidos climbed 7.5% on Aug. 5 after the company reported Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $3.21, well above Wall Street’s expectation. Revenue came in at $4.3 billion, topping estimates, and management raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $11.15 per share - $11.45 per share. Investor optimism was further supported by strong demand for Leidos’ technical services and munitions amid ongoing global geopolitical tensions.
For the fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect LDOS’ adjusted EPS to grow 11.7% year-over-year to $11.40. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It topped the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 18 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 12 “Strong Buy” ratings and six “Holds.”
This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with 10 “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.
On Aug. 6, Truist raised its price target on Leidos to $188 while maintaining a “Buy” rating.
As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $188.06. The Street-high price target of $209 implies a potential upside of 16.9% from the current price levels.

Diplomatic talks over the war in Ukraine continue to make headway. President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon, and European leaders are discussing a plan to send British and French troops to Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.
The focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal. Later today, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000, and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July. Also, the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 49.8. In addition, Jul existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.
In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.

Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up +6 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -2.5 bp to 4.281%. Sep T-notes are modestly higher today, supported by weakness in equity markets. Also, strength in European government bonds is providing carryover support to T-notes. T-notes remained higher after the Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump is considering firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud. If Cook is fired or resigns, Mr. Trump could appoint another Fed Governor who favors his lower interest rate policies.
Supply pressures are limiting gains in T-notes as the Treasury will auction $16 billion of 20-year T-bonds later today. Also, concerns that last week’s bearish US July CPI and PPI reports could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month’s FOMC meeting are weighing on T-notes.
European government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -3.4 bp to 2.716%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -6.0 bp to 4.680%.

She says not getting an MBA was a ‘really good thing’
-
As Gen Z questions the value of a degree, Epic’s billionaire CEO, Judy Faulkner, says she has never been a fan of MBAs—and built a $5.7-billion-a-year software giant without one. Unlike Apple CEO Tim Cook or General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who both attended business school, the 82-year-old charted her own path, including establishing 10 business “commandments,” like a directive to never file for an IPO or sell.
With recent graduates struggling to land jobs and the best business schools charging in excess of $150,000 for a degree, it’s left Gen Z’s aspiring business leaders questioning more than ever the value of going back to school.
For Epic Systems CEO Judy Faulkner, whose software powers many of the U.S.’s top hospitals, the answer is simple: A graduate business degree may have done more harm than good.
“I never got an MBA, which I think is a really good thing,” Faulkner recently told CNBC.
“They would have taught me, ‘Here’s how you do venture capital.’ We didn’t do it. ‘Here’s how you go public.’ We didn’t do it. ‘Here’s how you do budgets.’ We don’t have budgets. We say, ‘If you need it, buy it. If you don’t need it, don’t buy it.’”
While the 82-year-old’s leadership style may sound unconventional, it has worked wonders for her business, which she started in her Wisconsin basement in 1979. Epic now rakes in an estimated $5.7 billion in annual revenue and has propelled Faulkner’s net worth to over $7.8 billion.
Her secret to learning the ropes of business management still included reading books and taking multiday courses, but she’s just never been a blind follower. In fact, Faulkner even established her own set of principles, known as Epic’s 10 commandments, that are plastered all over the company’s sprawling 1,670-acre campus. They include “do not go public,” “do not acquire or be acquired,” and “software must work.”
CEOs are divided on the value of business school
While demand for business school is on the rise—a trend often seen in conjunction with economic uncertainty—business leaders have long expressed doubt about whether the skills taught in the classroom are worth it.
In fact, the richest person in the world, billionaire Elon Musk, has said that there are too many business school graduates running corporate America.
“I think there may be too many MBAs running companies,” Musk previously told the Wall Street Journal. “There’s the MBA-ization of America, which I think is maybe not that great. There should be more focus on the product or service itself, less time on board meetings, less time on financials.”",61bce9315b87b1bc28c6c7b4b53f5e6a,trafilatura

Prices rose at an annual pace of 3.8pc in July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), up from 3.6pc in June and higher than analysts’ predictions of a climb to 3.7pc.
Transport costs were the largest upward driver of prices, mainly as a result of higher air fares, while food inflation increased from 4.5pc to 4.9pc, the highest level since February last year.
Consumer prices for beef surged by 25pc, the largest annual increase since comparable data began a decade ago.
Coffee, butter and chocolate also saw sharp price increases of nearly a fifth as volatile weather conditions hit global supply.
The pound edged higher and housebuilding stocks fell as traders bet there was a less than 50pc chance that policymakers would lower borrowing costs again in 2025 after this month’s rate cut to 4pc.
It came as Tesco announced it would increase the price of its meal deal by 25p on Thursday. The price will rise from £3.60 to £3.85 for Clubcard shoppers and from £4 to £4.25 for all other customers. Tesco also said it will add 50p to the price of its premium meal deal, raising the price from £5.50 to £6.
Andrew Wishart of Berenberg said policymakers would not cut rates again this year as upward pressure on inflation from global food prices and energy would likely peak in the autumn.
Elliot Jordan-Doak, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned inflation will remain around 3.7pc on average for the rest of 2025 as inflation stays “miles above target for the foreseeable future”.
Mr Jordan-Doak said: “We expect headline inflation to remain above 3pc until April 2026, forcing the MPC to stay on hold for the rest of this year at least.”
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has a target to bring inflation down to 2pc but the pace of price rises has fallen below that level just once since April 2021.
Oxford Economics forecast that inflation will not drop below the Bank’s target until beyond 2027 and said it expects CPI in Britain to average 3.5pc this year and 2.8pc in 2026.
It follows the chancellor’s decision in her Budget last year to impose increases in National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage on employers, which took effect from April.
Closely-watched services inflation rose faster than expected from 4.7pc to 5pc, as businesses were hit with higher costs. The figure was also fuelled by rising prices for hotel stays as Oasis reunited for their first tour in 15 years.
Mr Wishart said: “The 5pc in services prices in July is sufficient to keep headline CPI inflation at 2.5pc even if prices in all other categories stopped rising.”
Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, added: “July’s outturn probably extinguishes hope of a September interest rate cut, while strengthening underlying inflationary pressures calls into question whether policymakers will be able to relax policy again this year.”
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said there is “more to do” to ease the cost of living.
She said: “We have taken the decisions needed to stabilise the public finances, and we’re a long way from the double-digit inflation we saw under the previous government, but there’s more to do to ease the cost of living.”

US tech sell-off boosts ‘boring’ FTSE
Tech stocks in the US have continued their sell-off on Wall Street, which some analysts have suggested could be helping push the FTSE 100 higher.
Chip giant Nvidia and electric carmaker Tesla were down about 3pc in the US, with Palantir falling around 7pc following a recent loss of confidence in AI stocks.
David Morrison, an analyst at Trade Nation, said: “I wonder if investors are also looking at the constituents within the FTSE 100 (which is effectively a tech-free index with loads of boring value plays) and thinking it may be a safer alternative to the high-valuation US corporates which have driven so much of market for such a long time.
“There are suggestions that AI has become seriously overhyped currently, requiring a bit of a readjustment.”

FTSE rises as market bets on later rate cuts
The FTSE 100 has climbed as traders bet that the Bank of England will cut interest rates next year.
The UK’s flagship stock index has climbed 0.7pc despite inflation rising faster than expected in July.
Money markets indicate there is about a 50-50 chance that interest rates will be cut again in 2025, down from 54pc at the start of the week.
However, traders are now betting there is a 64pc chance of two cuts coming by July next year, compared to 41pc on Monday.
Analysts suggested this was because the latest surge in inflation was due to temporary factors like the 30.2pc jump in air fares caused by an earlier school summer holiday.
Chris Beauchamp, an analyst at IG, said: “While the headline seems to make last month’s rate cut look misplaced, below the surface it seems several key components drove the rise, and a focus on the less volatile elements suggests that the picture is more nuanced.
“Inflation isn’t beaten, but it is perhaps being tamed.”
It is not all good news for UK stocks. The domestically focused FTSE 250 was last down 0.2pc.

US stocks subdued amid uncertainty over interest rates
Wall Street’s main indexes were muted at the open ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell which could detail the outlook for US interest rates.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at the open to 44,922.70 in the lead up to the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming later this week.
The S&P 500 fell 4.7 points, or 0.1pc, at the open to 6,406.62​, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 45.3 points, or 0.2pc, to 21,269.667 at the opening bell.
By contrast, London’s FTSE 100 has marched higher despite the inflation shock that rocked markets in early trading.

Inflation to remain above 2pc target for more than two years, say economists
Inflation will not fall below the Bank of England’s 2pc target next year or the one after, economists have warned.
Oxford Economics said it expects inflation in Britain to average 3.5pc this year and 2.8pc in 2026.
It said the consumer prices index (CPI) is likely to climb to 4pc over the next couple of months, peaking in September.
It is then due to subsequently “drift lower” as food and energy price rises ease in the final months of this year and through 2026, helped by the recent rises in the value of sterling, which have made imports cheaper.
However, the advisory firm forecast inflation will not drop below the Bank’s 2pc target until at least beyond 2027.

Why Britain is suffering from the highest price rises in Europe
When Sir Keir Starmer took the stage at the 2023 Labour conference in Liverpool, he promised voters he would solve the cost of living crisis if elected.
Rapid inflation “intrudes on the little things we love,” he said. “Whittles away at our joy.
“Days out, meals out, holidays [are] the first things people cut back on. Picking up a treat in the supermarket just to put it back on the shelf.
“We have to be a government that takes care of the big questions so working people have the freedom to enjoy what they love,” he vowed.
One year into government and this pledge looks far off. After a brief easing of the cost of living crisis, prices are once again climbing – and experts say Labour policy is fuelling the problem.

Raising rail fares will price out commuters, warns union
Rail unions have warned that increasing rail fares next year would price commuters off the network.
Rail fares in England are on track to surge by 5.8pc next year after inflation rose at a faster pace than expected.
Official figures showed the retail price index (RPI) rose to 4.8pc in July. Increases in train fares are traditionally calculated using July’s RPI figure plus one percentage point.
Maryam Eslamdoust, general secretary of the rail and transport union TSSA, said: “It’s vital that the Government protects the travelling public from any unnecessary rise in rail fares as a result of this inflation spike.
“The last thing passengers need is to be clobbered by higher fares and pushed off the railways at a time when we need people to be making more journeys for work and business reasons and in so doing powering the economy.
“Regulated fares account for almost half of all rail journeys so we are urging the Department for Transport to keep ticket prices affordable so that we can get people out of their cars and onto the railways.
“If we want public transport to be fully used by the public, it has to be priced for the public. Affordable fares mean full trains & cleaner air.”

Sweden keeps rates on hold after inflation rises
Sweden’s central bank kept its interest rates on hold today as it fights its own a recent tick up in inflation.
The Riksbank held its benchmark rate at 2pc, which is the lowest in more than two years, after its consumer prices index rose by 0.8pc in July, up from 0.7pc in June and 0.2pc in May.
It said: “Although developments in inflation and economic activity during the summer have deviated somewhat from the forecast in June, the Executive Board assesses that the outlook remains largely the same.
“There is thus still some probability of a further interest rate cut this year, in line with the June forecast.”
Adrian Prettejohn of Capital Economics said: “We think that the economy is likely to recover in the coming quarters, encouraging the Riksbank to leave its policy rate unchanged for the foreseeable future.
“However, the risks are tilted towards a further 25bp cut later this year.”

Rate cuts coming in November and February, says Barclays
Barclays said it expects the Bank of England will cut interest rates once more this year followed by another cut early in 2026.
The bank’s chief European economist Silvia Ardagna forecast a quarter point reduction in borrowing costs in November, followed by another cut in February.
She said that although inflation was stronger than expected at 3.8pc, “progress on services dis-inflation continued”.
Although services inflation rose from 4.7pc to 5pc, Barclays pointed to services inflation excluding indexed and volatile components, rents and foreign holidays, which fell from 4.2pc to 3.9pc.
Ms Ardagna said: “This inflation print increases the risk that the Bank of England will pause for longer and reaches neutral later than we currently forecast.
“That said, given the progress in underlying services inflation and on wage growth, we think it is too soon to rule a November cut.”

Bank of England to remain ‘on a knife edge’ says ex-policymaker
The Bank of England’s next decision on interest rates will “remain on a knife edge” following the latest jump in inflation, a former policymaker has said.
Professor Jonathan Haskel, who sat on the Monetary Policy Committee from 2018 to 2024, said there would be “slightly less prospect of more cuts” in the coming months as rate setters try to work out the underlying level of inflation.
“One surprise is that food and non-alcoholic beverages have gone up by an unexpectedly large amount,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The way that plays out on the committee is that, for some, that is a temporary increase because food prices often unwind, for others that’s extremely salient to wage bargainers who want to be compensated for, understandably, a rise in the important prices that they face.
“And so, if that increases wage pressure, that increases underlying wage inflation.
“So I think the committee is going to remain on a knife-edge given those two conflicting forces.”

FTSE 100 shrugs off inflation fears
The FTSE 100 has turned higher despite the stronger-than-expected inflation figures.
The blue-chip index was up 0.3pc as gains in consumer and healthcare sectors offset losses in energy and mining stocks.
The FTSE 250 mid-cap index dropped 0.4pc, putting it on pace to mark its steepest fall in over two weeks.
The UK’s consumer price inflation hit its highest in 18 months in July when it increased to 3.8pc from 3.6pc, once again leaving Britain with the fastest rate of price increases among the world’s largest rich economies.
Luke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen, said: “Inflation was always likely to rise today, but this report is definitely on the hotter side.
“In particular, services inflation, which the Bank of England watches very closely as a measure of underlying inflation pressure, popping higher will be a source of concern among policymakers.”
Traders are now betting on a quarter-point reduction in March next year. Earlier this month, markets had anticipated a cut before the end of 2025.
On the FTSE 100, BP dropped 1.3pc after it said operations at its refinery at Indiana were affected by flooding.
On the flip side, consumer stocks and healthcare companies supported gains on the blue-chip index.
Medical equipment maker Convatec rose 5.6pc was the largest gainer on the FTSE 100 after it announced $300m share buyback programme.

Tax raid forcing pubs and restaurants to close one day a week
Rachel Reeves’s tax raid is forcing hospitality businesses to shut their doors at least once a week as they grapple with spiralling wage costs following last year’s Budget.
On Wednesday, a new survey revealed that almost three quarters of hospitality businesses were operating at or below 85pc of their normal capacity, meaning they close for part of the week to save money.
The slimmer opening hours come as restaurants, pubs and cafes slash jobs in response to the rise in employers’ National Insurance contributions (NICs) and an increase in the minimum wage, which came into force in April.

US central bank boss under pressure over rates
Economists were cautious about the prospect of more interest rate cuts from the Bank of England after the latest rise in inflation.
However, it is a very different story over in the US.
Investors will hang on Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s every word when he speaks at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming.
The Fed, which is yet to cut rates in 2025, is not due to hold its next meeting until mid-September and policymakers are grappling with weaker-than-expected jobs report but higher-than-expected inflation.
Meanwhile, Mr Powell has come under intense pressure from Donald Trump to lower interest rates to boost the US economy.
Kevin Thozet of French asset manager Carmignac said: “Between Trump’s pressure and market expectations, Powell is expected to give in and hint that the rate cutting cycle will resume.
“This stance is widely anticipated, with market participants expecting the Fed to cut more than currently signaled by the dot plot.
“Short-term interest rate markets largely anticipate at least two interest cuts this year, reflecting expectations that the US economy and inflation will show further signs of deceleration.
“We think this is too high given the resilience of the US economy, policy uncertainty and the persistence of inflationary pressures.”

Bank of England to cut interest rates twice next year, says economist
The Bank of England will cut interest rates twice in the first half of next year amid signs underlying inflation is easing, an economist has said.
Andrew Wishart of Berenberg said policymakers would not cut rates again this year as upward pressure on inflation from global food prices and energy would likely peak in the third quarter.
He pointed to higher than expected growth in services inflation to 5pc, which “may suggest that underlying price pressures could be strengthening”.
“However, the increase was driven entirely by a surge in the volatile airfares component and hotel prices. Oasis’ live tour may have temporarily boosted the latter,” he said.
“As we move toward the end of the year, headline inflation should thus begin to ease. However, for headline inflation to fall back to the 2pc target, increases in services prices must slow.
“The 5pc in services prices in July is sufficient to keep headline CPI inflation at 2.5pc even if prices in all other categories stopped rising.
“A few signs that companies have lost pricing power and that wages growth has shifted onto onto a definitive downward trend give us some confidence that services inflation will ease next year.
“We therefore expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates twice more in the first half of 2026 to 3.5pc after a pause in the remainder of 2025.”

House prices pick up after stamp duty shock
Average UK house prices rose at a faster pace in the year to June, official figures showed, indicating the market is recovering from the shock of higher stamp duty.
The average UK house price increased by 3.7pc to £269,000, the ONS said, an increase from a 2.7pc rise reported in May, although this was downwardly revised from 3.9pc.
Average house prices increased by 3.3pc in England to £291,000, by 2.6pc in Wales to £210,000 and by 5.9pc in Scotland to £192,000.
The stamp duty discount expired at the end of March, cutting the threshold at which movers pay the tax from £250,000 to £125,000.
Elliott Jordan-Doak of Pantheon Macroeconomics said house prices are “recovering quickly from the disruption caused by the hike to stamp duty in April”.
“Cutting through the noise, we think fundamental housing demand remains solid, indicating that house prices can continue to rise steadily over the course of the second half of the year,” he said.
Meanwhile, average UK monthly private rents increased by 5.9pc to £1,343 in the 12 months to July. This was down from June’s 6.7pc rise.

Rising inflation will keep borrowing costs high, warn economists
The cost of government borrowing will rise as a result of higher inflation, economists have warned.
Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs said the news of inflation “looks set to get even worse before it gets any better”.
He said: “The latest jump in UK inflation to 3.8pc in July was not a big surprise – the Bank of England was already expecting an increase to 4pc in September.
“But rising inflation will continue to eat into real incomes and keep bond yields high, adding to the government’s cost of borrowing.”
He added: “The bigger picture is that UK inflation has continued to diverge from the euro area, where inflation has settled at around 2pc.
“This divergence is being driven by higher government-set prices (such as domestic energy bills and the national minimum wage), the continued pass through of higher employer taxes, and high housing costs as demand outpaces supply.”
Government borrowing costs have fallen on bond markets today as traders reacted to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s decision to cut interest rates at the same time as it signalled that lower borrowing costs were on the way, despite an increase in its inflation projections.
Bonds had already been given a boost by S&P Global’s decision to reaffirm its credit rating for the US on Tuesday.

Housebuilders slump after inflation blow
Housebuilding stocks slumped on the London Stock Exchange after the latest inflation figures dashed hopes for interest rate cuts.
Developers across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 fell as much as 1.4pc after the consumer prices index rose to a stronger-than-expected 3.8pc in July.
Crest Nicholson dropped by 2.2pc while Berkeley Group declined by 1.7pc as traders bet that the Bank of England would not reduce borrowing costs again this year.
Housebuilding stocks tends to perform better when interest rates are lower as it improves affordability for buyers.
Anna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “September’s rate decision is expected to be a hold, but don’t be surprised if sticky inflation puts paid to further rate cuts this year.”
Janet Mui, an analyst at RBC Brewin Dolphin, added: “Unless we see a sharp deterioration in economic activity, the Bank is likely to keep rates on hold until the end of the year.”
The FTSE 100 was last down 0.2pc and the mid-cap FTSE 250 has dropped by 0.5pc.

Rising food prices down to Labour policies and poor harvests, say retailers
Food and drink inflation increases for the fourth month in a row as Rachel Reeves’s tax raid fuelled prices at the till, according to retailers.
Food and drink inflation rose to 4.9pc in July, from 4.5pc in June, which was the highest level since February 2024.
Kris Hamer, director of insight for trade body the British Retail Consortium, said: “Households are once again seeing the cost of their weekly shop climb, with food inflation now up by 1.9 percentage points in just four months.
“This surge has been a key driver behind headline inflation, alongside a rise in transport costs, piling fresh pressure on families already being forced to cut back.
“The Bank of England has been clear that Government policies, which have driven up the costs of employment, are fuelling price rises at the till, while poor harvests and global instability have also added further cost pressures.”

‘All should be sacked’ as inflation climbs
Rachel Reeves has been accused of “utter incompetence” by Telegraph readers who said her tax raid on businesses had helped fuel inflation.
Others said the Bank of England is “wholly to blame” for cutting interest rates despite high inflation, suggesting failure to control food prices was a “fundamental economic failure”.
Here is a selection of views from the comment section below and you can join the debate here:

No more rate cuts this year, warn economists
The Bank of England will not cut interest rates again this year as inflation “is set to stay miles above target for the foreseeable future”, economists have warned.
Pantheon Macroeconomics has predicted inflation will remain around 3.7pc on average for the rest of 2025.
It said official figures for July showed services inflatuon was “sticky” in a blow to those at the Bank of England “that argued hard at the August meeting about the disinflationary process being underway”.
Policymakers were forced to make an historic revote on whether to cut interest rates from 4.25pc to 4pc at their last meeting, eventually choosing to do so by the thinnest of margins.
Economist Elliott Jordan-Doak said the latest inflation figures come on the back of a GDP report “that smashed consensus estimates, and a labour market report that showed the jobs market stabilising”.
He said: “The big picture remains that inflation is set to stay miles above target for the foreseeable future; we expect headline inflation to remain above 3pc until April 2026, forcing the MPC to stay on hold for the rest of this year at least.”
08:08 AM BST
UK stocks fall after inflation blow
The FTSE 100 declined at the open after stronger-than-expected inflation dashed hopes for further rate cuts this year.
The UK’s flagship stock index was down 0.1pc to 9,177.37 as traders slashed bets on the Bank of England reducing borrowing costs again before the end of 2025.
The domestically focused FTSE 250 sank by 0.3pc to 21,770.37.
07:57 AM BST
‘Oasis effect’ helps drive up hotel prices
A rise in the cost of overnight hotel stays helped drive services inflation during July as Oasis kicked off their reunion tour.
Services inflation hit 5pc last month, also driven by a large increase in air fares.
The figure was far higher than the jump from 4.7pc to 4.8pc that had been expected by economists and comes as the chancellor imposed higher costs on businesses through her tax raid.
Economists had expected the reunion of Oasis for their first tour in 15 years to push up the costs of hotels and provide further fuel to inflation.
Adam Deasy, economist at PwC, said: “As expected, the summer seasonals drove the change: we saw large increases in airfares, likely due to school holidays, and hotel prices surged – possibly influenced by the ‘Oasis effect’.
“This demonstrates the volatility that summer readings can bring and pushes inflation to an uncomfortable new peak since January 2024.”
“Despite recent falls in earnings growth, the Bank of England sees the all-important services inflation figure continuing to rise through the year, and the increase from 4.7pc to 5pc in July may indicate that it’s right.
“This, together with higher-than-expected food inflation through much of 2025, looks poised to push inflation to a peak of 4pc later this year, double the Bank’s 2pc target.”
07:42 AM BST
Pound edges higher as hopes of September rate cut ‘extinguished’
The value of the pound increased after the stronger-than-expected inflation effectively ruled out the chances of a September interest rate cut.
Sterling rose 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.351 and gained 0.2pc versus the euro to €1.161 after prices rose at a rate of 3.8pc in July, faster than projections of 3.7pc.
Suren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, said: “July’s outturn probably extinguishes hope of a September interest rate cut, while strengthening underlying inflationary pressures calls into question whether policymakers will be able to relax policy again this year.”
He added: “Increasing services inflation suggests that rising National Insurance and National Living Wage costs are exacerbating underlying price pressures by more than offsetting the current downward squeeze from looser labour market conditions.
“While spiralling business costs and food prices may mean that inflation peaks higher than the Bank of England’s prediction of 4pc, it should start decelerating in the autumn as a weaker economy increasingly bears down on prices.”
Monica George Michail, associate economist at Niesr, added: “The Bank faces a difficult balancing act between lowering inflation and boosting a sluggish economy.
“Given that several of the current drivers of annual price increases are one-off policy changes, we think the Bank of England may look through them and cut interest rates one more time this year.
“However, there remain upside risks especially from food prices and sustained wage pressures, which will force the Bank to remain cautious”
07:35 AM BST
Interest rates may not be cut until next year, warn economists
The higher than expected rise in inflation to 3.8pc in July, from 3.6pc the previous month, makes life even more difficult for the Bank of England.
Its nine-person rate-setter panel is already struggling to agree on the right diagnosis for the economy’s ills.
For the first time ever they were forced into a second round of voting in August, before ultimately agreeing to lower interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to 4pc.
The latest figures will make their balancing act even more fraught. Inflation is rising faster than expected, but growth has been better than anticipated. Normally that would make policymakers err on the side of caution and swerve rate cuts.
Among the drivers of inflation in July were airfares – worsened by how the school holidays fell – and hotel prices, likely affected by Oasis making a return. The rate setters may judge these are temporary factors and persist with cutting rates. But the risk of price rises proving stubborn will be a big concern.
“The risk is that inflation expectations and wage growth rise further and the next move down in rates does not happen until next year,” warns Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics.
07:27 AM BST
Rail fares on track to jump by 5.8pc
Regulated train fares in England may increase by 5.8pc next year, based on a measure of inflation announced today.
The Office for National Statistics said Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation rose to 4.8pc in July.
The Government has not confirmed how it will determine the cap on regulated fare rises in 2026, but this year’s 4.6pc hike was one percentage point above RPI in July 2024.
If that formula is used to set next year’s fare increase, the cost of train travel will jump by 5.8pc.
Pressure group Railfuture recently said “it would be outrageous” if fares even rose by as much as 5.5pc.
07:19 AM BST
Tories say rising inflation ‘deeply worrying for families’
Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said inflation jumping to its highest level in more than 18 months was “deeply worrying for families”.
He said: “Labour’s choices to tax jobs and ramp up borrowing are pushing up costs and stoking inflation – making everyday essentials more expensive. And with leading economists warning that the Chancellor has blown a colossal black hole in the public finances, families and businesses are bracing for yet more pain come the Autumn Budget.
“Families are paying the price for Rachel Reeves’ economic mismanagement. Britain can’t afford Labour.”

Reeves admits ‘more to do’ as inflation jumps
Rachel Reeves said there is “more to do” to ease the cost of living after inflation jumped to its highest level since January last year.
The chancellor said: “We have taken the decisions needed to stabilise the public finances, and we’re a long way from the double-digit inflation we saw under the previous government, but there’s more to do to ease the cost of living.
“That’s why we’ve raised the minimum wage, extended the £3 bus fare cap, expanded free school meals to over half a million more children, and are rolling out free breakfast clubs for every child in the country.
“Through our Plan for Change we’re going further and faster to put more money in people’s pockets.”
07:11 AM BST
Air fares and petrol prices push up inflation
ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said: “Inflation rose again this month to its highest annual rate since the beginning of last year.
“The main driver was a hefty increase in air fares, the largest July rise since collection of air fares changed from quarterly to monthly in 2001.
“This increase was likely due to the timing of this year’s school holidays.
“The price of petrol and diesel also increased this month, compared with a drop this time last year.
“Food price inflation continues to climb, with items such as coffee, fresh orange juice, meat and chocolate seeing the biggest rises.”
07:06 AM BST
Inflation jumps to 3.8pc
The rate of inflation rose to 3.8pc in July from 3.6pc in June, the Office for National Statistics said.
Transport, particularly air fares, made the largest upward contribution to the monthly change.

Oasis reunion could fuel inflation
Prices in the UK are set to have risen faster last month as school holidays boosted travel costs and grocery bills remain elevated.
However, some economists have said an “Oasis bump” could have contributed to higher hotel and accommodation prices in July.
Sanjay Raja, senior economist for Deutsche Bank, said this could partly be attributed to Oasis kicking off their reunion tour in July.
The concerts brought in hordes of fans to arenas in Cardiff, Manchester, London and Edinburgh, which could have driven greater demand for hotel rooms.
Accommodation prices could rise by as much as 9pc in July, compared with June, “with the Oasis concerts having a strong impact on Manchester prices alone”, Mr Raja said.
He is predicting headline UK inflation will have risen to 3.8pc in July.

Global share markets came under pressure on Wednesday after a tech-led sell-off on Wall Street.
Benchmarks fell in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, pulled lower by selling of computer chip makers.
Tokyo’s benchmark Nikkei 225 declined 1.7pc to 42,787.28. Computer-chip equipment makers Advantest plunged 6.6pc and Disco dropped 4.7pc. Chip maker Tokyo Electron lost 1.9pc and Lasertec lost 1.8pc.
Japan reported its exports fell slightly more than expected in July, pressured by higher tariffs on goods shipped to the US.
South Korea’s Kospi dropped 1.4pc to 3,096.09, while the Taiex in Taiwan fell 2.4pc after chip maker TSMC dropped 3.8pc.
On Wall Street, falls in Nvidia and other heavyweight artificial intelligence stocks pulled the S&P 500 down 0.6pc, to 6,411.37. They also dragged down the Nasdaq by 1.5pc, to finish at 21,314.95. However, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average ended roughly flat, ending at 44,922.27, after briefly touching an all-time high.
In the bond market, the yield on benchmark 10-year US Treasury notes fell to 4.314pc from 4.346pc late on Monday.",b6e73450f7a8cb5d1e4ad75a8e0ec6db,trafilatura

Thread Bank’s new chief digital officer is focused on practical problem-solving by identifying business challenges and time-consuming processes that could be streamlined by artificial intelligence.
Marty Miracle, hired earlier this month, is Thread Bank’s first chief digital officer and he prefers a more centralized AI approach with a unified platform, rather than individual solutions.
“We don't want 30 different vendors doing 30 different AI things,” Miracle said. “If we can have a plan where we can have AI tailored to solve the business problems, we may be better off.” Thread Bank CEO Chris Black joined Miracle during the interview.
The Nashville, Tennessee-based community bank has roughly $797 million in assets and serves the Eastern part of the state.
The lender’s move to hire a digital chief aligns with its long-term goal to focus on strategic partnerships instead of maintaining “teams and teams of engineers” and building technology in-house, Black chimed in.
The lender partners with software providers, emphasizing implementing external capabilities in compliant and regulatory-appropriate ways and using partnerships to deliver banking products and services through various channels, Black noted.
Though this strategy reduces development complexities, it creates integration challenges that require coordination between internal teams and external partners, and demands strong data strategies and governance to maintain compliance, according to Black.
Miracle’s expertise in integrating different technology systems and components while implementing an effective data strategy and governance is crucial for the bank, Black pointed out.
“He's got a lot of embedded banking experience,” Black said. “These are all things that have been on our roadmap and in vision on the journey that we've been doing. But Marty's got an ability to help us pull them together and integrate more tightly.”
Thread Bank delivers embedded financial services, including deposits, lending, acquiring and payments.
The bank's first dedicated CDO position consolidates functions that were previously handled by separate roles, including the chief technology officer and chief information security officer, Black said. Miracle’s role will focus specifically on digital banking initiatives, embedded banking solutions, innovation leadership and bringing together previously fragmented digital strategies as the lender aims to scale.",7645edd52d204f0a2d2f45acb857d9af,trafilatura

Earlier this week, HUD and the U.S. Census Bureau again reported strong numbers for multifamily construction.
Starts for buildings with five or more units jumped 11.6% month over month in July and rose 27.4% year over year to a seasonally adjusted rate of 470,000. Multifamily developers finished an annualized 383,000 apartments in buildings with five or more units, a 28.8% YOY drop and a 2.8% month-over-month decline.
Overall housing starts came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 million in July — a 12.9% increase YOY and a 5.2% increase compared to the revised June estimate. Single-family home starts clocked in at a rate of 939,000 homes, a 7.8% YOY increase and a 2.8% month-over-month increase.
On the surface, the multifamily performance, which had the second-highest number of starts for any July in the past four decades, is much stronger than was expected at the beginning of the year.
“This follows the Census reporting that June 2025 multifamily starts were the fifth-highest for any June since 1990,” rental housing economist Jay Parsons wrote on LinkedIn.
But Parsons and other observers are skeptical. “The numbers don't make a lot of sense,” Jay Lybik, senior director of market research at Milwaukee-based apartment owner and manager Continental Properties, told Multifamily Dive.
Not matching the environment
Chris Nebenzahl, vice president of rental research at Irvine, California-based John Burns Research & Consulting, said his team has been monitoring the Census numbers over the past five months and has noticed an issue.
“The Census data doesn’t represent what we are seeing from our clients, third-party data providers that we subscribe to, or what our surveys are saying,” he said.
Nebenzahl said most of these sources indicate that multifamily starts are down 8% to 10% year over year. “Given the capital markets and uncertainty in the economy, I don’t believe there’s been an increase YOY in multifamily starts,” he said.
Ryan Davis, CEO of Dallas-based consulting firm Witten Advisors, told Multifamily Dive the 42,000 total multifamily starts in July were “laughable.”
“Equity for new development went on a pause after [President Donald Trump's tariffs were first enacted on] April 2, 2025, and given that the industry is influenced by these numbers, I suspect that pause will now continue into next year,” Davis said. “Add to that tariff-driven/uncertainty pause is the fact that very few deals can pencil.”",efd4f5fee8c88b5d82829a4ea3f5e9a8,trafilatura

Lowe's reported that same-store sales increased 1.1% in the second quarter, a return to growth after falling in the first three months of 2025. That compared to a 1.3% jump Wall Street expected.
""We had solid growth and performance with both Pro and DIY,"" CEO Marvin Ellison told Yahoo Finance over the phone.
Similar to its peer Home Depot (HD), Ellison said, ""Throughout the quarter, [Lowe's] comps got better, ending July with a positive 4.7%"" as it leaned into promotions. On Tuesday, Home Depot stock rose after the company said it saw a 3.3% same-store sales increase in July to exit its second quarter.
As it leans into professional services to boost sales, Lowe's also announced a deal Wednesday morning to acquire Foundation Building Materials for approximately $8.8 billion. This is on top of the recent acquisition of Artisan Design Group.
""When you combine FBM with our recent acquisition of ... ADG, it's going to give us the ability to give a large Pro customer a full complement of interior finishes, drywall to doors, insulation, ceiling systems, flooring, countertops, and cabinets,"" Ellison said.
The home improvement chain reported earnings per share in the second quarter of $4.33 on an adjusted basis, better than the $4.24 Wall Street had expected. Revenue came in at $23.96 billion; the Street had forecast revenue of $23.98 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
In the quarter, the average ticket increased 2.9%, but shoppers visited stores less often, with transactions down 1.8%.
Ellison said that signals consumers are still deferring larger, discretionary projects as customers are ""waiting for more confidence in the economy before they spend.""
""As an example ... getting a kitchen redesign in your home, getting your bathroom remodel, those are discretionary purchases. You can wait another six months. You can wait another year if need be.""
Notably, Lowe's raised its guidance for the 2025 fiscal year, with total sales now projected to be in a range of $84.5 billion-$85.5 billion, up from a prior range of $83.5 billion-$84.5 billion, while same-store sales are still expected to be flat to up 1% year over year.
As analysts have been banking on a turnaround in the housing market to reignite momentum, Ellison said, ""We're not planning for any type of inflection to happen in our guidance.""",f0e4fc45afa12adbb387b204c36a4e88,trafilatura

Two major trends haven't done the athleisurewear company any favors recently.
-
One worrying development from this is a significant erosion in top-line growth.
Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) stock has looked very drained and low-energy in recent months. The athletic apparel specialist's share price trades nearly 47% year to date, while the benchmark S&P 500 index is up by almost 10%.
It wasn't so long ago that Lululemon was a star in the always tough and highly competitive specialty clothing industry. A closer look at how it started falling from the sky, and whether it's got a chance at regaining altitude, will show the main reason for its drop.
Stiff headwinds
Basically, Lululemon has struggled to cope with two trends -- rising competition, and the end of the COVID-19 pandemic-era boom in exercise products, services, and apparel.
With the many closures and lock-ins of that age, people were often stuck for things to do. Two activities that could be conducted at home with relative safety were working out or doing yoga, hence the rise in demand for athleisurewear. This coincided with the rise of Lululemon as a brand; the company had clothes and accessories that not only looked good but were highly practical for such pursuits.
Excessive success leads to determined competition, and rivals inevitably piled into the space. At the same time, the company was maturing, a combination that slowed sales growth notably. From a 42% improvement in fiscal 2021, in the three subsequent years, growth withered to 30%, 19%, and finally 10% in 2024.
To its credit, Lululemon has been able to consistently land in positive territory on the bottom line. But investors are always hungry for meaningful revenue growth, and when that slows, they often bail.
One brand among many
To its credit, Lululemon has remained profitable, as it's continued to -- sensibly, in my view -- focus on that combination of product style, durability, and usefulness.
Yet with those determined competitors crowding its space, the company's wares aren't as distinctive as they used to be. Given that, I'd probably be hesitant to buy the stock for its growth potential until the company figures out how to better distinguish itself in the market again.

Indianapolis multifamily developer Milhaus is expanding the scope of its operations with a new acquisitions division led by a former employee, Greg McHenry, who is returning to the company as senior vice president of acquisitions.
In his new role, McHenry will both lead and build the new acquisitions division, expanding the company’s business model, focusing on strategic growth and capitalizing on market opportunities, according to the news release.
""After 15 years, we are excited to add acquisitions as a business line to grow our portfolio,"" said Tadd Miller, chief executive officer of Milhaus, in the release. ""We're thrilled to welcome Greg back to the Milhaus team in this pivotal leadership role … His comprehensive industry knowledge and proven track record will be instrumental as we harness our momentum to broaden our reach in both existing and new markets.""
McHenry, one of Milhaus’s first employees, joined the company as director of development in 2010, according to the release. He moved to Houston-based investment manager Hines in 2017 as a senior associate and later director, according to his LinkedIn page, where he led development and acquisition across the Midwest and Southeast.
With more than 15 years of experience in the real estate industry, McHenry has managed over $1.8 billion in multifamily, retail and office developments, according to the release.

Dive Brief:
-
The retail industry is full of AI adopters, and many are exploring agentic tools even as reliability concerns mount, according to a Monday.com survey of more than 1,800 retail leaders worldwide published Tuesday.
-
More than 3 in 5 leaders in the industry worry about the consistency and quality of generated outputs. Many retailers are also facing adoption roadblocks, such as privacy and data concerns, integration complexity, risk of alienating customers, high implementation costs and employee pushback.
-
Despite the obstacles, retail leaders are confident in the technology's long-term potential. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said businesses that fail to adopt AI agents in the next two years risk falling behind. More than half of retailers expect most customer interactions will be handled by AI within five years.
Dive Insight:
Retailers have upped their AI investments this year as economic pressures push business leaders to optimize costs and streamline operations. Retail companies are bracing for slower growth rates for the rest of the year, and many see AI as a lever to mitigate headwinds and improve experiences.
Under Armour touted the benefits of its AI efforts earlier this month during the retailer’s Q1 2026 earnings call.
“AI is becoming more integrated across the business, enhancing design, planning and forecasting,” said Kevin Plank, founder, president and CEO at Under Armour.
To improve operations, the company is moving from siloed functions to collaborative teams with shared KPIs and real-time data, according to Plank.
“After two years of data and platform development, we have over 80 automations that are streamlining workflows, reducing time to market and improving execution from predictive pricing to real-time inventory management,” Plank said.
Under Armour is in the midst of a restructuring in response to significant revenue declines. The company reported a 10% revenue decline and a $305 million net loss.
Advance Auto Parts is also turning to technology to address lackluster performance. While the company lowered its outlook for the year and reported mixed results during a Q2 2025 earnings call, executives highlighted technology’s role in advancing goals around the store experience, such as in its deployment of a new assortment management framework.
“We have been able to accelerate this rollout by harnessing advanced technological tools, including the use of AI,” Shane O’Kelly, president, CEO and director at the retailer, said during last week’s call. “These innovative tools are enabling us to introduce greater intelligence in the assortment planning process, which has traditionally been done manually.”",1cde75879b280082469042ae9624a204,trafilatura

SoundHound AI extended its losing streak to a third consecutive day on Tuesday, shedding 10.26 percent to close at $13.30 apiece as investors appeared to have taken profits amid the past few weeks’ surge that has already seen the company grow as much as 69 percent month-to-date.

From its closing price of $10.11 last August 1, share prices of SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) have already gone up to $17.08, with the recent selling sparking a sell-off to cash in on gains.
The recent rally can be attributed to the company’s strong revenue performance in the second quarter of the year, with revenues expanding by 217 percent to $42.68 million from only $13.46 million in the same period last year.
Despite the figures, SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) remained at a GAAP net loss of $74.7 million, double the $37.3 million registered in the same period a year earlier.
Following the strong revenue performance, SoundHound AI, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOUN) raised its full-year revenue outlook to a range of $160 million to $178 million, versus the $157 million to $177 million expected previously.
While we acknowledge the potential of SOUN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Coffee Prices Just Hit 2-Month Highs. How Much Higher Can They Go Here?
On Monday, sugar prices fell to a 1-week low on the outlook for Brazil's sugar mills to increase production. Covrig Analytics reported Monday that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.
NY sugar rallied to a 2-month high last Tuesday on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil. Last Friday, Unica reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of July fell by -0.8% y/y to 3,614 MT, and the 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through July fell -7.8% y/y to 19,268 MT. However, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of July increased to 54.10% from 50.32% the same time last year. Also, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said last month that 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.
The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Monday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 611.2 mm as of August 18, or 1% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.
The outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).",f3d462e204ebe5864d237e7ab8449bb0,trafilatura

Dive Brief:

Cybersecurity startup Horizon3.ai announced Tuesday that it appointed Holly Grey as its CFO as the company seeks to grow its business, which autonomously tests corporate networks, data, email and other systems in order to find and manage areas vulnerable to cyberattacks and ransomware breaches.
-
The San Francisco, California-based company’s co-founder and CEO Snehal Antani cited Grey’s experience in the cybersecurity field, calling her a “proven operator” whose leadership will be critical as “we expand globally and cement our position as a leader in offensive security.”
-
The appointment comes two months after the company announced it completed a $100 million Series D funding round led by the Menlo Park, California-based private equity firm NEA with participation from SignalFire, Craft Ventures and 9Yards Capital. The round marks NEA’s second major cybersecurity startup round in less than a month, according to TechCrunch.
Dive Insight:.
The company’s plan to scale comes as cybersecurity budgets grew just 4% in 2025 on average, down from 8% in the previous year, with the belt tightening likely due to concerns about economic uncertainty that looms despite companies identifying cyber as a top five business risk, CFO Dive previously reported.
Grey has more than three decades of experience in public company operations, compliance, and strategic finance, according to the company press release. She has followed a traditional CFO track, obtaining her Bachelor’s in accounting from Boston College and starting her career as a manager at the public accounting firm Arthur Andersen.
Most recently, Grey served as CFO of the cybersecurity firm Exabeam, helping to position it for acquisition by Thoma Bravo, according to the release. In July 2024, Exabeam merged with Bravo's portfolio company LogRhythm to become a pure-play security operations firm, according to a release from that time. Prior to that time, Grey worked as SVP and VP of Finance for ForeScout Technologies, a firm in the Enterprise of Things space, where she built its financial operations and helped with its IPO in 2017.
Horizon3. ai which says its autonomous penetration testing, or “pentesting,” enables companies to see themselves through the “eyes of the attacker,” was founded in 2019.
“Horizon3.ai is redefining what it means to secure an organization by proving what’s actually exploitable, not just what’s theoretically vulnerable,” Grey said in a statement in the release. “I’m excited to help operationalize and scale this success as we enter the next phase of global expansion.”",f2fb3630578a8a7c94903387c5df7cec,trafilatura

The indicator is a widely used technical measure that smooths out price data over roughly nine months of trading, helping investors identify long-term trends. When a stock trades above its 200-DMA, it is generally seen as being in an uptrend, while trading below it may signal potential weakness or a shift in momentum. Because of its role as a key support or resistance level, the 200-DMA is closely watched by both traders and long-term investors.
In recent years, the 200-DMA has been a notable level of support for MSTR.
For instance, in April 2025, during the so-called “Trump tariff tantrum,” the stock tested this level before rebounding. A similar pattern emerged during the summer of 2024, when MSTR once again found a floor around the 200-DMA before resuming its upward trajectory.
Whether the current dip below this technical threshold proves temporary or signals a more sustained downturn will likely depend on both bitcoin’s price action and broader market sentiment.
Chanos notches a win
Famed short-seller James Chanos has been publicly bearish on Strategy for a number of weeks, saying he's opened up a sizable bet against the Michael Saylor-led company by shorting MSTR against a long in bitcoin.
Of late, the trade has been looking like a winner, with MSTR lower by 21% over the past month compared to bitcoin's very modest 3.5% decline.
Market technician J.C. Parets noted on Wednesday that the ratio between MSTR and IBIT (BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF) has now fallen to a five-month low. ""This one is accelerating quickly,"" said Parets.",e87ee8ae8f59f138f0caeb6ad0296d47,trafilatura

Vending machines are an integral part of the Exchange’s retail footprint, according to Master Sgt. Caleb Barrieau, because they allow personnel access outside of traditional retail hours. The Exchange has also deployed vending machines stocked with personal care items such as toothpaste, shampoo, body wash and lotion, installed in remote locations, to support military personnel deployed in remote areas of European bases.
In addition to traditional food, beverage and sundry items, the Exchange has deployed vending machines to offer road safety items at vehicle registration centers across Europe, including at Kapaun, Grafenwoehr and Wiesbaden. Personnel can purchase safety gear to satisfy vehicle inspection requirements quickly.
The Exchange has also deployed several automated self-service stores across Europe. The first is located in the Grafenwoehr training area in Germany, and other locations include Sembach Kaserne, Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, and the Ramstein Air Base Pax Terminal.
“By enhancing our vending services, we’re ensuring that service members have access to the essentials they need whenever they need them,” said Col. Everett (Bud) Lacroix, commander for Exchange Europe, Southwest Asia and Africa. “It’s all about making their lives easier and more convenient.”
Earlier this month, the Navy Exchange Service Command opened its 100th micro market in Georgia, demonstrating that at military installations around the world, the Department of Defense relies on convenience services and unattended retail technologies to serve U.S. troops effectively.",e19ec26bc1eff9d7d7a50db72c48bc88,trafilatura

Over the past year, major exchanges, including Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, Cboe (in the U.S.) and the London Stock Exchange have all announced plans to extend the equity trading hours toward 24 hours a day. Clearing and settlement (DTCC) and the Consolidated Tape (SIP) will also need to be upgraded.
Today we’re going to look at what research says about how overnight trading works now. The data points might help us work out how 24-hour trading should work.
Not a lot of data on extended-hours trading
One problem with understanding how extended-hours trading works is there is not a lot of data on it.
To start, extended-hours trading accounts for about 11% of total daily volume. As the volume curves in Chart 1 show, most of extended-hours trading occurs in the hours right before and after regular hours trading. Overnight trading (8 p.m. to 4 a.m.) accounts for only 0.2% of the total equity market volume.
Chart 1: Volumes across the 24-hour day, and the proportion of on and off-exchange
We already talked about what is the best time to actually “end the day,” based on the fact that some Asian markets open before midnight in the U.S. Chart 1 shows that that not only is there (a lot) less liquidity after hours, but a lot of it is also traded in off-exchange trading – although there is still on-exchange trading when exchanges are open (from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m.).
Why do we care about extended-hours trading?
Importantly, the rules of trading are also different. There is no NBBO and no OPR (order protection rule). That means “trade-throughs,” or fills at worse prices than exchange prices, are allowed and there is no 605 reporting to account for how much trade-throughs cost investors.
Market volatility trading bands (like LULD and Market-Wide Circuit Breakers) are also not available to protect investors. In fact, the SIP isn’t even open from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m., making it impossible to report trades during those times.
Looking at the research that has been done
Recently, a number of research papers have been done by academics, looking at overnight and extended-hours trading. Today, we focus on what those academics have found.
The academics consistently suggest that overnight trading is primarily used by retail investors, and they pay much higher trading costs overnight. Many studies indicate that retail investors still need help guaranteeing low execution costs and good trade prices, especially when exchanges don’t provide competitive quotes to protect the market.
1. Most overnight volume comes from retail investors in the Asian region
We know that earnings, and some economic data, are typically announced just outside of regular market hours. That news creates some additional trading, most likely from professional investors. That’s consistent with a 2003 paper by Barclay and Hendershott. It also likely explains the elevated trading near the open and the close in Chart 1, but not the trading after most in the U.S. have gone to sleep.
A recent study suggests that the trading while the SIP is closed (8 p.m. to 4 a.m.), also sometimes called overnight trading, is dominated by retail investors. The study’s data source suggests that 80% of the volume comes from the Asian-Pacific region, with around half of that originating in Korea. The rest — just 20% — primarily comes from U.S. retail investors.
Chart 2: Makeup of overnight trading participants
2. Market quality is notably worse when exchanges are not quoting
We have shown in the past how the use of rebates to incentivize competitive NBBO quotes helps narrow the spread during regular trading hours.
However, overnight trading operates fundamentally differently from regular hour trading. Currently, no exchanges operate overnight. Instead, trading occurs off-exchange (as Chart 1 shows). With less exchange trading and less competition for lit quotes, we see that spreads widen after-hours.
The research from the recent study shows that stocks that:
- Trade overnight every day: Only 393 stocks traded every day during their sample period. For those:
- The quoted spread was around 40% higher during overnight.
- The depth was only 47% of the regular hours.
- Stocks trade overnight: Only 3,026 stocks traded at all during their sample period.
- The quoted spread on was around 144% higher during overnight.
- Interestingly, on average for all stocks, depth is comparable to that during regular hours.
Chart 3a: Depth and spreads are worse overnight
With overnight spread wider and depth lower, most traders would expect trading costs to be higher. In fact, that’s exactly what this study found. Effective spreads on retail orders were around 3 times the size of those executed during regular hours, and price impact was around 6 times larger.
Chart 3b: Overnight trading cost is much higher
3. Lack of OPR and 605 might add to overnight execution costs
Another paper by Hendershott and Barclay (2003) shows that extended-hour trading (4 p.m. – 9:30 a.m.) cost is 4-5 times larger than regular hours. That compares to the Werner, Eaton and Shkilko (2025) paper above which found that overnight trading (8 p.m. - 4 a.m.) was 3-6 times.
Interestingly, the study by Werner also found the majority of overnight executions happen at or worse than the best quoted price – and there are almost no orders with price improvement.
Chart 4: Overnight orders “trade through” exchange quotes
4. Liquidity providers maximize spread capture – adding cost to retail orders
During the day, the combination of the Order Protection Rule (OPR), Execution Quality (605) reports and competition help to protect retail investors. During extended hours, none is in force.
Sometimes, in order to protect retail customers from their market orders trading through a thin market, and increasing their execution costs, orders are automatically converted to limit orders.
A study out of the University of Cincinnati noticed that, between 2018 and 2022, this practice may have actually increased retail trading costs. The data shows executions “clustered” close to the 5% limit (Chart 4) during extended hours. Then, as soon as the practice stopped (at 6 p.m.) the effective spreads reported no longer clustered right below 5%.
The academics argued that this indicated that sophisticated traders adapted their algorithms to maximize spread capture from this automatic collaring.
Chart 5: Sophisticated investors profit from retail investors
Some studies suggest shorter hours might improve market quality
Not all studies suggest longer hours are better.
Another study looked at European trading. It suggested that their “longer” trading day (typically 8.5 hours compared to 6.5 hours in the U.S.) might actually be harming market quality and adding to execution costs.
They use the times when the U.S. and Europe daylight savings changes create a stronger overlap of hours. They show that European markets have better spreads and depth when the markets overlap. In short, the authors argue that shortening the European day (specifically opening closer to U.S. hours) would concentrate liquidity better in the European opening and improve the market quality.
Investor protection, and rewarding lit quotes, is still important
Perhaps what these studies show best of all is the value that exchanges and lit quotes provide to the market. Sure, with less liquidity after hours, spreads are likely to be wider. But this data shows that trading at times when there is no OPR, NBBO or 605 requirements might also make some retail trading costs unnecessarily higher.
This, in turn, shows the importance of having competitive lit quotes. Although as the European study also shows, getting market makers to compete over a longer timeframe might also be a challenge.

Extended Hours Trading
There are also pre-market and after hours trading sessions available, also known as Extended Markets.
For Nasdaq, pre-market trading hours are 4:00 am to 9:30 am, Eastern Time Zone. After hours runs from 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm, Eastern Time Zone. Certain brokers have different pre-market and after hours trading times.
Some online brokers do allow you to trade during those hours; check with your broker to see if you're eligible to make those kinds of trades. Know that Extended Markets carry risks. The volatility tends to be much higher, and there is less liquidity, meaning that fewer people are trading and that prices tend to move much more dramatically.
