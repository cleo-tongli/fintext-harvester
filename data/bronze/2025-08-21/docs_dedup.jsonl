Throughout the second quarter and the summer season, we delivered a diverse lineup of content, the current leadership in total drama viewership market share according to Enlightened. Our robust offerings were highlighted by three original blockbuster dramas that generated IG popularity index scores of over 10,000, namely Field, Bingjianxian, Coroner's Theory, Caoxilu, and the Thriving Land, Shiwanwu. Among them, Field and the Coroner's Diary resonated especially well with female viewers, while the Thriving Land captured the hearts of audiences of all ages and genders. These blockbusters further solidified our dominance in both the female and realistic genres. The performance of our variety shows was equally impressive.\nIn the summer season, iQIYI accounted for four of the top five spots in our Enlightened total viewership list. The highly anticipated return of our flagship IP, The King of Stand Up Comedy Season two, and the season and the wrap of China 2025, Xinhua Chang, generated impressive viewership with The King of Stand Up Comedy Season two commanding the industry's highest viewership market share in its category in the summer. The strong performance of our premium content drove our key operating metrics in the summer, reflecting our commitment to delivering high-quality, diverse stories while continuing the user experience across our platform.\nBuilding on the strong momentum of our content ecosystem, we are proactively exploring new opportunities to foster sustainable long-term value creation and achieve meaningful progress in our experience business and overseas business. Let me begin with our experience business. We are focusing on two key areas: IP-based consumer products and offline experiences. We are leveraging our extensive and unique IP collection to enhance our competitive edge and tap into the booming IP merchandising market. In the first half of the year, our self-operated live table trading cards achieved over RMB100 million in GMV with popular IPs such as lobbying prevailing, Huai Ruuding field setting new sales records.\nWe will also bring our IPs to offline experiences like IT land and immersive centers following an asset-light strategy. Currently, two IT labs in Yongzhou and Kaibong are in development, while over 50 immersive shelters are already operating in around 30 cities nationwide. Our business outside Mainland China continues to show strong growth momentum. In the second quarter, both subscriber base and revenue from the membership services reached record highs. We have now established four major operating regions: Southeast Asia, North America, Japan and Korea, and The Middle East and North Africa. We have meaningfully enhanced our brand influence and expanded our global recognition by combining premium C-pop content with targeted localized operations, unlocking exciting opportunities for further growth.\nNow let's dive into the details of our business performance in Q2, starting with content, which serves as a foundation of our business. We maintained our leadership of the core long-form drama category, securing the top spot in total viewership market share for four consecutive quarters according to Enlightened data. Our performance in the second quarter was driven by our diverse content offering highlighted by an enhanced lineup of female-oriented dramas. Notably, Field achieved an IT popularity index score of over 10,000, topping the Enlightened list. Our original series Demon Hunter's Romance, Wiltu, is an in-house production that achieved a peak IGA popularity index score of over 9,800 thanks to its perfect blend of traditional Chinese tales and arts.\nOther standout titles include Dream with a Dream, Wishing a Dream, Shuju and Yemeng, and the lobbying pavilion from our Roma theme heartbeat shelter, Ganjingqiu Chang, which scored over 9,600 and 8,900 for popularity index respectively. We also broadened our appeal with multiple suspense and realistic scenarios including The Secret Path, Jamie Zhao Leong, and two dramas from our suspense shelter, Breaking the Shadow, and Life for Life. The Secret Path and Breaking the Shadow were especially well received by large screen viewers, ranking among the top five most-watched titles on TVs. Our premium content has won high recognition from the industry.\nIn the latest Magnolia Award, one of the most prestigious honors of Chinese dramas, 13 titles produced by or broadcasted on iQIYI received an impressive total of 29 nominations with four titles winning a combined eight awards. Notably, our original drama To the Wonder With Other Time from our microcosm shelter, Mission Yucha, received the highest honor, the Best TV Series Award, along with the International Communication Award and Best Cinematography Award. Additionally, City of the City, Chengdu Cheong, won the special award and We Are Criminal Police, Xinjiang, received both the Grand Prix and the Best Original Screenplay Award. Moving on to micro dramas, a valuable complement to our content ecosystem.\nMore people are tuning into iQIYI to watch micro dramas. In the second quarter, gross average daily viewing time and unique visitors have shown double-digit sequential growth. Our library boasts a diverse collection of about 15,000 titles forming a strong portfolio of micro dramas. Since the second quarter, we have shifted our strategy focus on consistently delivering premium micro dramas through original production and licensing, aiming to drive user growth and accelerate revenue expansion. Our internal data indicates that premium micro dramas can consistently outperform across key metrics, including subscriber conversion, viewing time, user engagement, and retention. Developing premium content is our core strength.\nBuilt upon years of experience in producing long-term video blockbusters, our expertise in content production and advanced technology can be seen as applied to premium micro dramas. Additionally, our extensive IP collection provides us with a unique resource for success in IP adaptation. In Q2, we made great strides with original micro dramas and launched multiple titles that performed exceptionally well with audiences, including In Is Capable, A Scrouching Love, How Dare You, Chong Le Kitong, and For My Dearest Xiaocheng Zhu.\nNotably, How Dare You, our first IP-adapted micro drama, hit a new milestone by reaching a peak iQIYI popularity index score of 5,500, a historical high for our platform, and even outperformed the licensed hit My Sweet Home in both average daily unique visitors and revenue from new subscriptions in the first week of release. Its success extended beyond numbers, broadening the typical micro drama audience and attracting a younger and more diverse demographic. It's a great example of how we are successfully developing IP across multiple formats. The strong reception of this micro drama drove reservations for the long-form generation and the second season of the animation based on the same IP.\nIt also increased rewatch of the animation's first season, showing the power of strategic IP development to drive engagement across formats. Turning to movies, we have dominated this category in viewership market share for fourteen consecutive quarters according to Enlightened data. In the second quarter, we launched over 10 major titles catering to a diverse range of audiences with a variety of genres, including crime, female realistic, martial arts, comedy, and action. Standout titles included the licensed movie Detective Chinatown 1900 and the original movie The Only Way in Chinese New. We have been actively innovating our movie business model to drive long-term industry growth.\nThis quarter, we were the first in the industry to use the revenue-sharing model typically seen with online films for newly released theatrical movies. This approach includes revenue potential for titles with limited box office performance. A great example is our pilot project Trapped Daften Shop, which generated over RMB28 million in revenue-sharing income on our platform, the highest for any movie title this year. Remarkably, this amount even surpassed its box office revenue share, showcasing the potential of this model to amplify returns. For variety shows, our focus on delivering top titles has yielded great results.\nAccording to Enlightened data, iQIYI released five S-plus rated variety shows in the first half of the year, the highest among all long-form video platforms, with four of them being original productions. Our flagship IP, Five Plus Season five, made a strong comeback with a record-high IT popularity score, surpassing member revenue expansion and its current status as a nationally renowned IP. Additionally, the competition formats in the latest season of the wrap of China 2025 strongly connected with the audience, driving the popularity index score to over 9,500 and setting a new record for the show. For animations, we continue to improve our original production capabilities.\nRevenue from Over the Divide Reals, Shenguochesha, has consistently ranked as our top-performing Chinese animation during the same period on our platform. Moving on to our content strategy and pipeline. For long-form dramas, we focus on crafting top-notch premium stories that balance high commercial value with innovation and artistic excellence. At the same time, we are committed to delivering a steady, diverse slate of content that resonates with our broad audience to elevate engagement. We are also reducing episode counts for a tighter, more compelling viewer experience. For the summer season, we introduced female-oriented key titles such as Corona's Diary and The Wanted Detective Improvoke.\nAmong them, Corona's Story stood out as another in-house produced original that delivered exceptional performance, surpassing the IT Popularity Index score of 10,000. Its attractive growth generated a strong word-of-mouth buzz, further cementing its success. In addition, we also prepared a variety of new titles and our drama shelter brands, notably the Thriving Land, a realistic theme drama from our masterpiece shelter, Zaja Quchang, which exceeded our IGA popularity index score of 10,000 within just four days of its release, driven by its compelling storyline that resonated with a broad audience. Its popularity also extended beyond our platform, topping both the industry's Enlightened data and traditional TV station charts.\nOther highlights from our suspense filter include Justifiable Defense and That App Shuyunbigu. In our upcoming fourth quarter, we are excited about our lineup of anticipated titles, including 8,000 Miles of Clouds and More, Legend of the Magnet, Born with Luck, Fox's Spirits, Matchmaker, Swallow and Beloved, A Strange Tale of Tang Dynasty, and Speed and Last Runway. For micro dramas, we are focused on premium titles. We released two to three premium titles each week during the summer season, including Sorbet of the Ruoxigua, Moment of Romance, The Wars, Revenge, Story of Zhao Yue, Zhao Yue Fei, and others. Shifting to movies, we are aiming to build a vibrant ecosystem for original production with three key projects.\nFirst, our blockbuster project, where we team up with top filmmakers to deliver standout theatrical hits. Second, the Sleeper Hit Projects for Tianjinhua, where we partnered with rising directors to create bold, so article films that blend commercial appeal with fresh ideas. And third, the emerging film projects, is an innovative collaborative approach for original online movies and a minimum guarantee and a revenue-sharing model designed to spark creativity. Looking ahead, our original production pipeline features several titles for theatrical release, including crime, action movie, The Shadow's Edge, action comedy, Enough is Enough Get Now Measure, The Shadow's Edge and Buffon Zhui, and The Skin Pinot.\nNotably, The Shadow's Edge, Buffon Zhui recently premiered in shelters, achieving an impressive initial box office of over RMB300 million within just five days. For online original productions, we launched Ultimate Mission and Never a Safe QiDong with upcoming titles such as Heroes of War Cable, Replacement, Wiguo, Wings of Dread, WeiQi, Wanmi, Weiqi, and others. Additionally, we have enriched our lineup by bringing licensed theatrical movies to our platform as the second window, such as Mega Heat Neutra two and highly anticipated upcoming titles like Amalice, She's Got No Name, Jiangyuanong, and Li Qingro, Chang Li Zhi.\nNotably, Ne Zhi too has extended its success from to the online domain, becoming the first movie to exceed our popularity index score of 10,000 on our platform. For variety shows, we are committed to delivering top-tier content, enhancing the value of our multiple-season IPs. In the summer season, our eagerly awaited show, The Drag of China 2025, and the team of Santa Comedy Season two made a strong return. In addition, our new observation-related show, Her Prime, Zhejiang Jia, resonated positively with audiences entering the fourth quarter.\nWe are thrilled to bring forth new seasons of our acclaimed IP, such as the Blooming Journey Season two, Yoruba Park, and High Young Summer Season, along with the company of 18 new IP from Get Together. For animations, we are committed to elevating our original projects. Key original animations launched during summer include Over the Divine Realms, Shengbo Zishan, Embers, Yujin, Xingzhou, Demons Accession, Mo Yinji. Our highly acclaimed original production Love Between Fairy and Devil, Challenge, has returned with a second season in July and received positive feedback.\nFor children's content, we are dedicated to turning beloved IP into a fully immersive ecosystem, delivering experiences that grow with families and offer something special for every stage of the parent-child journey. For the second half of the year, we will launch a number of key original productions, including a new season of our classical IP Girl Squad Season four and a brand new IP, Carmen and Birds for the track. Moving on to membership services, we are focused on building a membership experience that connects with our broad audience, powered by a vibrant content ecosystem and the best-in-class services. By constantly enhancing the ads and variety of what we offer, we are delivering even more value to our members.\nOne notable highlight is our family-oriented ice diamond plan, which integrates an Express package that grants early access to show finals as part of its exclusive privilege. This approach has proven to be a key catalyst in driving new subscriptions and upgrades to the premium channel. In Q4, 78% of new Star Diamond subscription revenues come from upgrades. Additionally, our ad-supported basic membership plan provided an attractive option for price-sensitive viewers to further enhance the member experience. We have launched over 10 bundled membership plans to foster a stronger connection within the member community and support revenue growth. Looking ahead, we are focused on expanding these bundled membership initiatives to reach even more audiences.\nWe also made meaningful strides in improving perceived membership value. A highlight of the quarter is our country's experience programs. This program enables content lovers, brand advertisers, and more to get virtual seats, essentially granting membership access for binge-watching content. This feature has driven higher engagement and amplified the popularity of key titles on our platform. So far in 2025, seed purchases have already tripled the total from 2024, with show lovers accounting for the majority. Beyond that, we made membership even more rewarding this quarter by allowing members to gift the express package to friends and launching a dedicated channel for members to redeem points for projects.\nOn top of that, we hosted 12 VIP-only events, including fun meetups, advanced screenings, and live variety show recordings. Moving on to the advertising business. In the second quarter, brand ads benefited from enhanced premium variety shows offering and seasonality. Our flagship content continued to be highly attractive to advertisers during the first half of the year. Our premium market shows led the industry in both the total and average number of advertisers attracted in Q2. Other revenue from key advertisers delivered double-digit growth annually and sequentially. Notably, several key industries are showing positive recovery trends, with food and beverage and communication services achieving double-digit annual and sequential growth in Q2.\nLooking ahead, we will sharpen our focus on maximizing ad sales from premium variety shows, dramas, and our drama sales rep brands. We see exciting potential in multiple-season variety shows. For example, ad revenue from the King of Thunder, our comedy season two, doubled compared to its first season. Additionally, we are capitalizing on new budgets for micro and short dramas, micro shows, and customized programs. Early sales of micro shows are encouraging, opening new marketing opportunities. We have also introduced product placements within micro dramas and are preparing to launch dedicated ad products for our micro drama shelter. Additionally, we are boosting monetization on smart TVs and expanding ad inventory with innovative formats.\nFor performance ads, strengthening relationships with existing clients while capturing budgets from high-growth sectors is our focus. In Internet services, we expanded our advertiser base by bringing in new partners for e-commerce. We utilized programmatic advertising to maximize opportunities during the June 18 shopping festival. In the education sector, we expanded our advertiser base to include wellness management services and other industries, driving year-over-year doubling in revenue. Moving forward, we will harness AI to optimize both advertising materials and placement strategies, unlocking even greater budget opportunities. In fact, AI-powered video ads saw a 20% increase in click-through rates compared to those created without AI.\nMoving on to technology and products, we are committed to harnessing AI to transform entertainment experiences, amplifying content value, and enhancing user engagement. In the second quarter, we introduced the industry's first AI-powered iJump Talkout feature, redefining viewer engagement with long-form video by offering faster-paced micro drama-like experiences. With a simple swipe up or down on a mobile phone, users can effortlessly skip between key plots without missing any captivating moments. This feature is now available for over 2,300 dramas and variety shows on our main iQIYI mobile app and has quickly become a popular feature for binge-watching and rewatching favorite shows, clearly boosting user engagement.\nAnother pioneering example is Touhou World, launched in early 2024 as an industry-first AI agent-based NPC data platform, realizing our vision of AI-powered human-machine interaction. Featuring over 102,000 NPC agents from our most popular content, it engaged fans 24\/7 in new and exciting ways. As I know, it's total an AI agent acting as a personal assistant offering support like video search, recommendation, and cloud insights. These innovations are transforming fan engagement and creating new value for our content. Beyond that, we harness AI to upgrade content production. A good example is our application of AI to streamline digital asset production.\nOn the set of The Great Nobody two, Dao Wanbei Huang Zhao, AI boosted the efficiency of digital asset generation by over 10 fold, cutting costs and shortening production time. For the pre-production for romance dramas, we achieved a breakthrough in qualitative script analysis, now supporting in-depth evaluation of the leading characters, dramatic relationships, and interactions. In addition to that, AI also helps in identifying unneeded plans. Moving on to our business performance in reaching outside of Mainland China. Overseas business continues its strong growth momentum with membership revenue and membership scale expanding for eight consecutive quarters.\nIn Q2, membership revenue grew by around 35% annually, driven by standout performances in markets like Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and the five Spanish-speaking regions, all reporting annual growth over 80%. Average daily subscribers reached an all-time high during the quarter. The outstanding performance is anchored in our exceptional content lineup, especially as C-drama popularity continues to grow globally. The original C-drama Field topped popularity charts in 15 overseas markets on premiere day. The winner Nimis doubled version of our dream, missing our dream set a new record for the highest daily revenue in its language segment on release day.\nCorona's Diary achieved the highest popularity ranking in 13 overseas markets and led Google Trends in five markets within its first week, expanding its domestic success internationally. On top of the long-form video, we have been expanding our offering by introducing micro dramas overseas since March and have gained strong momentum. Membership revenue attributed to micro dramas surged month by month during the second quarter. By June, micro dramas ranked as the second largest category attracting new subscriptions in Indonesia, Korea, and Brazil. Our original micro drama In Is Capable Squelching Love gathered widespread international acclaim, expanding the reach and influence of our micro dramas beyond the domestic market.\nBuilding on the initial success, we plan to ramp up original micro drama production overseas in the second half of the year. Expanding beyond content, we continue to amplify the global influence of C-pop through offline marketing events such as fan meetings and media conferences that spotlight Chinese celebrities. In the second quarter alone, we hosted three events that drew widespread engagement from users, media partners, and advertisers. Looking ahead, we are gearing up to scale these events internationally, further driving the reach of Chinese content globally. In summary, we are committed to building a beloved national brand and strengthening our market leadership with exceptional user experiences and a wide brand company ecosystem.\nAt the same time, we are focusing on innovation and investing in key growth areas such as AI applications, micro dramas, experience business, and global expansion, all with the goal of driving sustainable long-term success.\nJun Wang: Thanks, Mr. Gong, and hello, everyone. Let me walk you through the key numbers for the second quarter. In the second quarter, the total revenues were RMB6.6 billion. The membership services revenue reached RMB4.1 billion, down 9% annually, primarily due to our lighter content slate compared to the same period last year. The online advertising revenue was $300 million, decreased by 13% annually. During the quarter, some advertisers adjusted their advertising and promotion strategies in response to macro pressures. The accounts and distribution revenue reached RMB436.6 million, down 37% annually, primarily due to the decrease in other transactions. Other revenues increased by 6% annually to RMB829.3 million. Moving on to costs and expenses.\nWe have maintained a disciplined cost and expense management. The accounting cost was RMB3.8 billion, representing a saving of 8% annually, primarily due to a lighter accounted slate in the quarter. And the total operating expenses were RMB1.4 billion, representing a saving of 3% annually. Turning to profits and cash flows. The non-GAAP operating income was RMB58.7 million. The non-GAAP operating income margin was 1%. As of the end of the second quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, and long-term restricted cash included in prepayment and other assets, totaling RMB5.1 billion. In addition, the company had a loan of US$522.5 million to PAG recorded under amount due from rogue parties.\nWe continue to improve our capital structure. In the second quarter, we repurchased a total principal amount of US$85 million of the 2028 notes for cash, and the outstanding principal balance remaining for the 2028 notes is $208 million as of the end of the second quarter. As we continue to optimize our debt structure, our net interest expense decreased by 33% compared to the same period last year. For detailed financial data, please refer to our press release on our IR website. Now we will open the floor for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Your first question comes from Maggie Yeh with CLSA.\nMaggie Yeh: Regarding the recent change of policy in China's long-form video industry, could management share with us your thoughts on the potential impact to the company? Thank you.\nOperator: I'll invite our Chief Content Officer, Xiaobui Wang, to take this question. The introduction of the new policies represents a significant positive development for the overall long-form video industry, which we and the entire industry welcome and fully support. These policies bring benefits across multiple aspects. First, the time cycle from content production and review to broadcast can be effectively shortened, allowing content to reach audiences more quickly. This not only improves scheduling stability but also ensures that the content aligns more closely with current social sentiment and resonates with the audience. Additionally, it also enhances the efficiency of the company's capital utilization. Second, these policies enhance the flexibility of content creation, providing creators with greater creative freedom.\nThis, in turn, can significantly boost the content appeal and promote greater content diversity. Third, the policies could strengthen the synergy between online video platforms and traditional TV networks. More content can benefit from simultaneous online and linear TV broadcasting, expanding distribution channels for quality production, stabilizing content distribution prices, and enhancing the reach and influence of content. This is beneficial for both online video platforms and traditional broadcasters. Last but not least, after the release of these new policies, it is sending a strong signal, and that signal can attract more talent and capital into the content production, driving the healthy and vigorous development of the entire industry. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Zhiking Zhang with CICC.\nZhiking Zhang: Thanks, management, for taking my question. You mentioned a great number of hit dramas and variety shows during the summer seasons in your prepared remarks. We have also noticed that recently, Austin Stone has achieved the ICT popularity index of over 10% and received excellent reviews. Could the management provide an overview of the content performance this summer? Additionally, considering the impact of the new regulations, what's your future content strategy? Thank you.\nOperator: The CEO is taking the first part of the question. He is commenting on the new policies. After the release of the policies, I think from the company standpoint, we will promote innovation in different aspects of content production. For example, seasoned multi-season content and also different formats of innovative dramas can be produced in the future. And then next, we'll invite our Chief Content Officer, Xiaobui Wang, to take the rest. During this year's summer season from June to August, we delivered outstanding performances across drama, variety shows, film, and micro dramas. Three of our original drama blockbusters, namely Field, Coroner's Diary, and Describing Lines, all achieved ITE popularity index scores of over 10,000.\nFor micro drama, How Dare You hit a new milestone for ITE Popularity Index score. And for variety shows, returning flagship titles such as The King of Stand Up Comedy Season two and The Wrap of China 2025 led the market. Last but not least, on the film front, the theatrical release, The Shadow's Edge recently surpassed RMB300 million in box office revenue, and the third-party market forecast predicted total box office revenues to exceed RMB1 billion. All of these once again demonstrate the audience's strong affection for premium content that further demonstrated our strength in producing popular tier content.\nIn the future, benefiting from the new policies for the industry, we aim to strengthen our content strategies across different categories. For the long-form dramas, we will continue to focus on premium productions with high commercial value. And like CEO Lu Gong mentioned earlier, not only will we focus on innovations for long-form video dramas, but we will also improve our innovations for short dramas as well. For long-form video dramas, we will leverage our five major drama theaters to comprehensively cover key content genres such as suspense, romance, realistic, and comedy. For the production side, we'll focus on creating innovative contemporary storylines with tighter pacing and greater viewer appeal.\nIn terms of content promotion, we'll place a stronger emphasis on creativity, buzzworthiness, and emotional resonance, adopting strategies that better engage younger audiences. For micro drama, our approach for premium quality production is expected to attract more users who previously did not watch micro dramas to the content genre. We'll continue to apply our long-form drama development expertise, expand collaborations with top creators, and produce more flagship titles while exploring serialized formats. On the monetization side, beyond our existing membership and free models, we will actively explore opportunities such as content distribution, branded content integration, and IT merchandising development. Beyond dramas, we're also striving for breakthroughs across different other categories.\nFor variety shows, our focus remains on the flagship multi-season IPs, while continuing to explore innovative content formats. For films, we're working on a comprehensive framework to strengthen our original film projects through our three strategic initiatives, namely blockbuster project, Sleeper hit project, and an immersion film project. These efforts will expand our market share in online video online movie streaming, enhancing our influence in theatrical releases, and strengthen synergies between IT's online and offline platforms. For animation and children's content, we will continue to improve our original production capabilities, focusing on high-quality domestic animations while enhancing the monetization of children's content. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jijie Zhu with\nJijie Zhu: I will translate the question myself. This year, we have seen that iQIYI is preparing for the offline theme park, at the same time selling related iQIYI products during the broadcasting of some top key dramas. Could you share about these strategies in the future? And how do you think of this market size? Thank you.\nOperator: Our CEO, Lu Gong, is taking this question. So for IT's experience business, we have two key areas: IP-based consumer products and offline experiences. For IT consumer products, in the past, we fully operated in IT licensing, but the percentage of GMV is relatively low in the whole market. So starting this year, we're now transitioning to a self-operation, building a consumer product system that includes planning and design, manufacturing, and sales. Right now, we're starting to test the waters starting from the collectible cards. And then also we're testing the waters for different sales channels. So we will expand that effort in the future. For the offline experiences, overall, we take an asset-light approach to this strategy.\nIt mainly has two parts: the immersive theaters, which now is a licensed model that we operate with different stores, now has over 30 cities, have more than 50 stores. For IT land, we also take the asset-light approach and we support in terms of content management and technology. In addition to the games and experiences based on our IPs, we also have the derivative products, the IT consumer goods that we'll be selling in the stores. Collectively, it will create synergy for our overall experience business. Right now, we have the Yangzhou and Otto, Taifeng locations are in development. By the end of this year, we will probably have more locations to be announced. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Thomas Chong with Jefferies.\nThomas Chong: Good evening, management. My question is about our debt management plan. Can management share more color about this? Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Our CFO, Jun Wang, is taking this question. As you probably noticed, for our debt, we have two parts: overseas U.S. Dollars and domestic RMB. As of the end of the second quarter, you will notice that the outstanding balance for the 2028 convertible notes is only $208 million. Currently, the company has sufficient cash to meet the debt obligation if the CP holders decide to provide to us. In terms of the domestic debt denominated in RMB, you probably noticed in the past few quarters, the long-term loan versus short-term loan has significantly improved. Currently, the portion is like fifty-fifty in terms of our outstanding loans as a whole.\nOverall speaking, the capital structure now is pretty healthy enough to support our daily operations and also the long-term development and growth in the future. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Ms. Yu for closing remarks.\nLu Gong: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. See you next quarter. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you.\nJun Wang: Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today.

The price will rise from £3.60 to £3.85 for Clubcard shoppers and from £4 to £4.25 for all other customers. Tesco also said it will add 50p to the price of its premium meal deal, raising the price from £5.50 to £6.\nAndrew Wishart of Berenberg said policymakers would not cut rates again this year as upward pressure on inflation from global food prices and energy would likely peak in the autumn.\nElliot Jordan-Doak, of Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned inflation will remain around 3.7pc on average for the rest of 2025 as inflation stays “miles above target for the foreseeable future”.\nMr Jordan-Doak said: “We expect headline inflation to remain above 3pc until April 2026, forcing the MPC to stay on hold for the rest of this year at least.”\nThe Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has a target to bring inflation down to 2pc but the pace of price rises has fallen below that level just once since April 2021.\nOxford Economics forecast that inflation will not drop below the Bank’s target until beyond 2027 and said it expects CPI in Britain to average 3.5pc this year and 2.8pc in 2026.\nIt follows the chancellor’s decision in her Budget last year to impose increases in National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage on employers, which took effect from April.\nClosely-watched services inflation rose faster than expected from 4.7pc to 5pc, as businesses were hit with higher costs. The figure was also fuelled by rising prices for hotel stays as Oasis reunited for their first tour in 15 years.\nMr Wishart said: “The 5pc in services prices in July is sufficient to keep headline CPI inflation at 2.5pc even if prices in all other categories stopped rising.”\nSuren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, added: “July’s outturn probably extinguishes hope of a September interest rate cut, while strengthening underlying inflationary pressures calls into question whether policymakers will be able to relax policy again this year.”\nChancellor Rachel Reeves said there is “more to do” to ease the cost of living.\nShe said: “We have taken the decisions needed to stabilise the public finances, and we’re a long way from the double-digit inflation we saw under the previous government, but there’s more to do to ease the cost of living.”\n04:24 PM BST\nSigning off...\nThanks for joining us on this blog.\nThat’s all for today, but you can read our latest economic and business news and analysis here.\n03:28 PM BST\nUS tech sell-off boosts ‘boring’ FTSE\nTech stocks in the US have continued their sell-off on Wall Street, which some analysts have suggested could be helping push the FTSE 100 higher.\nChip giant Nvidia and electric carmaker Tesla were down about 3pc in the US, with Palantir falling around 7pc following a recent loss of confidence in AI stocks.\nDavid Morrison, an analyst at Trade Nation, said: “I wonder if investors are also looking at the constituents within the FTSE 100 (which is effectively a tech-free index with loads of boring value plays) and thinking it may be a safer alternative to the high-valuation US corporates which have driven so much of market for such a long time.\n“There are suggestions that AI has become seriously overhyped currently, requiring a bit of a readjustment.”\n02:55 PM BST\nFTSE rises as market bets on later rate cuts\nThe FTSE 100 has climbed as traders bet that the Bank of England will cut interest rates next year.\nThe UK’s flagship stock index has climbed 0.7pc despite inflation rising faster than expected in July.\nMoney markets indicate there is about a 50-50 chance that interest rates will be cut again in 2025, down from 54pc at the start of the week.\nHowever, traders are now betting there is a 64pc chance of two cuts coming by July next year, compared to 41pc on Monday.\nAnalysts suggested this was because the latest surge in inflation was due to temporary factors like the 30.2pc jump in air fares caused by an earlier school summer holiday.\nChris Beauchamp, an analyst at IG, said: “While the headline seems to make last month’s rate cut look misplaced, below the surface it seems several key components drove the rise, and a focus on the less volatile elements suggests that the picture is more nuanced.\n“Inflation isn’t beaten, but it is perhaps being tamed.”\nIt is not all good news for UK stocks. The domestically focused FTSE 250 was last down 0.2pc.\n02:37 PM BST\nUS stocks subdued amid uncertainty over interest rates\nWall Street’s main indexes were muted at the open ahead of a speech by Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell which could detail the outlook for US interest rates.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat at the open to 44,922.70 in the lead up to the Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming later this week.\nThe S&P 500 fell 4.7 points, or 0.1pc, at the open to 6,406.62​, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 45.3 points, or 0.2pc, to 21,269.667 at the opening bell.\nBy contrast, London’s FTSE 100 has marched higher despite the inflation shock that rocked markets in early trading.\n02:16 PM BST\nInflation to remain above 2pc target for more than two years, say economists\nInflation will not fall below the Bank of England’s 2pc target next year or the one after, economists have warned.\nOxford Economics said it expects inflation in Britain to average 3.5pc this year and 2.8pc in 2026.\nIt said the consumer prices index (CPI) is likely to climb to 4pc over the next couple of months, peaking in September.\nIt is then due to subsequently “drift lower” as food and energy price rises ease in the final months of this year and through 2026, helped by the recent rises in the value of sterling, which have made imports cheaper.\nHowever, the advisory firm forecast inflation will not drop below the Bank’s 2pc target until at least beyond 2027.\n01:56 PM BST\nWhy Britain is suffering from the highest price rises in Europe\nWhen Sir Keir Starmer took the stage at the 2023 Labour conference in Liverpool, he promised voters he would solve the cost of living crisis if elected.\nRapid inflation “intrudes on the little things we love,” he said. “Whittles away at our joy.\n“Days out, meals out, holidays [are] the first things people cut back on. Picking up a treat in the supermarket just to put it back on the shelf.\n“We have to be a government that takes care of the big questions so working people have the freedom to enjoy what they love,” he vowed.\nOne year into government and this pledge looks far off. After a brief easing of the cost of living crisis, prices are once again climbing – and experts say Labour policy is fuelling the problem.\n01:37 PM BST\nRaising rail fares will price out commuters, warns union\nRail unions have warned that increasing rail fares next year would price commuters off the network.\nRail fares in England are on track to surge by 5.8pc next year after inflation rose at a faster pace than expected.\nOfficial figures showed the retail price index (RPI) rose to 4.8pc in July. Increases in train fares are traditionally calculated using July’s RPI figure plus one percentage point.\nMaryam Eslamdoust, general secretary of the rail and transport union TSSA, said: “It’s vital that the Government protects the travelling public from any unnecessary rise in rail fares as a result of this inflation spike.\n“The last thing passengers need is to be clobbered by higher fares and pushed off the railways at a time when we need people to be making more journeys for work and business reasons and in so doing powering the economy.\n“Regulated fares account for almost half of all rail journeys so we are urging the Department for Transport to keep ticket prices affordable so that we can get people out of their cars and onto the railways.\n“If we want public transport to be fully used by the public, it has to be priced for the public. Affordable fares mean full trains & cleaner air.”\n01:19 PM BST\nSweden keeps rates on hold after inflation rises\nSweden’s central bank kept its interest rates on hold today as it fights its own a recent tick up in inflation.\nThe Riksbank held its benchmark rate at 2pc, which is the lowest in more than two years, after its consumer prices index rose by 0.8pc in July, up from 0.7pc in June and 0.2pc in May.\nIt said: “Although developments in inflation and economic activity during the summer have deviated somewhat from the forecast in June, the Executive Board assesses that the outlook remains largely the same.\n“There is thus still some probability of a further interest rate cut this year, in line with the June forecast.”\nAdrian Prettejohn of Capital Economics said: “We think that the economy is likely to recover in the coming quarters, encouraging the Riksbank to leave its policy rate unchanged for the foreseeable future.\n“However, the risks are tilted towards a further 25bp cut later this year.”\n01:02 PM BST\nRate cuts coming in November and February, says Barclays\nBarclays said it expects the Bank of England will cut interest rates once more this year followed by another cut early in 2026.\nThe bank’s chief European economist Silvia Ardagna forecast a quarter point reduction in borrowing costs in November, followed by another cut in February.\nShe said that although inflation was stronger than expected at 3.8pc, “progress on services dis-inflation continued”.\nAlthough services inflation rose from 4.7pc to 5pc, Barclays pointed to services inflation excluding indexed and volatile components, rents and foreign holidays, which fell from 4.2pc to 3.9pc.\nMs Ardagna said: “This inflation print increases the risk that the Bank of England will pause for longer and reaches neutral later than we currently forecast.\n“That said, given the progress in underlying services inflation and on wage growth, we think it is too soon to rule a November cut.”\n12:16 PM BST\nBank of England to remain ‘on a knife edge’ says ex-policymaker\nThe Bank of England’s next decision on interest rates will “remain on a knife edge” following the latest jump in inflation, a former policymaker has said.\nProfessor Jonathan Haskel, who sat on the Monetary Policy Committee from 2018 to 2024, said there would be “slightly less prospect of more cuts” in the coming months as rate setters try to work out the underlying level of inflation.\n“One surprise is that food and non-alcoholic beverages have gone up by an unexpectedly large amount,” he told BBC Radio 4.\n“The way that plays out on the committee is that, for some, that is a temporary increase because food prices often unwind, for others that’s extremely salient to wage bargainers who want to be compensated for, understandably, a rise in the important prices that they face.\n“And so, if that increases wage pressure, that increases underlying wage inflation.\n“So I think the committee is going to remain on a knife-edge given those two conflicting forces.”\n11:55 AM BST\nFTSE 100 shrugs off inflation fears\nThe FTSE 100 has turned higher despite the stronger-than-expected inflation figures.\nThe blue-chip index was up 0.3pc as gains in consumer and healthcare sectors offset losses in energy and mining stocks.\nThe FTSE 250 mid-cap index dropped 0.4pc, putting it on pace to mark its steepest fall in over two weeks.\nThe UK’s consumer price inflation hit its highest in 18 months in July when it increased to 3.8pc from 3.6pc, once again leaving Britain with the fastest rate of price increases among the world’s largest rich economies.\nLuke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at Aberdeen, said: “Inflation was always likely to rise today, but this report is definitely on the hotter side.\n“In particular, services inflation, which the Bank of England watches very closely as a measure of underlying inflation pressure, popping higher will be a source of concern among policymakers.”\nTraders are now betting on a quarter-point reduction in March next year. Earlier this month, markets had anticipated a cut before the end of 2025.\nOn the FTSE 100, BP dropped 1.3pc after it said operations at its refinery at Indiana were affected by flooding.\nOn the flip side, consumer stocks and healthcare companies supported gains on the blue-chip index.\nMedical equipment maker Convatec rose 5.6pc was the largest gainer on the FTSE 100 after it announced $300m share buyback programme.\n11:25 AM BST\nTax raid forcing pubs and restaurants to close one day a week\nRachel Reeves’s tax raid is forcing hospitality businesses to shut their doors at least once a week as they grapple with spiralling wage costs following last year’s Budget.\nOn Wednesday, a new survey revealed that almost three quarters of hospitality businesses were operating at or below 85pc of their normal capacity, meaning they close for part of the week to save money.\nThe slimmer opening hours come as restaurants, pubs and cafes slash jobs in response to the rise in employers’ National Insurance contributions (NICs) and an increase in the minimum wage, which came into force in April.\n11:09 AM BST\nUS central bank boss under pressure over rates\nEconomists were cautious about the prospect of more interest rate cuts from the Bank of England after the latest rise in inflation.\nHowever, it is a very different story over in the US.\nInvestors will hang on Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell’s every word when he speaks at the annual Jackson Hole Symposium in Wyoming.\nThe Fed, which is yet to cut rates in 2025, is not due to hold its next meeting until mid-September and policymakers are grappling with weaker-than-expected jobs report but higher-than-expected inflation.\nMeanwhile, Mr Powell has come under intense pressure from Donald Trump to lower interest rates to boost the US economy.\nKevin Thozet of French asset manager Carmignac said: “Between Trump’s pressure and market expectations, Powell is expected to give in and hint that the rate cutting cycle will resume.\n“This stance is widely anticipated, with market participants expecting the Fed to cut more than currently signaled by the dot plot.\n“Short-term interest rate markets largely anticipate at least two interest cuts this year, reflecting expectations that the US economy and inflation will show further signs of deceleration.\n“We think this is too high given the resilience of the US economy, policy uncertainty and the persistence of inflationary pressures.”\n10:43 AM BST\nBank of England to cut interest rates twice next year, says economist\nThe Bank of England will cut interest rates twice in the first half of next year amid signs underlying inflation is easing, an economist has said.\nAndrew Wishart of Berenberg said policymakers would not cut rates again this year as upward pressure on inflation from global food prices and energy would likely peak in the third quarter.\nHe pointed to higher than expected growth in services inflation to 5pc, which “may suggest that underlying price pressures could be strengthening”.\n“However, the increase was driven entirely by a surge in the volatile airfares component and hotel prices. Oasis’ live tour may have temporarily boosted the latter,” he said.\n“As we move toward the end of the year, headline inflation should thus begin to ease. However, for headline inflation to fall back to the 2pc target, increases in services prices must slow.\n“The 5pc in services prices in July is sufficient to keep headline CPI inflation at 2.5pc even if prices in all other categories stopped rising.\n“A few signs that companies have lost pricing power and that wages growth has shifted onto onto a definitive downward trend give us some confidence that services inflation will ease next year.\n“We therefore expect the Bank of England to cut interest rates twice more in the first half of 2026 to 3.5pc after a pause in the remainder of 2025.”\n10:21 AM BST\nHouse prices pick up after stamp duty shock\nAverage UK house prices rose at a faster pace in the year to June, official figures showed, indicating the market is recovering from the shock of higher stamp duty.\nThe average UK house price increased by 3.7pc to £269,000, the ONS said, an increase from a 2.7pc rise reported in May, although this was downwardly revised from 3.9pc.\nAverage house prices increased by 3.3pc in England to £291,000, by 2.6pc in Wales to £210,000 and by 5.9pc in Scotland to £192,000.\nThe stamp duty discount expired at the end of March, cutting the threshold at which movers pay the tax from £250,000 to £125,000.\nElliott Jordan-Doak of Pantheon Macroeconomics said house prices are “recovering quickly from the disruption caused by the hike to stamp duty in April”.\n“Cutting through the noise, we think fundamental housing demand remains solid, indicating that house prices can continue to rise steadily over the course of the second half of the year,” he said.\nMeanwhile, average UK monthly private rents increased by 5.9pc to £1,343 in the 12 months to July. This was down from June’s 6.7pc rise.\n10:02 AM BST\nWhat higher inflation means for mortgages, savings and investments\nInflation jumped unexpectedly to an 18-month high of 3.8pc in July, up from 3.6pc in June, and above analyst predictions of 3.7pc.\nThis could have a significant impact on your finances – including savings, mortgages and investments. Here, Telegraph Money explains what your options are.\n09:44 AM BST\nRising inflation will keep borrowing costs high, warn economists\nThe cost of government borrowing will rise as a result of higher inflation, economists have warned.\nJulian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs said the news of inflation “looks set to get even worse before it gets any better”.\nHe said: “The latest jump in UK inflation to 3.8pc in July was not a big surprise – the Bank of England was already expecting an increase to 4pc in September.\n“But rising inflation will continue to eat into real incomes and keep bond yields high, adding to the government’s cost of borrowing.”\nHe added: “The bigger picture is that UK inflation has continued to diverge from the euro area, where inflation has settled at around 2pc.\n“This divergence is being driven by higher government-set prices (such as domestic energy bills and the national minimum wage), the continued pass through of higher employer taxes, and high housing costs as demand outpaces supply.”\nGovernment borrowing costs have fallen on bond markets today as traders reacted to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s decision to cut interest rates at the same time as it signalled that lower borrowing costs were on the way, despite an increase in its inflation projections.\nBonds had already been given a boost by S&P Global’s decision to reaffirm its credit rating for the US on Tuesday.\n09:18 AM BST\nHousebuilders slump after inflation blow\nHousebuilding stocks slumped on the London Stock Exchange after the latest inflation figures dashed hopes for interest rate cuts.\nDevelopers across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 fell as much as 1.4pc after the consumer prices index rose to a stronger-than-expected 3.8pc in July.\nCrest Nicholson dropped by 2.2pc while Berkeley Group declined by 1.7pc as traders bet that the Bank of England would not reduce borrowing costs again this year.\nHousebuilding stocks tends to perform better when interest rates are lower as it improves affordability for buyers.\nAnna Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “September’s rate decision is expected to be a hold, but don’t be surprised if sticky inflation puts paid to further rate cuts this year.”\nJanet Mui, an analyst at RBC Brewin Dolphin, added: “Unless we see a sharp deterioration in economic activity, the Bank is likely to keep rates on hold until the end of the year.”\nThe FTSE 100 was last down 0.2pc and the mid-cap FTSE 250 has dropped by 0.5pc.\n08:59 AM BST\nRising food prices down to Labour policies and poor harvests, say retailers\nFood and drink inflation increases for the fourth month in a row as Rachel Reeves’s tax raid fuelled prices at the till, according to retailers.\nFood and drink inflation rose to 4.9pc in July, from 4.5pc in June, which was the highest level since February 2024.\nKris Hamer, director of insight for trade body the British Retail Consortium, said: “Households are once again seeing the cost of their weekly shop climb, with food inflation now up by 1.9 percentage points in just four months.\n“This surge has been a key driver behind headline inflation, alongside a rise in transport costs, piling fresh pressure on families already being forced to cut back.\n“The Bank of England has been clear that Government policies, which have driven up the costs of employment, are fuelling price rises at the till, while poor harvests and global instability have also added further cost pressures.”\n08:46 AM BST\n‘All should be sacked’ as inflation climbs\nRachel Reeves has been accused of “utter incompetence” by Telegraph readers who said her tax raid on businesses had helped fuel inflation.\nOthers said the Bank of England is “wholly to blame” for cutting interest rates despite high inflation, suggesting failure to control food prices was a “fundamental economic failure”.\nHere is a selection of views from the comment section below and you can join the debate here:\n08:33 AM BST\nNo more rate cuts this year, warn economists\nThe Bank of England will not cut interest rates again this year as inflation “is set to stay miles above target for the foreseeable future”, economists have warned.\nPantheon Macroeconomics has predicted inflation will remain around 3.7pc on average for the rest of 2025.\nIt said official figures for July showed services inflatuon was “sticky” in a blow to those at the Bank of England “that argued hard at the August meeting about the disinflationary process being underway”.\nPolicymakers were forced to make an historic revote on whether to cut interest rates from 4.25pc to 4pc at their last meeting, eventually choosing to do so by the thinnest of margins.\nEconomist Elliott Jordan-Doak said the latest inflation figures come on the back of a GDP report “that smashed consensus estimates, and a labour market report that showed the jobs market stabilising”.\nHe said: “The big picture remains that inflation is set to stay miles above target for the foreseeable future; we expect headline inflation to remain above 3pc until April 2026, forcing the MPC to stay on hold for the rest of this year at least.”\n08:08 AM BST\nUK stocks fall after inflation blow\nThe FTSE 100 declined at the open after stronger-than-expected inflation dashed hopes for further rate cuts this year.\nThe UK’s flagship stock index was down 0.1pc to 9,177.37 as traders slashed bets on the Bank of England reducing borrowing costs again before the end of 2025.\nThe domestically focused FTSE 250 sank by 0.3pc to 21,770.37.\n07:57 AM BST\n‘Oasis effect’ helps drive up hotel prices\nA rise in the cost of overnight hotel stays helped drive services inflation during July as Oasis kicked off their reunion tour.\nServices inflation hit 5pc last month, also driven by a large increase in air fares.\nThe figure was far higher than the jump from 4.7pc to 4.8pc that had been expected by economists and comes as the chancellor imposed higher costs on businesses through her tax raid.\nEconomists had expected the reunion of Oasis for their first tour in 15 years to push up the costs of hotels and provide further fuel to inflation.\nAdam Deasy, economist at PwC, said: “As expected, the summer seasonals drove the change: we saw large increases in airfares, likely due to school holidays, and hotel prices surged – possibly influenced by the ‘Oasis effect’.\n“This demonstrates the volatility that summer readings can bring and pushes inflation to an uncomfortable new peak since January 2024.”\n“Despite recent falls in earnings growth, the Bank of England sees the all-important services inflation figure continuing to rise through the year, and the increase from 4.7pc to 5pc in July may indicate that it’s right.\n“This, together with higher-than-expected food inflation through much of 2025, looks poised to push inflation to a peak of 4pc later this year, double the Bank’s 2pc target.”\n07:42 AM BST\nPound edges higher as hopes of September rate cut ‘extinguished’\nThe value of the pound increased after the stronger-than-expected inflation effectively ruled out the chances of a September interest rate cut.\nSterling rose 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.351 and gained 0.2pc versus the euro to €1.161 after prices rose at a rate of 3.8pc in July, faster than projections of 3.7pc.\nSuren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, said: “July’s outturn probably extinguishes hope of a September interest rate cut, while strengthening underlying inflationary pressures calls into question whether policymakers will be able to relax policy again this year.”\nHe added: “Increasing services inflation suggests that rising National Insurance and National Living Wage costs are exacerbating underlying price pressures by more than offsetting the current downward squeeze from looser labour market conditions.\n“While spiralling business costs and food prices may mean that inflation peaks higher than the Bank of England’s prediction of 4pc, it should start decelerating in the autumn as a weaker economy increasingly bears down on prices.”\nMonica George Michail, associate economist at Niesr, added: “The Bank faces a difficult balancing act between lowering inflation and boosting a sluggish economy.\n“Given that several of the current drivers of annual price increases are one-off policy changes, we think the Bank of England may look through them and cut interest rates one more time this year.\n“However, there remain upside risks especially from food prices and sustained wage pressures, which will force the Bank to remain cautious”\n07:35 AM BST\nInterest rates may not be cut until next year, warn economists\nThe higher than expected rise in inflation to 3.8pc in July, from 3.6pc the previous month, makes life even more difficult for the Bank of England.\nIts nine-person rate-setter panel is already struggling to agree on the right diagnosis for the economy’s ills.\nFor the first time ever they were forced into a second round of voting in August, before ultimately agreeing to lower interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to 4pc.\nThe latest figures will make their balancing act even more fraught. Inflation is rising faster than expected, but growth has been better than anticipated. Normally that would make policymakers err on the side of caution and swerve rate cuts.\nAmong the drivers of inflation in July were airfares – worsened by how the school holidays fell – and hotel prices, likely affected by Oasis making a return. The rate setters may judge these are temporary factors and persist with cutting rates. But the risk of price rises proving stubborn will be a big concern.\n“The risk is that inflation expectations and wage growth rise further and the next move down in rates does not happen until next year,” warns Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics.\n07:27 AM BST\nRail fares on track to jump by 5.8pc\nRegulated train fares in England may increase by 5.8pc next year, based on a measure of inflation announced today.\nThe Office for National Statistics said Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation rose to 4.8pc in July.\nThe Government has not confirmed how it will determine the cap on regulated fare rises in 2026, but this year’s 4.6pc hike was one percentage point above RPI in July 2024.\nIf that formula is used to set next year’s fare increase, the cost of train travel will jump by 5.8pc.\nPressure group Railfuture recently said “it would be outrageous” if fares even rose by as much as 5.5pc.\n07:19 AM BST\nTories say rising inflation ‘deeply worrying for families’\nMel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said inflation jumping to its highest level in more than 18 months was “deeply worrying for families”.\nHe said: “Labour’s choices to tax jobs and ramp up borrowing are pushing up costs and stoking inflation – making everyday essentials more expensive. And with leading economists warning that the Chancellor has blown a colossal black hole in the public finances, families and businesses are bracing for yet more pain come the Autumn Budget.\n“Families are paying the price for Rachel Reeves’ economic mismanagement. Britain can’t afford Labour.”\n07:16 AM BST\nReeves admits ‘more to do’ as inflation jumps\nRachel Reeves said there is “more to do” to ease the cost of living after inflation jumped to its highest level since January last year.\nThe chancellor said: “We have taken the decisions needed to stabilise the public finances, and we’re a long way from the double-digit inflation we saw under the previous government, but there’s more to do to ease the cost of living.\n“That’s why we’ve raised the minimum wage, extended the £3 bus fare cap, expanded free school meals to over half a million more children, and are rolling out free breakfast clubs for every child in the country.\n“Through our Plan for Change we’re going further and faster to put more money in people’s pockets.”\n07:11 AM BST\nAir fares and petrol prices push up inflation\nONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said: “Inflation rose again this month to its highest annual rate since the beginning of last year.\n“The main driver was a hefty increase in air fares, the largest July rise since collection of air fares changed from quarterly to monthly in 2001.\n“This increase was likely due to the timing of this year’s school holidays.\n“The price of petrol and diesel also increased this month, compared with a drop this time last year.\n“Food price inflation continues to climb, with items such as coffee, fresh orange juice, meat and chocolate seeing the biggest rises.”\n07:06 AM BST\nInflation jumps to 3.8pc\nThe rate of inflation rose to 3.8pc in July from 3.6pc in June, the Office for National Statistics said.\nTransport, particularly air fares, made the largest upward contribution to the monthly change.\n06:46 AM BST\nOasis reunion could fuel inflation\nPrices in the UK are set to have risen faster last month as school holidays boosted travel costs and grocery bills remain elevated.\nHowever, some economists have said an “Oasis bump” could have contributed to higher hotel and accommodation prices in July.\nSanjay Raja, senior economist for Deutsche Bank, said this could partly be attributed to Oasis kicking off their reunion tour in July.\nThe concerts brought in hordes of fans to arenas in Cardiff, Manchester, London and Edinburgh, which could have driven greater demand for hotel rooms.\nAccommodation prices could rise by as much as 9pc in July, compared with June, “with the Oasis concerts having a strong impact on Manchester prices alone”, Mr Raja said.\nHe is predicting headline UK inflation will have risen to 3.8pc in July.\n06:28 AM BST\nGood morning\nThanks for joining me. Inflation has been forecast to have climbed from 3.6pc to 3.7pc in July. We will cover the data as it is released and what it means for you and the markets.

Borrowing in the month of July was better than had been expected by economists at £1.1bn. It was the lowest figure for the month in three years following stronger self-assessed income tax receipts.\nHowever, consultancy Capital Economics said the improvement in July’s borrowing figures was “not as good as it looks”,\nUK economist Alex Kerr said: “Ultimately, today’s release does little to brighten the gloomy outlook ahead of the Budget later this year.”\nElliott Jordan-Doak of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the Chancellor will still have to raise taxes in October.\nHe said: “The big picture remains that the public finances are in chronically weak condition.\n“The Chancellor faces surging gilt yields and a likely productivity downgrade from the OBR in the October forecast round.\n“The litany of policy U-turns has only compounded the Government’s fiscal woes. We think the Chancellor will need to resort to ‘sin’ and ‘stealth’ tax hikes, duty increases, and a pensions tax raid in order to meet her fiscal rules if she wants to meet her pledge of keeping headline tax rates unchanged.”\nNabil Taleb, an economist at PwC UK, said Ms Reeves “remains under pressure as she tries to balance weak growth with the fiscal rules”.\n“Higher debt servicing costs as a share of total revenues will leave the public finances more exposed to future economic shocks,” he warned.\nDebt interest payments reached £7.1bn in July, which was £200m more than last year.\n03:30 PM BST\nSigning off...\nThanks for joining us on this blog.\nThat’s all for today, but you can read our latest economic and business news and analysis here.\n03:23 PM BST\nUK borrowing costs surge\nThe UK’s government borrowing costs remained the fastest-growing among the world’s major economies today after the latest figures on the public sector’s finances.\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts – a benchmark for the cost of servicing the national debt – was up nearly six basis points to 4.73pc.\nBy contrast French and Italian 10-year bond yields were up around five basis points, with eurozone benchmark Germany up four points to 2.75pc.\nIt was the same story for Britain’s shorter-term two-year and longer 30-year bond yields amid concerns about Britain’s public finances and whether the Bank of England will cut interest rates again this year.\n03:03 PM BST\nState of Britain’s public finances means writing is on the wall for tax rises\nRachel Reeves is on course to raise taxes by at least £20bn this autumn as surging borrowing costs and public sector pay make another Budget raid inevitable.\nWhile borrowing in July came in below City forecasts, official data showed that on an annual basis, the deficit targeted by the Chancellor was almost £6bn higher than predicted by her budget watchdog.\nThe shortfall has partly been driven by weaker income tax receipts and higher government spending on salaries and benefits, following the Chancellor’s humiliating about-turn on welfare reform.\n02:46 PM BST\nUS stocks fall ahead of Powell speech\nWall Street’s main indexes opened lower as investors turned cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole Symposium.\nJerome Powell is on Friday due to give a speech at the three-day conference – his last as Fed chairman.\nHis comments will be closely watched for any signals that US interest rates will be cut next month, following pressure from Donald Trump.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 130.1 points, or 0.3pc, at the open to 44,808.21.\nThe S&P 500 dropped 14.9 points, or 0.2pc, at the open to 6,380.83​ following a tech-led sell-off in recent days.\nThe Nasdaq Composite declined 60.3 points, or 0.3pc, to 21,112.52.\n02:36 PM BST\nRetailers tell Reeves tax rises will hit cost of living\nMajor retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Boots have urged Rachel Reeves not to raise taxes on their sector in the autumn Budget as it could hit living standards.\nSome of the county’s biggest chains have signed a letter to the Chancellor sent by trade body British Retail Consortium (BRC).\nIt warns that further tax rises on businesses could result in the Government breaking its manifesto pledge to provide “high living standards”.\n“Labour’s manifesto made a clear and welcome promise to deliver good jobs and higher living standards but if future policy decisions lead to rising prices and fewer jobs, then those commitments are at risk,” the letter reads.\nThe UK bosses of Aldi, Lidl, B&Q, Currys, Burger King, Ikea, JD Sports, Boots, John Lewis and Primark were also among the signatories – the number of which the BRC is expecting to grow.\nMany businesses have seen their labour costs rise thanks to the rate of employer National Insurance being increased in last year’s Budget.\nSome retailers have blamed the tax hike for the decision to raise prices in shops, which they say has allowed them to partly mitigate the impact.\nOthers have resorted to cutting staff or freezing hiring, while some businesses said they were absorbing the higher costs into their profits.\nBut in the letter signed by more than 60 chief executives, it says: “As retailers, we have done everything we can to shield our customers from the worst inflationary pressures but as they persist, it is becoming more and more challenging for us to absorb the cost pressures we face.”\n02:10 PM BST\nRachel Reeves is preparing the ground for the extinction of the middle class\nThe pitch rolling has started. The propagandists have been unleashed. We are being softened-up for the ultimate betrayal, the most obscene of broken promises, the grossest attack on private wealth in living memory.\nIf you are a homeowner, I have grim news: Rachel Reeves has just declared war on you. You could pay even more tax, so much so that in some cases you may be forced to sell your house to pay the bill – and then to hand over yet more cash just to be allowed to say goodbye to your beloved family home.\nReeves is considering several options, all abhorrent: an annual proportional wealth tax on the value of homes, large enough to replace stamp duty, council tax and more; the imposition of capital gains tax (CGT) on primary residences for the first time ever, albeit just on more expensive ones at first; an “exit tax” as an alternative to CGT, payable on sale; and a revaluation of council tax, with even higher bands, including a mansion tax.\n01:53 PM BST\nMorgan Stanley says £20bn Budget black hole ‘not implausible’\nRachel Reeves faces a £20bn black hole in the public finances when she delivers her Budget later this year, according to a Wall Street bank.\nMorgan Stanley said there had been a “likely erosion of the chancellor’s fiscal headroom” because the OBR will be forced to downgrade its productivity and growth projections.\nThe bank’s chief UK economist Bruna Skarica said expectations of a £20bn gap in the public finances “don’t seem implausible to us”.\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley said it was maintaining its forecast that the Bank of England would cut interest rates in November despite figures showing stronger than expected inflation and private sector growth.\n“While today’s number poses hawkish risks for our call for a November cut, we keep it in our base case,” Ms Skarica said.\n“Should there be no signs of softening in underlying inflationary pressures in the August inflation reading, nor growth momentum into the September meeting, we would rethink that forecast.”\n01:29 PM BST\nHigher earners face £7,000 bill if Reeves freezes tax rates\nHigh earners could pay more than £7,000 in extra income tax if Rachel Reeves extends the current freeze on payment thresholds until 2030, a wealth manager has warned.\nThe Chancellor is widely expected to raise taxes in her Budget in the autumn as she looks for ways to fill a black hole in the public finances that some estimates have put as high as £50bn.\nOne option is freezing the tax-free personal allowance at £12,570 as well as income tax thresholds for basic, higher and additional rates.\nThis would drag more people into paying more tax as their wages rise. This effect is known as fiscal drag.\nRathbones said that if the freeze runs until April 2030, someone who earned £100,000 in 2022 could pay £7,077 more in tax than if thresholds had kept pace with inflation.\nThe additional tax burden would be £5,635 for someone who was on £80,000, £4,632 for those who earned £50,000, and £926 for those on £35,000.\nDirector Ade Babatunde said: “With the Chancellor searching for ways to plug the nation’s financial black hole, the freeze on income tax thresholds could be dragged out further.\n“It’s taxation by stealth: the rates stay the same, but a bigger slice of your pay disappears into the taxman’s coffers.\n“And it’s not just income tax. Capital gains, dividend and inheritance tax thresholds are also frozen, quietly pulling more people into the net.\n“Coupled with inflation – and with talk of a wealth tax – the rising tax burden has fuelled a surge in clients asking if they can do more to reduce their liability ahead of the Budget.”\n01:06 PM BST\nUS stocks poised to drop amid fears over AI valuations\nJust as UK stocks have fallen today, Wall Street indexes have dropped further in the wake of a tech-led sell-off.\nWalmart shares were down 2.5pc in premarket trading even as the world’s largest retailer raised its fiscal year sales and profit forecasts, driven by strong demand from shoppers across all income levels.\nThe company has implemented minimal price hikes compared to competitors and promised to maintain low prices, as well as stocked up on affordable discretionary products to draw in more customers.\nInvestors are trying to gauge how US tariffs will sales later this year. Oher retailers such as Target and Home Depot painted a mixed picture earlier this week .\nMeanwhile, there has been a sharp decline in technology stocks such as Nvidia, AMD, Palantir and Meta in recent days.\nRaffi Boyadjian, an analyst at brokerage XM said: “Equities could be more at risk of volatility amid this week’s sell-off in AI-related stocks on the back of renewed doubts about AI valuations.”\nIn premarket trading, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Palantir were marginally up, while Meta slipped 0.3pc.\nAhead of the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.4pc, the S&P 500 fell 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 declined 0.2pc.\n12:14 PM BST\nEconomy throws ‘mixed signals on inflation’\nThe latest data on Britain’s private sector growth sent “mixed signals” on inflation, an economist has said.\nTraders have reduced bets on interest rate cuts after stronger-than-expected inflation figures on Wednesday, following by survey data indicating the UK’s business activity has jumped at its fastest pace in a year this month.\nHowever, Julian Jessop of the Institute of Economic Affairs pointed to input prices and prices charged rising at a slower pace than in April when Rachel Reeves’s tax raid on businesses came into force.\nThis could mean inflation will ease towards the end of the year, Mr Jessop said, which could open the door to more rate cuts.\n11:55 AM BST\nUK borrowing costs jump in blow to Reeves\nThe cost of UK government borrowing has climbed at the fastest pace among major economies today in a blow to Rachel Reeves after official figures showed the Treasury’s deficit deepened last month.\nGilt yields – a benchmark for the cost of servicing Britain’s national debt – jumped across the piece on bond markets following the latest public sector borrowing data.\nBritain’s total current budget deficit – borrowing to fund day-to-day public sector activities – has climbed to £42.8bn since April, which was £5.4bn higher than during the same period in 2024.\nThis was despite the current budget managing a surplus of £3.3bn in July, which was £1bn better than the OBR forecast earlier this year.\nRising borrowing costs are an issue for the Chancellor as she seeks to balance the nation’s finances. The ONS said the interest payable on central government debt rose to £7.1bn in July.\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts has climbed five basis points today to 4.72pc.\nDavid Roberts of Nedgroup Investments said this could also be put down to stronger than expected growth in the private sector in August. This has weakened the case for further cuts to interest rates.\nHe said: “UK gilts have fallen in price and have lagged international peers – but whether either of those owe their origin to Government failings is debatable.\n“What is certain is the economy continues to positively surprise, reducing the chances of further rate cuts and putting upward pressure on gilt yields.”\n11:33 AM BST\nFTSE 100 drops from record high\nThe FTSE 100 has fallen from its record high on Wednesday as traders bet that interest rate cuts are less likely.\nThe UK’s blue-chip index has dropped 0.2pc in the wake of stronger-than-expected figures on both private sector growth in August and Treasury borrowing in July.\nThe FTSE 100 had climbed above 9,300 for the first time a day earlier as defensive stocks were boosted by concerns about US tech stocks. This was despite figures showing inflation rose faster than expected in July.\nFiona Cincotta of City Index said: “The FTSE 100 is steadying after reaching a record high on Wednesday, benefiting from the rotation out of tech, which saw the Nasdaq fall sharply from its record high.\n“While the FTSE’s lack of tech stocks meant it has underperformed in recent years, the recent rotation into value has put the wind in the FTSE’s sails. The FTSE has plenty of value plays which are still relatively cheap.”\nSue Noffke of Schroders added: “Consumer staples, such as personal care, tobacco and drinks companies, together with healthcare groups and pharmaceuticals businesses, were buoyant. Some business services groups also rose.\n“What these companies have in common is international revenues and earnings – so they are immune from the implications of the hotter UK inflation print seen today, as well as questions over whether that impacts the path of interest rates from the Bank of England or government fiscal policy in the autumn Budget.”\nThe FTSE 250 was down 0.5pc by late morning trading.\n11:03 AM BST\nPound rises after economy grows\nThe value of the pound climbed after closely watched survey data showed Britain’s private sector grew at the fastest pace in a year this month.\nSterling gained 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.348 and 0.1pc versus the euro to €1.156 as traders reduced bets on the Bank of England cutting interest rates.\nThe S&P Global Flash PMI for August showed business activity hit a one-year high this month, as the services industry led a summer rebound.\nMoney markets indicate there is a 42pc chance of another rate cut in 2025, down from 53pc on Wednesday, when official figures showed inflation rose at the fastest pace in 18 months in July.\nMeanwhile, public sector borrowing rose at a slower than expected pace last month in a potential further boost for the economy.\n10:46 AM BST\nInterest rates ‘to stay on hold this year’\nThe Bank of England will leave interest rates at 4pc for the rest of the year as the economy remains too strong to justify further cuts, economists have said.\nElliott Jordan-Doak of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the latest PMI data showed the “economy is ticking along at a healthy pace” as private sector activity hit its highest level in a year.\n“We think healthy growth and inflation miles above target means the MPC will have to keep rates on hold for the rest of the year,” he said.\nSeparate data on Wednesday showed that inflation rose faster than expected to 3.8pc in July.\n10:24 AM BST\nInterest rate cuts ‘less likely’ as economy grows\nThe Bank of England is less likely to cut interest rates later this year in the face of a strengthening economy, experts have warned.\nAshley Webb of Capital Economics said there was an “increase the chances the Bank of England leaves interest rates on hold in November”.\nIt comes after the closely watched PMI survey for August indicated that Britain’s private sector has grown at its fastest pace in a year.\nMoney markets indicate the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will keep rates on hold in September, with a 42pc chance of a cut before the end of the year.\n“Overall, at the margin today’s data release may give the hawks at the Bank a bit more support,” said Mr Webb.\n“We are still forecasting a 25 basis point cut in November to 3.75pc. But November’s decision will be a close call.”\nThomas Pugh, chief economist at RSM UK added: “Overall, a more positive signal on growth combined with stable input and output cost balances is another reason for the MPC to delay further rate cuts.”\n10:00 AM BST\nPrivate sector growth picks up in boost for Reeves\nBritain’s private sector activity grew at the fastest pace in a year, a closely watched survey showed, in a boost for Rachel Reeves’s hopes that a strong economy can help balance the nation’s books.\nThe S&P Global Flash UK PMI showed the UK’s dominant services sector drove growth in August, as new business orders expanded at the strongest pace since October.\nHowever, in a warning sign amid Donald Trump’s tariff campaign, input cost inflation edged up to its highest since May.\nBosses blamed the Chancellor’s tax raid on employers for suppliers passing on the cost of higher National Insurance rates.\nChris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global, said: “The services sector has led the expansion, but manufacturing also showed further signs of stabilising.\n“It’s evident from survey measures of order books, however, that the demand environment remains both uneven and fragile.\n“Companies report concerns over the impact of recent government policy changes, as well as unease emanating from broader geopolitical uncertainty. Goods exports are still falling especially sharply.”\n09:45 AM BST\nBorrowing costs could fall as Treasury hits targets, says economist\nGovernment borrowing costs could fall as Rachel Reeves shows the first signs of tackling the fiscal deficit, an economist has said after the Treasury hit forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\nBorrowing since April is in line with the OBR’s official forecast following stronger self-assessment income tax receipts and National Insurance contributions.\nThis has put the fiscal deficit on track to fall from 5.1pc of GDP in 2024-25 to 3.9pc in this financial year, according to private bank Berenberg.\nEconomist Andrew Wishart said he expects the “tailwinds from strong income tax and VAT receipts will continue to blow”.\nHe said: “That removes one of the reasons for the OBR to downgrade its forecasts.\n“If the OBR avoids downgrading its productivity growth assumption too, the upward revision to the deficit forecast since the spring would just be about £5bn from failing to follow through with spending cuts.\n“The fact that the government has taken steps to tackle the fiscal deficit sets it apart from the likes of France and the US.\n“Bond investors give the UK little credit for this, with the 10-year government bond yield higher than that of any other developed market and 30-year yields recently hitting a 27-year high of 5.5pc.\n“Under the radar, the required fiscal adjustment is beginning to take place. If sustained, that should pare back the risk premium in UK bond prices.”\n09:17 AM BST\nNational Insurance payments jump £2.6bn\nRachel Reeves’s tax raid on employers brought in an extra £2.6bn in July, ONS data suggested.\nCentral government receipts – the amount of money brought in, typically through taxes – was £100.1bn for the month, up £8.8bn against the same month last year.\nThis came as compulsory social contributions, which include National Insurance (NI) payments, increased by £2.6bn to £16.3bn.\nThe Chancellor increased the NI rate for employers rose from 13.8pc to 15pc in April following changes in October’s Budget. She also lowered the threshold at which businesses must pay the tax from £9,100 to £5,000.\nMeanwhile, the Government also saw a £2.7bn rise in self-assessed income tax receipts to £15.5bn.\n08:57 AM BST\nReeves warned mansion tax risks backfiring\nRachel Reeves has been warned that a “mansion tax” risks backfiring and could raise little or even no money.\nThe Chancellor is reportedly considering charging capital gains tax on the sale of homes worth more than £1.5m, as she scrambles to fill a hole in public finances that economists fear could be as large as £50bn.\nHowever, Andrew Wishart, an economist at Berenberg Bank, said a raid on wealthy homeowners could ultimately fail to raise the money she needs.\nHe said: “It is going to incentivise people to not sell, to try and hold to the next election, to see if it changes. Therefore, it might not generate any additional revenues at all.”\n08:39 AM BST\nReeves ‘shouldn’t get carried away’ with July boost\nRachel Reeves has “shouldn’t get carried away” from the latest borrowing figures, despite an improvement in the public finances during the month of July.\nThe current budget managed a surplus of £3.3bn in July, the ONS said, which was £1bn better than the OBR forecast earlier this year.\nHowever, Britain’s total current budget deficit – borrowing to fund day-to-day public sector activities – has climbed to £42.8bn since April, which was £5.4bn higher than during the same period in 2024.\nThomas Pugh, an economist at RSM UK, said the July figure, which matters for the chancellor’s fiscal mandate, is “much less positive than the headline numbers suggest”.\n“The bigger picture is that public borrowing has been roughly in line with the OBR forecast this year, but U-turns on spending cuts and a likely downgrade to the OBR’s growth forecasts mean the chancellor will probably have to raise around £20bn at the budget in the autumn,” he said.\n“The good news is that with interest rates likely to be around 4pc at the time of the budget there is plenty of scope for the Bank of England to cut rates to offset the impact of any fiscal consolidation on the economy.”\n08:23 AM BST\nBritain’s finances ‘chronically weak’ as Reeves plans tax rises\nBritain’s public finances remain “chronically weak” as Rachel Reeves prepares to raise taxes in the autumn, economists have warned.\nThe Treasury borrowed £1.1bn in July, which was less than official forecasts, while in the first four months of the financial year borrowing was in line with predictions by the OBR.\nElliott Jordan-Doak of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the Chancellor will still have to raise taxes in October despite borrowing matching official forecasts.\nHe said: “The big picture remains that the public finances are in chronically weak condition.\n“The Chancellor faces surging gilt yields and a likely productivity downgrade from the OBR in the October forecast round.\n“The litany of policy U-turns has only compounded the Government’s fiscal woes. We think the Chancellor will need to resort to ‘sin’ and ‘stealth’ tax hikes, duty increases, and a pensions tax raid in order to meet her fiscal rules if she wants to meet her pledge of keeping headline tax rates unchanged.\n“We expect the bulk of those tax hikes to be backloaded towards the end of the forecast period, minimising any short-term growth implications.\n“But that will buy the Chancellor only precious little time. The public finances are unsustainable in the long-run and delaying action now increases the risks of needing to make sharper adjustments in the future, which would be more disruptive for economic activity.”\n08:08 AM BST\nUK stocks lack direction at open\nStock markets in London were mixed at the start of trading after the latest figures showed Britain’s public finances remain heavily reliant on borrowing.\nThe FTSE 100 edged up 0.1pc to 9,297.34 while the domestically focussed FTSE 250 declined by 0.2pc to 21,851.95.\n07:54 AM BST\nTax receipts could explain falling payrolls, says economist\nHigher self employment tax receipts could help explain the decline in the number of people on payrolls in Britain, an economist has said.\nStaff numbers fell in July to their lowest level since October 2023, the ONS said earlier this month.\nSimon French of Panmure Liberum said the latest borrowing figures could offer a clue as to why this has happened.\nThe ONS said self-assessed income tax receipts hit £15.5bn in July, up £2.7bn on the same month last year.\n07:47 AM BST\nReeves ‘remains under pressure’ as borrowing rises\nRachel Reeves “remains under pressure as she tries to balance weak growth with the fiscal rules”, economists have warned.\nNabil Taleb, economist at PwC UK, acknowledged that tax revenues “rose sharply” in July, coming in £9.2bn higher than the same month last year.\nHowever, he warned: “Higher debt servicing costs as a share of total revenues will leave the public finances more exposed to future economic shocks.”\nDebt interest payments reached £7.1bn in July, which was £200m more than last year.\n“Although tax receipts rose in July, the Chancellor remains under pressure as she tries to balance weak growth with the fiscal rules she has committed to,” he said.\n“As the Chancellor prepares for the Autumn Budget, the challenge will be finding creative sources of revenue while treading carefully around the impact on living standards.”\n07:33 AM BST\nTreasury borrowing ‘not as good as it looks’\nThe improvement in July’s borrowing figures was “not as good as it looks”, economists have warned.\nCapital Economics forecast that the Chancellor will still need to raise taxes by £17bn to £27bn at the Budget later this year to balance the nation’s books.\nThe Treasury borrowed £1.1bn in July, which was lower than the OBR forecast for £2.1bn and economists’s estimates for £2bn.\nHowever, economists pointed to the cumulative current budget deficit, which overshot the OBR’s forecast by £5.7bn and “is what matters for the Chancellor’s fiscal mandate”.\nUK economist Alex Kerr said: “Ultimately, today’s release does little to brighten the gloomy outlook ahead of the Budget later this year.\n“The Government’s U-turns on spending cuts and potential upward revisions to the OBR’s borrowing forecasts mean the Chancellor may need to raise £17bn to £27bn at the Autumn Budget to maintain the £9.9bn of headroom against her fiscal mandate.\n“And given that she is struggling to stick to existing spending plans and we doubt the gilt market will tolerate significant increases in borrowing, most of that will have to be funded by tax rises.”\n07:28 AM BST\nToo much spent on covering interest on national debt, says minister\nThe Chief Secretary to the Treasury said too much taxpayer money is spend on debt interest payments.\nThe Government spent £7.1bn in July covering the interest payable on central government debt, which was £200m more than in the same month last year.\nDarren Jones said: “We’re investing in our public services, and modernising the state, to improve outcomes and reduce costs in the medium term.\n“Far too much taxpayer money is spent on interest payments for the longstanding national debt.\n“That’s why we’re driving down government borrowing over the course of the parliament – so working people don’t have to foot the bill and we can invest in better schools, hospitals, and services for working families.”\n07:25 AM BST\nHigher tax and National Insurance ease July borrowing figures\nONS deputy director for public sector finances Rob Doody said: “Borrowing this July was £2.3bn down on the same month last year, and was the lowest July figure for three years.\n“This reflects strong increases in tax and National Insurance receipts.\n“However, in the first four months of the financial year as a whole, borrowing was over £6bn higher than in the same period in 2024.”\n07:18 AM BST\nBorrowing lower than expected in July\nBorrowing for the first four months of this financial year hit £60bn, which was £6.7bn more than during the same period last year.\nHowever, Government borrowing slowed to a lower-than-expected £1.1bn in July, the ONS said.\nTreasury borrowing was £2.3bn less than the same month a year earlier and is the lowest July borrowing figure for three years.\nIt came after a rise in self-assessed income tax payments helped increase tax receipts for the month.\nJuly borrowing was higher than the £2bn figure predicted by economists.\n07:14 AM BST\nGood morning\nThanks for joining me. The Treasury has ramped up borrowing so far this year as Rachel Reeves prepares to raise taxes to fill a £50bn black hole in the public finances.\nPublic sector borrowing has climbed to £60bn since April, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, which was £6.7bn more than at the same point last year.\nThe Treasury’s borrowing figure was in line with official forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which was set up in 2010 when George Osborne was chancellor to analyse Government management of the public finances.\nBorrowing in the month of July was better than had been expected by economists at £1.1bn, which was the lowest figure for the month in three years following stronger self-assessed income tax receipts.\nThe spending comes as Ms Reeves is widely expected to raise taxes in her Budget in the autumn to balance the nation’s books.\nShe raised taxes by £40bn at her fiscal event last year but the public purse has come under pressure from rising borrowing costs on debt markets and a failure by the Government to cut public spending.

Email pr@fool.com\nI'll now turn the call over to Mr. Jinfeng Huang. Please go ahead, David.\nJinfeng Huang: Thank you, Irene, and thank you, everyone, for joining Yatsen Holding Limited's second quarter 2025 earnings conference call today. I will begin with a brief macro overview and a summary of our financial results, followed by an update on how our R&D-driven initiatives have supported the healthy development of our brand portfolio. China's beauty industry saw another modest quarter. According to the adjusted data published by the National Bureau of Logistics, beauty sales increased by 2.6% year over year, falling short of the 5.4% growth in total retail sales of consumer goods. Specifically, during May and June, the key promotion period around June, beauty sales rose by 4.4% in May but declined by 2.2% in June.\nDespite the uncertain environment, we stayed focused on executing our R&D-driven strategy, anchored in our vision of becoming a world-class pioneer in beauty innovation. We have continued expanding our international innovation network, attracting top global R&D talents, and deepening collaborations across industries, academia, and research institutions. These efforts have laid a solid foundation for both product innovation and brand equity, which in turn supported the rebound in our financial performance. Building on the momentum that began in 2024, we delivered year-over-year revenue growth and achieved non-GAAP profitability for the third consecutive quarter. In 2025, total net revenues grew by 36.8% year over year, significantly exceeding our previous guidance.\nRevenues from brands increased 78.7% year over year, driven by an 88.1% growth in the combined revenue from our three major skincare brands, Calanique, Doctor Wu, and Yiflon. Our color cosmetics brands also delivered year-over-year growth of 8% with Perfect Diaries brand back on the growth trajectory. As operating leverage began to take effect, coupled with our efforts to improve efficiency in our operations and marketing spend, we narrowed our net loss margin to 1.8% from 10.8% for the prior year period and achieved a non-GAAP net profit margin of 1.1% for the second quarter of 2025 as compared with a non-GAAP net loss margin of 9.4% for the prior year period.\nLet me now walk you through some brands and product highlights powered by our solid R&D infrastructure. Genomics posted strong results, supported by robust product highlights and effective product marketing. Our number one VC7 continues to lead sales, while our upgraded brightening micro mask featuring the brand's micro profusion and active anchor technology ranked number one among premium single-use masks on both Tmall and JD during the June 2018 period. The number two VA Serum also received increasingly positive feedback, particularly on Douyin. In addition to online growth, we began expanding dynamic offline presence, opening experience stores in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Shenzhen by June. These stores are designed to strengthen brand visibility and deepen consumer engagement.\nDoctor Wu also benefited from a more diverse and balanced product portfolio. Its purifying renewable essence toner formulated with a gentle acid complex effectively adjusted the antioxidant and the brightening ease of Oly and Acne Protein. This product resonates strongly with its targeted consumers and reinforces the brand positioning as a leader in professional skin renewal. The second quarter also marked a key milestone for Pavidari. Since the launch of the Bio Lip Essence Lipstick in September 2023, Pavidari has embraced a new philosophy of makeup skinification. Building on this, we introduced the third generation biotech technology and applied it to facial makeup. The new BioPhase Essence Foundation provides a flawless finish while supporting the skin barrier.\nWe also launched the translucent blurring setting powder, powered by the smart lock technology to control oil, combat oxidation, and reduce dullness. These innovations played a key role in putting Togedari back on its growth path. As our commitment to R&D remains essential to our long-term strategy, we continue to strengthen our capabilities and presence in the scientific community. In May, we participated in the 2025 China Cosmetic Science and Technology Conference in Yunnan as a guest speaker and joined a roundtable discussion on emotional skincare at the 2025 International Cosmetics Innovation Conference in Shanghai. In June, our joint laboratory with Regen Hospital unveiled its latest innovation at the 30th International Council of Nurse Congress in Health Care, Finland.\nWe are also proud of our ongoing social responsibility initiative. During 2025, our Create a Beautiful Life program launched in partnership with the China Women's Development Foundation celebrated the graduation of its first 2025 cohort in Guizhou. Now in its fifth year, the program provides free professional makeup training for low-income women, helping them pursue new opportunities in employment and entrepreneurship. Meanwhile, Doctor Wu has entered the third year of his campus charity tour, promoting scientific skincare education and raising skin health awareness among university students across China. In summary, we are beginning to see tangible results from our long-term focus on R&D. We remain committed to nurturing our brands and delivering exceptional products to our customers.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Donghao Yang, to discuss our financial performance. Thank you, everyone.\nDonghao Yang: Thank you, David, and hello, everyone.

These forecasts reflect our current and preliminary view on the market and operational conditions, which are subject to change. With that, I'd now like to open the call to Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question today will come from Maggie Huang of CICC. Please go ahead.\nMaggie Huang: Thanks for taking my question. This is Maggie Huang from CICC. Firstly, congratulations for beating our guidance. And I have two questions. My first question is that as we enter into the second half of the year, how should we expect the change of profitability for both skincare and color cosmetic categories? And how do we intend to strike the balance between promoting new product lines and improving our profitability? And my second question is about competition. So what's our view on the industry competition in Q3 and Q4, particularly the competition from foreign premium brands? That's my two questions. Thank you.\nDonghao Yang: Okay. Thank you very much for your question. Well, we've always been trying to track balance between our growth and profitability. And we don't believe that we have to sacrifice one for the other. And especially now our high-end skincare brands are growing even faster than our color cosmetics brands, which tend to have higher gross margin and bottom line. So we're confident that as we grow our business, both in skincare and color cosmetics going forward and especially skincare is showing a much stronger growth momentum. We believe that we can achieve both growth and profitability.\nAnd competition and I think you're right, competition is going to be becoming more and more intense going forward, especially as our high-end skincare brand is growing faster, we do expect to have more competition from the international brands. But in order to drive our growth and strengthen our competing position, we are adopting an R&D-driven growth strategy. So for the last four, five years, we've been one of the most aggressive players in the cosmetics industry to invest heavily in R&D. So now we've built a very, I would say, best-in-class R&D team and R&D infrastructure. If you look at our lab, our R&D center in Shanghai is one of the world-class facilities.\nSo that's how we view where to drive our future growth and especially to win the competition against the players in the industry.\nMaggie Huang: Well, it's very clear. I have no more questions. Thank you very much.\nJinfeng Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today will come from Lin Zhang of CITIC Securities. Please go ahead.\nLin Zhang: Thank you for taking my questions. I'm Lin Zhang from CITIC Securities and congratulations on the performance in the second quarter. My first question is for the skincare brands. So I want to ask what are the key drivers behind the rapid growth of skincare brands, for the Calanique and Doctor Wu in the first half of the year? And what is the outlook for the skincare business in the second half year and the next year? And my second question is, in which assets will the company make efforts to continuously improve the profitability? Thank you.\nDonghao Yang: Thank you for the question. So for the growth of skincare brand, so we think there are a number of reasons. Primarily it's because of our continued investment in R&D and our gradual systematic upgrade of our R&D capabilities. As a result, we have a very strong pipeline of new product innovations. So just to give you some examples, for example, for Calanique, for the past couple of quarters, we have introduced a series of new products, including on top of very successful VC, we produced the VA serum and also the MicroMask series has been very successful. And we also widened the offering of the MicroMask in terms of different efficacy and we also operated the micro mask recently.\nAnd for Doctor Wu, the new essence toner has been very successful. So we think mainly from the R&D upgrade and also the new product pipeline. And then in terms of outlook, we have provided the guidance for Q3 of 15% to 30%, which will I would think reflect our future outlook in terms of continued trend of our skincare brands in terms of the development. And then on your second question is our efforts to how to improve the profitability. We are continuing to optimize our channel and product mix and at the same time streamline our operating expenses.\nBut we think most of our brands, some of them given the high growth, we think there's still significant growth potential. And those brands are right now remain well below their respective ceilings. That's why we continue to plan to invest in the brand awareness and brand equity. So especially when there are few product launch. So as a result, we think the profitability improvement will be gradual.\nJinfeng Huang: Okay. As well, just to add on to Irene's point, we do see clear opportunities to further improve profitability across several dimensions. First, we will continue to optimize our product mix by driving premiumization and hero products with stronger margins. Second, we're improving marketing efficiency through data-driven CRM and better ROI discipline, shifting spending towards higher return channels. Thirdly, we are enhancing supply chain and operational efficiency to reduce costs and improve scale leverage. And lastly, as top-line growth continues, we expect to gain operating leverage across fixed expenses. So altogether these initiatives give us confidence in steadily expanding profitability while maintaining growth.\nLin Zhang: Thank you. That's very clear. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nIrene Lyu: Thank you again for joining us today.

The Magnificent Seven stocks retreated, with Nvidia (NVDA) falling over -3% and Meta Platforms (META) dropping more than -2%. Also, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) slumped more than -5% after GF Securities downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy. In addition, Viking Therapeutics (VKTX) cratered over -42% after the drugmaker released study results of its experimental weight-loss pill showing that nearly a third of patients discontinued treatment, raising concerns about potential side effects. On the bullish side, Intel (INTC) climbed more than +6% and was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after SoftBank Group agreed to buy $2 billion worth of the chipmaker’s shares.\nEconomic data released on Tuesday showed that U.S. July housing starts unexpectedly rose +5.2% m\/m to a 5-month high of 1.428 million, stronger than expectations of 1.290 million, while building permits, a proxy for future construction, fell -2.8% m\/m to a 5-year low of 1.354 million, weaker than expectations of 1.390 million.\nFed Governor Michelle Bowman on Tuesday held firm on her stance about cutting interest rates, saying she hadn’t changed her view after dissenting from the majority of the Fed board in July on the need for a rate cut. “The story is out there, and that’s that. I haven’t changed my views,” Bowman said during an interview on Bloomberg Television.\nToday, market watchers will pay close attention to the publication of the Fed’s minutes from the July 29-30 meeting, which will provide insight into the Fed’s stance on interest rates and the economy and could shed more light on the decision by Fed Governors Waller and Bowman to support a rate cut.\nAlso, market participants will hear perspectives from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic throughout the day.\nOn the earnings front, retailers such as TJX Companies (TJX), Lowe’s (LOW), and Target (TGT), as well as notable companies like Analog Devices (ADI) and Estee Lauder (EL), are slated to release their quarterly results today. Investors will closely watch retail earnings for clues on consumer sentiment and tariff effects.\nOn the economic data front, investors will focus on U.S. Crude Oil Inventories data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists expect this figure to be -0.800M, compared to last week’s value of 3.036M.\nInvestor attention for the remainder of the week is squarely focused on the Kansas City Fed’s annual Economic Policy Symposium, which begins Thursday evening in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Chair Jerome Powell, in remarks on Friday, is expected to outline the central bank’s new policy framework. Investors are watching to see whether Powell confirms the market’s pricing for a September rate cut or pushes back by stressing that incoming data before the next policy meeting could change the outlook. They’re also seeking signals about the longer-term path of Fed cuts heading into next year.\nU.S. rate futures have priced in an 82.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 17.1% chance of no rate change at the September FOMC meeting.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.300%, down -0.05%.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.01% this morning, paring earlier losses, supported by strength in defensive sectors. Personal care and utility stocks outperformed on Wednesday. At the same time, defense stocks continued to drop as optimism over progress toward a peace settlement in Ukraine weighed on the sector. U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington could provide air support to Ukraine as part of a peace deal, but ruled out deploying troops on the ground. Data from Eurostat released on Wednesday confirmed that the Eurozone’s annual inflation rate held steady at 2.0% in July, unchanged from the prior month. Separately, data from the Office for National Statistics showed that Britain’s annual inflation rate rose to an 18-month high in July, increasing the likelihood that Bank of England policymakers will refrain from lowering rates next month. Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Wednesday that the trade deal between the U.S. and the EU is broadly in line with the central bank’s baseline assumptions, though uncertainty remains in key sectors such as pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. On the monetary policy front, Sweden’s Riksbank kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 2.00%, as expected, while noting it sees some likelihood of a rate cut later this year. Investor focus later this week will turn to the Fed’s Jackson Hole economic symposium for signals on the rate outlook. In corporate news, Alcon (ALC.Z.IX) plunged over -9% after the medical device manufacturer cut its full-year net sales guidance.\nU.K. CPI, U.K. Core CPI, Germany’s PPI, Eurozone’s CPI, and Eurozone’s Core CPI data were released today.\nU.K. July CPI rose +0.1% m\/m and +3.8% y\/y, stronger than expectations of -0.1% m\/m and +3.7% y\/y.\nU.K. July Core CPI rose +0.2% m\/m and +3.8% y\/y, stronger than expectations of +0.1% m\/m and +3.7% y\/y.\nThe German July PPI came in at -0.1% m\/m and -1.5% y\/y, weaker than expectations of +0.1% m\/m and -1.3% y\/y.\nEurozone’s July CPI was unchanged m\/m and rose +2.0% y\/y, in line with expectations.\nEurozone’s July Core CPI fell -0.2% m\/m and rose +2.3% y\/y, in line with expectations.\nAsian stock markets today closed mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +1.04%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed down -1.51%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index reversed earlier losses and closed higher today on remarks from the country’s foreign ministry that investors viewed as a sign of potential progress in U.S.-China trade talks. Sentiment improved in the afternoon session after China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, responding to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s comments, reiterated Beijing’s hope that the U.S. would cooperate with China to implement the consensus reached by the two presidents and pursue “positive outcomes” in economic talks based on equality, respect, and reciprocity. Mr. Bessent signaled on Tuesday that the U.S. is satisfied with the current tariff set up with China. “We have had very good talks with China. I imagine we’ll be seeing them again before November,” he said. Also aiding sentiment, China’s industry ministry said it convened a meeting with solar industry representatives, the second in two months, urging the sector to tighten regulations and curb excessive competition among firms. Meanwhile, China left benchmark lending rates unchanged for the third straight month on Wednesday as authorities signaled they are in no hurry to roll out monetary stimulus despite a series of recent disappointing economic data. The one-year loan prime rate remained at 3.0%, while the five-year rate held steady at 3.5%, according to the People’s Bank of China. The official People’s Daily stated in a commentary that China “must continue to exert efforts in macro policies and increase them at an appropriate time to promote the continued implementation of existing and established policies while maintaining policy continuity and stability.” In corporate news, Pop Mart surged over +12% in Hong Kong after the toy company posted an approximately 400% year-over-year jump in first-half net profit.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply lower today, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street. Technology, heavy industry, and video game stocks led the declines on Wednesday. Domestic trade data added to the downbeat mood. Government data released on Wednesday showed that Japan’s exports in July posted the biggest drop in more than four years, falling for a third consecutive month as the impact of U.S. tariffs intensified, heightening concerns over the outlook for the export-reliant economy. Shipments to the U.S. dropped 10.1% year-over-year, dragged down by weakness in automobile exports. Capital Economics’ Marcel Thieliant said that Japan’s July exports data indicate that U.S. tariffs are beginning to “bite.” “We expect softer external demand to result in slower export growth over the coming quarters,” Thieliant added. At the same time, Japan’s monthly core machinery orders, a key leading indicator of capital spending, unexpectedly rose in June, snapping a 2-month decline. Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds remained under pressure on Wednesday as worries grew over the nation’s debt burden and the government’s rising deficit spending. In other news, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday that documents memorializing trade deals with Japan and South Korea are “weeks away” from being ready. In corporate news, SoftBank Group slumped over -7% following a steep selloff in U.S. technology shares, while concerns over its investment in Intel continued to weigh on the company. Investor focus remains on Japan’s national core CPI data for July, scheduled for release on Friday, for clues on whether the Bank of Japan will raise rates again this year. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed up +3.84% to 25.15.\nThe Japanese July Trade Balance stood at -117.5B yen, weaker than expectations of 196.2B yen.\nThe Japanese July Exports fell -2.6% y\/y, weaker than expectations of -2.1% y\/y.\nThe Japanese July Imports fell -7.5% y\/y, stronger than expectations of -10.4% y\/y.\nThe Japanese June Core Machinery Orders came in at +3.0% m\/m and +7.6% y\/y, stronger than expectations of -0.4% m\/m and +5.0% y\/y.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nEstee Lauder (EL) slumped more than -7% in pre-market trading after the cosmetics company issued below-consensus FY26 adjusted EPS guidance.\nToll Brothers (TOL) fell over -3% in pre-market trading after the homebuilder reported weaker-than-expected FQ3 net orders and cut its full-year deliveries guidance.\nLa-Z-Boy (LZB) tumbled more than -24% in pre-market trading after the furniture maker posted weaker-than-expected FQ1 adjusted EPS and provided below-consensus FQ2 revenue guidance.\nSnowflake (SNOW) rose over +3% in pre-market trading after BofA upgraded the stock to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $240.\nLowe’s (LOW) gained about +3% in pre-market trading after the home-improvement retailer reported better-than-expected Q2 adjusted EPS, raised its full-year sales guidance, and announced the acquisition of Foundation Building Materials for about $8.8 billion.\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Wednesday - August 20th\nTJX (TJX), Lowe’s (LOW), Analog Devices (ADI), Target (TGT), Estee Lauder (EL), Baidu (BIDU), Futu (FUTU), Nordson (NDSN), Huazhu (HTHT), Dycom Industries (DY), GDS Holdings (GDS), Coty Inc (COTY), Kingsoft Cloud (KC), Corporacion America Airports (CAAP), BBVA Argentina (BBAR), iQIYI (IQ), ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM), John B Sanfilippo&Son (JBSS), Jiayin (JFIN), National Energy Services (NESR).\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Over the past sixty years, Buffett’s investing strategy has turned the firm into a trillion-dollar giant, with powerful positions in the insurance, tech, and energy sectors. He’s known as a major backer of American brand names, and has long held multi-billion positions in Apple, American Express, and Coca-Cola.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nBuffett is particularly well-known for his promotion of value investing, buying into high-quality companies and holding onto them for the long term. A master of the bon mot, Buffett has said that if you can’t imagine holding a stock for 10 years, then you shouldn’t even hold it for 10 minutes. He has also shown a preference for buying into undervalued stocks, as long as their fundamentals are sound, and his success in finding those gems has earned him the nickname ‘the Oracle of Omaha.’\nFollowing Buffett’s trades has long been a viable strategy for the ordinary retail investor – and as he retires, we can take a look at two of his final stock purchases as the head of Berkshire Hathaway.\nThey’re interesting choices – but according to the TipRanks database, analysts at Bank of America aren’t as convinced. So, let’s give them both a closer look to see where these names are at – and maybe get an idea of just why a major investor and a major investment bank are taking diverging stands.\nUnitedHealth Group(UNH)\nThe first stock we’re looking at here, UnitedHealth, is a giant of the US health insurance industry – in fact, with its market cap of $275 billion, it is the largest company in that space. UnitedHealth operates through two distinct, but complementary, business divisions. The first of these, the eponymous UnitedHealthcare, offers customers a full range of health benefits and affordable coverage. The company’s policies include employer and individual plans; Medicare and retirement plans; and community and state benefit products.\nUnder its second main business division, Optum, the company provides a wide range of direct-care health services, including mental health services. Optum Health acts as a patient-centered provider, for high-quality, community-based care nationwide. Optum Insight partners with the payers, the providers, and the government and life-science companies that develop services and handle payment – all to create a simplified administrative and financial process. Finally, Optum RX deals with the pharmacy end, making medications available at affordable prices.\nThrough these business arms, UnitedHealth covers more than 148 million people worldwide, and employs nearly 400,000 people. The company’s workforce includes administrative and office staff; insurance adjusters; clinicians and pharmacists – everyone needed to provide leading-edge healthcare services. The company generates revenues in the hundreds of billions, but we should note, however, that UNH shares fell in April of this year, after the company released its 1Q25 results – and revised its full year 2025 guidance downward, a slide that continued when the company suspended its 2025 outlook in May. The stock faced additional downward pressure after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into possible Medicare fraud at the company. All told, the stock is down 39% for the year-to-date.\nOn a positive note, UnitedHealth’s 2Q25 report showed a top line of $111.6 billion, a figure that up 13% year-over-year and met Street expectations. At the bottom line, the the non-GAAP EPS came to $4.08, missing the forecast by 37 cents per share. Even though the company’s earnings missed the forecast, they are still more than enough to fund the dividend. UNH’s next common share payment, for $2.21 per share, is due to be paid on September 23. At the declared rate, the dividend annualizes to $8.84 per common share and gives a forward yield of 3%.\nBuffett, for his part, must think the stock now offers some great value. Last Friday, the stock got a bump when Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosure forms revealed that Buffett’s firm opened a significant stake in UNH. Berkshire Hathaway bought 5,039,564 shares of UNH, a stake that is worth $1.532 billion at the current share price.\nOn the other hand, while Bank of America acknowledges that UnitedHealth is a solid player in its field, it believes the company faces some near-term difficulties. As analyst Kevin Fischbeck writes, “UNH set a tone of refocusing on strong execution, but the pace of improvement is likely slower than expected. UNH expects ‘solid but moderate earnings growth in 2026, but accelerating in 2027 and in succeeding years.’ UNH didn’t explicitly bless 13-16% LT growth, but pointed in that direction, indicating it would get back to low double-digit ranges and get back to ‘historical levels,’ which is predicated on reasonable growth from well run businesses, compounding efficiency gains, deploying capital for shareholders and M&A. UNH was much more open about segment margins and issues, creating a better understanding of the drivers. That said, we reiterate Neutral given what we see as significant earnings power, but low visibility in earnings in the near term.”\nThe stated Neutral rating is accompanied by a $290 price target – which implies a downside of 4.5% in the next 12 months. (To watch Fischbeck’s track record, click here)\nThere are 22 recent analyst reviews on file for UNH, and the breakdown – 18 to Buy, 2 to Hold and Sell, each – supports a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $304.01 and the average target price of $312.95 indicates a modest one-year upside potential of 3%. (See UNH stock forecast)\nAllegion(ALLE)\nThe next stock we’ll look at is Allegion, a leader in the home security field. Allegion’s products are designed to keep people safe, whether at home, at school, at work, or traveling to and fro. The company has operations and sales in more than 120 countries, and its product lines focus on doorway security: residential and commercial locks and locking mechanisms, door closers and other exit devices, and advanced doorframes to control access to protected spaces. The company spun off from Ingersoll Rand to become a stand-alone public firm in 2013. Allegion boasts that some of its owned brand names date back to the 1700s.\nAmong the names in Allegion’s portfolio are Austral Lock, Kreiger Specialty Products, Stanley Access Technologies, Steelcraft, Kryptonite, and Soss Door Hardware. Most of the company’s product brands can be found around the world, and specific products include such stand-bys as keys and levers; portable chains and locks (think bicycles, here); electronic access and monitoring devices; weather stripping solutions for exterior doors; latches, hinges, and other hardware for door systems; and even automated entrance solutions. While we don’t always think of doors and doorways as essential technology, Allegion’s product lines remind us that doors – and other access points – are vital areas wherever we go.\nIn its quarterly report for 2Q25, Allegion’s top line came to $1.02 billion. This was up 5.6% from the prior year and was $20.6 million better than had been anticipated. The company’s bottom line also beat the estimates; the $2.04 non-GAAP EPS was up 4% year-over-year and was 5 cents per share better than expected.\nWhen we turn to Warren Buffett’s purchase, we find that the legendary investor’s new position in ALLE totals 780,133 shares. This holding is currently valued at $130.414 million.\nThis is another stock whose good execution has caught Bank of America’s attention. 5-star analyst Andrew Obin notes the company’s new management and its sound prospects for continued strong results – although he also notes that Allegion’s close connections to the construction industry could be problematic if interest rates remain high. Obin writes of the company, “While Allegion’s end markets have been weak, the company has executed well. Since August 2022 when the current CEO John Stone joined, the Architecture Billings Index (ABI) has only been at or above 50 for six months. Despite the depressed ABI, Allegion has beat on EPS every quarter since Stone has been CEO. We expect the execution to remain strong as the company’s markets bottom\/improve… Our Neutral rating balances Allegion’s consistent execution and the bottoming of the non-resi construction market with Allegion’s exposure to the residential construction market which remains soft in the current high-interest rate environment.”\nObin’s Neutral (i.e., Hold) rating comes along with a $175 price target that implies this stock will gain 5% on the one-year horizon. (To watch Obin’s track record, click here)\nThere are 9 recent analyst reviews here, and their split of 3 Buys and 6 Holds gives the stock its Moderate Buy consensus rating. ALLE shares are currently trading for $167.17 and have an average price target of $171.56, suggesting the shares will stay rangebound for the time being.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.54%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -1.37%.\nStock indexes settled mixed on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq 100 falling to a 1.5-week low and the Dow Jones industrials posting a new all-time high. Tuesday’s selloff in chip makers and the Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks weighed on the overall market.\nOn the positive side, Home Depot recovered from early losses and closed up more than +3% to push the Dow Jones industrials to a new record high after it reported a +3% jump in July comparable same-store sales. Lowes and Target will report their earnings on Wednesday, and Walmart will report on Thursday.\nLower bond yields on Tuesday were supportive of stocks, as the 10-year T-note yield fell -3 bp to 4.30%. US government debt garnered support Tuesday after S&P Global Ratings affirmed its AA+ long-term rating and A-1+ short-term rating on US debt and said the US can maintain its credit strength despite the fiscal hit of its recent spending bill because tariff revenues will “generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes.”\nTuesday’s US housing news was mixed. US Jul housing starts unexpectedly rose +5.2% m\/m to a 5-month high of 1.428 million, stronger than expectations of a decline to 1.297 million. However, Jul building permits, a proxy for future construction, fell -2.8% m\/m to a 5-year low of 1.354 million, weaker than expectations of -0.5% m\/m to 1.386 million.\nDiplomatic talks over the war in Ukraine continue to make headway. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said he came away with a commitment from President Trump late Monday to join security guarantees for any peace deal and reserve discussion on territorial swaps with Russia for later. President Trump is pushing for a summit between Presidents Putin and Zelenskiy soon, and European leaders are discussing a plan to send British and French troops to Ukraine as part of a peace agreement. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.\nThe focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000 and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July.

Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 87% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday.

Now that we're over the mid-day hump, we'll take the magnifying glass to the top movers (and losers) today.\nAnalog Devices\nIn a day where semiconductor companies are down, Analog Devices (ADI) (+3.5%) is in the unique position of being up. In fact, it's the top stock in the Nasdaq 100 right now (and the #2 stock in the S&P 500). The company's quarterly earnings report is to credit for the modest pop, with strong results and higher guidance buoying the stock today.\nTarget\nToday's most-anticipated earnings report wasn't one that anybody had high hopes for. I guess you could say that they didn't hit the Target (sorry.) That's probably why it's on the other end of the market; the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 today is Target (TGT) (-7.48%), with same-store sales continuing to decline. To read more, scroll down to our section about the Target Turnover.\nRegeneron\nThe pharmaceutical company Regeneron (REGN) (+3%) is jumping after the Food & Drug Administration indicated that it would extend the review period for the company's EYLEA HD injection, crediting a 'recent inspection of a third-party manufacturer' for a change in decision.\nIntel\nIt sucks being the main character, but chipmaker Intel (INTC) (-6.3%) has been making the most of it. Amid murmurs that the White House is going to convert the company's CHIPS Act money into equity, Intel scored a cool $2 billion investment from SoftBank. But today, it's down amid reports that they're shopping for even more investors, dangling discounted equity as a carrot.\nPalantir\nThe secretive AI company powering some of the stock market's most absurd gains seems to be cooling off. Palantir (PLTR) (-4%) is off its intraday lows, but still among the worst-performing components in both the S&P and Nasdaq today. Some analysts have warned that the stock, which some have called 'the most overvalued of all-time' is set for a pullback. It's on track for its sixth straight session, down 20% over that period of time.\nUpdate: 11:08 a.m. ET\nWhy Is the Nasdaq Doing So Poorly?\nStocks are now near session lows, led by the Nasdaq Composite (-1.63%). The S&P 500 (-0.97%) also isn't doing so hot. Why?\nWell, it kind of speaks for itself:\nWe've seen this one before... AI picks are sagging yet again, off to a downright horrendous start to the morning.\nAt last look, Palantir (PLTR) (-8.7%) is having another near-double digit day of losses. It's one of the worst-performing stocks on the market today again.\nIt's followed by AI hardware plays like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (-4.02%), Broadcom (-3.37%), and Nvidia (NVDA) (-3.14%).\nAnd other than that, other big tech plays like Tesla (TSLA) (-3.55%), Amazon (AMZN) (-2.49%), Google (GOOGL) , and Meta (META) are all down more than 2% this morning.\nReally, the only way that things could be worse for you right now is if you're in the unfortunate position of having a portfolio mostly built exclusively out of retail popular stocks. More on that later.\nUpdate: 10:32 a.m. ET\nThe Berkshire Comeback Begins?\nWhen Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett said he'd retire at the end of 2025, handing the chief job to long-time successor Greg Abel, the conglomerate's shares started to sag. Things might finally be turning a corner. Our very own Charley Blaine has the latest on the company's latest moves.\nMaybe it's just déjà vu, but we've seen this picture a lot recently: Dow up, everybody else down. This morning, the Dow (+0.11%) is the only index in the green. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (-0.22%), Nasdaq (-0.59%), and Russell 2000 (-0.78%) are in the red.\nIf you're wondering how we got here, blame tech. Yesterday, we touched on how mega-cap tech and AI names dragged down the broader market.\nMany such cases. It has been the reason for the pullback in recent days. And today, it's the same deal. In fact, from the looks of it, it might well be worsening this morning if the numbers at the starting gun are any indication.\nUpdate: 7:43 a.m. ET\nFutures Flat Before the Open\nFutures started to the downside, but have been trending up all morning. All four major U.S. indexes are pointing to either a modest loss or gain at the open, with the S&P 500 down just 9 bips before the market open.\nUpdate: 7:12 a.m. ET\nTarget Taps COO for Top Job in Exec Shakeup\nTarget (TGT) was once the envy of retailer for its beloved stance among the millennial crowd. No longer. In fact, it's hard to remember the last time that the hypermarket saw sales growth at all. Today, in its latest earnings showing, it reported that comparable sales fell 1.9% year-over-year.\nThat's why it's looking within for the solution, tapping COO Michael Fiddelke to become the company's next CEO. He has worked at the company for 20 years. He will take over in Feb. 2026.\nThe company's once-magnificent stock has been lapped by wholesale competition such as Walmart (WMT) and ecommerce names like Amazon (AMZN) , both of which offer a wider range of product at different price points.\nThose giants are also known to steer clear of a controversy; the same can't be said for Target, which tried to 'both sides' its way out of a culture war sparring match. In the end, it simply frustrated everybody.\nTarget's exceptionally bad few years fall on management. Its lost its Tar-jhay again might ultimately lay at his feet of this long-time employee.\nUpdate: 7:01 a.m. ET\nEarnings Today: TJX Companies, Lowe's, Analog Devices\nThere are just 51 earnings set for today, per Nasdaq, but the retail sector is set to make them count. Firms like TJX Companies (TJX) , Lowe's Companies (LOW) , and Target (TGT) are set to dominate the discussion today.\nPer TipRanks, these are the top ten earnings reports of the day, sorted by market capitalization:\nEconomic Data\nToday will be another day of calm before the storm on Friday: Jackson Hole. There, Fed President Jerome Powell is expected to serve up the premier piece of central bank commentary this year.\nIn the meantime, investors will be treated to a handful of reports today, including speeches from the Fed's Waller and Bostic. We'll also get a look at the FOMC Minutes, arguably the most important nugget of insight that we'll get on the economic side today.\nHere's the top reports due out today, per TradingEconomics:","content_hash":"0e27a5abf04f21645f24f8429dd4885a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8479,"method_rank":0}

Clearing and settlement (DTCC) and the Consolidated Tape (SIP) will also need to be upgraded.\nToday we’re going to look at what research says about how overnight trading works now. The data points might help us work out how 24-hour trading should work.\nNot a lot of data on extended-hours trading\nOne problem with understanding how extended-hours trading works is there is not a lot of data on it.\nTo start, extended-hours trading accounts for about 11% of total daily volume. As the volume curves in Chart 1 show, most of extended-hours trading occurs in the hours right before and after regular hours trading. Overnight trading (8 p.m. to 4 a.m.) accounts for only 0.2% of the total equity market volume.\nChart 1: Volumes across the 24-hour day, and the proportion of on and off-exchange\nWe already talked about what is the best time to actually “end the day,” based on the fact that some Asian markets open before midnight in the U.S. Chart 1 shows that that not only is there (a lot) less liquidity after hours, but a lot of it is also traded in off-exchange trading – although there is still on-exchange trading when exchanges are open (from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m.).\nWhy do we care about extended-hours trading?\nImportantly, the rules of trading are also different. There is no NBBO and no OPR (order protection rule). That means “trade-throughs,” or fills at worse prices than exchange prices, are allowed and there is no 605 reporting to account for how much trade-throughs cost investors.\nMarket volatility trading bands (like LULD and Market-Wide Circuit Breakers) are also not available to protect investors. In fact, the SIP isn’t even open from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m., making it impossible to report trades during those times.\nLooking at the research that has been done\nRecently, a number of research papers have been done by academics, looking at overnight and extended-hours trading. Today, we focus on what those academics have found.\nThe academics consistently suggest that overnight trading is primarily used by retail investors, and they pay much higher trading costs overnight. Many studies indicate that retail investors still need help guaranteeing low execution costs and good trade prices, especially when exchanges don’t provide competitive quotes to protect the market.\n1. Most overnight volume comes from retail investors in the Asian region\nWe know that earnings, and some economic data, are typically announced just outside of regular market hours. That news creates some additional trading, most likely from professional investors. That’s consistent with a 2003 paper by Barclay and Hendershott. It also likely explains the elevated trading near the open and the close in Chart 1, but not the trading after most in the U.S. have gone to sleep.\nA recent study suggests that the trading while the SIP is closed (8 p.m. to 4 a.m.), also sometimes called overnight trading, is dominated by retail investors. The study’s data source suggests that 80% of the volume comes from the Asian-Pacific region, with around half of that originating in Korea. The rest — just 20% — primarily comes from U.S. retail investors.\nChart 2: Makeup of overnight trading participants\n2. Market quality is notably worse when exchanges are not quoting\nWe have shown in the past how the use of rebates to incentivize competitive NBBO quotes helps narrow the spread during regular trading hours.\nHowever, overnight trading operates fundamentally differently from regular hour trading. Currently, no exchanges operate overnight. Instead, trading occurs off-exchange (as Chart 1 shows). With less exchange trading and less competition for lit quotes, we see that spreads widen after-hours.\nThe research from the recent study shows that stocks that:\n- Trade overnight every day: Only 393 stocks traded every day during their sample period. For those:\n- The quoted spread was around 40% higher during overnight.\n- The depth was only 47% of the regular hours.\n- Stocks trade overnight: Only 3,026 stocks traded at all during their sample period.\n- The quoted spread on was around 144% higher during overnight.\n- Interestingly, on average for all stocks, depth is comparable to that during regular hours.\nChart 3a: Depth and spreads are worse overnight\nWith overnight spread wider and depth lower, most traders would expect trading costs to be higher. In fact, that’s exactly what this study found. Effective spreads on retail orders were around 3 times the size of those executed during regular hours, and price impact was around 6 times larger.\nChart 3b: Overnight trading cost is much higher\n3. Lack of OPR and 605 might add to overnight execution costs\nAnother paper by Hendershott and Barclay (2003) shows that extended-hour trading (4 p.m. – 9:30 a.m.) cost is 4-5 times larger than regular hours. That compares to the Werner, Eaton and Shkilko (2025) paper above which found that overnight trading (8 p.m. - 4 a.m.) was 3-6 times.\nInterestingly, the study by Werner also found the majority of overnight executions happen at or worse than the best quoted price – and there are almost no orders with price improvement.\nChart 4: Overnight orders “trade through” exchange quotes\n4. Liquidity providers maximize spread capture – adding cost to retail orders\nDuring the day, the combination of the Order Protection Rule (OPR), Execution Quality (605) reports and competition help to protect retail investors. During extended hours, none is in force.\nSometimes, in order to protect retail customers from their market orders trading through a thin market, and increasing their execution costs, orders are automatically converted to limit orders.\nA study out of the University of Cincinnati noticed that, between 2018 and 2022, this practice may have actually increased retail trading costs. The data shows executions “clustered” close to the 5% limit (Chart 4) during extended hours. Then, as soon as the practice stopped (at 6 p.m.) the effective spreads reported no longer clustered right below 5%.\nThe academics argued that this indicated that sophisticated traders adapted their algorithms to maximize spread capture from this automatic collaring.\nChart 5: Sophisticated investors profit from retail investors\nSome studies suggest shorter hours might improve market quality\nNot all studies suggest longer hours are better.\nAnother study looked at European trading. It suggested that their “longer” trading day (typically 8.5 hours compared to 6.5 hours in the U.S.) might actually be harming market quality and adding to execution costs.\nThey use the times when the U.S. and Europe daylight savings changes create a stronger overlap of hours. They show that European markets have better spreads and depth when the markets overlap. In short, the authors argue that shortening the European day (specifically opening closer to U.S. hours) would concentrate liquidity better in the European opening and improve the market quality.\nInvestor protection, and rewarding lit quotes, is still important\nPerhaps what these studies show best of all is the value that exchanges and lit quotes provide to the market. Sure, with less liquidity after hours, spreads are likely to be wider. But this data shows that trading at times when there is no OPR, NBBO or 605 requirements might also make some retail trading costs unnecessarily higher.\nThis, in turn, shows the importance of having competitive lit quotes. Although as the European study also shows, getting market makers to compete over a longer timeframe might also be a challenge.\nShiyun Song, Economic Research Principal at Nasdaq, contributed to this article.\nMarket Makers Newsletter\nGet market insights and analysis from Nasdaq Chief Economist Phil Mackintosh straight to your inbox\nLatest articles\nThis data feed is not available at this time.","content_hash":"5f6ef06e8458c3d790422ece3e97d4e8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8119,"method_rank":0}

Washington has not placed secondary tariffs on China for its Russian oil purchases.\nIndia has reiterated that it was the U.S. administration that had asked it to purchase Russian oil to keep the markets calm, while pointing to the European Union and even the U.S.' existing trade with Moscow.\nThe country has taken aim at Washington, saying U.S. continues to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry, palladium for the electric-vehicle industry, as well as fertilizers and chemicals from Russia. U.S. bilateral trade with Russia in 2024 stood at $5.2 billion, down from nearly $36 billion in 2021, government data showed.\nBilateral trade between New Delhi and Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the year ended March 2025. In comparison, the European Union's trade with Russia stood at 67.5 billion euros ($78.1 billion) in 2024, while its services trade in 2023 was at 17.2 billion euros, according to European Commission data.\n\"India has been victimized by these pressure tactics that that the Trump administration is trying to carry out. Trump is clearly using tariffs as a pressure tactic against Russia,\" Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at Washington-based think tank Wilson Center, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\"\nAnother factor determining the U.S. approach to India is that Trump feels \"aggrieved,\" over how Modi undercut his bid to claim credit for playing a role in the India-Pakistan ceasefire, Kugelman emphasized.\nAdding to Trump's grievances is India's \"unwillingness to lower barriers\" to exports of American agricultural products such as soybeans and corn, Kevin Chen Xian An, associate research fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies pointed out.\nOil trade for ceasefire\nTrump's true agenda has little to do with Washington's stated goal of curbing Moscow's oil revenues, but extracting leverages from the trading partners, according to several geopolitics experts.\n\"The overarching objective for the Trump administration is to extract concessions from countries to figure out some justification for levying taxes on trade so that the government can fund its tax reductions on American citizens' income,\" said Drew Thompson, senior fellow at the think-tank RSIS.\n\"It's not based on foreign policy principles [but] on power politics and gaining leverage,\" Thompson added.\nLast week, Trump rolled out a red carpet to greet Putin on his first visit to the U.S. in about a decade, sharing a ride with him in the presidential limousine to the venue.\nWhile the meeting did not appear to have produced meaningful steps toward a ceasefire in Ukraine — a goal U.S. had set ahead of the summit — but Trump described the meeting as \"productive.\"\nSpeaking at the joint news briefing following the talks, Putin reiterated that \"for the conflict resolution in Ukraine to be long-term and lasting, all the root causes of the crisis ... must be eliminated; all of Russia's legitimate concerns must be taken into account.\"\nKirill Dmitriev, one of Putin's top negotiators, hailed Monday's talks in Washington as an \"important day of diplomacy,\" emphasizing Moscow's opposition to any short-term ceasefire deal with Ukraine.\nTrump is trying to \"maximize his leverage ... pressuring India, and Russia via India,\" to get a trade deal with the former and a ceasefire pact with the latter, said Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical and U.S. strategist at BCA Research. These will eventually help boost Republicans' prospects in the upcoming midterm election, Gertken added.\nNot provoking China\nWhile India faces steep tariffs for its purchases of Russian crude, China, which has remained the largest importer of Russian crude, has been spared such levies. Trump said last Friday he was not considering retaliatory tariffs on China for buying Russian oil, but might consider it in two or three weeks.\nChina's purchases of Russian oil have risen to 46% of overall exports from Russia in the first half of this year, from 34% in 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, followed by India which imported around 36% of Russia's supplies.\nWhen asked about China's role in Russian oil purchases, Bessent suggested that Beijing's imports were less egregious in the eyes of the Trump administration because it had already been a big buyer even before Russia invaded Ukraine.\nGoing soft on China may also reflect Trump's desire not to scuttle a potential high-profile summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming months and the conclusion of a lasting trade deal, said Stephen Olson, a senior visiting fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.\nThe secondary tariffs on India may be intended as \"a shot across Russia's bow\" to show that the U.S. could turn up the pressure by extending similar tariffs to China, if Russia is not more compliant, Olson added.\nFollowing weeks of escalating tensions, Beijing and Washington agreed in May to suspend the hefty duties and loosen several punitive measures imposed in April, as both sides continued to work on hammering out a durable deal.\nBeijing has leveraged its sheer dominance of rare-earth minerals crucial for military and industrial use in its negotiations with Washington, maintaining a tight control on exports of the critical minerals.\nThe relationship with China is complicated, and the Trump administration has not yet come out with \"a clear, coherent policy toward China. Sometimes it seems like it wants to compete with China economically. Other times it seems like it wants to reach some type of understanding or a or a detente,\" Kugelman said.","content_hash":"90d16c0564d3d5d64e23aa1a4fdc2c4d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7942,"method_rank":0}

The company said it felt pressure on profits for the period, including from some one-time expenses, such as restructuring costs, pricier insurance claims and litigation settlements.\nWalmart said it now expects net sales to grow between 3.75% and 4.75% for the fiscal year, up from its previous expectations for 3% to 4%. It raised its adjusted earnings per share outlook slightly to $2.52 to $2.62, up from a prior range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company is working hard to keep prices low – including speeding up imports from overseas and stepping up the number of Rollbacks, or limited-time discounts, in its stores.\n\"This is managed on an item-by-item and category-by-category basis,\" he said. \"There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we've had to pass some of those costs along.\"\nBut he added \"tariff-impacted costs are continuing to drift upwards.\"\nEven so, Rainey said Walmart hasn't seen a change in customer spending. For example, sales of private-label items, which typically cost less than national brands, were roughly flat year over year, he said.\n\"Everyone is looking to see if there are any creaks in the armor or anything that's happening with the consumer, but it's been very consistent,\" he said. \"They continue to be very resilient.\"\nYet on the company's earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said middle- and lower-income households have been more sensitive to tariff-related price increases, particularly in discretionary categories.\n\"We see a corresponding moderation in units at the item level as customers switch to other items, or in some cases, categories,\" he said.\nHere's what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 74 cents expected\n- Revenue: $177.40 billion vs. $176.16 billion\nWalmart shares fell 4% in morning trading Thursday.\nWalmart's net income jumped to $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including legal charges, Walmart reported adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents.\nRevenue rose from $169.34 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nComparable sales for Walmart U.S. climbed 4.6% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, as both the grocery and health and wellness category saw strong growth. That was higher than the 4% increase that analysts expected. The industry metric, also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.\nAt Sam's Club, comparable sales jumped 5.9% excluding fuel, higher than the 5.2% that analysts anticipated.\nE-commerce sales jumped 25% globally and 26% in the U.S., as both online purchases and advertising grew. In the U.S., Walmart said sales through store-fulfilled delivery of groceries and other items grew nearly 50% year over year, with one-third of those orders expedited. The company charges a fee for some of those faster deliveries, and others are included as a benefit of its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+.\nIts global advertising business grew 46% year over year, including Vizio, the smart TV maker it acquired for $2.3 billion last year. Its U.S. advertising business, Walmart Connect, grew by 31%.\nAs Walmart's online business drums up more revenue from home deliveries, advertising and commissions from sellers on its third-party marketplace, e-commerce has become a profitable business. The company marked a milestone in May — posting its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally.\nRainey said Thursday that Walmart doubled its e-commerce profitability in the fiscal second quarter from the prior quarter.\nIn the U.S., shoppers both visited Walmart more and spent more on those trips during the quarter. Customer transactions rose 1.5% year over year and the average ticket increased 3.1% for Walmart's U.S. business.\nAs the largest U.S. retailer, Walmart offers a unique window into the financial health of American households. As higher duties have come in fits and starts — with some getting delayed and others going into effect earlier this month — Wall Street has tried to understand how those costs will ripple through the U.S. economy.\nWalmart warned in May that it would have to raise some prices due to higher levies on imports, even with its size and scale. The company's comments drew the ire of President Donald Trump, who said in a social media post that Walmart should \"EAT THE TARIFFS.\"\nAbout a third of what Walmart sells in the U.S. comes from other parts of the world, with China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam and India representing its largest markets for imports, Rainey said in May.\nAccording to an analysis by CNBC of about 50 items sold by the retailer, some of those price changes have already hit shelves. Items that rose in price at Walmart over the summer included a frying pan, a pair of jeans and a car seat.\nRainey on Thursday declined to specify items or categories where Walmart had increased prices, saying the company is \"trying to keep prices as low as we can.\"\nHe said one of the company's strategies has been bringing in inventory early, particularly for Sam's Club as it gets ready for the second half of the fiscal year and its crucial holiday season. At the end of the quarter, inventory was up about 3.5% at Sam's Club, Rainey said. It was up 2.2% for Walmart U.S.\nOn the company's earnings call, McMillon said the impact of tariffs has been \"gradual enough that any behavioral adjustments by the customer have been somewhat muted.\"\n\"But as we replenish inventory at post-tariff price levels, we've continued to see our costs increase each week, which we expect will continue into the third and fourth quarters,\" he said.\nYet even with higher costs from tariffs, Walmart has fared better than its retail competitors as it has leaned into its reputation for value, competed on faster deliveries to customers' homes and attracted more business from higher-income households.\nThe Arkansas-based retailer's performance has diverged sharply from rival Target, which posted another quarter of sales declines on Wednesday and named the new CEO who will be tasked with trying to turn around the company.\nWalmart has gained from Target's struggles. It has followed the Target playbook by launching more exclusive and trend-driven brands, including grocery brand BetterGoods and activewear brand Love & Sports. It has also expanded its third-party marketplace to include prestige beauty brands and more.\nSales of general merchandise, items outside of the grocery department, were a bright spot for Walmart in the fiscal second quarter, Rainey said. That category struggled during peak inflation in recent years, as consumers spent less on discretionary items because of rising grocery bills.\nComparable sales for general merchandise rose by a low single-digit percentage and accelerated throughout the quarter, Rainey told CNBC. He added clothing and fashion sales \"really shined for us.\"","content_hash":"cc97a8bc9df8c2354747a34a56b55c14","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7652,"method_rank":0}

Ford shares are still priced where they were in 2002, after all, even if decent dividends have been paid for most of the meantime.\nWhat's not clear is if this is the best move Ford could make at this time to get shares moving again. Here's what investors need to know about the plan.\nThis investment rethinks its electric vehicles from the ground up\nThe company's already in the EV business, to be clear. It makes a handful of hybrids, although its highest-profile electric vehicles are arguably its all-electric F-150 Lightning and a pretty cool all-electric Mustang called the Mach-E.\nWith the exception of their batteries and electric motors, however, these EVs are still designed and manufactured rather similarly to ordinary combustion-powered automobiles. Ford's $5 billion plan includes a whole new kind of assembly line specifically for electric vehicles. And not just one. This assembly line will be capable of supporting the manufacture of several different kinds of vehicles including a light pickup truck with a targeted starting price point of around $30,000.\nMore than half of the $5 billion investment, however, will be made in the lithium batteries required by all electric vehicles. Ford says its new battery tech can lower the size and cost of EV batteries by around one-third without sacrificing any range per charge, solving one of the EV industry's biggest lingering problems.\nFord's existing EV business isn't exactly thrilling ... or profitable\nAs exciting as this decision may be, again, it's not exactly Ford's foray into the electric vehicle market. It's the company's second (and perhaps third) chapter. And its story to date hasn't exactly been thrilling. The aforementioned Mustang Mach-E became available in 2021, while the F-150 Lightning and a new delivery van reached the market in 2022. A few more Ford-made hybrids have been unveiled since then as well. Yet, Ford only sold $3.9 billion worth of electric vehicles last year, down 35% year over year, and only accounting for about 2% of its total top line of $185 billion. Its EV arm also lost a little over $5 billion in 2024, on an operating basis.\nIt's a concern simply because it's difficult to determine if the challenge is a lack of production scale, a lack of demand, or a combination of both.\nThe ambitious goal may be aimed at the wrong market\nFord will almost certainly do it right. But, figuring out how to make an affordable and marketable electric vehicle may be of little actual benefit to shareholders.\nSimply put, Americans as a whole are anything but stoked about battery-powered automobiles. A recent survey performed by the American Automobile Association (which you know as AAA) indicates that only 16% of U.S. adults are likely or very likely to purchase a fully electric automobile. That's down from 2024's figure of 18%, marking three years of declines from 2022's 25%. Conversely, the number of American consumers who are unlikely or very unlikely to purchase an EV has grown from 51% to 63% during that four-year stretch.\nFord isn't just a U.S. company, to be clear. It also makes and markets vehicles overseas -- even if largely through partnerships -- where EVs are considerably and increasingly more marketable. For instance, the International Energy Agency believes that 80% of China's new automobile sales will be EVs by 2030, versus only about half of the country's new-car sales now.\nFord is mostly an American company though, where it produces roughly two-thirds of its total sales and very nearly all of its profits. And, while the U.S. company's electric vehicle production know-how and battery technology could be utilized elsewhere, it's difficult not to notice the American-ness of its $5 billion plan. The EV production facility in question is located in Louisville, Kentucky, while the new-tech lithium batteries will be manufactured in Marshall, Michigan. Let's also not look past the fact that the one vehicle Ford has touted that will be made by this new assembly line is a low-cost pickup truck, which, of course, is wildly more popular here than anywhere else in the world.\nThis is (almost) an all-in bet on the company's future\nGiven the American-centric nature of Ford's big investment in EVs, largely aimed at a market that isn't exactly in love with battery-powered vehicles, the concerns being voiced are understandable.\nAlthough the cost doesn't quite present the existential crisis that some analysts are hinting at, it is a sizable bet for any struggling company that only clears about $5 billion in net income per year and is sitting on more than $100 billion in long-term liabilities. If Americans don't come around on electric vehicles by the time they start coming off of Ford's new assembly line in 2027, the company's current challenges will only worsen. As such, there's no room for any error here, including errors in judgment as to the future marketability of EVs in the United States. That's why any interested investor will want to think very carefully before plowing into a new stake in this carmaker.\nStill, with Ford shares priced at only about 8 times next year's expected per-share earnings of $1.40 and a trailing dividend yield of just over 5%, it seems most (if not all) of this risk is already priced in. It wouldn't be unreasonable to find a little bit of room in your portfolio for Ford stock at this time. You just might want to contain your risk by keeping any position in this name smaller than you might normally take on.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ford Motor Company right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Ford Motor Company, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ford Motor Company wasn’t one of them.

That's when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will address the central bank's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Investors will be listening carefully to Powell for hints on whether central bankers might cut interest rates as many three times before the end of the year, as the market thought was possible a week ago, or whether they will, at best, cut only twice, as the market thinks now after the rather hawkish minutes of the Fed's July meeting were released Wednesday afternoon. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the base case for the year remains at two rate cuts, where it has been for a while. The wild card? The odds of only one or up to three. The market this week has signaled which stocks might do better under each of those extremes. In the acute rotation that began on Tuesday, when the up-to-three rate cuts by year-end scenario was on the table, we saw investors book profits in momentum stocks and high-growth year-to-date winners and buy value-oriented and lower multiple names that can actually benefit from more cuts via upward earnings revisions. Stocks like Palantir , for which three or one rate cuts mean nothing in the face of their ties to artificial intelligence and other secular trends, were sold heavily Tuesday and into Wednesday's session. Names like Club stock Home Depot , which needs lower policy rates to spur cheaper mortgages, were bought. Investors looked past Home Depot's quarterly earnings and revenue misses to signs of a better back half of the year. When the Fed minutes came out Wednesday afternoon, the market rotation eased. Palantir bottomed and closed off its lows on Wednesday and made it into the green Thursday. Home Depot, on the other hand, came off Wednesday's session highs and closed lower. The stock was lower again Thursday. Again, fewer rate cuts means earnings revisions won't be upwardly revised as much as we may have thought to start the week. If Home Depot, or any other rate beneficiary, was priced for two cuts, but we could see three, investors had reason to believe the earnings estimates were too low. That thesis doesn't hold up, though, if the odds of that third rate cut diminish or go to one. The reason all this attention is on the Fed is that low rates are generally considered to be positive for stock valuations. Whether you want to value a stock via the lens of a discounted cash flow model or a multiples-based price-to-earnings ratio , lower rates tend to result in a higher present value for stocks. That's especially true for the high flyers that don't have much profit, if any, in the present but are expected to see robust earnings grow in the future. The reason? Future earnings have a higher present value at a lower rate because they are discounted back at a lower rate. That textbook school of thought, however, does appear to conflict with the real-world market action of the past couple of days, with premium-valuation stocks getting hit as investors started to price-in a more dovish Fed, only for the rotation to let up as soon as the Fed minutes dropped and pointed to central bankers, perhaps, maintaining more of a hawkish stance after all. Historically, it's been the other way around. It comes down to relative year-to-date performance and which companies need low rates to win. While lower rates do result in a higher present value being ascribed to future earnings, the current growth names, largely tied to the AI investment trade, have proven their ability to grow regardless of the interest rate environment. Low rates may help momentum stocks' valuation, but they don't do much in terms of upward revisions to earnings estimates over the next three to six months — again, many don't even have real earnings to begin with. More cyclical names, on the other hand, stand to see earnings estimates revised higher as they generate money here and now. Lower rates can also catalyze business investments among a host of others. Palantir probably isn't going to make more money in the third and fourth quarters because the Fed lowers the overnight bank lending rate 75 basis points instead of 50 basis points. Home Depot, on the other hand, absolutely stands to make more money should rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage finally dip under 6.5%, a historically important level that has led to increased housing activity. In 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates from the Covid-era level of near 0%, the market move was out of the growth names and into more mature names that were making money. Back then, our mantra for the year was to only invest in companies with real earnings. \"We do not want companies that only grow sales but lose boatloads of money,\" Jim Cramer told Club members then, adding that 2022 was the year that \"you want to own companies that make stuff, that do tangible things, that innovate.\" The focus then was on what rates meant for valuation. When the cost of money is cheap or non-existent, as was the case during the pandemic, some investors could rationalize speculating on a flying car company's potential earnings 10 years out, but if the cost to borrow rises, then the more traditional view is it's better to own a real car company whose valuation is based on its current financial profile. The focus now is less on valuation dynamics and more on earnings revisions. Helping that move is also the simple fact that so much money has been made this year in the high-flyers that investors are ready to jump on any reason they can to book profits there and rotate into year-to-date underperformers such health care, which is the third worst performing sector in the S & P 500 year-to-date but leading to the upside this week. Bottom line So, as we await Powell's Jackson Hole speech, be mindful of this dynamic and understand that while a dovish tone has traditionally been supportive of the high-flying growth stocks due to valuation dynamics, that may not be the case this time around. Wall Street is more focused on near-term earnings revisions than valuation model dynamics. If dovish talk is, as it should be, taken to mean lower mortgage rates and more infrastructure investments, it will be the economically sensitive, cyclical names that benefit, more so than the secular growth names that are tied to themes like AI that couldn't care less about 25, 50, or even 75 basis point changes in the federal funds rate.

Today, however, the race has accelerated.\nQuantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) to achieve exponential processing power, compared to other computers, which process information in bits (either zero or one). With advances in hardware, networking, artificial intelligence (AI), and commercialization, the global quantum computing market is getting closer to being a $12.6 billion market by 2032. This has piqued investors’ interest in this emerging technology.\nWhich companies will lead the race ahead? Let’s find out.\nQuantum Computing Stock #1: IonQ\nWith a market cap of $11.9 billion, IonQ (IONQ) is a pure-play quantum computing company that designs, builds, and operates quantum computers. The company’s goal is to make quantum computing practical and commercially viable, while also laying the groundwork for future quantum networks.\nWhile IONQ stock is down 11% year to date, it has returned 410% over the past year.\nIn the second quarter, the company reported revenue of $20.7 million, which was 15% higher than expected. The highlight of the quarter was the $1 billion equity investment closed in July, representing the largest single investment in quantum computing and networking history. This financing increased IonQ’s pro forma cash balance to $1.6 billion, giving it the financial flexibility to carry out its aggressive expansion plans. However, it raised concerns about share dilution and the timeline for profitable growth.\nAt the same time, IonQ is investing heavily in growth. In the second quarter, R&D spending increased by 231% year on year to $103.4 million, reflecting significant investment in scaling quantum networking and computing capabilities. This resulted in a net loss of $177.5 million, although management stressed that this was due to strategic scaling rather than operational weaknesses.\nBesides the U.S., IonQ is rapidly expanding its global presence through strategic partnerships with Japan and South Korea. Aside from government collaborations, IonQ highlighted a 20x speedup in quantum-accelerated drug development with AstraZeneca (AZN), Amazon’s (AMZN) AWS, and Nvidia (NVDA), combining hardware access with hybrid workflows.\nFurthermore, IonQ’s acquisitions of Lightsynq, Oxford Ionics, and Capella Space Corporation provide the foundation for the industry’s most ambitious quantum roadmap. The company aims for 800 logical qubits by 2027, with an ambitious goal of 80,000 logical qubits by early 2030. For 2025, IonQ increased its full-year revenue guidance to between $82 million and $100 million, in line with consensus estimates. Analysts further project revenue increase of 87% to $170.9 million in 2026.\nLooking ahead, IonQ’s long-term goals go far beyond selling standalone quantum computers. Management described the company’s vision as a seamlessly connected quantum ecosystem in which quantum processors, sensors, and communication endpoints interact securely across terrestrial and space networks.\nCEO Niccolo de Masi emphasized that IonQ has a competitive advantage derived from decades of R&D and vertical integration, allowing it to lead as the industry transitions from theory to commercialization. He stated, “We were first to operate on all three of the Google, Amazon, and Microsoft public clouds five years ago. Looking forward, we believe our unit economic advantages will underpin IONQ’s long-term market share leadership.”\nWith a fortified balance sheet, an expanding global presence, and a growing ecosystem of commercial and government partners, IonQ is positioning itself to be a clear leader in this field.\nOverall, on Wall Street, IONQ is a “Moderate Buy.” Among the eight analysts covering IONQ stock, four rate it a “Strong Buy,” one gives it a “Moderate Buy” rating, while three suggest a “Hold.” Its average price target of $49.57 suggests the stock can rally 36% from current levels. The high price estimate of $70 implies upside potential of 94% over the next 12 months.\nQuantum Computing Stock #2: D-Wave Quantum\nValued at $5.7 billion, D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) is a quantum computing company that takes a very different approach than most other players in the industry. Instead of developing gate-based quantum computers like IonQ, IBM, or Google, D-Wave focuses on quantum annealing, a technique used to solve optimization problems.\nD-Wave stock has surged 84% year-to-date, outperforming the broader market. The stock has also returned an eye-catching 1,567% over the past year.\nCustomers can access D-Wave’s quantum computers via the Leap cloud platform, which provides real-time access to its most recent machines, such as the Advantage system with over 5,000 qubits.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue came in at $3.1 million, up 42% year-over-year. A key contributor to this increase was $1 million in revenue from the Advantage2 quantum processing unit (QPU) upgrade at the Jülich Supercomputing Center. Bookings surged as well, totaling $1.3 million, a 92% increase from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted gross margin stood at 71.8%, down slightly from 73.1% in the year-ago period.\nD-Wave emphasized that its growing sales pipeline is increasingly dominated by large enterprises and Global 2000 companies. Over the last four quarters, D-Wave has collaborated with over 100 revenue-generating customers, including nearly two dozen Forbes Global 2000 firms from the commercial, government, and research sectors. Given its aggressive R&D spending, the adjusted net loss stood at $25.3 million, compared to $20 million a year earlier.\nOne of the quarter’s highlights was D-Wave’s record cash balance of $819.3 million, which was fueled by $400 million raised from the company’s fourth at-the-market equity program and $99.3 million from warrant exercises, among other things. Despite increased net losses, management emphasized that D-Wave is poised to be the “first independent publicly held quantum computing company to achieve sustained profitability.”\nInterestingly, the company believes it can accomplish this with significantly less funding than its competitors, owing to its hybrid business model of quantum cloud services, system sales, and expanding enterprise partnerships. Analysts predict a revenue increase of 178.2% in fiscal 2025, followed by a 55.9% increase to $38.3 million in fiscal 2026.\nOverall, Wall Street rates D-Wave’s stock a “Strong Buy.” Among the 11 analysts covering the stock, nine rate it a “Strong Buy,” one rates it a “Moderate Buy” and one says it is a “Hold.” The stock’s average target price of $21.20 suggests upside potential of 39% from current levels. Plus, its high-end estimate of $30 suggests it has the potential to rally up to 96% over the next 12 months.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

For many new retirees, it’s also when costly financial mistakes can set the stage for decades of money problems. Aaron Channing has seen these mistakes firsthand. As a partner and private wealth advisor at Fortivus Wealth Group, a Northwestern Mutual Private Client Group, he works with clients navigating the transition from earning to spending their nest eggs.\nBe Aware: 6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early\nRead Next: 5 Cities You Need To Consider If You're Retiring in 2025\nThe mistakes he sees aren’t just about poor planning. They’re about failing to adjust to a completely different financial reality. Here are the four biggest money mistakes Channing said new retirees make in their first year.\nMany new retirees make a dangerous assumption. They think they can keep the same aggressive investment approach that worked during their earning years.\n“A common oversight among new retirees is neglecting to shift their investment approach to reflect their new financial reality,” Channing explained. “Continuing with a high-risk strategy in retirement can expose assets to unnecessary volatility, which may be harder to recover from without a steady income.”\nThe problem is timing. During working years, aggressive growth strategies make sense because you have decades to recover from market downturns. You also have a steady paycheck to keep adding money to your accounts.\nRetirement changes everything. You no longer have decades to recover from losses. You also don’t have earned income to build accounts back up after market crashes.\n“Transitioning to a more conservative investment strategy doesn’t mean abandoning growth entirely,” Channing shared. “Instead, it involves rebalancing the portfolio to prioritize capital preservation and reduced exposure to market fluctuations.”\nThe key is finding the right balance for your specific situation. Someone planning frequent travel or large discretionary spending needs a different allocation than someone focused on maintaining a modest lifestyle.\n“This is why working with a financial advisor is so valuable,” Channing said. “Advisors serve as impartial experts who can tailor recommendations to align with a retiree’s specific circumstances, helping to ensure that their investment strategy supports both short-term needs and long-term financial security.”\nThe freedom of retirement often triggers a spending urge that can derail even well-planned budgets. New retirees frequently celebrate this milestone with expensive purchases they’ve been dreaming about for years.\n“It’s common for individuals transitioning into retirement to feel compelled to make a significant purchase, such as a vacation home, luxury vehicle or other high-ticket item,” Channing said. “These decisions are often driven by a desire to celebrate a milestone or fulfill a long-held aspiration.”\nThe problem isn’t the desire for nice things. It’s the timing and impact on fixed retirement income.\n“Such purchases can place considerable strain on retirement finances, especially when income becomes more fixed and predictable,” Channing explained.\nThere’s a simple solution. If the purchase is truly essential or deeply meaningful, consider making it during your working years when income is still active and flexible.\n“Alternatively, exploring less costly options that still meet the underlying need can help preserve retirement savings while still providing satisfaction,” he suggested.\nThe key is adjusting your budget before making major purchases, not after. Many new retirees buy first and figure out the financial impact later, which can create lasting problems.\nImpatience often drives one of the costliest mistakes new retirees make. Many people start withdrawing from retirement accounts or claiming Social Security benefits as soon as they’re eligible, despite not knowing the full impact of this move.\n“One of the most common financial missteps in early retirement is accessing retirement accounts or claiming Social Security benefits prematurely,” Channing said. “Without a clear understanding of the tax implications and optimal timing, early withdrawals can trigger higher tax liabilities and significantly shorten the lifespan of retirement savings.”\nThe consequences extend far beyond immediate tax bills. Early withdrawals can affect decades of future income.\n“This can be especially detrimental if the funds are needed to last for several decades,” Channing warned.\nRetirees who can delay tapping into Social Security and other retirement accounts, particularly beyond their full retirement age, can benefit from delayed retirement credits.\n“These credits can substantially increase monthly Social Security payments for life, offering a more secure and predictable income stream,” Channing explained. “Additionally, postponing withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts allows those investments to continue growing, potentially improving long-term financial outcomes.”\nEvery year you delay Social Security past full retirement age adds about 8% to your monthly benefit until age 70. For someone entitled to $2,000 monthly at full retirement age, waiting until 70 could mean an extra $640 per month for life.\nHealthcare costs often blindside new retirees who assume Medicare will cover everything they need. This assumption can be financially devastating.\n“Many retirees mistakenly assume that health insurance or Medicare will fully cover long-term care expenses,” Channing said. “In reality, these programs often fall short, leaving individuals vulnerable to significant out-of-pocket costs if they face an unexpected illness or injury that limits their independence.”\nThe financial impact goes beyond just medical bills. Inadequate planning can force difficult choices about quality of care and your living arrangements.\n“Without proper planning, healthcare and long-term care expenses can strain retirement finances, forcing retirees to settle for limited care options or compromise their preferred living arrangements,” Channing explained.\nPersonal income sources like pensions, Social Security and investment income may help cover ongoing costs. Government programs such as Medicaid or veterans’ benefits can provide additional support.\n“Long-term care insurance is another valuable tool, offering broad coverage at a relatively low premium,” Channing said.\nThe key is planning before you need care, not after. Once health issues arise, insurance options become limited and expensive.\n“Whether through insurance, income planning or a combination of resources, preparing for healthcare and long-term care needs is essential to maintaining both financial stability and quality of life in retirement,” he said.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: I’m a Private Wealth Advisor: 4 Money Mistakes Retirees Make in Their First Year","content_hash":"d73b7178938d6977082dceb811bd3eaf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6897,"method_rank":0}

The hedge fund that first shook-up Salesforce management three years ago just doubled down hard, boosting its stake by nearly 50% in the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Aug. 14. Starboard now holds approximately 1.3 million shares as of June 30, a dramatic surge from 849,679 shares at the end of Q1, when it had already increased its position by a notable 52%. In fact, Starboard's latest move comes at a strategic time.\nCRM stock has been battered this year as investors flee due to slowing revenue growth, shaky execution of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies, and aggressive acquisition spending. These are the exact same red flags that triggered the activist uprising in late 2022 and early 2023, when Starboard teamed up with Third Point, ValueAct, and Elliott Management to demand better margins and operational efficiency.\nMost of those activists cashed out and disappeared by mid-2023 after Salesforce delivered improved results and added board oversight. But Starboard, which is known for circling back when companies backslide on their promises, appears ready to ramp up the pressure again. The hedge fund's latest aggressive stake increase sends a clear message that Salesforce still has some room to improve its efficiency and profitability. That said, would it be wise to load up on CRM shares now?\nAbout Salesforce Stock\nBased in California, Salesforce has been a powerhouse in cloud computing ever since its founding in 1999. Over the years, it has not only pioneered the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model but also secured its dominance in the customer relationship management (CRM) space. Now, Salesforce is busy doubling down on AI, channeling big investments into tools that enhance customer engagement and boost sales team productivity. At the heart of this strategy is Agentforce, unveiled at Dreamforce 2024.\nThe platform promises to automate customer interactions, enabling businesses to scale their services while reducing their reliance on human labor. To further strengthen this vision, Salesforce announced plans this May for an $8 billion all-cash acquisition of Informatica, a leader in AI-powered cloud data management. Informatica’s strength lies in bringing together and cleaning data across silos, exactly the kind of backbone Salesforce needs to unlock the full potential of agentic AI.\nIf completed, this would be Salesforce’s most significant buy since the $27.7 billion Slack deal in 2021. But not everyone is cheering. While the Informatica acquisition was well received in the analyst community, the company’s aggressive spending, coupled with slowing revenue growth, has made some investors uneasy.\nValued at about $235 billion by market capitalization, CRM stock has pulled back 33% from its 52-week high of $369 and is down almost 27% in 2025. By contrast, the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has returned a modest 9% so far this year.\nSalesforce Beats Q1 Estimates\nSalesforce kicked off fiscal 2026 with an impressive start. The company’s first-quarter earnings report published on May 28 topped Wall Street’s expectations and underscored how central AI and Data Cloud have become to its growth story. Revenue climbed 8% year-over-year (YOY) to $9.8 billion, edging past consensus estimates of $9.7 billion. What really stood out, however, was the strength of its AI and Data Cloud business, which has quickly become a significant growth engine.\nAnnual recurring revenue from the unit surpassed the $1 billion milestone, surging more than 120% from last year, with nearly 60% of the company’s top 100 deals now including AI and Data Cloud. The momentum extended to Agentforce, which is already proving its worth. Since its launch, the AI platform has secured over 8,000 deals, with half of these being paid, while processing over 750,000 customer requests. By automating workflows, Agentforce has helped cut case volume by 7% YOY.\nProfitability remained a steady anchor. GAAP operating margin rose to 19.8% from 18.7% a year ago, while non-GAAP margin held firm at 32.3%, slightly above last year’s 32.1%. Adjusted EPS shot up 6% annually to $2.58, comfortably beating estimates of $2.54. Salesforce also prioritized shareholder returns, distributing $3.1 billion through $2.7 billion in buybacks and $402 million in dividends, signaling confidence in its long-term growth prospects.\nLooking ahead, management is staying upbeat. For fiscal Q2, Salesforce is guiding for adjusted EPS of $2.76 to $2.78 on revenue between $10.11 billion and $10.16 billion. For the full year, the company lifted its outlook, calling for $11.27 to $11.33 in adjusted EPS and revenue between $41 billion and $41.3 billion, implying 8% to 9% growth.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Salesforce Stock\nAfter Starboard Value increased its stake in Salesforce, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria upgraded CRM stock to “Neutral” from “Underperform”, maintaining a $225 price target. While still maintaining a cautious stance, Luria emphasized that Starboard’s increased presence could intensify pressure on Salesforce to focus on core growth, maintain margins on the upswing, and avoid expensive, dilutive acquisitions.\nAt the same time, Stifel analyst Parker Lane trimmed his price target to $325 from $375 but reiterated a “Buy” rating. Lane sees a path for the stock to regain momentum if Salesforce can deliver steadier core performance and lift its AI and Data Cloud contributions meaningfully above the $1 billion mark.\nOverall, Wall Street appears highly bullish on CRM stock, with a consensus “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 50 analysts offering recommendations, a majority of 36 analysts advocate a “Strong Buy,” two give a “Moderate Buy,” 11 advise a “Hold,” and the remaining one suggests a “Strong Sell.” The average analyst price target of $349.69 represents potential upside of 42%, while the Street-high target of $440 suggests a 79% rally from current levels.\nFinal Thoughts\nWith activist pressure from Starboard Value back in the picture, Salesforce may once again find itself pushed to sharpen its focus and boost profitability. The hedge fund has previously forced the company to be more disciplined, and with its return, hopes are rising for better efficiency and stronger execution. Moreover, considering the company’s solid fundamentals, growing momentum in AI and Data Cloud, and Wall Street’s bullish outlook, Salesforce appears to be a stock worth keeping on the radar.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

So I think that he'll continue to kind of walk that line.\"\nIndeed, President Donald Trump has kept up a near constant drumbeat against Powell and his colleagues. As he did during much of his first term, Trump has badgered Powell to lower interest rates. But in recent days the president's attacks on the Fed have gone past mere monetary policy.\nEarlier this summer, the White House lashed out at the Fed for a major reconstruction project at its Washington, D.C. headquarters. That coincided with a period when Trump toyed with removing Powell, though he later backed off the idea.\nThen this week the administration trained its focus on Fed Governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud regarding two federally backed loans she took.\nAmid the controversies, Powell could use the speech to at least take a swipe at the political distractions, even if he holds to past practice of not taking direct aim.\nPolitics and policy\n\"He's going to take a jab and talk about Fed independence, because what does he have to lose really at this point?\" said Dan North, senior economist at Allianz Trade North America. \"It seems pretty clear that Trump can't legally fire him. He can certainly put all kinds of tremendous pressure on him. And I think it's an opportunity for Powell to say the central bank's got to stay independent, and that's what we're going to do.\"\nBeyond the politics there's policy, and that also will be challenge.\nThe speech is billed as an \"Economic Outlook and Framework Review,\" indicating Powell will take time to provide his views on broad conditions as well as discuss the Fed's long-term policy goals, a review that occurs every five years.\nMarkets are expecting Powell to tee up a September rate cut. At each of his previous Jackson Hole speeches, starting in 2018, he indicated significant policy shifts. From pushing for quarterly cuts in that first speech to a pivotal switch in how it would view inflation in 2020 to last year's nod towards an aggressive September move, markets have taken their cues from the chair's keynote.\nWall Street commentary reflects similar expectations this time around, if in somewhat subtler terms.\n\"We do not expect Powell to decisively signal a September cut, but the speech should make it clear to markets that he is likely to support one,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle said in a note.\nKansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, whose district hosts the Jackson Hole event, told CNBC on Wednesday that he isn't sold yet on a September cut and will need to see more data. In fact, only Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman have overtly signaled they favor a move next month.\n\"We suspect that most FOMC participants who have expressed mixed feelings about cutting in September will be willing to support a cut if Powell pushes for one, but that he will think it more reasonable to make that case to them closer to the meeting with more data in hand,\" Mericle said.\nInflation vs. unemployment\nKey points to watch will be how Powell characterizes the labor market and his view on the inflation pass-through from Trump's tariffs.\nShortly after the July Fed meeting, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced meager job growth for July and even weaker gains for May and June. However, multiple policymakers have used the word \"solid\" to describe the labor market, indicating they see less urgency for rate cuts.\nMinutes from the July meeting indicated most FOMC members see a greater worry over inflation. Regional presidents Beth Hammack from Cleveland, Atlanta's Raphael Bostic and Schmid in Kansas City have expressed skepticism about the need for a September cut, a position that could rile Trump and upset the market.\nPowell \"is likely to remain careful and not pre-commit in advance to a September cut, which could disappoint some investors,\" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI. \"Much of his speech may try to provide a steady medium- to longer-term framing for policy strategy and inflation control.\"\nThat framing could be critical as well, and is getting little attention from Wall Street so far.\nFive years ago, against a backdrop of the Covid pandemic and protests over police brutality, the Fed adopted what it called \"flexible average inflation targeting.\" Essentially, the framework change would allow the Fed to let inflation run hot if unemployment was higher, particularly for underrepresented groups.\nOver the next couple years, the Fed stood pat while inflation hit its highest level in more than 40 years. While most officials say the inflation targeting change did not play a role in the widely-held view that inflation was \"transitory,\" the policy is likely to get a retooling, with the Fed returning to its previous inflation stance that included preemptive action if inflation appeared to be rising.\n\"While the adoption of the new framework in 2020 was not the primary factor behind the Fed's delay and the substantial inflation overshoot, it contributed to this outcome,\" Matthew Luzzetti, Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist, said in a note. \"For this reason, we expect Powell's speech in Jackson Hole to highlight changes to the Fed's statement on longer-run goals that will reflect this reality. Specifically, we expect the speech to call for rolling back the 2020 modifications and restoring a primary role for preemption.\"\nLuzzetti added that the Friday speech \"could arguably not come at a more important time\" and he expects Powell to change his tone on the labor market.\nPowell's speech will be presented at 10 a.m. ET. The conference wraps up Saturday.","content_hash":"d91900faaff3c20196d6d1f41760f042","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6745,"method_rank":0}

Where to Invest When Nothing Looks Cheap examined the pockets of investing where investors might find reasonably priced investments.\n“‘Markets are expensive,’ says Charles Shriver, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price and co-chair of the firm’s Asset Allocation Committee. ‘We have more modest return expectations looking over the next 12 months,’” Morningstar contributor Sarah Hansen wrote.\nI couldn’t agree more with the above quote.\nI’ve held a significant amount of cash over the past few weeks, waiting for the steep price American consumers and companies will pay as a result of the White House’s implementation of global tariffs to reveal themselves.\nThat’s yet to happen, but the day of reckoning will soon be upon us. Expect the economic numbers to get worse in Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. But I digress.\nMorningstar’s article pointed to four areas of relative opportunity in the markets: value stocks, international stocks, small-cap stocks, and high-yield bonds. Three of the four are part of the Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF’s (AVDV) investment strategy.\nThe ETF just hit its 47th new 52-week high of the past 12 months. If you’re a passively-active investor, you might want to consider allocating some of your portfolio to AVDV for the next 3-5 years. Here’s why I feel this way.\nBefore I get into the positives of investing in this particular ETF, let’s consider the basics of AVDV.\nAvantis launched the ETF in September 2019. It has $11.45 billion in total assets invested across 1413 holdings. Its annualized total return since inception through July 31 is 11.62%. The ETF’s benchmark, the MSCI World ex USA Small Cap Index, has a five-year annualized total return of 9.50% over the past five years through July 31.\nWhile it’s not quite the same comparison period, it’s pretty close. Over 200 basis points higher than its benchmark, it’s easy to see why it continues to hit new 52-week highs.\nHere’s what the ETF’s summary prospectus has to say about its investment strategy:\n“The fund seeks to achieve higher expected returns by selecting securities of companies with higher profitability and value characteristics, as well as smaller market capitalizations relative to others within the fund's small cap investment universe.\n“To identify the desired market capitalization companies with higher profitability and value characteristics, the portfolio managers use reported and\/or estimated company financials and market data including, but not limited to, shares outstanding, book value and its components, cash flows from operations, and accruals.”\nFrom its summary prospectus, in addition to what you can observe from the above quote, the ETF won’t invest in a stock that has a market cap higher than the highest market cap in the benchmark. As of Sept. 24, 2024, it was $10.2 billion.\nAs a result, AVDV’s average market cap is $1.96 billion, about one-quarter the size of the foreign small\/mid value category average of $8.30 billion. You’re going to find micro-cap stocks among the 1413 holdings.\nMost importantly, the fund charges 0.36%, a very reasonable fee for an actively managed international ETF.\nNow let’s get into the fund’s holdings.\nSome ETFs claim to be diversified, but their top 10 holdings account for over 50% of the net assets. AVDV is not such a beast. Its top 10 accounts for just 8% of the ETF’s total assets.\nHere’s a blurb about its weighting methodology from the summary prospectus:\n“To determine the weight of a security within the portfolio, the portfolio managers use the market capitalization of the security relative to that of other eligible securities as a baseline, then overweight or underweight the security based on the characteristics described above [valuation and profitability metrics mentioned in summary prospectus and from earlier quote].”\nEssentially, they add together the market caps of all 1413 stocks and then divide each market cap by the total to get an initial weighting. The portfolio managers then overweight or underweight each stock.\nSo, for example, if there were 100 stocks in an ETF’s portfolio with a total value of $200 billion, and one stock had a market cap of $4 billion, the initial weighting would be 2% [$4 billion divided by $200 billion]. The portfolio managers would then decide whether to make the final weighting higher or lower than 2%.\nThat’s an illustrative example. In the case of AVDV, there are 1413 stocks; the weightings are all much smaller. For example, the top holding, Marks & Spencer Group (MAKSY), whose primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange, has a market cap of 7.28 billion British pounds ($9.81 billion). That’s at the high end of the inclusion eligibility.\nGiven the large number of holdings, the key to delivering above-average investor returns lies more with the sector and country weightings than with individual stocks.\nAVDV’s top three countries by weight are Japan (32%), the UK (12%), and Canada (10%). The top 10 countries account for 86% of the total assets, with 14% invested in 41 other countries.\nAs for sectors, the top three are industrials (24%), materials (19%), and financials (18%). Technology is down at 4%. This weighting allocation is not uncommon for international small-cap funds. So, if you're looking for a significant tech contribution, AVDV probably isn’t for you.\nWhile AVDV is up 24% in the past year, its five-year return is just less than 78%, about 10 percentage points less than the S&P 500. Reversion to the mean suggests that the ETF could close the gap in the next five years.\nI just returned from a two-week trip in Ireland and Spain. Of the top 10 holdings, I engaged with two of them -- I went to Marks & Spencer in Belfast and saw Iveco Group (IVCGF) trucks everywhere I went in Spain -- so you will know a number of the names in the portfolio. However, with 44% of the total assets invested in Asia Pacific and 42% in Europe, American investors won’t know most of the holdings unless they spend a lot of time in either region.\nDon’t let that dissuade you. AVDV is the best deal going at the moment.\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

This data interface showcases the top 500 securities that have generated aberrant transactions relative to prior norms in the derivatives market. Theoretically, the screener can tip off retail investors as to where the smart money may be positioning its funds.\nOn Monday, total options volume for OKE stock reached 4,924 contracts, representing a 54.89% lift over the trailing one-month average. Interestingly, call volume stood at 4,197 contracts, leaving the put side at only 727 contracts. On paper, this would seem bullish as it implies more traders buying calls than puts.\nHowever, options can be debit or credit based, imposing complexities. A closer look at options flow — which focuses exclusively on big block transactions — showed net trade sentiment slightly favoring the bears. However, last Friday, this metric stood at $136,700 above parity, overwhelmingly favoring the bullish side.\nWhile it’s difficult to make wholesale assumptions, it appears that professional investors don’t anticipate OKE stock falling below the $75 strike price by the Sep. 19 expiration date.\nUsing Path Dependency to Estimate Where OKE Stock May End Up\nWhile analyzing unusual options activity can be helpful, it’s not the full story. To be quite honest, I’m not sure if there are empirical studies linking the insights of unusual options with predictive power — and that’s probably because such studies are inherently multidimensional. To get a clearer picture of the unknown future, traders may rely on one of two frameworks.\nPrimarily, the most common approach is known as volatility dependency. By using derivations of the Black-Scholes formula, retail traders rely on implied volatility (IV) to narrow down their range of possibilities for their target security. Essentially, a higher IV ratings lead to wider bands in projections such as the Expected Move calculator, while lower IV ratings lead to narrower bands.\nHowever, one of the biggest concerns that I have about Black-Scholes-derived or influenced metrics is that the formula doesn’t account for how markets actually behave. For example, returns are assumed to be log-normal distributions rather than fat-tailed, skewed and clustered around pockets of volatility. There’s also the obvious vulnerability that it doesn’t account for American-style options, which allow for position exiting prior to expiration.\nWhile I might get skewered for saying this, I believe a better approach is path dependency. Much more common in Slavic countries, path dependency builds forecasts off actual pricing dynamics against like-like conditions. In other words, the math involved in this approach is descriptive rather than prescriptive.\nHowever, the tricky part of path-dependent models is that the input and output variables require epistemological continuity. As such, I convert price action into a binary code of accumulative and distributive sessions. With this approach, all stocks now speak the same language — facilitating cross-sector analysis.\nFor OKE stock, the takeaway is that in the past 10 weeks, the market voted to buy the security four times and sell six times. During this period, OKE incurred a downward trajectory. For brevity, we can label this sequence as 4-6-D.\nNotably, in 68% of cases (going back to January 2019), the following week’s price action results in upside, with a median return of 2.32%. That’s above the baseline probability of 57.23% or the chance that a long position will be profitable on any given week.\nAdding to the intrigue, if we were to include the current week’s session into the equation, OKE stock would be charting a 3-7-D sequence. This rare signal has an even greater next-week upside probability of 77.8%.\nIntriguing Strategies to Consider\nBased on how the next 10 weeks could play out as implied by the flashing of the 3-7-D sequence (which is very similar to the scenario forecasted by the 4-6-D sequence), the most conservative debit-based multi-leg options strategy may be the 70\/75 bull call spread expiring Sep. 19. This trade requires OKE stock to hit the $75 short strike price at expiration, which appears to be more than doable (assuming that you believe my forecast).\nHowever, the payout — for a net debit of $325 — is just under 54%. That’s not particularly enticing.\nA much more tempting trade is the 75\/80 bull call spread expiring Oct. 17. The $80 short strike price is projected in my model to be lower than either the positive or negative pathways. Of course, you would have to assume that my projections are more accurate than volatility-dependent calculations. With a payout of over 170%, it’s going to tempt some folks.\nNow, the real [insert Samuel L. Jackson’s favorite word here] is the 75\/80 bull spread expiring Sep. 19. My model shows that it’s on the edge of possibility. If you’re a believer, you need to put down $130 for the chance to gain a profit of $370. That’s a payout of almost 285%.\nYeah, there’s a lot to think about when you shift paradigms to path dependency.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

These include stage four chronic kidney disease and a pacemaker with defibrillator. I am currently independent, cleaning my own home, mowing my yard, gardening, shopping for and preparing my own meals. I enjoy playing bridge, book club, exercise class and volunteer work at church.\nMy passion is travel and exposure to new cultures, foods and scenic landscapes. I have had the privilege of visiting 45 countries and am now limited to “first-world countries” by my electrophysiologist. I was denied long-term health insurance in my late 50s. Emotionally, my concern over the current administration is influencing my thoughts about allocations.\nI have $1 million in my IRA, $700,000 in my personal brokerage account, $500,000 in bank accounts and a $600,000 interest in a family farm. I pay my total credit-card debt every month. In the past, I have stayed firm on my investments through the crises of 1987, 2000 and 2008. Gold is about the only thing missing from my portfolio.\nI am now concerned about preserving my “nursing home money.” My income is $120,000 per year which includes $60,000 in Social Security and a pension. As a former teacher, my charitable contributions are made directly from my IRA to charities featuring women, children and education, determined by my tax bracket.\nHow should my savings be distributed among stocks, bonds, cash, etc?\nYou’ve kept busy, both volunteering and in your garden, and have not allowed your medical events to define you. You have kept your mind active playing bridge, belonging to a book club, and volunteering at your local church. All of these activities — social, physical and mental — have kept you engaged and healthy.\nAn older person who is more socially isolated, lonely and disconnected, studies have shown, has a higher risk of chronic illness, depression and dying earlier than perhaps they would otherwise do so. Your life has purpose and you are more than the sum of your parts: being single, 75, and having chronic illness.\nIn other words, you’re doing all the right things — and I’m not talking about money. But since you asked: Your $1.1 million in your bank account and share in your family farm alone would keep you in long-term care for close to a decade. As would your $120,000 annual Social Security and pension. And you would still have preserved your $1.7 million investments.\nWhatever side of the political spectrum you’re on, the administration changes every four years under the constitution, and America has survived a lot of events that others might have wondered at the time if they would be the nation’s undoing, including the Civil War, Great Depression and Great Recession. It can be a good or bad thing to be plugged into the news.\nAmong the biggest concerns for economists and Federal Reserve officials are the latest jobs numbers and economic growth. GDP expanded in the second quarter after contracting in the first quarter, but that result came with caveats, including people shifting their spending to avoid tariff hikes and a smaller trade deficit as higher tariffs stymied demand for imports.\nAs to your other concerns: The median cost of a nursing home in the U.S. is just over $10,600 per month, according to Genworth and Carescout’s 2024 Cost of Care Survey. A semi-private room is roughly $9,200. But this can vary depending on the city and state where you live, from $7,000 to $12,000 a month for a private room. It’s not cheap, but you are well prepared.\nAs to your question about allocation, the more you leave in your IRA and brokerage accounts, the more it will grow over time. At 75, you’re right to enjoy your life, see the world, and ensure you have high-quality, productive downtime. This is the time to live off your savings and income, and enjoy the next chapter of your life.\nHolding 50%-plus in equities\nRegarding your asset allocation, a “moderately conservative” portfolio would be approximately 50% stocks, 40% bonds and 20% cash for living and emergencies, according to Charles Schwab. Given your income and cash, you could probably be less conservative than that. You are fortunate that you have a six-figure income; given your age, this is substantial.\nFor the last 60 years, the average peak-to-peak recovery time for a diversified index of stocks in bear markets was roughly 3.5 years, Charles Schwab says. “So, it’s wise to keep 2-4 years’ worth of living expenses in short-term bonds, CDs, or other reasonably liquid accounts. This way, you’ll have access to cash during a downturn if you need it without selling stocks.”\n“Consider adding some dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio,” it adds. “They also allow your principal to remain invested for potential growth. Stick with stocks: Make sure you don’t dial back your exposure to stocks too soon. Having a larger allocation of stocks in the early years of retirement can help guard against the risk of outliving your retirement savings.”\nYour deposits are insured up to $250,000 at each Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured bank. Think about putting your savings into high-yield money markets or savings accounts, rolling Treasury bills or laddered CDs. You will get more bang for your buck than leaving them in a checking or savings account.\nBuying CDs through a brokerage will allow you to spread out the FDIC insurance over various banks. You could purchase a $10,000 CD every month for the next 24 months. If you do not need the money when they mature, you could purchase another CD 24 months out. This helps you lock in the higher CD rates, while also providing you liquidity.\nAs interest rates go down, bond typically prices go up, and vice versa. For maturities up to 12 months, U.S. Treasuries are known as Treasury Bills, or T-Bills. For 2 years to 10 years, they are Treasury Notes, and for 20 or 30 years, they are Treasury Bonds. In its 2025 forecast, Vanguard projected aggregate bond returns would return 10-year annualized 4% to 5%.\nYou may have been denied long-term care insurance in your 50s, but if those insurance agents could see you now! At 75, living your best life, traveling the world, maintaining your financial and physical independence. All going well, you may avoid the need for a nursing home altogether and\/or only need it towards the end of your journey.\nUntil then, live life to the fullest and have a ball on your next trip.","content_hash":"b5d9847d7444c314427dd49cc816028d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6384,"method_rank":0}

A recent LendingTree survey found that one-quarter (25%) of buy-now-pay-later users have used these loans to buy groceries.\nBut some states are struggling more than others. Florida is now one of the most financially stressed states in the country, second only to another Southern state, according to a new report by WalletHub, which defines financial distress as having credit in forbearance or deferring payments due to financial difficulty.\n“When you combine data about people delaying payments with other metrics like bankruptcy filings and credit score changes, it paints a good picture of the overall economic trends of a state,” WalletHub analyst Chip Lupo said about the findings.\nHere are the five states struggling the most and why people there are having such a tough time.\nThe top 5 financially distressed states\nTexas is the most financially distressed state in the country, followed by Florida, Louisiana, Nevada and South Carolina. The states that are best off? That honor goes to Hawaii, followed by Vermont, Alaska, Oregon and New Mexico.\nTo determine their ranking, WalletHub compared all 50 states across nine key metrics in six categories, calculating an overall score by weighting the average across all metrics. For example, the ‘credit score’ category is determined by two key metrics: the average credit score as of March earned double weight, while the change in credit score from March 2024 to March 2025 earned full weight.\nOnce all the numbers were crunched, Texas came out on top — and, in this case, No. 1 means the most distressed or worst off — even though the state has a larger GDP than most countries (ranking ninth on the world stage). And it still has one of the top 10 economies in the U.S.\nTexans search Google for ‘debt’ and ‘loans’ at a high rate, “which shows that many people are desperate to borrow, despite already owing money,” says the WalletHub report. They also ranked sixth in the change in number of bankruptcy filings from March 2024 to March 2025, with non-business bankruptcy filings increasing more than 22% in the past year.\nOverall, Florida was the second-most financially distressed state in the country, ranking No. 1 in the share of people with accounts in financial distress and No. 2 in the average number of accounts per person that were in distress. Florida had the ninth-worst credit score ranking in the country; one previous WalletHub study found that Floridians have the second-highest credit delinquency rate nationally.\nFollowing in third place was Louisiana, which ranked above Florida for the average number of accounts in distress — taking the No. 1 spot — and above Texas in the ‘loans’ search index ranking (at No. 2). “Around 11.8% of Louisianians also have a credit account in forbearance or with deferred payments, the highest share in the country,” according to WalletHub.\nNevada, coming in at No. 4 overall, had the third-worst credit score ranking in the country (the top spot went to Montana), while South Carolina, at No. 5 overall, ranked highly in the number of people with accounts in financial distress and average number of accounts in distress.\nAs for the least financially distressed states? Hawaii was the winner here, even though the state had the fourth-worst credit score ranking. But it performed well in all other categories and, unlike Texas, it was the state with the fewest number of people searching Google for ‘debt’ and ‘loans.’\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market? Gain potential quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire. Here’s how to get started with as little as $10\nWhat to do if you’re financially underwater\nWhile states like Texas and Florida may be struggling the most, all states are struggling to some degree. Of the five states that were deemed to be the least financially distressed in the WalletHub study, three of them (Hawaii, Vermont and New Mexico) didn’t fare well on their credit score ranking.\nIndeed, the bottom 60% of U.S. households (by income) fall short of the threshold for a minimal quality of life, according to a Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) analysis. (The analysis takes into account essentials, like food and shelter, as well as basic leisure costs, such as streaming subscriptions.)\nIt points to the fact that wages haven’t kept up with rising costs — for example, medical premiums skyrocketed 301% from 2001 to 2023 and rent jumped by 131%.\nIf you’re struggling to make ends meet, start by making a budget so you’ll have a clear idea of how you’re spending your money (and where you can cut back).\nIf you’re behind on paying your bills, be proactive. “Do it before a debt collector gets involved. Tell your creditors what’s going on, and try to work out a new payment plan with lower payments you can manage,” according to the Federal Trade Commission consumer advice.\nThe same goes for mortgage payments. If you’re struggling, contact your lender before they foreclose on your home. If you’re acting in good faith, your lender may temporarily lower or defer your payments or work with you to extend your repayment period (meaning lower overall payments).\nWhen it comes to credit card debt, you’ll want to make at least the minimum payments each month so your credit score doesn’t take a hit. But since interest rates are so high — averaging around 24% these days — you’ll want to focus on paying this down as soon as possible, along with any other high-interest debts. You can do this through debt-reducing strategies such as the snowball or avalanche methods.\nYou may also want to seek out additional sources of income, whether that’s taking on a side gig, upskilling or reskilling for a higher-paying role or new job, or looking for passive income such as renting out a room in your home.\nDigging yourself out of debt isn’t easy, but there are resources that can help, including low-fee credit counseling services. For housing challenges, you can contact a free, HUD-certified counselor for advice via your local U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development office.","content_hash":"5a7907a3a975c24d610d3e8c089d7fc4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6292,"method_rank":0}

A recent Liquid Insight report, published Aug. 14 by strategist Howard Du and his team, warns that the current monetary and inflation landscape is flashing signals reminiscent of the last time the Fed cut rates in a rising inflation environment. “This is a possible but historically rare regime,” they added. The last time it happened was from the second half of 2007 to the first half of 2008, they said in their note titled “Ghosts of 2007.”\nAt the same time, a separate BofA Global Research note, from the equity and quantitative strategy team, looked at another historical rhyme: between the megacap stocks dubbed the “Nifty 50”—notably Nvidia and other members of the “Magnificent Seven”—and the last time they outperformed the S&P 500 for so many years. (The first Nifty 50 to bear the nickname was a group that ran until roughly 1973, when the game changed for markets because of the onset of the Great Inflation and other factors, including a shift away from the gold standard.)\n“Megacaps led for seven years but cracked in July,” wrote the team led by Savita Subramanian, adding that the last memorable run by the largest 50 stocks in terms of market cap was the 1990s lead-up to the dotcom bubble. That was about six years long, a similar duration to the current market pattern.\nThe analysis from Du’s team notes that the convergence of falling policy rates and accelerating inflation is exceedingly rare, occurring just 16% of the time since 1973. Historically, central banks have slashed rates in response to declining inflation, not rising prices. The bank’s concern centers on the potential for rate cuts this year to push the so-called real policy rate—the Fed rate adjusted for inflation—deeply negative. Such a move, the report warns, could further weaken the U.S. dollar, citing striking similarities to 2007, when the Fed’s easing amid supply-driven inflation triggered currency volatility and set the stage for the financial meltdown.\nMeanwhile, Subramanian’s team suggested that the Nifty 50 may be giving way to broader market leadership. Historically, Fed easing, particularly during periods of sticky inflation, has triggered underperformance by megacaps. BofA’s analysts say that, in past recoveries, small-cap and value-oriented stocks have strongly outperformed, benefiting from cash moving out of money-market funds into equities as risk-free returns begin to dwindle.\nThe notes were written by different teams on subsequent days, digesting the Fed’s likely cuts coming down the pike and the several parallels to the last two major financial crashes of the past 25 years. To be sure, BofA isn’t connecting these two trends to each other specifically, and isn’t predicting another imminent financial crisis. But the ghosts of 2007 are back, and the Nifty 50 is showing wear and tear.\nWhat’s next?\nMarket conviction for a September rate cut is now running near certainty, with the probability of a 25 bps reduction at the next Fed meeting nearing 100%. This sharp shift follows disappointing July employment numbers and a string of downward revisions to prior job data. Markets are also betting on at least two rate cuts before year-end and forecast the Fed funds rate to fall below 3% by 2026. Meanwhile, BofA’s models suggest that even modest monthly rises in headline CPI will keep year-on-year inflation elevated at 2.9% or higher into December, up from 2.3% to 2.4% in early 2025—an echo, the bank says, of the temporary inflation surges triggered by supply-side shocks during 2007–08.\nDu’s team also noted strong parallels in the foreign exchange market, flagging that the U.S. dollar is tracking its weakest year since 1999 and is moving more closely in tandem with 2007 than any other year in half a century. Back then, the dollar’s sharp pre-rate-cut depreciation lingered for months and only reversed as real rates recovered—pain that currency markets may soon reexperience if the Fed proceeds as markets expect. “While the [dollar] is on track for largest year-to-date depreciation since 1999,” Du’s team noted, “the price action in 2025 still has the highest correlation with 2007 out of all years since 1973.”\nSubramanian’s proprietary U.S. Regime Indicator, which turned to “Recovery” in July and held steady into August, mirrors previous cycles in which smaller and value stocks led, with high-beta and sector-neutral value factors outperforming the big names by notable margins. Today’s megacaps, while pivotal to market gains in recent years, now exhibit average growth and weakened quality—measured by lower free cash flow margins and fewer highly rated companies—heightening their vulnerability as valuation premiums stretch.\nAs rates head lower, BofA expects flows to favor value and dividend-oriented stocks, with investor strategies tilting toward Russell 1000 names offering robust but not excessive dividends. Small-cap and value stocks with low P\/E ratios and high beta also screen as top performers, in both sector-neutral and unconstrained assessments. Meanwhile, the persistent crowding and high valuations in growth names point to a broadening of opportunities outside megacap growth as risk premiums compress and market leadership tilts.\nIn summary, BofA’s dual analysis offers both a warning and a road map: The Fed’s imminent rate cut, set against the rare backdrop of accelerating inflation, invokes a historical precedent fraught with risk for the dollar and for financial market stability. Simultaneously, the stage appears set for a major rotation within U.S. equities, away from the megacaps toward broader market segments—a development investors will be closely watching as the Fed’s pivotal September meeting approaches.\nIf there’s a crash to rival the early 2000s or the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, though, that will be a different story indeed.\nFor this story, Fortune used generative AI to help with an initial draft.

But that’s not growth—that can mean chaos. Real, sustainable growth comes from clarity. And clarity only comes when you know your numbers inside and out. If you’re not tracking, reviewing, and executing off your data, you’re not scaling—you’re just guessing. And in this industry, guessing will sink you faster than a slow freight week.\nThe carriers that last aren’t the ones chasing every load. They’re the ones using data to sharpen decisions, protect margins, and grow with intention. Let’s break down the key numbers you need to track, how to make sense of them, and how to actually use them to build a fleet that lasts.\n“Visibility Before Velocity”\nYou can’t manage what you don’t measure. And you sure can’t grow what you don’t understand. Before you even think about expansion, ask yourself:\nDo I know my all-in Cost Per Mile (CPM)?\nCan I show my net profit per truck for the past 90 days?\nDo I know which lanes actually make money and which just burn time?\nAm I tracking which brokers pay consistently—and which ones waste my time?\nIf the answer is anything less than a clear “yes,” hit the brakes. Scaling without data is like flooring it without a fuel gauge. You might move fast, but you won’t move long.\nFive Core Metrics That Drive Smarter Growth\nYou don’t need a fancy TMS subscription or a data analyst on payroll. What you do need is consistency, discipline, and a basic spreadsheet. These five numbers will tell you whether you’re ready to grow—or just asking for headaches.\n1. Revenue Per Mile (RPM)\nRPM is the pulse of your freight. It’s not about what you gross—it’s about what you keep per mile.\nTrack both loaded RPM and all-miles RPM. Why? Because deadhead miles and bad routing eat profits alive. Example: you might haul a load at $2.80\/mile from Dallas to Atlanta, but if you deadhead 200 miles after, that “good load” looks a whole lot worse.\nSmart carriers break RPM down by lane, by broker, and by truck. That’s how you know what to double down on—and what to cut loose.\n2. Cost Per Mile (CPM)\nThis is your break-even line. And it’s non-negotiable.\nYour CPM includes fuel, maintenance, insurance, payroll, tolls, ELD fees, trailer rentals—everything.\nHere’s why it matters: if your all-in CPM is $1.95 and your RPM is averaging $2.10, your margin is razor thin. Add another truck with the same costs and one bad breakdown? You’re underwater.\nTrack CPM monthly. It’ll show you if your growth is adding margin—or just adding stress.\n3. Net Profit Per Truck\nForget gross—it’s a vanity number.\nThe only number that matters is what each truck actually nets after all expenses. That’s the number that tells you whether your model works.\nIf Truck 1 grosses $28,000 in a month but only nets $1,800, adding Truck 2 isn’t a solution—it’s doubling the problem. Fix the first truck before you clone it.\n4. Load History by Broker and Lane\nKeep track of every single load:\nBroker name\nOrigin and destination\nLinehaul rate\nAccessorials\nTotal RPM\nAny issues (detention, reschedules, lumpers)\nPatterns will jump out fast:\nWhich brokers value your time\nWhich lanes deliver consistent RPM\nWhich zip codes are freight deserts\nThat becomes your freight map. And the cleaner it is, the less risky growth becomes.\n5. Deadhead Miles and Down Time\nSilent killers of profitability. Ignore them at your own risk.\nDeadhead miles burn fuel and destroy your all-mile RPM. Track them. Set a percentage target. Cut them.\nDowntime is just as bad. Every hour your truck sits is an hour it’s not earning. Track delays by customer and location.\nEven trimming these by 10% can boost profit—without running one extra mile.\nProfit Point: It’s not about running harder—it’s about running smarter.\nFour Questions Before You Add a Truck\nAm I profitable with one truck? If you’re not netting consistent profit per truck, you’re not ready to scale—you’re ready to fix. If your margin is under $0.25 per mile, growth will bury you.\nDo I have repeatable systems? Dispatch, payroll, compliance, maintenance—if those aren’t smooth now, adding more trucks will only magnify the problems. Build the system first. Scale second.\nDo I have freight consistency? Load boards are fine when you’re just starting, but if 90% of your freight still comes from random brokers, you don’t have a foundation. Growth needs lanes and relationships you can count on.\nCan I handle a 15% rate drop? Rates fall. Always. Stress test your numbers. If a 15% drop wipes you out, don’t grow yet. Build the buffer first.\nExecution Tip: You don’t grow because you feel ready—you grow because the numbers prove you’re ready.\nTactical Moves: Making Data Part of the Routine\nMonthly Scorecard Track: revenue, RPM (loaded and all miles), CPM, net profit per truck, load count, deadhead %, and maintenance costs. Review every 30 days.\nWeekly Load Log One spreadsheet, every load. Date, broker, origin\/destination, linehaul, fuel surcharge, accessorials, RPM, issues. Review weekly.

He also detailed how the company’s integration of express and ground networks will change workflows and technology deployment.\nFedEx (NYSE: FDX) has temporarily reassigned some experts from its U.S. ground parcel and freight units to Europe to help improve efficiency, Dietrich told investors at the Deutsche Bank Transport Conference.\n“Route planning, package efficiency, condensing our stations, in-station efficiencies, all these things are being looked at and implemented. … I think we’re second to none in what we do here in the U.S. So we want to leverage that expertise and bring it to Europe,” he said.\nFedEx last year merged divisions at the corporate level into FedEx Express, which makes it possible to share resources across the enterprise. Previously, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services were managed as separate entities.\nFedEx has set a target of $1 billion as the next phase of its Drive cost-cutting campaign, after successfully eliminating $4 billion in costs the past two years. Reduced expenditures will be realized through consolidating facilities under the Network 2.0 strategy, as well as streamlining in Europe.\nManagement said on the June 25 earnings presentation that FedEx expects to take out $150 million in costs from the European business by June 2027, the end of the fiscal year, primarily through network and back-office restructuring. The company last year also announced plans to eliminate between 1,700 and 2,000 back office and commercial jobs in Europe.\nThe integrated parcel carrier has had difficulty fully integrating its European operation since acquiring TNT Express in 2016, which Dietrich partly attributed to the complexity of European labor regulations and other rules.\nStreamlining the European organization has also taken longer than expected because of a major cyberattack on TNT in 2017, damage to one of its four main facilities and cultural resistance to changing the customer experience.\n“It was harming us more than helping us in terms of bringing the networks together. Sometimes change is challenging,” said Dietrich, who joined FedEx two years ago after running all-cargo airline Atlas Air.\nFedEx said in June that it has reduced the delivery cost per package for two consecutive years and is focused on improving vehicle and in-station productivity, offering new digital tools for customers and growing market share profitably in Europe.\nU.S. realignment requires careful planning\nDietrich also provided insight about how FedEx is managing personnel, facilities and technology as it integrates FedEx Express and FedEx Ground into a unified system. Every facility converted to a common operation provides lessons for the next consolidation, he reiterated.\nFedEx is deciding location-by-location whether independent contractors from the pre-existing Ground network or employee drivers will handle pickup and delivery of Federal Express packages.\n“We have a team of people dedicating significant resources to doing debriefs and downloads — what went well, what did not go so well,” Dietrich said.\nA key component of the effort is changing driver behavior in a way that treats workers fairly while without impacting service levels.\n“Our couriers, who are used to day-definite [delivery] may have some time-definite requirements on them. And so we’re working together with them on how they can best manage and handle our priority products most efficiently. And there’s opportunities for them to make more money, too. We’ve been reconciling our compensation programs for our contractors and our couriers and so forth, to have the most positive outcome and deliver for our customers,” Dietrich said.\nAmong technologies FedEx is incorporating for optimizing efficient delivery routes and vehicle mix is a route planning tool from RouteSmart Technologies, which FedEx acquired in February after many years of collaboration, he added.\nOne of FedEx’s founding principles is that information about a shipment is as important as the shipment itself. As an integrated carrier, all the information about the customer, types of shipments, conveyance, en-route tracking, and billing are all housed under one roof.\nFedEx earlier this year formed a data and technology team, which focuses on streamlining the technology used during the package delivery lifecycle; establishing global standards across pickup-and-delivery, linehaul, sort, and clearance operations; and improving digital products and experiences for internal use and customers.\n“In this current environment, we’re just looking to take it to the next level. How can we leverage AI and technology not only to help our operations, but to monetize and unlock the value of the significant data that we collect on a daily basis” from 3 million customers and 17 million packages per day, said Dietrich.\nFedEx Dataworks, an internal unit tasked with harnessing data to improve efficiency, is involved with some of the next-generation data analytics underway. Dataworks is implementing dynamic scheduling tools at many U.S. surface facilities to match sort staffing with volumes and is introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and proceed directly to vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity, FedEx said in its annual report published on Monday.\nDataworks is also enhancing facility productivity through use of machine learning and algorithms to develop more detailed and accurate volume forecasts.\nFedEx is also testing autonomous, driverless technologies for handling large packages that don’t fit on conveyor systems, as well as robotic product sortation systems to sort small packages, according to the annual report.\nThe company last week named Vishal Talwar, an executive at Accenture Technology, as chief digital and information officer, and president of Dataworks.\nAlthough Dataworks has helped FedEx enhance decisionmaking tools, it hasn’t accomplished its second mission of making money, said parcel industry consultant Satish Jindel in a commentary last week.","content_hash":"cf5d207dee9706fb0def04930ee80c08","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6218,"method_rank":0}

That has helped AI stocks continue to rocket higher and higher.\nOf course, that upward trajectory won't last forever, but that doesn't mean there aren't opportunities to benefit while it does. For investors seeking great long-term exposure to this burgeoning industry, leaders like Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) can provide it. Here's why these three AI stocks are still a buy in 2025.\nIt's not only a great Q2 performance that makes Meta a must for AI investors\nThe headline figures for Meta's second quarter were undeniably impressive. It crushed analysts' top- and bottom-line expectations in the second quarter, and management forecasted a strong performance in the third quarter, too. Whereas the analysts' consensus forecast for Q3 revenue is $46.3 billion, Meta is guiding for sales in the range of $47.5 billion to $50.5 billion.\nWhat really caught my attention, though, was Mark Zuckerberg's comment on the earnings conference call. The Meta CEO said his company has \"begun to see glimpses of our AI systems improving themselves. The improvements are slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence -- which we define as AI that surpasses human intelligence in every way -- we think is now in sight.\"\nMeta is clearly developing into an AI leader that's leveraging the technology to increase user engagement. Daily active users on Meta products have increased every quarter, from 3.07 billion in Q2 2023 to 3.48 billion in Q2 2025. Monthly active users on Threads, for example, are growing rapidly, rising to over 400 million users from 350 million in April, narrowing the gap between it and X.\nThe company's progress in developing generative AI (and other AI tools) is no small achievement, and it could go a long way in distinguishing the company from its peers. There's no denying the company's leadership and allure as an AI investment option.\nWhat's in a name? ASML stock smells just as sweet as its more recognizable peers\nForget the fact that you may not recognize its name as readily as AI hardware titans like Nvidia and Broadcom. The fact is that ASML plays a crucial role in the manufacturing of AI-capable semiconductors. As the world's only manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, it is in a class by itself. These vital systems are capable of printing features on microchips at smaller sizes and higher densities than any rival's equipment. As such, they are the only lithography systems that can be used to produce the industry's most sophisticated and powerful microchips, such as those used in AI applications.\nWhile ASML has a competitive advantage as the only manufacturer of EUV systems, it's not resting on its laurels. The company continues to innovate, and its newest EUV system, the Twinscan EXE:5200B, is already receiving interest from major chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel.\nSome investors are skittish about ASML's near-term outlook as the rollout of those new systems may extend deeper into 2026. For that reason, shares of ASML are now available at a discount. Whereas its five-year average operating cash flow multiple is 36, shares are now changing hands at 23.1 times operating cash flow. With the stock sitting on the discount rack, now's a great time for investors to act.\nNvidia's a great option for risk-averse AI investors\nIt seems almost impossible to have a conversation about the AI sector without Nvidia's name popping up. The company invented the graphics processing unit (GPU) and has long dominated that niche of the chip industry. And today, GPUs -- most of them Nvidia designs -- provide the key parallel processing power in the data centers where most AI computing workloads are handled.\nThe critical role that Nvidia plays is evident in the company's financials. In the first quarter of its fiscal 2026, Nvidia reported revenue of $39.1 billion for its data center business -- a year-over-year increase of 73%.\nBecause of its dominant position among semiconductor stocks, Nvidia is a great option for investors looking to add an AI position while also keeping their portfolio risk reasonable. The fact that the company effectively prints money makes it even more compelling for risk-averse investors.\nTrading at 58 times trailing earnings, Nvidia stock may seem pricey, but the stock often trades at a high multiple. Compared to its five-year average P\/E of 69.7, today's valuation looks a lot more palatable -- and perhaps even like a bargain.\nWhich AI opportunity is right for you?\nFor a low-risk AI investment option, Nvidia stock is a great option at this point, while those interested in a generative AI leader will want to gobble up Meta stock. But investors who see the appeal of a company that has a monopoly on hardware that's vital to the production of AI chips will want to pick up some shares of ASML.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $671,466!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,115,633!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,077% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500.

Despite the bullish market mood and several helpful developments in Polkadot's corner, the official cryptocurrency of the Web3 Foundation dropped 11.8% lower instead.\nAll that could change in a hurry. I would argue that Polkadot is deeply undervalued these days, and poised for strong returns in the long run. At the same time, leading crypto-trading platform Coinbase Global just released a market analysis that suggests traders will be swinging away from Bitcoin and into altcoins in the next quarter -- which would be good news for smaller names like Polkadot.\nSo there's some urgency to my Polkadot recommendation, but Coinbase's analysis is not the core of my thesis. I'm looking at why people use Polkadot, not chart squiggles and economic trends. Read on to see the three biggest reasons why I'm a Polkadot buyer in 2025.\n1. Web3 infrastructure\nThe Web3 idea has been around since 2014, when Polkadot co-founder Gavin Wood coined the term. Web3 always had some dedicated fans, but the world at large never seemed ready to trade in centrally owned social networks for community-driven blockchain solutions.\nThings are different in 2026.\nThe U.S. government is throwing heavy support behind the cryptocurrency industry, and people are getting more comfortable with decentralized blockchain networks. Popular examples include the Brave web browser, the Uniswap digital assets trading system, and the soccer game FIFA Rivals. All three apps rely on Polkadot in various ways.\nI can't promise that Web3 applications will go mainstream very soon, but all the ingredients of that recipe are ready for a bake-off. Decentralized content and financial tools could gain mainstream traction any day now, and Polkadot will absolutely benefit when it happens. Owning a few Polkadot coins in 2025 sets you up to take advantage of the Web3 revolution in 2026 and beyond.\n2. Boy, this thing is fast!\nPolkadot connects to a plethora of other blockchain ledgers, transferring data between them in secure and easy-to-use channels. It stands to reason that this ledger must be fast in order to keep up with this multitude of connections.\nAnd it is indeed very fast. A speed test in December 2024 reached 140,000 transactions per second (TPS). This event used only a portion of Polkadot's testing network, Kusama. Putting the entire production-grade Polkadot system to work could yield more than 620,000 TPS.\nHow fast is that? Well, Bitcoin handles less than 10 transactions per second, and Ethereum's maximum TPS is roughly 120. These large networks are widely rebuked for their slow performance, though. Avalanche is known for its snappy transaction performance, but its theoretical TPS ceiling stops just short of 1,200.\nWhat about Solana, the speed king of modern blockchain networks? With a theoretical TPS of 65,000, this coin puts up a fight. Its max performance is comparable to credit card processor Visa, which sported a capacity of 65,000 TPS in 2017 and actually runs 10,000 transactions per second on a global scale. Polkadot is still about twice as fast as Solana, though.\nThis blistering top speed isn't terribly important right now, given the modest reach of Web3 applications and much lower real-world traffic on the Polkadot network. But what happens if and when Web3 concepts go mainstream, making potential Polkadot users out of every smartphone owner in the world?\nVisa's transaction volume could look tiny next to that avalanche of decentralized data, and Polkadot must be ready to handle that sea change. And I think it's ready to hit the global limelight on short notice.\n3. Polkadot 2.0\nAnd here's the best part: Polkadot's performance may look impressive right now, but it's just the start of a far more ambitious long-term plan.\nI won't bore you with technical jargon like elastic scaling, agile coretime, or the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM). What you need to know is that Polkadot's technical platform is getting a bunch of important upgrades right now. Some components are already up and running, and the rest are scheduled to go live before the end of the year.\nThey add up to a more powerful ecosystem known as Polkadot 2.0, with much higher TPS, a more flexible development environment, and simpler ways to pay for computing capacity on the Polkadot platform. If you were on the fence about owning Polkadot, this confident step forward might be the clincher.\nBy the end of 2025, Polkadot will be even better prepared to make an impact on the global stage with wider Web3 adoption. I think you'll be a happier investor with some Polkadot exposure under your belt in 2026.\nDo the experts think Polkadot is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities. They’ve just revealed their 10 best stocks to buy now — did Polkadot make the list?\nWhen our Stock Advisor analyst team has a stock recommendation, it can pay to listen.

Research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that a 65-year-old couple retiring today may need as much as $351,000 to have a 90% chance of covering their medical expenses in retirement.\nBut according to Sudipto Banerjee, a global retirement strategist at T. Rowe Price, that widely cited figure is misleading and can create needless anxiety.\n\"My first point would be not to really focus on ... that one single number,\" Banerjee said in a recent Decoding Retirement podcast. \"It's basically what a couple will spend over 30 years. It's just the sum of that.\"\nFor those approaching retirement, Banerjee explained that the more useful focus is cash flow — understanding your income, your expenses, and how much you'll spend on healthcare each year.\n\"Healthcare is not something where you retire one day, then you cut a check for $350,000 to someone and it's taken care of,\" he said. \"It doesn’t work like that. It's an ongoing process, and every year you have to make decisions.\"\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nRather than obsessing over total lifetime costs, Banerjee recommended a practical two-bucket approach.\nIn the first bucket, plan for predictable premium costs, and build Medicare Part B, Part D, and supplemental insurance premiums into your regular cash flow. These costs are relatively stable and predictable, making them suitable for budgeting like any other fixed expense.\nIn the second bucket, maintain a separate cash reserve of $5,000 to $10,000 for deductibles, copays, and unexpected medical expenses. Replenish this fund annually as unpredictable out-of-pocket expenses come up.\n\"You have a very good idea how much you are going to need for your health insurance premiums, so you can basically build that into your cash flow,\" he said. \"The more trickier part is the out-of-pocket expenses, where you might not know exactly how much you'll need.\"\nThis approach acknowledges that retirement healthcare isn't a single large bill, but a series of ongoing decisions and payments that can be managed systematically.\nAnother major driver of healthcare costs is Medicare coverage. The choice between traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and adding a Medigap policy can significantly affect both expenses and protection against unexpected bills.\n\"It's a really important decision,\" Banerjee said. \"When it comes to healthcare in retirement, the choice of plan — whether you go with traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage, or add a Medigap policy — deserves a lot of attention.\"\nFor those considering Medigap, Banerjee suggests starting with two questions: Can you afford it? And why do you want it?\n\"Medigap typically costs more — on average about $2,000 a year — so there's an affordability question,\" he said. \"If you can cover that extra cost comfortably, that's great.\"\nBanerjee added that many choose Medigap to limit out-of-pocket expenses, since traditional Medicare involves deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing. But Banerjee's research shows average annual out-of-pocket spending for Medigap enrollees is about the same as for those with other coverage — except at the high end of spending, where Medigap offers greater protection.\n\"People with Medigap tend to use more healthcare,\" he explained. \"They know they have that protection, so they consume more services.\" His advice: If you expect Medigap to automatically lower your yearly out-of-pocket costs, understand that may not happen — higher utilization can offset the savings.\nThis decision is even more critical because switching from Medicare Advantage to traditional Medicare with Medigap later in retirement is \"virtually impossible\" if health issues arise.\nManaging the tail risk of long-term care\nLong-term care is another wildcard in retirement planning. Many fear they'll one day need nursing home care and won't know how to pay for it, whether through insurance, self-funding, home equity, Medicaid, or a combination of these.\n\"This is a classic example of what we call tail risk,\" Banerjee said. \"For most people, if you look at the average, people don't spend anything on long-term care out of pocket. But a very small percentage will spend a large amount. And this is sort of a classic case where you would think that it's ... a situation to be addressed by insurance because it's a tail risk.\"\nThe problem, he said, is that \"the long-term care insurance market has not performed or functioned very well over the years ... the policies are very expensive. So people don't want to be spending so much on these policies and never needing the care.\"\nFinancial circumstances often dictate the approach.\nThose with lower incomes often use Medicaid as a fallback, while those with higher incomes are often able to self-fund their care. It's the middle market that must weigh protecting assets from Medicaid against paying for coverage they might never use.\nAnd timing insurance coverage is critical. \"You don't want to be too late when you have health issues crop up and your premiums will really go up, and you don't want to get it too early when you are spending on premiums for a long period,\" Banerjee said. \"So I think somewhere between 55 and 65 is a good period to consider long-term care insurance.\"\nIf you expect to stay at home for a while and then move into a continuing care facility, knowing that in advance can help you choose the right long-term care insurance.\nBroad \"umbrella\" policies cover almost any living arrangement but cost more, he said. If you've already decided where you'll live, a more targeted policy may be cheaper.\nWhatever you choose, compare costs, coverage limits, and benefits — and do your homework before buying.\nGot questions about retirement?

The company ranks first among smart vacuums by global market share, according to IDC Research. Last week, it reported a nearly 79% revenue surge in the first half of this year. About half of sales came from outside China.\nIn an exclusive interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Quan predicted that human-like robots will become part of many households by 2030, thanks largely to advances in generative artificial intelligence.\nAnd before then, he expects, Roborock can make its latest, high-end cleaner with an AI-powered robotic arm so cheap that the mass market will be able to buy it — for at most a few hundred U.S. dollars.\n\"If we only focus on the premium segment, in the end, other than being the best robotic vacuum cleaner company in the world, we will have nothing,\" Quan said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. He noted that robot vacuums still don't have a very high household penetration rate.\nChina, the largest market for the robot vacuums by value, has a penetration rate of only 5.6%, while the United States, the second-largest market, has a 22% penetration rate, according to Euromonitor estimates for 2025. The firm predicts penetration in the U.S. will tick up to 24.1% over the next two years, and edge down to 5.5% in China.\nCompetition in the robotic vacuum + robotic arm category heated up earlier this year at the U.S. Consumer Electronics Show, with Roborock and at least two other Chinese competitors releasing demos. The AI-powered arm removes obstacles from the cleaner's path as it rolls autonomously around the house.\nSo far, only Roborock has started selling one, called the Saros Z70 — but with a hefty price tag of around $2,600 on amazon.com. The site shows 141 reviews and a 4.6 rating. Roborock did not share specific sales figures.\nInitial reviews of the Saros Z70 from U.S. tech sites such as Mashable and Wired weren't impressed, especially given the price, but hoped for more capable versions in the near future. Both recommended that consumers stick with the more traditional Roborock Saros 10R — which retails for $1,600.\nRobot vacuum cleaner companies should develop products that \"bridge cutting-edge technologies and mainstream price points to accelerate adoption,\" said Jin Liu, senior analyst of small appliances at Euromonitor International.\nBut even if the price comes down, it would only be a small step toward having a robot help with cooking and other household chores.\nVacuum cleaners are the \"only successful application [of robots] in our homes to date,\" said Jeff Burnstein, president of the Association for Advancing Automation (A3). \"This is after four decades of talking about how we're going to have robots in our home.\"\n\"What made the [robot] vacuum cleaner so successful is it didn't cost that much,\" he said. For the same thing to happen for humanoids to enter homes, he said, there needs to be a compelling quality for the price.\nHumanoids, such as those from Chinese startup Unitree, still cost tens of thousands of U.S. dollars and don't have clear household use cases yet.\nNavigating tariffs\nDespite its mass market ambitions, Roborock said that because of tariffs, it had to raise the Saros Z70 price by $700 from the original $1,899.\nQuan said Roborock started working with suppliers late last year in Vietnam, where he said the company can fulfill all its North American orders.\nLooking ahead, he said the company is considering global supply chain partnerships, but not necessarily to invest in building its own factories. Roborock's plans for a Hong Kong listing are primarily to raise capital for international expansion, Quan said, noting the company is also expanding beyond vacuums.\nDespite Roborock's 79% revenue surge, the company more than doubled its spending, largely on research and development, steepening the company's losses in the first half of the year.\nQuan said the company has hired nearly 100 AI experts this year and is still hiring — with an eye to add a total of nearly 200 AI experts this year. He said many of the new hires have overseas education or work experience.\nThe company built a dedicated AI lab in Shanghai and a research institute in Shenzhen, soon after Roborock's founding in 2014. When asked about computing power, Quan said there are many solutions and that buying Nvidia chips aren't the only option.\nAs for improving the AI-powered robotic arm and making it cheaper, \"the challenge lies primarily with the algorithm and data,\" he said, not the hardware.\nHumanoid apps\nAs AI becomes more critical for household robots, Quan has an even bigger vision.\n\"If this robot in your home needs to clean, then it will have to integrate the cleaning knowledge that Roborock has accumulated over the years in algorithms, models, data and training,\" he said. \"Then it can be installed onto the robot like an app.\"\n\"This robot may be Tesla's, or Unitree's, or someone else's, ... but in the area of cleaning, it will be inseparable from Roborock,\" he said, claiming the company has the best data on cleaning tasks. Another company might have the best data for robots to cook, he said.\nThe humanoid market will likely reach $5 trillion by 2050, with $800 billion in China alone, according to Morgan Stanley estimates.\n\"With humanoids, if they can't do more than one thing, then they're competing against an existing form factor that can do one thing very well,\" Burnstein said. But ne noted companies around the world expect there's a big market for safe, affordable humanoids that can cook, clean, help the elderly and do other things.\n\"We're not there yet with the technology, but maybe we'll get there and maybe that multitasking would be the differentiator potentially,\" he said. \"So you wouldn't need 5 robots. You might just need one.\"","content_hash":"06047cfccc5456ca697d4d17e0e28ecf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5976,"method_rank":0}

The median price — a better gauge of the market — was 89.4 million yen, up 9% from a year earlier.\nOn a median basis, condo prices in Tokyo's 23 wards jumped about 64% from 2021 to 2025, far outpacing the 26% rise across the greater Tokyo area.\nMeanwhile, Japan's income levels remain low compared with several of its developed peers, with weaker minimum wage and one of the widest gender pay gaps, making affordability a concern. In 2024, Japan ranked 25 out of 34 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ranked on a purchasing power parity–adjusted, average annual wages basis, at $49,446.\nProperty prices in Tokyo's prime districts have soared, fueled in part by rising construction and labor costs, and as a weak yen and comparatively low valuations draw overseas investors.\nThe urban property boom has attracted political attention, with discussion around foreign capital restrictions featured during the recent Upper House elections. Unlike countries such as Australia, Canada and Singapore, Japan has virtually no restrictions on foreign property ownership.\nThe Democratic Party for the People or DPFP, which secured solid gains in the July elections, is expected to table a bill curbing foreign real estate purchases as early as the autumn extraordinary Diet session, according to local media. DPFP leader Yuichiro Tamaki has argued that home prices in urban areas have soared partly due to overseas investors buying property for non-residential, speculative purposes, and has floated the idea of a \"vacancy tax\" to curb such acquisitions.\nMeanwhile, Sanseitō, a right-wing populist party campaigning on a \"Japan First\" anti-immigration platform, is also preparing its own proposal to curb foreign land acquisition but has not yet specified a timeline for submission.\nWith the ruling coalition lacking a majority in both houses of the Diet, the positions of opposition parties have become increasingly critical in shaping legislative outcomes.\nTobias Harris, founder of political risk advisory firm Japan Foresight, said it was hard to separate foreign property ownership from broader debates about Japan's foreign population. While not the centerpiece of Sanseitō's platform, he said the issue stands out because it offers a clearer legal path for action versus other issues.\n\"The party's rhetoric on the issue has emphasized both national security and economic security, hinting at the dangers of certain foreigners buying property and also the impact on Japanese quality of life if they can't afford houses.\"\nThe exact scale of foreign buying is hard to pin down, as Japan does not publish official statistics on buyer nationality, but a semiannual survey by Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking Corp, published in March 2025, found that in Tokyo's Chiyoda, Shibuya, and Minato wards, 20% to 40% of new apartments are typically sold to foreign buyers.\n\"Foreigners buying is one factor, but domestic investors and residents are also buying,\" said Makoto Sakuma, senior researcher at Japanese think tank NLI Research Institute.\nSakuma noted that although the Bank of Japan has raised interest rates since March last year, they remain low in real terms and ample liquidity is still circulating in the market with much of it flowing into urban property.\nHarris said the outlook for any legislative change depends on Japan's political landscape. A new prime minister or shifting coalition dynamics could reshape how opposition parties put issues like foreign ownership on the agenda.\nRomeo Marcantuoni, a doctoral candidate at Waseda University who focuses on Japanese opposition politics, said the salience of the issue moving ahead is unlikely to fade, noting that Sanseito has ramped up its rhetoric on foreigners and foreign capital since winning three Lower House seats last year.\nStill, he noted the legislative path is uncertain, as more pressing priorities, such as tax cuts, cash handouts, and a gasoline levy is likely to dominate discussions in the near term.\nUrban-rural divide\nWhile Tokyo's population continues to rise, Japan's overall population has been declining since 2008, creating a sharp gap in demand between urban and rural areas.\nAnd while there has been a property boom in major cities, the country had about 9 million abandoned homes, known as akiya, as of 2023, primarily in rural regions.\nAlthough akiya can be purchased cheaply, they don't match the needs of many domestic buyers. Many are in disrepair, located far from jobs and services, or require renovations costing $20,000 to $300,000, depending on the property's state and location. Cultural stigma around secondhand homes and limited government support for revitalization further limit their appeal.\n\"When you look at the countryside, we have a huge problem with stagnation, prices are not rising and houses are not selling,\" said Parker Allen, co-founder of Akiya & Inaka, a real estate platform helping overseas buyers find and revive vacant houses in rural Japan.\nAkiya hold little appeal for most Japanese, but they have been catching the attention of foreign buyers seeking lower prices, traditional architecture, and the romance of restoring an old home. Allen warns that any potential restrictions on foreign property ownership should be aimed only at metropolitan markets where competition with locals is fiercest.\n\"The most logical way is to focus on the cities,\" he said. \"If foreign buying is accelerating, it could price some people out of the market — but we're talking here only about the Fifth Avenues of Japan.\"","content_hash":"94a002fd14505d73d8d655304a9e92d0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5909,"method_rank":0}

That said, there's more to the story here than meets the eye. Here are three reasons why, if you are considering buying an S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index clone, you might be better off buying this Invesco ETF like there's no tomorrow instead.\n1. Equal weighting matters theoretically and practically\nThe S&P 500 index is constructed by a committee. It includes 500 or so of the largest and most economically important U.S. companies, picked using specific criteria. The stocks that make the list are weighted by market cap, so the largest companies have the biggest impact on the index's performance. It is a well-constructed index that does a good job of tracking the U.S. economy and, secondarily, the U.S. stock market.\nIf you look at the past decade, the S&P 500 index has easily outdistanced Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF. But if you look back to roughly the inception of Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, it has actually beaten the S&P 500 index on both price-only performance and total return, which assumes dividend reinvestment. There's clearly something going on here, noting that Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF's 0.2% expense ratio is actually kind of high for an exchange-traded fund.\nUsing equal weighting makes a performance difference over time. The key is that equal weighting means every stock has the same impact on performance, good and bad. So the upside is limited from large companies today, but so will be the downside when today's hot stocks slump. Effectively, equal weighting increases diversification while market-cap weighting leads to heavy concentrations in hot stocks.\nIf you are a long-term investor and want to be in the market, but are worried about the frequent excesses of the market, the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF will be a great pick for you despite the elevated expense ratio.\n2. The ETF's valuation levels are extreme right now\nThe first point is a big-picture view of things. Getting down to something a little more specific to today, Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF's valuation levels are way more attractive than those of the S&P 500 index.\nThe S&P 500 index's average price-to-earnings ratio is currently around 27.6. The price-to-book value ratio is 5. Alone, those numbers don't mean much. The importance shows up when you compare them to Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight's 19.3 P\/E ratio and 2.9 P\/B ratio. The S&P 500 is expensive right now, as its performance has been driven by a small number of very large technology stocks. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF isn't nearly as expensive, which positions it better when those tech giants falter.\n3. Technology is less than half as important for this ETF\nThe final reason to buy the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is very granular and it goes back to the technology sector. The S&P 500 index's weighting in technology is roughly 34% today. Step back and think about that for a second. If you buy the S&P 500, you are putting a third of your portfolio in technology stocks. That's a very heavy weighting, or, to think of it another way, a very big bet on technology stocks. This is the kind of imbalance that market cap weighting leads to.\nThe Invesco S&P 500 ETF's weighting in technology stocks is only about 14%, less than half as much exposure to a sector that is hot right now. But Wall Street history tells investors that hot sectors eventually cool off. There's another number to look at here, though.\nNine of the top 10 holdings in the S&P 500 index are technology-related, if not directly in the tech sector. These top 10 holdings account for nearly 39% of assets. Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF's top-10 list contains a mix of industries and only accounts for about 3% of the ETF's assets. This all goes back to the equal-weighting methodology, but the difference is clearly important and pervasive when it comes to what you are buying.\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight is hidden in plain sight\nInvesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is a unique way to get exposure to the broader market. What it does isn't rocket science; it is a pretty simple approach to investing. But history suggests equal weighting works and that it leads to a materially different portfolio than you would get if you'd just bought an S&P 500 index ETF. If you are a long-term investor, going with Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF could be a very wise choice as the S&P 500 rockets higher on the backs of a very small number of large stocks.\nDo the experts think Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

It's probably as close to free money as you'll get. The only thing you need to do to earn dividends is own the stock that pays them.\nBut sometimes people get the wrong idea -- that dividend stocks are ultra-conservative investments, suitable for retirees or those only looking for passive income. Nope, dividend-paying companies can also deliver price appreciation, especially companies that continually increase their dividends.\nFortunately, you don't need to find these stocks yourself. Instead, consider an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF(NYSEMKT: VIG), which currently yields over 1.6% and has delivered total annualized returns of 12% for the past decade.\nBut is the ETF a buy right now, at a time when the broader stock market is at all-time highs? Here is what you need to know.\nBreaking down precisely what is in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF\nAn ETF is simply a bucket of individual stocks trading under one ticker symbol. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF comprises 337 stocks, so when you own a share, you're becoming a part owner in hundreds of individual companies. The primary benefit of an ETF such as this one is that you're instantly diversified, so you're not putting too many eggs in too few baskets.\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is incredibly well-rounded, both by market sector and the companies within it. For instance, five sectors have double-digit representation in the ETF:\nSource: Vanguard; chart by author.\nSome of the world's largest companies are technology and financial businesses, and happen to pay and raise dividends, so it makes sense that these sectors would carry a higher representation than others. To add some color to this, here are the ETF's top 10 individual holdings:\nSource: Vanguard; chart by author.\nThis top 10 represents a combined 33% of the fund, so they undoubtedly move the needle, but not so much that they alone can collapse the ETF if something happens to one of them. Among this list are top-notch stocks in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, weight-loss drugs, and e-commerce. These dividend stocks are anything but boring.\nA well-rounded composition may benefit the ETF if the \"Magnificent Seven\" stumbles\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF is a bit more well-rounded than the S&P 500 index, which carries hefty exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\nAccording to research by The Motley Fool, these stocks currently represent 34% of the index, up from just 12.3% a decade ago. As excited as investors are about AI and how it could affect the world over the coming decade and beyond, the increasingly higher weighting in the broader stock market creates concentration risks that investors shouldn't ignore.\nUnfortunately, it's hard to get around this heavy representation, because these companies are going to show up in many market indexes and investment funds due to their massive multitrillion-dollar valuations.\nHowever, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF includes only two Magnificent Seven stocks, Microsoft and Apple. In other words, the ETF is a great way to diversify your portfolio since you probably already have plenty of exposure to the Magnificent Seven companies, either directly or through other funds.\nShould you invest in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF now?\nThe Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF primarily contains large-cap companies, so it's unlikely the ETF would be a bargain while the broader market is doing so well.\nBut that doesn't mean it's not a buy. The ETF's blended five-year annualized earnings growth rate is 12.8%, and it trades at a blended price-to-earnings ratio of 25.1. Using the price\/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) to weigh the ETF's valuation against its earnings growth, the current ratio, about 2.0, is reasonable enough for long-term investors here, assuming the companies within the ETF continue to sustain that growth.\nThe value isn't compelling, so I probably wouldn't want to chase the ETF much higher from these prices. Still, it's never a bad idea to buy quality companies at reasonable prices, and these dividend-raising blue chip companies certainly earn that quality distinction. Consider nibbling on the ETF here, while saving some cash in case broader market volatility creates some better buying opportunities in the future.\nShould you buy stock in Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF wasn’t one of them.

The company announced a launch date of May 26, 2026 for the title.\nTake-Two reportedly spent over $1 billion to create the game. While that's a substantial sum, the previous entry in the franchise, GTA V, has pulled in around $10 billion in sales since its debut in 2013.\nWith the arrival of GTA VI on the horizon, is now the time to buy Take-Two shares? To address this question, here's a deeper look into the company.\nTake-Two's game looks like a winner\nThe success of the Grand Theft Auto series is critical to Take-Two. Upon GTA V's launch, the franchise accounted for nearly 70% of the company's sales in its 2014 fiscal year.\nMore than a decade later, GTA products still represented 15% of revenue in Take-Two's fiscal first quarter, ended June 30. The company produced $1.5 billion in Q1 sales, a 12% year-over-year increase.\nIndications already suggest that GTA VI will be a hit. Fan anticipation for the game is high. Its second trailer, released in May, is the biggest video launch of all time, according to Take-Two, with 475 million views in the first day. For comparison, 2024's Deadpool & Wolverine movie trailer reached 365 million views in the first 24 hours, which made it the most-watched film trailer in history at the time.\nIn addition, GTA V remains among the top three best-selling video games of all time, accounting for over 215 million units sold. The entire GTA franchise has achieved sales of 455 million units. In contrast, Minecraft has sold around 300 million units.\nTake-Two's strengthening financials\nThe company has additional irons in the fire aside from GTA VI. Two other successful franchises are launching new titles in September. The sports game NBA 2K26 comes out on Sept. 5, and the looter-shooter Borderlands 4 arrives Sept. 12.\nThe releases are expected to boost revenue in the fiscal second quarter, ending Sept. 30, to a range between $1.65 billion and $1.7 billion. That would be a strong increase from sales of $1.3 billion in the prior fiscal year.\nWith the impending titles and Take-Two's excellent Q1 sales, the company raised its fiscal 2026 revenue outlook to between $6.1 billion to $6.2 billion, up from fiscal 2025's $5.6 billion.\nDespite the sales growth, Take-Two's business isn't profitable. It exited fiscal Q1 with a net loss of $11.9 million. However, that figure is a substantial reduction from the $262 million loss in the prior year, which is a sign that the company has a shot at turning a profit soon.\nIn fact, Take-Two achieved operating income of $21.6 million in fiscal Q1. That's a dramatic turnaround from the previous year's operating loss of $184.9 million.\nA tailwind to Take-Two's ability to achieve profitability lies in digital content sales. People are overwhelmingly opting for digital downloads instead of buying a physical game disc, and digital products deliver higher profit margins to Take-Two.\nIn fiscal Q1, digital sales represented 98% of the company's $1.5 billion in revenue. When GTA V was released, digital comprised only 16% of revenue. This means GTA VI is likely to contribute greater profit than its predecessor.\nEvaluating whether to buy Take-Two stock\nGiven Take-Two's many positives and the imminent release of Grand Theft Auto VI, the company looks like a worthwhile investment. But the stock is up 26% this year through the week ending Aug. 15. You have to wonder if now's the best time to scoop up Take-Two shares.\nTo assess the situation, let's examine the stock's price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio, which measures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of revenue generated over the trailing 12 months.\nThe chart shows that Take-Two's P\/S multiple has increased steadily over the past year, indicating that shares are not cheap. This suggests that the anticipated sales boost from upcoming popular titles, including GTA VI, may already be priced into the stock.\nOf course, if sales of GTA VI exceed expectations, Take-Two's share price is likely to rise. One approach to address the situation is to use dollar-cost averaging. Purchase some shares now, and gradually build your position over time, which takes the guesswork out of whether to buy now or wait for the stock price to dip.\nSince the video game sector's sales surpass the film, music, and book-publishing industries combined, and considering the enduring popularity of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, investors have strong reason to anticipate that GTA VI will be a key driver of Take-Two's revenue growth next year.\nShould you buy stock in Take-Two Interactive Software right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Take-Two Interactive Software, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Take-Two Interactive Software wasn’t one of them.

Googlers told Hugh how they feel about it.\nWhat's on deck:\nMarkets: Infamous market bear Michael Burry appears to have flipped his stance on stocks.\nTech: Hundreds of Microsoft employees are comparing compensation in a giant spreadsheet, BI exclusively reports.\nFor Googlers, the message is clear: use AI to make yourself more productive — or get left behind.\nSome are excited about it, others are doing it grudgingly, one Google engineer told Hugh. Either way, their boss needs them to do it.\nGoogle is under pressure. In an all-hands meeting last month, CEO Sundar Pichai said that as rival companies leverage AI, Google needs to rise to the challenge if it wants to compete, employees who heard the remarks told BI.\nIn a frank blog post, GitHub's CEO said developers have a choice: embrace AI, or \"get out of your career.\"\nThe rivals are becoming lean, mean, and increasingly machine. These directives apply as much to the companies as to their workers. If they fall behind their competitors — as a worker may fall behind a colleague — they risk never catching up.\nThe future of the software engineering profession will be a tale of the haves and have-nots.\nThat's according to Meta's chief technology officer. \"The engineers who master the tools to the point that they can't themselves be replaced by the tools command a premium,\" he said on Monday.\nGoogle seems to know this — and it's watching its engineers closely. Pichai said in June that engineers' weekly productivity hours are up 10% thanks to AI.\nSome companies are tracking employee AI use on a more granular level. Three providers of worker-tracking software told BI they've seen a sharp rise in demand over the past two years. Companies want their workers to use AI, and they aren't taking risks.\nIt can be an unpleasant message to hear. Few people enjoy receiving instructions that come with stark warnings. That said, the Google employees who spoke with BI seem on board.\n\"It seems like a no-brainer that you need to be using it to get ahead,\" one engineer told Hugh.\nIn Google's internal message board, BI found more skeptical remarks: \"You know a technology works and is great when you're forced to praise it to maintain your livelihood.\"\nIn this race, it seems there is no medal for second place.

They also happen to make up a tenth of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI).\nI have nothing against the other 90% of the stocks make up the widely tracked 30-stock index, but I'll stick with Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Disney. They are three of the Dow 30 stocks that I think are positioned well to soar for the rest of 2025 and beyond. Let's take a closer look.\n1. Amazon\nIt's hard to believe that the world's leading online retailer didn't punch its card to get into the Dow 30 until last year, but it's up a brisk 28% since the induction 18 months ago. The index is up less than 15% in that time, so the Amazon expedition is paying off so far for the Dow 30.\nAmazon's inclusion comes as growth slows for the dot-com icon. It has an applause-worthy run of growing its net sales by 9% or better in each of its first 28 years of trading, but it's been clinging to the low end of that range in recent years. Its top line has risen by 9% to 12% in each of the last three years, and it kicked off 2025 in uninspiring fashion when net sales climbed a mere 8.6% higher. It seemed as if the Dow 30 was too late on Amazon, but last month we saw a surprising acceleration of growth.\nNet sales rose 13% for Amazon's second quarter, which it announced at the end of last month. An 11% increase for its North American segment sales was nice, but the 16% jump in its international business -- fueled partly by a sluggish dollar -- was even better. The real star continues to be its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, up 18% for the quarter. It's just 18% of the revenue mix for Amazon, but it brought in more than half of the company's operating profit.\nThe bottom line fared even better. Net income per share rose 33% to $1.68 a share. It was another double-digit percentage earnings beat for Amazon. Three months ago the e-tailing behemoth was forecasting just a 4% increase in operating profit on a 7% to 11% year-over-year bump in net sales. Business keeps accelerating for Amazon.\nThe stock isn't cheap if you consider that it's trading for nearly 30 times next year's earnings. It's fetching nearly 4 times trailing net sales, a stiff multiple for retail stocks but a bargain if you focus on the AWS business that also makes it a tech services company. You have to like how Amazon is starting to accelerate its business again. Its guidance for the current quarter calls for net sales to rise 10% to 13%. The way it blew the cover off the ball last time, it shouldn't surprise anyone if its top line finds a way to rise in the mid-teens for the first time in three years. It's putting the \"magnificent\" in the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n2. Coca-Cola\nTurning to a bubbly stock, Coca-Cola is the undisputed global leader in the realm of pop. It's also a global juggernaut among beverage stocks with 30 different brands generating more than $1 billion in annual sales each. You didn't think that Coca-Cola was just about the namesake beverage, did you?\nCoca-Cola is a high-margin business with a long string of positive profit surprises. It's not just a reliable source of sugary escapism or hydration. Income investors collecting today's 2.9% yield know that they can bank on this Dividend King to continue boosting its payouts the way it has for 63 straight years. With a trailing payout ratio of 69%, there is more than enough wiggle room to stretch that streak to 64 next year.\nThere are some legitimate concerns about soda consumption trends, but Coca-Cola loves to climb that wall of worry. Revenue should climb for the fifth year in a row in 2025.\n3. Disney\nI couldn't write about my favorite Dow 30 stocks without mouse droppings. Disney is the global entertainment leader that also happens to operate the world's most popular theme parks. It's a historical laggard. It has delivered just three fiscal years of double-digit revenue growth in this millennium. This might not seem to make it a good time to invest in Disney, but the future is brighter than its storied past.\nDisney is getting back into a good groove at the multiplex after putting out the world's three biggest movies last year. Its theme parks have been generating strong results coming out of the pandemic. Disney+ is now profitable, dramatically boosting the media stock's bottom line. Its latest tweak -- today's launch of the new ESPN streaming service -- is another sign that a company that many figured would be disrupted is doing the disrupting. At 18 times forward earnings it's also the cheapest of these three stocks. It's time to come home to the House of Mouse.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Investors were assigning roughly 69% odds on a 0.25% cut from the Fed on Sept. 17 as of early Friday.\nDisagreement over the Fed's next move, however, is only a small part of the backdrop against which Powell is set to speak.\nMost notable is pressure from President Trump, who this week called for Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook to resign amid a controversy over two mortgage loans. The Financial Times reported Thursday that the Department of Justice sent Powell a letter calling on the Fed chair to remove Cook from her post.\nTrump, who refers to Powell as \"Too Late\" for not cutting rates earlier this year, has regularly commented on Fed policy and said interest rates should be much lower than the current benchmark range of 4.25%-4.50%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also weighed in on monetary policy, saying in an interview earlier this month that the Fed ought to consider cutting rates by 0.50% in September.\n\"I think that having an independent central bank has been an institutional arrangement that has served the public well,\" Powell said last month. \"And as long as it serves the public well, it should continue and be respected.\"\nPowell is also expected to lay out changes to the central bank’s policy framework review, which articulates the Fed’s strategy and commitment to fulfilling its congressional mandate for stable prices and maximum employment.\nIn particular, the central bank is expected to drop so-called average inflation targeting, a policy put in place pre-pandemic when inflation was running low and Fed officials wanted to avoid deflation.\nThis strategy has said that if inflation ran below 2% in years past, the Fed would tolerate it running above 2% in the future on the theory that it averages out. Given the recent bout of inflation and the risks it poses to the economy, the Fed is expected to drop that and focus on an inflation target of simply 2%.\nPowell signaled the change in a speech in May.\n“In our discussions so far, participants have indicated that they thought it would be appropriate to reconsider the language around shortfalls,” Powell said. “And at our meeting last week, we had a similar take on average inflation targeting.”\nThe Fed first created its monetary policy framework in 2012, which it adjusts every five years. And just as the changes announced back in 2020 had implications for monetary policy actions over the past five years — the Fed's language shift, it could be argued, kept the lid on rate hikes even as inflation accelerated in 2021 — so too could the changes Powell announces Friday send ripples for years to come.\n“While the adoption of the new framework in 2020 was not the primary factor behind the Fed’s delay and the substantial inflation overshoot, it contributed to this outcome,” said Matt Luzzetti, chief US economist for Deutsche Bank\nAs a result, Luzzetti expects Powell’s speech to restore a more preemptive strategy for monetary policy, along with recognizing risks of supply shocks and a return to a balanced view of inflation and the job market.\nJames Fishback, CEO of hedge fund Azoria, argued Powell needs to acknowledge what he calls the “tragic mistake” of average inflation targeting.\nPowell noted in his May speech that inflation could be more volatile going forward than in the 2010s and that the US may be entering a period of more frequent, and potentially more persistent, supply shocks.\n\"The economic environment has changed significantly since 2020, and our review will reflect our assessment of those changes,” Powell said in a speech in May.\nPowell also stressed enhancing the Fed’s formal policy communications, particularly regarding the role of forecasts and uncertainty. Investors will watch for whether the Fed rolls out changes to its quarterly Summary of Economic Projections, which contains the famous \"dot plot,\" a compilation of each member of the FOMC’s expectations for interest rates that year.\nJennifer Schonberger is a veteran financial journalist covering markets, the economy, and investing.

But given how risky and volatile crypto is as a whole, it may be wise to keep things simple. Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) has been around for a decade and is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.\nEther, the native token for the Ethereum network, has been on a tear lately; its market price has almost tripled since April, and it's beginning to approach its all-time high, set back in 2021 at the peak of a previous crypto bull market.\nBut things have changed since 2021, and the coin's recent rally may have some serious legs. Here are three reasons why it's one of the best cryptocurrencies you can invest $100 in right now.\n1. Regulatory tailwinds\nTo start, look no further than the regulatory tides lifting all the cryptocurrency boats. The Trump administration has been a tremendous ally to the cryptocurrency industry by:\nPeeling back regulatory scrutiny and litigation against companies in the industry.\nPlanning to establish a federal Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile via executive order.\nHelping to pass the Genius Act, which is aimed at establishing clearer regulatory frameworks for digital currencies and their real-world applications.\nThese moves are a step toward making cryptocurrencies a mainstream asset.\n2. Institutional money flowing in\nInstitutional interest is gaining steam as the regulatory climate thaws. Corporations, banks, and investment funds have substantial buying power.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the creation of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last summer. These ETFs hold Ether on behalf of the fund's investors, giving people a simple way to invest without having actual custody of the tokens. That means no need to fuss with wallets or seed phrases. Since then, more $12 billion has flowed into U.S. spot Ether ETFs.\nAdditionally, President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order that would pave the way for retirement accounts like 401(k)s to have access to alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies. With time, this could spark further interest in Ether and other cryptocurrencies. There are more than $40 trillion in total U.S. retirement assets, and even a tiny fraction of that going into digital assets could mean a massive inflow of funds.\n3. The Ethereum network is evolving\nSmart contracts could eventually play a significant role in society. A smart contract is a digitally coded agreement that automatically executes an action under the specified conditions. A blockchain is a decentralized and secure ledger system, an ideal avenue for smart contracts. The Ethereum blockchain is currently the largest, by a wide margin, based on its total locked value, with more than $121 billion in smart contracts. The next closest are Tron and Solana, with just over $8 billion and $6 billion, respectively.\nTo stay on top, the Ethereum network has a roadmap for upgrades. Previously, the Merge transitioned Ethereum from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system. This reduced the network's energy consumption, improved its security, and set the stage for several planned upgrades.\nThose upgrades include the Verge, Purge, and Splurge, which will make the network more efficient, lower transaction fees, and enhance scalability, enabling nodes to run on smaller hardware devices, such as smartphones. While there is competition from other blockchains, and Ethereum isn't the best at everything, its current size and continuous improvements bode well for its future as a pillar of the digital economy.\nEther's price outlook looks promising\nIt's anyone's guess how high Ether's price will go, and it's bound to be volatile. That said, Ethereum looks like a strong buy for long-term investors. The token's price still hasn't cleared its all-time high from back in 2021, something Bitcoin did at the beginning of last year. Additionally, its fully diluted market value is still just a quarter of Bitcoin's.\nThat doesn't mean that Ether is bound to catch Bitcoin, but Ethereum is the world's largest blockchain, and its valuation doesn't reflect that yet. Smart contracts could see increased adoption during the next several years as regulatory barriers fall, which, along with continued inflows from investors and institutions, could drive Ethereum's usage and Ether's price higher over time.\nShould you buy stock in Ethereum right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn’t one of them.

The energy midstream giant has woefully underperformed the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which has rallied nearly 10% so far this year.\nThe master limited partnership's (MLP) underperformance may have some investors wondering whether it's time to get out of their investment. Here's a look at what has weighed on the midstream giant, and whether it has the fuel to rise again.\nA speed bump\nEnergy Transfer is coming off a strong year. The MLP produced a company-record $15.5 billion in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) last year. That was at the high end of its guidance range, and up 13% from 2023's level.\nThe pipeline company also generated a record $8.4 billion in distributable cash flow in 2024, a 10% year-over-year increase. Energy Transfer capitalized on strong market conditions and got a boost from acquisitions (Crestwood in late 2023 and WTG Midstream in the middle of last year).\nHowever, the midstream giant's growth rate has slowed considerably this year. It has generated nearly $8 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $5.5 billion of distributable cash flow through the first half of 2025, representing increases of 4% and less than 1%, respectively. Those sluggish growth rates are due largely to a lack of catalysts. Energy Transfer has completed fewer growth capital projects and isn't getting as big a boost from recent acquisitions. Additionally, market conditions have been more volatile this year.\nAs a result of these factors, Energy Transfer currently expects its adjusted EBITDA to be at or slightly below the lower end of its $16.1 billion-$16.5 billion guidance range. That implies less than 4% growth compared to 2024.\nA reacceleration is on the way\nWhile Energy Transfer is benefiting from fewer growth catalysts this year, the momentum should shift as it heads into 2026. The MLP is investing $5 billion in growth capital projects this year, with the bulk of these projects entering service through the end of next year. It has recently completed two new gas processing plants and has another scheduled for completion in the second quarter of next year.\nEnergy Transfer is also wrapping up construction on its Nederland Flexport NGL expansion. Additionally, the company is building both phases of the Hugh Brinson Pipeline, which should enter service at the end of next year. These and other projects should fuel a substantial increase in its earnings and cash flow in 2026 and 2027.\nMeanwhile, Energy Transfer has recently secured several more growth projects. The most notable is the Desert Southwest expansion of its Transwestern Pipeline. The $5.3 billion project should enter service by the end of the decade. Energy Transfer also approved projects with in-service dates in 2027 and 2028. As a result, it now has visible earnings growth into the next decade.\nEnergy Transfer has many more expansion projects under development. It's getting closer to approving the long-delayed Lake Charles LNG export project. The MLP is also working on several potential projects to supply gas to new power plants and data centers. Securing these and other projects would further enhance and extend Energy Transfer's growth outlook.\nAdditionally, Energy Transfer is currently in the strongest financial position in its history. That puts it in an excellent position to continue making acquisitions as the right opportunities emerge.\nWhile Energy Transfer hasn't made a deal this year, its affiliated MLP Sunoco LP has agreed to buy Parkland for $9.1 billion. Sunoco expects the deal to boost its earnings by more than 10% in the first year. As a major Sunoco investor, Energy Transfer's financial results will benefit from this deal when it closes later this year.\nDefinitely not out\nEnergy Transfer's slowing growth in 2025 has weighed on its unit price. However, a growth reacceleration appears to be right around the corner. Because of this, the recent dip in the unit price appears to be a compelling buying opportunity for those who are comfortable receiving the Schedule K-1 federal tax form that the MLP sends investors each year.\nIn addition to the upside potential as its growth engine reaccelerates, investors can lock in the MLP's more than 7.5%-yielding distribution, which should steadily grow in the coming years as its income rises. These catalysts potentially position investors to earn a high-octane total return from here.\nShould you buy stock in Energy Transfer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Energy Transfer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Energy Transfer wasn’t one of them.

Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate,” Fink continued.\nBlackRock’s recent acquisitions underscore Fink’s advice against the 60\/40 stock-bond portfolio split. The 50\/30\/20 split means 20% of a person’s investments are in private assets, which could be good for BlackRock’s business as they move in this new private asset-focused direction.\nWhat does this mean for you?\nIf the democratization of assets previously reserved for the wealthy and a 50\/30\/20 split sounds appealing to you, there are options that allow you to increase your investment in private assets like real estate right away.\nYou can tap into the private real estate market by investing in shares of vacation homes or rental properties through Arrived.\nBacked by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived allows you to invest in shares of vacation and rental properties, meaning you could earn passive income from real estate without the hassle of being a landlord.\nTo get started, simply browse through their vetted properties to find potential investments that appeal to you. Once you find your dream investment property, you can start investing with as little as $100.\nBut as alternative assets become increasingly accessible, there are also ways to put more of your money into this sector. Accredited investors could consider commercial real estate to further diversify their portfolios.\nFor years, direct access to this $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector has been limited to a select group of elite investors, but First National Realty Partners (FNRP) has changed that.\nFNRP allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, minus the stress of being a commercial landlord.\nGold is another private investment that has become increasingly popular over the past few months, reaching an all-time high of $3,534 on August 8.\nIf you’re interested in investing in gold, you can open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold and gold-related assets within their retirement account, combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the safety of gold. This makes it an attractive option for anyone looking to hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\nSome advisors are not as comfortable as Fink is with the 50\/30\/20 split for the average investor.\nAmy Arnott, portfolio strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC that a 20% allocation in private assets is still considered aggressive.\n“If you want to keep things very simple, the 60\/40 portfolio or a target date fund is a great starting point,” Arnott said.\nShe noted that the total value of private assets globally is only “about $14.3 trillion, while the public markets are worth about $247 trillion,” which means private assets account for just 6% of the market — not 20%.\nIf you’re not sure what split you should be investing in, you might want to speak with a financial advisor to help give you peace of mind.\nAdvisor.com can help match you with an advisor to find the right portfolio mix for you. Since their advisors are legally obligated to act in your best interest, you know your money is in good hands.\nJust answer a few quick questions about yourself, and Advisor.com will match you with a vetted financial advisor who can walk you through your portfolio options.\nIf your household income is above $300,000, you might also consider a wealth management team like Range to help you figure out all the possible options.\nRange’s all-in-one wealth management platform offers modern investing advice — with no hidden fees.\nTraditional advisors typically charge 0.5-2% AUM fees, but Range’s flat-fee pricing with 0% AUM fees offers comprehensive plans at a fraction of the cost of traditional advisors.\nRange’s clients receive 24\/7 expert advice and personalized strategies, allowing for complete portfolio customization alongside full wealth management — including complex tax management, equity compensation and estate planning.","content_hash":"735975a07b46c6ec7690131e41997c5d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5490,"method_rank":0}

Hutton at the time — she talked, people listened — though she got no mention in the movie by the same name.\nThe CEO and founder of the Meredith Whitney Advisory Group has been spotting trouble on the horizon again, saying the U.S. faces a “bifurcated economy” driven by the high-end consumer.\nIn a Tuesday interview with MarketWatch, Whitney stood by a prediction she made earlier this year, that over 50% of U.S. households – many living paycheck to paycheck – faced a second recession of losing jobs, after one in 2022-2023 when stimulus checks ended.\n“To me, the weakest portion of the U.S. economy, which employs over 20% of U.S. workers, is hospitality and leisure,” she said. Those jobs generally pay under $60,000 and may see the biggest hits when employment numbers start to worsen and tariffs start to weigh, she added.\n“I think employment is going to be a really big pickle,” Whitney said, adding that stagflation — rising jobless numbers and sticky inflation — is a “real possibility.” That’s as college graduates are having an incredibly difficult time in getting first jobs, just as student debt payments resume, which she notes is straining multiple generations.\nWhitney turned bullish on dollar stores like Dollar General DG and Dollar Tree DLTR late last year, “thinking the worst was over,” but moved away from that view in May. “I think the dollar stores are going to be challenged -– we’ll see in a couple of weeks when they report -– because their customer base will be the most economically challenged,” she said.\nShe now prefers “higher-end retailers” like Home Depot HD, Lowe’s LOW and Walmart WMT. Those companies “don’t scream ‘high end,’ but we argue that the fact that more of their customers are homeowners, and homeowners and the high end are the only households with a financial safety net, is significant,” Whitney told clients in a separate note.\nWhether or not consumers continue to spend comes down to home ownership, according to Whitney, who said homeowners increasingly began to tap into their home equity a little over a year ago, reversing a 17-year cycle of declining equity-home loans.\n“So from a peak of around $700 billion, that went down closer to $250 billion to $240 billion and that’s now increasing. And home equity is actually the fastest growing loan category of any consumer-loan product,” with credit cards, student and auto loans flat, she said.\nShe’s bullish on companies in that space of home equity, personal loans and cash-out refinances. Those include Rocket RKT, SoFi Technologies SOFI and Affirm Holdings AFRM — those stocks have doubled or more this year.\nWhitney believes the housing market itself is headed for its worst market in decades — in terms of activity — backing up a prediction she made a month ago. “Existing-home sales are tracking under 4 million on an annualized basis and that’s the worst in over 25 years. Buyers are looking for steep discounts and sellers are not willing to make those discounts,” she said.\nThe trouble is that an estimated 60% of homes are owned by those over 55, who aren’t selling, partly as lower-cost downsizing options are limited, she said. “So either these folks have no mortgage or a small mortgage and the capital gains that they have to take and the costs that are required to move are prohibitive,” she said, adding that boomers may not be as wealthy as many think.\nStuck with limited alternatives, they are tapping tapping into equity in their homes, accounting for 41% of total home equity debt, she said..\nThat, of course is counterintuitive because individuals tend to get more conservative with money as they age, but are now struggling with increasing costs of owning a home – property insurance has risen well north of 60% over the past five years, she noted.\n“Given the fact that 60% of homes are owned by seniors, that is the clear issue with affordable housing, because there’s just an inventory lock,” said Whitney.\nU.S. stocks SPX DJIA COMP have opened mixed following Tuesday’s losses driven by big technology names. Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y are inching up and oil CL00 is also positive.\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but to get it delivered once to your email box. The emailed version will be sent out at about 7:30 a.m. Eastern.\nThe buzz\nTarget TGT named a new CEO as it beat earnings expectations in the second quarter.\nLowe’s LOW hiked its full-year guidance and said it was buying Foundation Building Materials for $8.8 billion.\nMinutes of the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting are due at 2 p.m., with an appearance by Fed. Gov. Christopher Waller at 11 a.m. ahead of that. Later, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak.\nTuesday was notable in other ways, such as a burst of energy for value plays, while momentum stocks sagged, as the chart shows. That “smells a lot like the clean-out in the AI trade we saw last January, when the release of DeepSeek drove a temporary market panic over the outlook in the space,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group.\nTop tickers\nThese were the top-searched tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m.:","content_hash":"fcdd42361c1525ec52d6f996405d7fe1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5379,"method_rank":0}

Once a fan of heavy money printing, Asahi Noguchi has also turned more neutral and voted for raising rates in January.\nSuch shifts in the board's policy bias put Ueda and his career central banker-turned deputy Shinichi Uchida in the more dovish camp, as their comments continue to focus on downside risks to Japan's fragile economy.\nTheir caution reflects the BOJ's preference to await more data to gauge whether the global economy, including Japan's, will withstand the hit from U.S. tariffs, say sources familiar with the bank's thinking.\nIt also reflects lingering worries within the BOJ that the damage to exports and capital expenditure will intensify in coming months - as predicted by the bank's economists.\nIn analyses included in the July quarterly outlook, BOJ economists warned company profits are likely to fall this year because of U.S. tariffs, hurting capital expenditure.\nThere is good reason to worry. While Japan's trade deal with the U.S. agreed to cut tariffs for its mainstay auto exports, Washington has not made clear the timing of the reduction.\nMany analysts expect exports, which lifted Japan's second-quarter GDP, to lose momentum later this year as the hit from U.S. tariffs deepens.\nEven hawkish board members warn such risks could warrant caution on rate hikes.\n\"We need to scrutinise whether any negative impact from U.S. tariffs could appear,\" board member Takata said in a speech on July 3.\nDespite the board's hawkish tilt, Ueda's cautious stance may prevail given the influence the governor holds over BOJ decision making.\nWith support from staff of key divisions, the governor prepares proposals on policy and interest rates for a vote by the board. Most have been approved unanimously or by a majority, including the BOJ's exit from a decade-long stimulus last year.\nThe governor's proposal has never been voted down since the current board framework took shape in 1998.\n\"I don't see any tough negotiator in the current board who could stage a revolt. It's hard to imagine the hawks proposing a rate hike against the governor's will,\" said former BOJ official Nobuyasu Atago, who used to be staff for hawkish ex-board member Miyako Suda.\n\"Governor Ueda's leadership within the board appears to be fairly strong.\"\n(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Sam Holmes)","content_hash":"82a13015d2572be49579512a2a5a089f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5350,"method_rank":0}

Taxpayers who are 65 or older can now claim an extra $6,000 as a tax deduction above their standard deduction and additional standard deduction, effectively reducing their tax liability.\nThis senior deduction is per filer, so a couple filing together could get up to $12,000 in additional deductions as a result of the new tax act.\nIn theory, the deduction could save you money and provide you with greater tax-free room during a Roth IRA conversion.\nThat’s because any cash converted from your traditional IRA into a Roth IRA is regarded as regular income, meaning you will pay taxes on it during the process.\nEffectively, the senior deduction could make a Roth IRA conversion more attractive. However, there are some limitations on the deduction that could make it less attractive depending on your income and time horizons.\nAlthough this new senior deduction may seem attractive, it isn’t permanent, and it isn’t available to everyone.\nThe full deduction is only applicable for those who earn $75,000 or less individually, or $150,000 or less as a couple. Beyond those thresholds, the deduction amount is gradually phased down and fully phased out at $175,000 for individual taxpayers, and $250,000 for couples.\nIf you attempt a Roth IRA conversion and the cash you convert pushes your adjusted gross income (AGI) over these thresholds, then your deduction could be impacted.\nIf you earn a relatively high income and are looking to convert a large amount, you could even eliminate the senior deduction completely, missing out on valuable tax savings.\nFor example, if a married couple had a household income of $140,000, and they were considering a $20,000 Roth IRA conversion, that move would push their AGI to $160,000, placing them beyond the $150,000 threshold for the new senior deduction, meaning they would not receive the full $12,000 deduction that was previously available to them.\nThat means the effective cost of converting to a Roth IRA could be higher than expected — not only because of the added taxable income, but also because you’d lose a valuable deduction in the process.\nHigh-income households and backdoor Roth IRA contributions\nWith that being said, there are still ways for high-earners to access the benefits of a Roth IRA — in particular, that tax-free withdrawal come retirement.\nRoth IRAs don’t allow joint filers making above $246,000 or individuals making more than $165,000 in modified adjusted gross income to make contributions. But there’s no rule stopping you from contributing to a traditional IRA and then converting it into a Roth IRA.\nWith that said, be careful if you have any other non-Roth IRAs, including those that may have rolled over from an existing 403(b) or 401(k). As far as the IRS is concerned, under pro-rata rules, all of your non-Roth IRAs will be assessed as one sum to determine the taxes owing on your after-tax IRA contribution.\nThis can torpedo your potential tax savings if you aren’t careful.\nIf that sounds complicated — and it is — the experts at Range are here to help. They provide all-in-one white-glove wealth management services for high-earning professionals and households making over $300,000.\nThis includes navigating the complexities of the backdoor Roth IRA tax strategy and even the mega-backdoor Roth IRA method. But Range Advisors can also offer proactive advice across your entire financial life, including alternative assets management — not just taxes.\nFrom stock options and tax strategies to real estate and big-picture planning, Range integrates it all under one roof. With a transparent, flat annual fee — no hidden costs or percentage-of-assets surprises — you get AI-powered insights and comprehensive guidance designed to scale with your wealth.\nThe bottom line\nYou might consider spreading out your Roth IRA conversion over multiple years. For instance, instead of converting $20,000 this year, you could convert $7,000 every year for the next three years, maintaining your eligibility for the new tax deduction.\nHowever, the senior deduction is only available for tax years 2025 through 2028, which means you have a limited window to maximize tax savings while converting to a Roth IRA account.\nIf you’re trying to figure out the best path forward, a certified financial planner can remove the guesswork from retirement planning.\nAdvisor.com can help connect you with a financial advisor suited to your needs, and based in your area.

This year, just four companies are on track to spend more than $350 billion and are set to spend at least $400 billion in 2026. To put that into perspective, adjusted for inflation, the entire Apollo program -- which put humans on the Moon -- spent less than $300 billion over 10 years.\nCoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV) is right in the middle of this data center boom, buying Nvidia's top chips and renting them out to companies like Microsoft. The opportunity here is massive, but so is the risk, as the company continues to fuel its growth with debt.\n1. CoreWeave has a $30.1 billion backlog\nThe company fills the substantial gap that exists between demand for AI computing power and current supply. It's what has led CoreWeave's top line to explode, up more than 200% year over year as of its second-quarter report. The jump from under $400 million in Q2 2024 to more than $1.21 billion in Q2 2025 is incredible, but can it continue?\nThe $30.1 billion in backlog sure makes it seem so, at least for the foreseeable future. That's $30.1 billion in sales lined up so long as the company follows through on its commitments and can build out the capacity needed to fill those orders.\nThere's a wrinkle here, however. While the $30.1 billion is a significant increase from last quarter's $25.9 billion, the company had already announced a $4 billion deal with OpenAI in its last earnings that accounted for the bulk of the quarter-over-quarter jump. CoreWeave only booked $1.4 billion in new contracts this quarter -- not as much as might have been expected.\n2. CoreWeave spent a record $2.9 billion in capex\nThe company spent $2.9 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in Q2, the bulk of which went toward purchasing Nvidia's hyper-advanced data center chips as it tries to meet the demand. Management has to make sure that it spends cash now to have chips available when customers need it; as best it can, it needs to anticipate demand, but it doesn't want to overspend if it can avoid it -- these chips aren't cheap. That makes capex a useful indicator of where the company thinks that demand will be in the future.\nAnd while a record-setting capex would seem at first blush to mean all is good, the $2.9 billion was actually lower than Wall Street expected and could indicate demand is not as strong as hoped.\n3. CoreWeave's debt continues to grow, topping $11 billion\nIn order to scale at its lightning-fast pace, the company is making use of debt -- a lot of it. In Q2, the company's total debt reached more than $11 billion, and analysts believe it could add another $10 billion by year-end. Just to service the interest on this debt, the company paid nearly $270 million in the second quarter. That's extremely high. In fact, CoreWeave paid more than 13 times its operating income just to cover the interest on its debt. And if it indeed adds another $10 billion to its debt load before 2025 is done, that multiple could be even worse.\nAnd while many companies effectively leverage debt to scale, the assets the company is buying with this debt don't have that long a useful life. These aren't loans for a gas pipeline that will last decades. These are high-interest loans for chips with shelf lives of a few years.\nCoreWeave is riding the edge\nCoreWeave's growth is built on too rocky a foundation for my taste. While the blistering pace and massive backlog are reassuring in the near term, there are already some cracks. But relying on high-interest debt to play the middleman in AI doesn't seem like a long-term winning strategy to me.\nThere will likely come a time when the Microsofts of the world prefer to cut out the middle man and drive down their own margins. And even if that doesn't happen, if AI demand cools even slightly, CoreWeave could be left out to dry, given its reliance on high-interest debt.

It's designed to expand access for existing cable subscribers and give sports fans outside the traditional pay TV bundle access to all of ESPN's content.\nIt's the first time the company is offering all of its linear TV content to customers via streaming.\n\"We're approaching our 46th year here, and I would say that this is one of the biggest days at ESPN, if not the biggest,\" ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro told CNBC's David Faber Thursday. \"This is something that fans have been wanting, they've been asking for for many years. And our mission is to serve the sports fan — anytime, anywhere — and we're going to deliver.\"\nPitaro and Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company will be focused on the ESPN ecosystem as a whole, rather than subscribers specifically to the new service.\n\"As a company, we're now agnostic when it comes to linear television and digital television, digital content, we manage them together and holistically,\" Iger said. \"We look at the whole, and that's what we'll do here.\"\nHere's what we know about what the app will look like and how it will work for consumers.\nPlan playbook\nAnyone who currently pays for ESPN through their cable service will have access to the ESPN streaming app.\nFor everyone else, the app will come in a variety of options at sign-up.\nSubscribers can buy into the unlimited plan, which grants access to all of ESPN's networks, for $29.99 per month or $299.99 annually.\nESPN says this plan will cover more than 47,000 live events annually, including the NCAA championships, the Australian Open, the PGA Championship and more.\nUsers can also bundle the ESPN unlimited plan with Disney+ and Hulu for $35.99 a month, including ads, or $44.99 a month without ads.\nAt launch, Disney will offer that same bundle at a promotional price of $29.99 per month, with ads, for the first year.\nThere's also another bundle on the way, in October. ESPN and Fox Corp. are teaming up to offer their direct-to-consumer streaming services as a combined offering.\nFox's service, called Fox One, also debuts Thursday and includes all Fox content including news and sports. It costs $19.99 a month on its own.\nThe ESPN and Fox One bundle will be available on Oct. 2 for $39.99 per month. However, customers of the pay TV bundle will receive access to each of the streaming apps at no additional cost.\nWhat's next for ESPN+\nShort of the ESPN unlimited offering, the company is also debuting its ESPN select tier.\nThis plan features access to all content available on the existing ESPN+ service, including live sports streaming, a library of exclusive studio shows and original content and on-demand game replays.\nESPN says this plan will cover more than 32,000 live events annually.\nIt will cost $11.99 per month or $119.99 annually.\nCustomers can also purchase the Disney+, Hulu and ESPN select bundle, which includes ads, for $16.99 per month, or a no-ads option for $26.99 per month.\nESPN+ was the sports network's first foray into streaming, launching in 2018 as a separate app that has exclusive content outside the TV network. While it has some live game simulcasts, it's never housed the bulk of ESPN's content.\nESPN+ had 24 million subscribers as of Disney's most recent earnings report.\nExisting ESPN+ customers will automatically become subscribers of the ESPN select plan under the new service, the company has said.\nCustomers with existing subscriptions to the streaming bundles will be able to watch ESPN content on Disney+ alongside the other programming.\n\"This is going to continue to evolve and continue to improve over time, and in fact, with the data that will be available, it will improve even more as sports fans are served what they want to watch and what they want to see the most,\" Iger said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"\nBulking up content\nESPN's streaming service will include all of the network's live games, along with programming from ESPN2, the SEC Network and ESPN on ABC. In addition, it will feature fantasy products, new betting tie-ins, studio programming and documentaries, among other kinds of content.\nThe network recently signed two deals to bolster its sports offerings.\nIn early August, ESPN said it was entering a partnership with the WWE for the U.S. rights to the wrestling league's biggest events, including WrestleMania, the Royal Rumble and SummerSlam.

And below, I'm going to focus on what I think are some of the best deals available.\nThree stocks that trade at less than $100 per share and can be bargain buys right now include Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS), and Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA). A couple are facing concerning headwinds, but here's why they can all be great long-term investments.\nPinterest\nPinterest is a popular social media site where people go for ideas related to just about anything. Whether it's home renovation projects, baking, or recent shopping hauls, there's a ton of content to sift through. The platform is particularly popular with Gen Z, which Pinterest says accounts for more than 40% of its monthly user base.\nEntering this week, shares of Pinterest have been trading around $35, and that's with the stock rising 24% since the start of the year. And yet, it's still a cheap buy, trading at just 13 times its trailing earnings.\nIts price\/earnings-to-growth multiple, or PEG, is around 0.8. That's based on analyst expectations over the next five years, and it implies that Pinterest is one heck of a cheap growth stock.\nThe company's top line rose by 17% in its most recent quarter (which ended on June 30), to just under $1 billion. Monthly active users rose by 11% to 578 million. With a market cap of only $24 billion, Pinterest is a business that could get a whole lot more valuable given how popular it is with younger audiences. It can be a terrific long-term buy.\nUnited Parcel Service\nThere's not much growth happening for United Parcel Service these days. The logistics company is battling significant macroeconomic headwinds due to tariffs. It's trading at less than $90, and the last time you could have bought the stock at a much cheaper price than that was in 2013.\nUPS is facing some near-term challenges, but it's hard to not like the business over the long haul. The world of e-commerce is still getting bigger, and demand for global shipments isn't likely to slow down. There may be short-term adversity, but if you're a long-term investor, you don't need to worry too much about UPS given its dominance in the industry.\nThe company is making tough but smart decisions, such as scaling back on volume from Amazon in an effort to improve profitability. And it is profitability, not simply sales, that should drive decisions. Although it may not be a popular move and it may hurt the top line, if it improves profit margins, that could be a big win in the end.\nUPS is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple (P\/E) of 13, and in the long run it could have plenty of upside as economic conditions improve.\nComcast\nRounding out this list of cheap stocks is media and tech company Comcast. It's trading around $34, and its P\/E is less than 6 -- an astoundingly low valuation for one of the largest entertainment companies in the country.\nIts high debt load (around $100 billion) is undoubtedly turning away a lot of risk-averse investors. But with Comcast spinning off many cable TV networks later this year, that could help reduce costs and allow it to focus on higher-growth opportunities in areas such as streaming. The business may have become too bloated, and simplifying its approach could work well for investors.\nOverall, Comcast still has excellent brands in its portfolio, and it's highly profitable, with an operating margin of around 20% over the past six months. I'm optimistic that by becoming leaner, the business can be better positioned for growth in the future. At such a cheap valuation, it may be too tempting to pass up since it offers an excellent margin of safety.\nDo the experts think Pinterest is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

","description":"Is Verizon Communications Stock a Buy for Passive Income Investors in 2025 ? ","published_at":"2025-08-21T10:00:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"Verizon Communications (VZ) has long been a go-to dividend stock for income investors due to its consistent dividend, industry-leading network, and scale in the U.S. telecom market. It offers wireless, broadband, and other communication services to individuals, businesses, and the government. The wireless giant has a high dividend yield of 6.1%, a ,long dividend history, and a clearer picture of cash generation now that the 5G buildout is maturing.\nAt the same time, the company operates in a saturated U.S. wireless market where adding phone subscribers has become increasingly difficult. As a result, the question arises: Is Verizon stock still a buy for income investors in 2025?\nValued at $183.4 billion, VZ stock has gained 10.8% year-to-date, slightly beating the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) gain of 9.7%.\nDividend Stability: The Key Metric for Income Investors\nAside from a high yield, the most appealing feature of a good dividend stock is its consistent dividend payments and growth. Verizon has increased its dividends over the last 20 years, establishing a reputation for consistent payouts and increases. This continued quarterly payment indicates that the company intends to protect the payout even in choppier operating environments.\nAnother factor in determining dividend safety is the amount of profits distributed as dividends, which is measured by the dividend payout ratio. Verizon’s forward payout ratio of 55.8% shows a good balance between returning money to shareholders and saving for growth initiatives.\nIn the second quarter, Verizon reported consolidated revenue of $34.5 billion, up 5.2% year-over-year, boosted by strong wireless service revenue and wireless equipment revenue. Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.1% year on year to $12.8 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 6.1% to $1.22.\nBroadband remains a growth engine, with 293,000 net additions in Q2. Fixed wireless access (FWA) accounted for 278,000 of the net additions, bringing its total to 5.1 million subscribers. In the earnings call, management stated the company remains on track to reach 8 million to 9 million FWA subscribers by 2028. The upcoming acquisition of Frontier (FYBR) (pending regulatory approval) has the potential to accelerate Verizon’s fiber strategy and expand its broadband footprint.\nThe company’s free cash flow reached $5.2 billion in the quarter and $8.8 billion year to date, an increase of more than $300 million over the same period in 2024. Free cash flow is arguably the most significant indicator in determining dividend stability. Its current debt-equity ratio is slightly higher at 1.4x. The company is continuing to reduce debt, with few maturities remaining in 2025, and has stated that share buybacks will be considered after meeting long-term leverage targets. Verizon expects to generate free cash flow between $19.5 billion and $20.5 billion in 2025. This should allow Verizon to pay down debt while maintaining dividend payments.\nThe company raised its annual adjusted EPS growth guidance to 1% to 3%. Analysts predict that Verizon’s earnings will increase by 2.5% in 2025 and 3.04% in 2026. Verizon’s dividend appears secure for now, thanks to strong free cash flow generation, a conservative payout ratio supported by EBITDA growth, and ongoing debt reduction, all of which improve financial flexibility.\nDespite these advantages, investors should be mindful of potential risks, such as competitive pressures in the wireless and broadband sectors from AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and cable providers. Furthermore, Verizon’s debt load, while manageable now, remains significant, and interest rate changes may affect refinancing costs.\nWhat Is Wall Street Saying About Verizon Stock?\nOverall, on Wall Street, Verizon stock is rated a “Moderate Buy.” Out of the 28 analysts who cover Verizon stock, nine rate it a “Strong Buy,” three suggest it’s a “Moderate Buy,” and 16 rate it a \"Hold.” Its average price target of $48.29 suggests that the stock can increase by 11% over current levels. However, its high target price of $58 implies upside potential of 33.3% over the next 12 months.\nBottom Line: A Solid Pick for Dividend Stability\nVerizon stock remains an attractive buy for income-focused investors looking for a high, stable yield backed by strong free cash flow. The company’s network leadership, disciplined financial management, and growth in broadband and private network services all help to ensure the dividend’s sustainability. While growth investors may prefer faster-moving tech stocks, those looking for a high, stable yield with moderate risk will find Verizon a compelling option in 2025.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Optimism was further boosted when coalition negotiations between Merz's Christian Democratic Union, alongside its sister party the Christian Social Union, and the Social Democratic Party, triggered a major fiscal shift that is set to enable higher spending on defense and infrastructure.\nThe CDU, CSU, and SPD now form Germany's coalition government, and the sense of enthusiasm from businesses has persisted as the coalition's political term has gotten underway, according to business leaders who have spoken to CNBC in recent weeks.\n\"We have, as you heard before, a minimum of 10, maybe 20, years of weak political decisions, very ideologically driven, not business driven, not society driven, and it seems to be that the new government is going in a different direction,\" Thomas Schulz, CEO of construction company Bilfinger, said earlier this month.\nElsewhere, financial services provider Allianz's CEO Oliver Bäte welcomed the new government's approach to take competitiveness seriously, with Merz having repeatedly pledged to get Germany's industry back on track to push for global leadership.\n\"I can only applaud them for taking it seriously, to also mobilize financial reserves to put an unheard of investment program into place, and also end almost two decades of lethargy of under investment in infrastructure, under investment in military, defense [and] under investment in education,\" he said.\nLeading German businesses in July announced their own initiative, with the goal of boosting investor interest and confidence. The group made up of 61 companies plan to collectively invest 631 billion euros [$737.4 billion] by 2028.\n\"This is a good signal, and it shows that there is an alliance between [the] corporate world and the politics these days, which is very important, which hasn't been the case over the last years,\" Timotheus Höttges, the CEO of Deutsche Telekom told CNBC.\nThe tone struck by business leaders is also reflected in recent data, with economic institute Ifo reporting improvements in company sentiment for five consecutive months now.\nCall for action\nHowever, businesses are also calling the government to action, demanding that campaign promises be turned into reality.\nAllianz's Bäte told CNBC that while the government's attitude was good news, \"now comes the delivery,\" and Bilfinger's Schulz noted that \"there is at the moment only lip service in a lot of areas, with very good ideas, but we have to come to execution.\"\nEconomists surveyed on policy by Ifo and German news organisation Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung also noted the lack of measures that have been implemented so far during Merz's term.\n\"30% of the participating economists rate the economic policy measures of the new German government in the first 100 days as 'rather negative', with a further 12% even rating them as 'very negative,'\" the survey found.\nParticipants negatively highlighted \"the lack of reform efforts in the area of social security systems. In addition, they see a lack so far of clear stimulus for further structural reforms, the reduction of bureaucracy, and progress on climate protection,\" it noted.\nBusiness leaders had an extensive wish list to share with CNBC.\nRoland Busch, CEO of tech conglomerate Siemens, was among those who called for structural reforms. Some of which included \"digitalization, faster decision processes, less bureaucracy, working [on] our energy transformation\" and changes to the labor market.\nBusiness-specific needs were also called out by leaders, with Deutsche Telekom's Höttges saying the company could be supported by local authorities and the federal government in its build out of fibre infrastructure.\nMany of these issues were also flagged by leaders as reasons for the economic weakness of recent years. Germany's economy contracted in both 2023 and 2024. Europe's largest economy then recorded gross domestic product growth of 0.3% in the first quarter followed by a 0.1% contraction in the following period, according to data, in the second quarter.\n\"In Germany, we have not been growing as a country in the last two years, and there are reasons behind that. It's about bureaucracy, it's about education, it's about security, about energy prices, and in that context, being competitive on a global scale,\" Carsten Knobel, CEO of chemicals and consumer goods business Henkel, noted.\n\"But we need to turn around this country from a not growing country back to growth,\" he said.","content_hash":"1eb51ed691757e5324c4c6bd4b2232d3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4748,"method_rank":0}

The weakness in stocks today has also boosted some liquidity demand for the dollar. In addition, the dollar has support due to speculation that last week's stronger-than-expected July PPI report could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month's FOMC meeting, as expectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut in September fell to 84% area from 93% before the report.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 84% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 55% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEUR\/USD (^EURUSD) today is up by +0.09%.

Also, higher Japanese government bond yields have strengthened the yen's interest rate differentials and boosted the yen after the 10-year JGB bond yield rose to a 16-year high today of 1.621%. In addition, lower T-note yields on Tuesday were supportive of the yen. Today's Japanese economic news was mixed for the yen as Jun core machine orders unexpectedly increased, but July exports posted their largest decline in almost 4.5 years.\nJapanese trade news was mixed as Jul exports fell -2.6% y\/y, weaker than expectations of -2.1% y\/y and the largest decline in almost 4.5 years.

Precious metal prices recovered from early losses today and moved higher due to a weaker dollar and lower T-note yields. Also, an increase in US political uncertainty and concerns about Fed independence has boosted safe-haven demand for precious metals after President Trump called for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign amid allegations of mortgage fraud. Gold continues to have safe-haven support related to US tariffs and geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.

This year, announced share repurchases for constituents in the broad market index have totaled $936 billion, up 30% from the year-ago period, the firm said. These buybacks have helped lift the S & P 500 , which is up more than 8% in 2025. Big names that have shared plans to snap up shares this year include Apple – which announced a $100 billion buyback plan in May – and Uber , which said earlier this month that it would purchase $20 billion of its shares. Like dividends, buybacks are a way for companies to return profits to shareholders. Repurchases reduce the number of shares outstanding, and they suggest that management is confident in the stock's upward trajectory. They also give companies greater flexibility in rewarding shareholders. \"You can do a buyback whenever you want,\" said Sam Huszczo, CFP and founder of SGH Wealth Management in Lathrup Village, Mich. \"When you set a dividend amount and you cut it because you want to use the cash flow for something else, it's going to be interpreted as something negative,\" he added. \"All you can do is grow the dividend. It's hard to bring it down without destroying sentiment.\" To that end, Jefferies shared a list of companies that offer high buyback yields and have the cash flows to sustain them. The firm scanned for U.S. companies with a market cap exceeding $5 billion, a last-12-months' buyback yield topping 4% and free cash flow yield that covers existing buybacks plus dividends. The companies must also have solid balance sheets, and \"relatively better\" 2025-2026 earnings per share compound annual growth rates and earnings revisions over the past three months. Tenet Healthcare , an operator of hospitals and health-care facilities, was on Jefferies' list. Shares have surged 42% in 2025. Last month, the company reported second-quarter results that surpassed the Street's estimates. Tenet also lifted its full-year guidance , calling for adjusted earnings to range from $15.55 to $16.21 per share, up from $11.99 to $13.12 a share. The forecast also topped the FactSet consensus of $12.85 a share. Tenet's board also authorized a $1.5 billion increase to its share repurchase program. The stock is widely liked by Wall Street, with 19 out of 24 analysts rating it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. Consensus price targets call for more than 8% upside from current levels Jefferies called out Mattel on its list. The owner of the Barbie and Hot Wheels brands is about flat on the year, but analysts like the name: Eleven out of 14 analysts deem it a buy or strong buy, and price targets suggest more than 40% upside, per LSEG. Last month, the company reaffirmed its 2025 share repurchase target of $600 million. However, Mattel dialed back its full-year earnings forecast to $1.54 to $1.66 a share, down from its earlier call of $1.66 to $1.72 a share. The FactSet consensus forecast $1.64 per share. D.A. Davidson analyst Keegan Cox noted that the company said it sees $100 million in tariff costs in the second half, which is down sharply from the $270 million it previously expected. \"We think MAT should be able to offset all of those costs after already raising prices in the U.S. and is not expecting any additional price increases from here,\" the analyst said in a July 23 report. Qualcomm also made Jefferies' list. In the company's fiscal third quarter, Qualcomm returned $3.8 billion to shareholders , including $967 million in dividends paid and $2.8 billion in share repurchases. The chip play also has a history of paying solid dividends , steadily growing those payments over the past two decades. Shares are roughly flat in 2025, standing in sharp contrast to its peers that have seen a boost from artificial intelligence. In all, 22 out of the 42 analysts covering the name rate it buy or strong buy, with consensus price targets suggesting 15% upside, per LSEG.","content_hash":"cfda207596ed83c099da67ff2c5b8061","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4046,"method_rank":0}

Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\nHigher interest rates and a fast-shrinking labor market are taking their toll on the fix-and-flip housing market. Investors are starting to pull back, as costs rise and the time it takes to sell their renovated homes lengthens.\nThe fix-and-flip market contracted slightly in the second quarter of this year from the first quarter and even more sharply from the second quarter of last year, according to an index from John Burns Research and Consulting and Kiavi, a lender focused on the real estate investor.\n\"Sentiment remains muted, as economic uncertainty, elevated mortgage rates and rising resale inventory weigh on demand for flipped homes,\" wrote Alex Thomas of John Burns Research and Consulting, the primary author of the report.\nThe index surveys roughly 400 flippers and measures current sales, expected sales and flipper competition for deals. All of those sub-indices fell last quarter. Days-on-market for flipped homes increased as the supply of both new and existing homes for sale rose.\nJust 30% of flippers reported \"good\" sales in the second quarter of this year compared to the seasonal norm, down from 38% in the same quarter of 2024.\n\"I think what our customers are really experiencing, it really comes down to housing velocity and turnover timelines,\" said Arvind Mohan, CEO of Kiavi. \"They are definitely in the velocity business, and so if it takes them an extra month to complete a transaction, that's capital that's tied up in that property that can't necessarily be freed up for the next investment.\"\nRoughly one third of flippers pointed to reduced labor availability due to immigration enforcement and fear-driven absences from jobsites. Labor and material costs for flips hit a record high, but costs as a percentage of sales price were flat.\n\"From an ROI perspective, we're not seeing much change there, right? People are still getting that kind of 30% to 31%,\" said Mohan.\n\"We're definitely seeing the more professional cohorts take a step back, be more conservative, be more choosy, right?,\" Mohan said. \"If they were going to buy four out of six opportunities a year ago now, they may be buying like two or three out of six just to make sure that they are prepared. As the market resets, they can reset their purchase price and keep the ROI metrics constant.\"\nRegionally, flippers in Florida, Northern California and the Southwest rated sales more poorly than flippers elsewhere.\n\"Flippers in these regions face increasing resale supply, significant competition from homebuilders, and rising costs (particularly insurance),\" wrote Thomas in the report.\nFlippers are also facing the potential of declining prices, depending on where they're working. While home prices are still slightly higher nationally than they were a year ago, the gains are shrinking fast, and some markets are solidly negative, especially those that overheated in the first years of the pandemic.\nPrices in June were just 1.7% higher than June 2024, according to Cotality, which noted that is well below the rate of inflation.

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\nFamily offices are known to invest for the long haul, sometimes for generations. But after President Donald Trump's tariff announcements in April, the family offices of billionaire investors were quick to make significant changes to their portfolios, according to second-quarter securities filings analyzed by CNBC.\nSome moves were clearly connected to tariff and recession fears. In the three months ended June 30, the family offices of David Tepper, Leon Cooperman and George Soros exited their positions in casino stock Las Vegas Sands Corp. Casino operator shares tumbled on fears that a U.S.-China trade war would endanger their Macao operations.\nHowever, some firms dialed back their exposure to stalwart tech stocks, with Cooperman's Omega Advisors exiting its Microsoft position and reducing its Alphabet stock by nearly 90%. Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office sold down 37 positions, including Amazon and about a half dozen pharmaceutical stocks.\nCooperman told CNBC in June that he thought the stock market was too confident given uncertainties with tariffs and conflicts in the Middle East.\n\"I'm not a big bear, but I'm not a big bull either,\" he said on \"Squawk Box.\"\nInstitutional investment managers — including family offices and hedge funds — that manage at least $100 million in certain securities, especially U.S.-listed equities, are required to disclose trades on a quarterly basis. While many family offices have stock portfolios worth well over $100 million, they do not have to file these 13F forms if they outsource investment decisions to a third party like JPMorgan or Bessemer Trust, according to lawyer David Guin, a partner at Withers who leads its U.S. corporate practice.\nNot all the moves were related to bigger geopolitical concerns. Despite concerns about tariffs on semiconductors, family offices boosted their Nvidia holdings. Tepper's Appaloosa Management increased its Nvidia holdings by nearly 500%. Soros Fund Management purchased about 932,000 share-equivalents in Nvidia, including options.\nIn another artificial intelligence play, several firms boosted their bets on other chipmakers, with Appaloosa buying 8 million shares of Intel and 755,000 shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Duquesne and Soros also increased their positions in TSMC.\nOmega Advisors doubled down on energy providers, which are poised to benefit from AI's energy demands, including Atlas Energy Solutions, Sunoco and Energy Transfer LP.\nAs family offices have long investment horizons, they can afford to be opportunistic and wait for stocks to rebound. Appaloosa bought 2.3 million shares in UnitedHealth Group, which suffered a 19% sell-off in April after the insurer cut its annual profit forecast. Tepper's hedge-fund-turned-family-office also bought new stakes in United Airlines and Delta Air Lines even as recession fears threw airline stocks for a loop.\nSome of Appaloosa's peers made similar bold bets, with Soros Fund Management and BlueCrest Capital Management, the family office of British hedge fund billionaire Michael Platt, also increasing its exposure to UnitedHealth. BlueCrest also started new positions in Delta and United.\n— CNBC's Nick Wells contributed to this report.","content_hash":"e69b72ca73d084990de109b643372e9e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3445,"method_rank":0}

For the most part, the second-quarter earnings season has blown away Wall Street expectations. Approximately 94% of the S & P 500 has already reported, and 82% of companies have delivered a positive earnings surprise. About 79% of companies have posted revenue exceeding analysts' estimates. But several stocks have lagged their numbers. A recent report from Wolfe Research shared a list of companies that investors might consider selling — stocks that missed both revenue and earnings expectations this quarter, while also having negative year-to-date earnings revisions for 2025. One name on Wolfe's list was Southwest Airlines , down 8% this year. Last month, Southwest reported adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share on revenue of $7.24 billion in its latest quarter, while analysts polled by FactSet had estimated earnings of 51 cents and revenue of $7.30 billion. Afterward, Evercore ISI downgraded the Dallas-based carrier to an in-line rating from outperform. Still, analyst Duane Pfennigwerth's $40 price target implies Southwest shares could soar 28% from the Wednesday close. \"Trading at 36x '25E, 11x '26E EPS, we believe shares are now much closer to fair value and are beginning to more fully price in clean execution of these initiatives into next year,\" Pfennigwerth wrote. \"We also wonder if the company's aggressive pace of buyback (likely a big contributor to YTD outperformance) can be sustained at this rate.\" Another stock that Wolfe says investors might avoid is Align Technology . Shares of the maker of Invisalign orthodontics have tumbled 32% in 2025. In July, Align's second-quarter earnings and revenue missed analysts' estimates. The company also guided for current-quarter revenue in the range of $965 million to $985 million, below the FactSet consensus among analysts of $1.04 billion. In the wake of the report, Morgan Stanley downgraded Align to equal weight from overweight, slashing its 12-month price target to $154 per share from $249. The new forecast implies shares might add another 7% from the Wednesday close. \"Our prior [overweight] thesis was based on ALGN's leadership in a high growth category, but growth has been challenged for years, w\/ limited clarity on [the] path from here,\" wrote analyst Erin Wright. \"We view a re-rate lower as warranted, closer to the Dental peer average.\" Defense prime contractor Lockheed Martin is another sell, according to Truist. The investment bank downgraded Lockheed to a hold from buy after second-quarter revenue at the maker of the F-35 fighter-bomber fell short of Wall Street estimates, and it lowered its full-year guidance below prior estimates. Truist also slashed its price target to $440 per share from $554, implying the stock won't do much in the coming year. \"We are downgrading LMT shares now as we have little confidence that management will be able to execute on its multi-year growth framework, and we can not be certain that more charges will not materialize in the coming quarters,\" wrote analyst Michael Ciarmoli. \"We expect shares will trade flat for the balance of the year given a lack of catalysts and believe LMT shares will continue to trade at a discounted multiple vs its larger peers.\" Shares of Lockheed Martin, which yields almost 3%, are down 8% on the year.","content_hash":"739902e0b94157d16ce82a9e3c900fea","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3438,"method_rank":0}

Markets: Stocks are trading lower Thursday. The S & P 500 , in particular, is on pace for its fifth straight loss, wiping out all of August's gains. The rotation out of momentum-driven winners and stocks with lofty price-to-earnings multiples — the dominant market story of the week — isn't as pronounced Thursday, with stocks like Club name GE Vernova and Palantir holding up better on a relative basis. However, the influential \"Magnificent Seven\" cohort is mostly weaker, which explains why the traditional market-cap weighted S & P 500 is slightly underperforming the Invesco S & P 500 equal-weight ETF , known as the RSP. Holding up : The health-care sector is putting together a solid few days despite the broader market weakness. The group, which is still one of the worst performing sectors this year, came to life last week thanks to a surge in the beleaguered UnitedHealth Group on news that Berkshire Hathaway purchased a stake in managed care giant during the second quarter. Club name Eli Lilly also start to rebound from its post-earnings sell-off, giving the sector a lift. Fast-forward to Thursday, and pharma stocks are helping push the health-care group higher, and those rallies are linked to some better-than-feared trade news. According to the updated trade agreement framework between the United States and the European Union, branded pharmaceuticals imported from the EU will face a 15% tariff rate. Uncertainty over the Trump administration's Section 232 sectoral tariffs on pharmaceutical imports hasn't gone away, but 15% is much more manageable than some of the triple-digit threats President Donald Trump has previously floated. Europe is a popular place for drug manufacturing. Shares of both Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly were higher on Thursday as investors digested the tariff developments. With Thursday's move, Lilly shares are down less than 5% from where they closed the day before its disappointing obesity pill data sent the stock plunging 14% in a single session. Up next: Zoom Communications , Workday , Intuit and Ross Stores report after the closing bell on Thursday. Ross Stores is a rival of Club stock TJX Companies , which reported its own strong set of results Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, Costco peer BJ's Wholesale reports on Friday. However, the main event of the day will be Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. It starts at 10 a.m. ET and will be a market-moving event.

Here's a recap of Thursday's key moments. 1. Stocks were modestly lower Thursday, extending the S & P 500 's losing streak to five straight sessions since last week's record high. The acute market rotation over the past two days out of stocks with premium valuations appears to be easing. \"It usually takes about three days for these rotations to play out. But it looks like it might be a day and a half,\" said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. Looking ahead, investors are awaiting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech on Friday. \"That's likely going to move markets,\" Jeff said. During a CNBC interview that aired Thursday, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid expressed hesitancy about a widely expected September interest rate cut. 2. Meta Platforms hit pause on its artificial intelligence hiring spree, according to The Wall Street Journal, after onboarding more than 50 AI researchers and engineers. The report was confirmed by a Meta spokesperson who characterized the freeze as \"basic organizational planning.\" The latest action should not be viewed as a slowdown in AI investments, Jeff said, noting the millions of dollars that Meta has spent on massive compensation packages to new hires. \"Maybe this is actually a good thing that they are kind of holding off on hiring. They're letting their team work and put their plan in place,\" said Jeff. 3. Walmart posted a quarterly revenue beat but missed on earnings per share. \"You don't really see that too often from Walmart,\" Jeff said, though he added that it appears to be a result of one-time expenses unrelated to core operations. Walmart stock sank more than 4.5% on the news, taking our retail names — Amazon , Costco , and TJX — with it. Walmart's same-store sales in the U.S. did go up 4.6% versus the 4.1% expected. Similarly, TJ Maxx and Marshalls parent TJX reported a 4% rise in comps on Wednesday. 4 . Boeing is in talks to sell as many as 500 planes to China, according to Bloomberg. It's good news for the aerospace industry and a positive sign that trade talks between Beijing and the U.S. are going well. \"This type of deal could get taken away in an instant if there is some type of escalation in tariff threats between the two [countries],\" Jeff said. The Club added Boeing to our Bullpen back in April on the idea that planes could be used as bargaining chips by countries looking to reduce trade deficits.

The deal, which gives SoftBank control over roughly 2% of Intel’s outstanding shares, comes as the US government explores a deal to take as much as a 10% stake in the Santa Clara, California, firm.\nREAD ALSO: Can the Worldwide Leader in Sports Survive a Brave New World? and AI Wrestles Jobs from Gen Z Workers\nChip Stack\nThat’s a lot of a lot. Intel needs it all and maybe more. While it’s technically the only major designer and manufacturer of leading-edge chips in the US, the company has largely failed to convince tech players that its Gaudi AI Accelerator chips could serve as a viable alternative to Nvidia’s popular GPUs, while its expensive foundry business has completely failed to compete with industry titan TSMC. The company has reported a total net loss of around $3.7 billion through the first half of the year, after a staggering $18.8 billion net loss in fiscal 2024, and has openly flirted with exiting the foundry business if it fails to secure a major client soon.\nEnter SoftBank. According to sources who spoke with the Financial Times, the two sides discussed several versions of a deal — including one in which SoftBank would have acquired Intel’s foundry business outright — but ultimately agreed on a $2 billion investment that gives Intel a major financial lifeline amid its search for clients and its capital-intensive push to catch up to TSMC’s manufacturing capacity. Crucially, it also places Intel into SoftBank’s growing AI ecosystem:\n-\nSoftBank is already the majority owner of British chip designer Arm and is a leading investor in OpenAI, which is working to reduce its reliance on key supplier Nvidia. Last week, Reuters reported that current and former OpenAI employees were looking to sell up to $6 billion worth of shares to a SoftBank-led group of investors.\n-\nSoftBank and OpenAI also have ambitious plans to expand AI infrastructure in the US, primarily through the $500 billion “Project Stargate” initiative the two firms announced earlier this year with Oracle.\nCentral Intel-igence: Of course, SoftBank isn’t the only player to notice that Intel is struggling. The company scored roughly $10.9 billion in grants and low-interest loans from the US government via the Biden-era Chips and Science Act, and now the Trump administration wants to get an equity stake in exchange for that. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made clear in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday that the White House isn’t seeking voting or governance rights in Intel, however. The idea comes after the president earlier this month publicly called for the resignation of new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan (who happens to be a former SoftBank board member) over alleged ties to the Chinese government. After a White House meeting with Tan this week, the president said Tan has an “amazing story” — one that, apparently, he prefers the US government to be a part of.\nThis post first appeared on The Daily Upside.

It's famously known for a highly secretive, primarily high-frequency, quantitative investing approach.\nFounded in 1982 by James Simons, a former National Security Agency (NSA) codebreaker and mathematics professor, Renaissance Technologies managed several funds in the early eighties before focusing on its flagship Medallion Fund starting in 1988.\nSimons was estimated to be worth over $31 billion at the time of his death in 2024 at the age of 86.\nWhile they definitely don't sit on a beach, Renaissance investment managers were able to take the billions they earned to make the premier Medallion Fund into an employee-only (current and former) fund in 2005.\nRelated: Nvidia quietly buys more stock in AI infrastructure favorite\nSince then, the fund has been closed to outsiders and has maintained an aura of secrecy about its operations and strategies, adding to its mystique.\nThe Medallion Fund reportedly manages over $71 billion in assets under management, or AUM, and has an even larger footprint due to its high use of leverage and rapid turnover of positions.\nHowever, Renaissance's main claim to fame is its spectacular annual returns. Gains on the order of +60% are not uncommon for the quantitative powerhouse.

But for investors trying to figure out what it all means to Microsoft's financials, analysts at UBS said the change is already factored into guidance.\n\"In our view, it is safe to assume that the impact of the pricing change\" was included in Microsoft's forecast, the analysts wrote in a report late Tuesday. They have a buy rating on the stock.\nMicrosoft's disclosure, on Aug. 12, came two weeks after the software company, it its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, issued a forecast that included double-digit year-over-year revenue growth for the new fiscal year. The shares rose 4% after the report.\nMicrosoft said in its blog post announcing the pricing change that, \"This update builds on the consistent pricing model already in place for services like Azure and reflects our ongoing commitment to greater transparency and alignment across all purchasing channels.\"\nThe change applies to companies with enough employees to get them into price levels known as A, B, C and D. It goes into effect when organizations sign up for new services or renew existing agreements, beginning on Nov. 1.\n\"This action allows us to deliver more consistent and transparent pricing and better enable clear, informed decision making for customers and partners,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email.\nJay Cuthrell, product chief at Microsoft partner NexusTek, said customers will see price hikes of 6% to 12%. Partners are estimating an impact as low as as 3% and as high as 14%, UBS analysts wrote.\nMicrosoft 365 commercial seat growth, a measurement of the number of licenses that clients buy for their workers, has been under 10% since 2023. Microsoft is aiming to generate more revenue per seat by selling Copilot add-ons and moving some users to more expensive plans.\nExpanding that part of the business is crucial. Most of Microsoft's $128.5 billion in fiscal 2025 operating profit came from the Productivity and Business Processes unit, and about 73% of the revenue in that segment was from Microsoft 365 commercial products and cloud services.\nSome customers could agree to pay Microsoft more to keep using the applications rather than moving to alternative services, said Adam Mansfield, practice lead at advisory firm UpperEdge. They may also lower their commitments to Microsoft in other areas, such as Azure cloud infrastructure, Mansfield said.\nOne way companies could potentially pay lower prices with the disappearance of discounts is by buying through cloud resellers instead of going direct, said Nathan Taylor, a senior vice president at Sourcepass, an IT service provider that caters to small businesses.\nSourcepass hasn't gotten many leads as a result of Microsoft's change yet, Taylor said.\n\"It takes a while for that information to disseminate to the industry at large,\" he said.\nMicrosoft shares are up 20% this year, while the Nasdaq has gained about 10%.\nWATCH: Microsoft's software business has a tailwind in AI, says Melius' Ben Reitzes","content_hash":"a16dd3736f8d5224cd1a395b747e3866","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3244,"method_rank":0}

That includes a team focused on building machine superintelligence, dubbed the \"TBD lab,\" or \"To Be Determined,\" an AI products division, an infrastructure division, and a division that focuses on longer-term projects and exploration.\nIt added that all four groups belong to \"Meta Superintelligence Labs,\" a name that reflects Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's desire to build AI that surpasses human intelligence.\nIn pursuit of that goal, Meta has been aggressively spending on AI this year. That included efforts to poach top talent from other AI companies, with offers said to include signing bonuses as high as $100 million.\nIn one of its most aggressive moves, Meta acquired Alexandr Wang, founder of Scale AI, as part of a deal that saw the Facebook parent dish out $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the AI startup.\nWang now leads the company's AI lab focused on advancing its Llama series of open-source large language models.\nToo much spending?\nWhile Meta's aggressive hiring strategy has caught headlines in recent months for their high price tags, other megacap tech companies have also been pouring billions into AI talent, as well as R&D and AI infrastructure.\nHowever, the sudden AI hiring pause by the owner of Facebook and Instagram comes amid growing concerns that investments in AI are moving too fast and a broader sell-off of U.S. technology stocks this week.\nEarlier this week, it was reported that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had told a group of journalists that he believes AI is in a bubble.\nHowever, many tech analysts and investors disagree with the notion of an AI bubble.\n\"Altman is the golden child of the AI Revolution, and there could be aspects of the AI food chain that show some froth over time, but overall, we believe tech stocks are undervalued relative to this 4th Industrial Revolution,\" said tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.\nHe also dismissed the idea that Meta might be cutting back on AI spending in a meaningful way, saying that Meta is simply in \"digestion mode\" after a massive spending spree.\n\"After making several acquisition-sized offers and hires in the nine-figure range, I see the hiring freeze as a natural resting point for Meta,\" added Daniel Newman, CEO at Futurum Group.\nBefore pouring more investment into its AI teams, the company likely needs time to place and access its new talent and determine whether they are ready to make the type of breakthroughs the company is looking for, he added.","content_hash":"0bbcff73b7268f4e113f128ca77a7274","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3220,"method_rank":0}

The stock lagged due largely to tariff concerns following the Liberation Day announcement, impacting sentiment given its global footprint and exposure to China. While earnings results beat expectations, earnings per share (EPS) guidance was lowered due to increased tariff-related costs. Management expects to mitigate about half of this impact by 2026 through manufacturing and operational initiatives. Despite this near-term margin pressure, we believe nothing has fundamentally changed with the company as it continues to exceed revenue guidance.

The way products are packaged plays a vital role in keeping them protected, reducing waste, and ensuring smooth delivery worldwide.\nISO standards for packaging logistics set the rules that help companies achieve all of this with consistency and confidence.\nWhat ISO means for packaging and logistics\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) creates global rules that industries everywhere can follow. In packaging logistics, these standards focus on how products are packed, labelled, stored, and transported.\nTwo of the most widely used are:\n-\nISO 9001 – a quality management standard that ensures packaging and transport meet customer requirements.\n-\nISO 14001 – an environmental management standard that promotes sustainable packaging and reduced waste.\nFor companies, following these standards builds trust with clients, avoids costly mistakes, and supports greener business practices.\nKey standards shaping packaging operations\nISO offers detailed guidance designed for the challenges of packaging and transport:\n-\nISO 780 – handling symbols like “fragile” and “keep upright” that are understood globally.\n-\nISO 18602–18604 – environmental packaging standards covering reuse, recycling, and recovery.\n-\nISO 4178 – tests packaging against stacking, vibration, and shock during transit.\n-\nISO 22982 – cold chain packaging rules for items like food and medicine that must stay at controlled temperatures.\nThese standards make packaging safer, more durable, and more efficient. For example, a food exporter using ISO cold chain packaging ensures goods arrive fresh, while a manufacturer shipping electronics can rely on ISO shock-testing rules to avoid damage.\nStandards for global safety and trade\nBeyond protecting products, ISO standards also support secure and reliable global supply chains:\n-\nISO 668 – defines container sizes and strength, ensuring cargo fits standard shipping systems worldwide.\n-\nISO 28000 – addresses supply chain security, helping logistics firms manage risks like theft or disruption.\n-\nISPM 15 – although not ISO, this wood packaging rule is critical. It requires wooden pallets and crates to be treated against pests before international shipping.\nTogether, these standards make international trade smoother by reducing delays at borders and ensuring shipments meet recognised safety levels.\nWhy ISO matters for the packaging industry\nFor the global packaging sector, ISO standards are practical tools, not paperwork. They deliver real benefits, including:\n-\nClear communication through standard symbols and labelling.\n-\nProduct safety by testing packaging for strength and reliability.\n-\nSustainability with rules that reduce waste and encourage recycling.\n-\nGlobal compatibility so packaging works across borders and transport systems.\n-\nTrust and resilience by improving supply chain security.","content_hash":"719ae51ce46740cd2cfd4aef58100b51","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2985,"method_rank":0}

The green belt is a term in British town planning that refers to an area of open land on which building is restricted.\nData centers, large facilities that house floods of computing systems to enable remote delivery of various IT services, have seen huge demand in recent years amid a global rush to develop powerful new AI systems, such as OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot.\nAt the same time, they have been met with concerns from environmental campaigners and activists due to the vast amounts of power they require to keep them running on an ongoing basis. AI, in particular, has been criticized for consuming massive amounts of energy.\nPlans to develop the Buckinghamshire facility were twice rejected by the council previously. However, they were again resurrected under the Labour government, which is pushing to make the U.K. a global artificial intelligence hub by ramping up national computing capacity.\nBuckinghamshire council again rejected the planned data center in June 2024, saying it would be \"inappropriate\" to develop it on the green belt. Then, last month, British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner granted planning permission for the project, overturning the local authority's decision.\nCampaign groups Foxglove and Global Action Plan announced on Thursday that they filed a formal planning statutory review asking a court to quash Rayner's approval of the data center, raising concerns over the vast amounts of power and water such facilities require.\n\"Angela Rayner appears to either not know the difference between a power station that actually produces energy and a substation that just links you to the grid — or simply not care,\" Foxglove Co-executive Director Rosa Curling, said in a statement Thursday.\n\"Either way, thanks to her decision, local people and businesses in Buckinghamshire will soon be competing with a power guzzling-behemoth to keep the lights on, which as we've seen in the States, usually means sky-high prices.\"\nThe U.K. Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government — which Rayner also leads — declined to comment on the legal action when asked about it by CNBC. The government has previously stressed the importance of building data center infrastructure to compete on a global level in AI development.\nThursday's move comes after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in January announced plans to block campaigners from making repeated legal challenges from so-called \"Nimbys\" to planning decisions for major infrastructure projects in England and Wales.\nNimby is a derogatory term that refers to people who protest developments they view as unpleasant or hazardous to their local area.","content_hash":"7d9f422424f1cbcb11a87e0f22e093e6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2980,"method_rank":0}

It's the first Jeep hybrid system, and the first for Stellantis in North America.\nThe 2026 Jeep Cherokee redesign aims to evoke the iconic Cherokee SUV brand, which has dotted the company's history for decades. Jeep had previously discontinued the model in 2023 under Stellantis' former CEO Carlos Tavares as part of various cost-cutting measures.\nThursday's model marks the debut of Stellantis' new 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain, with more than 500 miles to a tank of fuel. The car will boast a \"technology-filled interior,\" according to the company, including Stellantis' new Connect One services package.\n\"Hybrid was the perfect piece to round out the rest of our portfolio,\" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told CNBC's Phil LeBeau on Friday morning.\nThe new model, which the company said is longer, taller and wider than the previous Cherokee, also maximizes its space with 30% more cargo capacity.\n\"This is the biggest segment in the United States, and bringing this back into our portfolio is a perfect fit between the Compass and the Grand Cherokee,\" Broderdorf told CNBC. \"This is obviously one of the largest misses from our sales decline that is now going to help reinvigorate a positive direction for us going forward.\"\nThe entry-level 2026 car starts at $36,995, including a $1,995 destination charge. The cars will arrive at dealerships toward the end of this year and the beginning of next year, with production taking place at Stellantis' Mexico plant.\nThe announcement comes as Jeep tries to reinvigorate its sales in what has been a yearslong slump for the brand.\nAmid a six-year sales decline for Jeep, Stellantis is also facing headwinds from President Donald Trump's tariffs, estimating its full-year impact for the company will reach 1.5 billion euros, or $1.74 billion.

Target reported yet another quarter of weak financial results, with comparable sales down 1.9%, and the cheap-chic retailer reaffirmed its expectation that sales will decline by a low single-digit percentage this year, projecting a third year in a row of declines.\nIn recent years, after a torrid run that included Target making massive market share gains during the pandemic, the retailer has stagnated even as archrival Walmart has soared. Analysts say that Target has lost some of its magic touch. That is, the hip but affordable merchandise; fun, well-kept stores; and attentive customer service that helped it stand out and steal a lot of market share from rivals, notably department stores, in the not too distant past.\n“Target, which used to be very attuned to consumer demand, has lost its grip on delivering for the American shopper,” Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, wrote in a research note. Those problems have included a resurgence of out-of-stocks (a problem that was plaguing Target when Cornell took the reins in 2014 but had been overcome); long wait times at checkout registers; and what Saunders says are increasingly messy stores. Adding to Target’s woes were its flip-flops on the DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) issue. The retailer attracted the ire of conservatives who threatened boycotts, but then angered many shoppers and employees when it curtailed some of its efforts.\nFiddelke, who started at Target two decades ago and went on to become finance chief and then COO, acknowledged those problems on a call with reporters on Wednesday, according to CNBC. He has three main goals: reestablish the “Tar-zhay” magic with customers, improve customer experience, and make better use of technology to make operations more efficient and less costly. He’ll also have to rally the troops: The Wall Street Journal recently reported that a companywide survey in June found that 40% of Target workers didn’t have confidence in its future.\nThough Fiddelke, 49, extolled the value of knowing Target deeply, shares fell 10% in morning trading on the news of his appointment. Citi analyst Paul Lejuez said investors were “hoping for an external CEO” with fresh eyes. Meanwhile GlobalData’s Saunders said Target needs a CEO who can cut through the groupthink he says has impeded innovation. Target’s stock is down 64% since its all-time high four years ago. (During that time, Walmart shares have more than doubled.)","content_hash":"4b3c9fa51be66054d8219808962818e3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2944,"method_rank":0}

While most of the media and industry buzz focused on the latter, it’s the open models, and the rapidly advancing ecosystem around them, that could make a bigger difference for everyone from researchers to small businesses.\nThe idea of open versus closed (or proprietary) models is familiar to anyone who has worked in software, and the definition is the same when it comes to AI. According to our partners at the Open Source Initiative (OSI), open source AI means anyone can look at how the model works, change it, use it, and share it freely without needing to ask for permission. OpenAI’s new open weight models don’t entirely meet this definition, but they are still in position to deliver the most impact for many businesses.\nA Morning Consult report from 2013 identified cost and privacy as the primary barriers to AI adoption for small businesses. The arrival of open models has the potential to address both concerns: they can be deployed offline, enabling greater data privacy, and they are free to use.\nProprietary AI models often deliver stronger performance, but they require costly infrastructure and must run on an external provider’s servers, which requires a business to hand over its data. Open source models, by contrast, are improving quickly, and as they narrow the performance gap. Already, it is possible to run certain models locally, or even on a laptop or within a company’s own walls—options that can offer a powerful, self-managed alternative in the right circumstances.\nWhy should businesses care?\nAI is becoming a lot more practical for Main Street businesses. What’s new isn’t just that open models can be a fixed-cost asset instead of a metered service. It’s that these self-hosted, affordable models are getting good—really good! Small businesses can now keep customer data in-house, avoid surprise price hikes, and spin up niche copilots like a “local operations assistant” or a “custom cake-order concierge” on their own terms, without needing to be AI experts or train models themselves.\nOpen models also come with built-in transparency. Business owners can get a direct view of how the AI works, and the ability to store data in-house offers a surer way to meet compliance obligations. This is particularly important in an era where centralized data storage systems have been the targets of data breaches.\nHaving full control over the AI stack also means businesses can adapt and integrate models into the parts of their operations that matter most, such as loyalty programs, supply chain workflows, or customer support scripts, without worrying about vendor lock-in or shifting API terms. That kind of control turns AI into a strategic asset and helps businesses create more tailored, differentiated experiences.","content_hash":"8a04fc590c56aaca9ca64214bcd6441c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2934,"method_rank":0}

It offers extensive tax breaks and access to international dispute courts for investments exceeding $200m.\nMinas Argentinas executive director Martinez Ricardo Martinez emphasised the importance of the RIGI for “legal security” and highlighted the necessity for stable mining regulations.\nFollowing discussions with the government, Minas Argentinas, part of Aisa Group and the owner of Gualcamayo, has recalibrated its initial $1bn investment proposal to align with RIGI requirements.\nThe mine, which was on the brink of closure when purchased by Minas Argentinas in 2023, currently produces 50,000–55,000oz of gold annually through secondary recovery methods.\nThe ambitious plan for Gualcamayo includes the construction of a new mine, a pressure oxidation plant and a 50MW solar park to power the operations.\nThe proposed Carbonatos Profundos mine will be situated beneath the existing one, targeting gold production from sulphides. The company predicts annual output of 120,000oz of gold from 2029, with an estimated 17-year lifespan and potential exports worth $400m a year.\nGualcamayo's new mine and processing plant construction is due to begin in 2027. Martinez noted that the mine possesses three million ounces (moz) of economically viable gold reserves, a fraction of the 5moz of certified resources discovered on just 3% of the 40,000-hectare property, leaving the majority unexplored.\nDespite a decline in gold production across Argentina due to ageing mines and depleting high-quality ore, gold remains the country's leading mining export, representing 68% of the total.\nIn a related development, Argentina's Government officially approved Rio Tinto’s $2.5bn (£1.85bn) Rincon lithium mining project under the RIGI in May.\nThe Rincon project is located in Salar Del Rincón, Salta province, Argentina.\n\"Argentina’s Gualcamayo gold mine plans to invest $665m under RIGI programme\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

The Vanguard 500 Index Fund (NYSEMKT: VOO) posted a total return of 17.6% over the past year, as I write this on Aug. 18. That's well above average for the popular S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) tracker. But its sister fund in the consumer goods sector, the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSEMKT: VCR), saw a total return of 22.7% over the same period.\nIn other words, cyclical consumer goods stocks are beating the broader market these days, largely without any help from artificial intelligence (AI) market darlings.\nBut there's still room to grow in this booming market, even in the red-hot consumer discretionary sector. I'm particularly interested in two leaders in the gig economy right now. Read on to see why you might want to grab some Uber Technologies (NYSE: UBER) and Fiverr International (NYSE: FVRR) shares in August 2025.\nUber still rules the road\nLet's start with ride-sharing veteran Uber.\nFirst and foremost, Uber's business is thriving. In the recent second-quarter report, revenue rose 18% year over year with stable average revenues per user. In other words, the company is boosting its top-line results by earning more ride-share requests, not by increasing service prices.\nAt the same time, Uber's operations are growing more efficient. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 35% and free cash flow jumped 44% higher.\nAnd that's not the whole story. Uber also plans to put 20,000 self-driving vehicles in use over the next six years -- a drop in the ocean of more than 7 million drivers, but an important step toward a safer and more profitable future.\nThe stock has gained 27% over the last year, without becoming expensive. You can get Uber shares at the affordable valuation ratios of 16 times earnings and 4.1 times sales. That's a bargain in this economy.\nDon't judge Fiverr's book by its P\/E cover\nThen there's freelance service wrangler Fiverr. If you thought Uber's stock was affordable, you ain't seen nothing yet.\nSure, Fiverr's stock trades at a rich price-to-earnings ratio (P\/E) of 50.0, but that's an outlier. Fiverr suddenly looks undervalued when you base your analysis on cash gains instead of after-tax accounting profits, with a price to free cash flow ratio of 9.3. And if you include growth expectations in your earnings review, Fiverr's forward P\/E ratio stops at 8.5. From either one of these perspectives, Fiverr is hanging out in Wall Street's bargain bin.","content_hash":"d01176c4f3e69040ebb5a185fcf97a95","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2887,"method_rank":0}

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily CFO.com newsletter.\nU.S. employers are increasingly de-emphasizing the retention of executives as a key priority in making decisions about executive benefits, a new study suggests.\nJust two years ago, 84% of respondents to an annual survey by benefits adviser NFP identified retention as a major factor in making such decisions. In 2024, that proportion declined to 71%. This year it plummeted again, to 58% of the 260 participating executives.\nCompany financials, which 44% cited as a major factor impacting executive benefits decisions in 2023, increased to 58% this year, tying with retention.\nNFP characterized this recalibration during a time of economic turmoil as a sign of maturity rather than retreat. “Organizations are aligning executive benefit strategies with today’s realities: tighter budgets, growing demand [for executive talent] and the need to retain top talent without overextending financial resources,” the study report said.\nTo be sure, most (85%) of those surveyed said their company “can’t afford” to lose top talent.\nHowever, nearly every respondent (97%) said they were at least somewhat concerned about the economy. That’s pushing companies to rebalance their approach to executive compensation, according to the report.\n“Although retention remains a priority, financial discipline has regained equal footing in overall strategy,” wrote Tony Greene, president of executive benefits for NFP, in his foreword to the report. “The post-pandemic generosity that once defined these [pay] packages is giving way to a more measured, sustainable model.”\nThe report put a spotlight on nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which it said offer a “rare combination”: cost-effective design for employers and tax-advantaged flexibility for key employees. A large majority (83%) of survey participants said their companies offer some type of deferred compensation.\nWhile retention remains the top reason companies offer NQDCs, they are also doing so to stay competitive with peer companies, support long-term executive retirement planning and help top talent take greater control of their financial future.\nAmong survey respondents whose companies offer NQDCs, 82% said they have at least a moderate impact on plan success. Additionally, 63% said bank-owned and corporate-owned life insurance plans have at least such an impact.\nPerhaps surprisingly, only 29% of surveyed executives said they completely understand their benefits, while 54% said they mostly understand but still have questions. And 18% said they mostly find their benefits confusing.\nThe survey found that employees who understand their benefits are significantly more likely than those who lack clarity on their investment options to be extremely committed to their employer (65% vs. 36%).","content_hash":"888ddb3d77fe3fc292cb8cd50854936e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2886,"method_rank":0}

Choosing one that allows you to enjoy a low introductory APR so you can redirect your hard-earned money toward paying down the balance instead of just the high interest is a great way to get your budget in check.\nFor You: 8 Common Mistakes Retirees Make With Their Social Security Checks\nUp Next: Warren Buffett: 10 Things Poor People Waste Money On\nHigh-interest credit cards can send you down a debt spiral, which can impact your finances negatively for years. Considering the average credit card debt per borrower is also on the rise, according to TransUnion, this can feel like a no-win situation. As of last year, the average debt per borrower was about $6,329, so in 2025 there may be room for improvement.\nIf you’re tired of seeing a large portion of your credit card payments go toward interest, opening a balance-transfer card could be a smart money move. Here are some key signs it’s a good fit for your finances.\nYou’re Carrying Balances on Multiple Credit Cards\nHaving credit card debt can be tough, and it’s even more challenging when you’re carrying a balance on multiple cards. A balance-transfer card allows you to consolidate your debt so you have just one monthly payment.\nThis means you won’t have to juggle multiple due dates, making it easier to remember to pay your bill on time. Even better, consolidating your credit card payments into one could reduce the total amount of interest you’ll pay.\nConsider These: 25 Creative Ways To Save Money\nYour High-APR Credit Card Has a Significant Balance\nIf your current credit card has both a substantial outstanding balance and a high APR, much of your monthly payment goes toward interest. This can make it hard to pay off your debt. However, a balance transfer can help. Simply moving your balance to a credit card with a lower APR can help you pay down debt faster.\nYou’re Looking To Improve Your Credit Utilization\nIf your credit utilization isn’t great, a balance transfer may help. Your new balance-transfer credit card may offer a higher credit limit than your existing card(s), increasing your total available credit.\nThis matters because credit utilization plays a key role in both VantageScore and FICO credit scoring models. Plus, the lower interest rate on your balance-transfer card allows you to pay down the balance faster, boosting your available credit and improving your utilization ratio.\nYou Want To Pay Off a Large Purchase Over Time\nWhen you need to make a large purchase, your budget isn’t always equipped to handle the upfront cost. For example, if your washing machine unexpectedly breaks and you need to replace it, you might not have the funds to pay for it in full.","content_hash":"60c9f2fba9baba79dc13c89bd5123f49","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2797,"method_rank":0}

Above 1 means investors are paying a premium. Below 1 means the market values the stock at less than the coins it owns.\nStrategy’s aim with the change is to “provide greater flexibility in executing our capital markets strategy,” Saylor said on X on Monday.\nMichael Saylor’s scheme\nSaylor’s Bitcoin treasury approach is to raise capital to buy more Bitcoin by issuing new shares.\nThe company’s Bitcoin holdings are worth about $75 billion, making it the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world.\nAdditionally, Strategy currently trades at about 1.4x mNAV, according to Bitcoin Treasuries — well below its previous 2.5x floor.\nCrypto treasury companies have become the big trend of the current cycle. The sector has ballooned into a $112 billion market, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.\nIt all began in 2020, when Strategy started to build up its Bitcoin treasury back, but lately other players have joined. Those include US President Donald Trump’s media conglomerate, the gaming retailer GameStop, and video streaming platform Rumble.\nNew rules\nUnder the old rules, Strategy would have been locked out of issuing stock to fund new Bitcoin buys.\nUnder the new ones, however, management has much more freedom to tap equity markets at thinner premiums.\nFor instance, the firm will “actively” issue shares if its mNAV tops 4x, do so “opportunistically” between 2.5x and 4x, and may still issue below that threshold to cover debt, dividends, or “when otherwise deemed advantageous.”\nStrategy could even issue credit to repurchase shares if the stock slips below 1x under the new rules.\n‘Spiral of doom’\nIf Strategy is forced to sell shares at thinner and thinner premiums just to service debt, it risks triggering what former Goldman Sachs analyst Dom Kwok called a spiral of doom.\nThat means dilution eats into shareholder value, shares sink lower, interest payments mount, and the firm could even be forced to sell its vaunted Bitcoin stash to stay afloat, according to Kwok.\nThe stakes are high because mNAV is the core pitch for the entire crypto treasury sector. In practice, however, many firms are struggling. Of the 167 listed crypto treasury companies, 13%, or about 21 firms, already trade below an mNAV of 1, according to Bitcoin Treasuries.","content_hash":"dc474f878a6a87bdca227d9e262b42ab","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2789,"method_rank":0}

OpenAI has real revenues ($13 billion) and massive user growth. Still, tech valuations, especially the Magnificent Seven’s dominance in the S&P 500, look overheated, suggesting a potential correction even if fundamentals remain strong.\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the word “bubble” three times in 15 seconds in a room full of reporters and then urged them not to write a story about it—thus ensuring that plenty of stories would be written. He was arguing that investors are “overexcited” by AI.\nIs he right?\nFrom the point of view of technical stock valuations, probably yes. From the point of view of fundamentals, maybe not.\nA classic bubble exists when the assets being valued are fundamentally not worth their price (and never will be) or when the underlying value is close to zero.\nSo, in the great Dutch “tulip mania” of 1637, it is clear in hindsight that the price of a tulip bulb should never be equal to 10 times an annual salary.\nAnd in the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, it became clear in hindsight that many mortgages had been given to people who simply didn’t have the ability to afford them, and thus those mortgages were worth far less than banks’ balance sheets said they did.\nSo the question becomes whether AI is a bubble or not right now. From the fundamental point of view, the answer is no. OpenAI isn’t literally worth nothing. It’s not a tulip bulb or a tract home in the middle of nowhere. There is a real business there.\nJPMorgan’s Brenda Duverce told clients in a recent note that “OpenAI’s ARR has reached ~$13bn (up 30% from Jun-25), and the company has reported it is on track to reach 700mn weekly active users (up 40% from Mar-25), while surpassing 5mn paying business users (up 66% from Jun-25).” She also noted that a “secondary market transaction that could push the company’s valuation to $500bn, up from the previously cited $300bn post-money figure from Mar-25, which would make OpenAI the most valuable private company in the world.”\nTo put that bluntly, a company with a chatbot that often gets things wrong is somehow about to become the largest unicorn earth has ever seen. That does feel frothy.\nBut OpenAI isn’t worth nothing: $13 billion in revenues is a real thing. Maybe the value of its equity will decline in the short term but the company isn’t teetering the way Lehman Brothers was in 2007.\nBut how about the technical point of view?\nThere is a lot of chatter on Wall Street right now about whether tech stocks are overvalued in a way that looks like a bubble.

Even though some days are rougher than others, he admits that the key to success is keeping a winning attitude—and it may be paying off as the billion-dollar brand has grown revenue by nearly 20% year-over-year. A focus on mindset is something other top leaders, the likes of Amazon’s Andy Jassy and Cisco’s Sarah Walker, agree is valuable.\nAI may be coming for the C-suite, but Gen Z isn’t scared—they’re inspired. While some executives fret that the rise of AI could make CEOs obsolete, 38% of young workers say they’re more ready than ever to take the top job, nearly double the rate of Gen X, per McKinsey.\nAnd while the job may come with a corner office and a cushy salary, the CEO of the shoe company Brooks Running, Dan Sheridan, has a message for aspiring Gen Z corporate leaders: the job isn’t so glamorous all the time.\n“Brooks isn’t perfect—no organization is,” Sheridan told Fortune’s Leadership Next podcast last month. “We’ve got our warts and bruises and things like that…. 80% of the time I love what I’m doing.”\nThe CEO admits that for around 20% of the time, his job is filled with “things that drive you nuts and things you can’t solve.”\nAs a company owned by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, the pressure for Sheridan to have his company succeed is high. The pressure is on and sometimes rough days make him want to give up. However, he says the most important thing he can do as a leader is keep a cool head, reevaluate, and move on.\n“I just think as leaders, you have to be optimistic. You have to have a winning attitude,” Sheridan said.\n“Otherwise, no one’s going to follow you. Your customers aren’t going to follow you. Your employees aren’t going to follow you, and your owners are probably going to scratch their head and say, what’s going on here?”\nThe power of a positive attitude\nWhile Sheridan reveals that striking the right balance between optimism and realism is difficult, he says it’s mission-critical for leaders.\n“One of the things that I think a lot about in my role is keeping my head above the clouds to see the future—but staying grounded enough in the dirt and the mud to know what’s going on,” he added.\nHe’s not the first to shout out about the importance of positivity: Other business leaders say it’s the very trait that can help aspiring executives stand out from the crowd.\nThe head of Cisco U.K. Sarah Walker calls attitude the No. 1 green-flag trait she looks out for in hiring and promotions—far outweighing what may be on your resume.","content_hash":"42f2e68ae27e255e42317b02b38ab37b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2762,"method_rank":0}

The company has been pushing boundaries in market infrastructure, and this IPO structure marks a new chapter in crypto-capital markets.\nJefferies served as the settlement agent for the offering, which utilized the Solana blockchain to mint and record the tokens.

He added that the firm already uses stablecoins to power fast, secure international transfers, and hopes the IPO structure will create a broader blueprint for others in the space.\nRelated: What is Crypto? Cryptocurrency explained\nThe company’s move aligns with rising institutional interest in blockchain-native capital markets.

She said if the data going into the next Fed meeting shows “the risks of worsening labor market conditions relative to those risks of elevated inflation…then it may be appropriate soon to begin dialing back” interest rates.\nThe Fed officials spoke ahead of Powell's highly anticipated keynote address on Friday, which investors hope will offer firm clues on whether the central bank plans to cut rates at its September 16-17 meeting.\nFinancial markets are betting that the Fed will lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the meeting next month, and it's possible that Powell will in fact send such a signal.\nUnexpectedly weak July hiring data coupled with big downward revisions to hiring in May and June bolstered hopes of a coming reduction in borrowing costs.

(NYSE:LMT) reported $1.8 billion in charges in the second quarter, led by a classified Aeronautics program and two Rotary and Mission Systems projects, prompting Bank of America Securities (BofA) analyst Ronald J. Epstein to trim his outlook.\nThe analyst reaffirmed a Neutral rating and lowered his price forecast to $480 from $495, citing ongoing program challenges and limited near-term catalysts.\nEpstein said the recurring charges, which follow roughly $2 billion recorded in 2024, have shaken investor confidence. The latest write-downs included $950 million tied to a classified Aero effort, $570 million on Canada's Maritime Helicopter Program, and $95 million related to Turkey's utility helicopter program.\nAlso Read: Lockheed Martin Under Intense Wall Street Pressure On Mounting Program Risks, Q2 Woes\nTogether, the charges cut $5.83 per share from quarterly earnings. Additional hits came from a $66 million NGAD asset write-off and a $103 million tax adjustment, partly offset by state tax benefits.\nThe bright spot remains the Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) unit, which Epstein identified as the primary driver of potential upside. Programs such as Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3), and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) remain in high demand as the U.S. and allies replenish stockpiles. MFC's backlog rose 4% from 2024 and 25% over two years, signaling a strong pipeline.\nHowever, he added, supply chain constraints limit how fast the segment can scale, meaning it cannot fully counterbalance headwinds elsewhere.\nLooking ahead, BofA lowered its adjusted EPS forecast for 2025 to $21.95 from $27.30. Projections for 2026 and 2027 were also reduced slightly.\nEpstein set his price forecast at $480, down from $495, based on a 12x EV\/EBITDA multiple on 2026e, a level he sees as capped at Lockheed Martin's 10-year historical average while the company works through margin pressure and tax headwinds.\nEpstein flagged additional risks, including a potential $4.6 billion IRS tax dispute, program execution challenges, and budget-related uncertainty around the F-35. While long-term demand for missiles remains supportive, Epstein said Lockheed Martin may remain in the penalty box until management resolves program issues and restores investor confidence.\nU.S. Army Awards $720 Million Contract for JAGM, HELLFIRE Production\nAdditionally, Lockheed Martin on Thursday announced it has secured a $720 million contract from the U.S. Army to produce Joint Air-to-Ground Missiles (JAGM) and HELLFIRE missiles, marking the fourth and final follow-on award under its current multi-year agreement.","content_hash":"2882202c5db23244cbb9a75bc8727fbb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2725,"method_rank":0}

It has also struggled to garner approval for an offshore IPO from Hong Kong; although Shein has been based in Singapore since 2021, it was founded in Nanjing, China, in 2008, and Chinese regulators still require companies with strong ties to the country to go through a review process before listing in any global market.\nBut now that it has applied to list on the Hong Kong exchange, it has gone as far as consulting lawyers to discuss the creation of a mainland China-based parent company, per Bloomberg’s report.\nIf the parent entity is created, Shein’s other operations—in Singapore and in global markets—would become subsidiaries of that entity.\nSources reportedly noted that while discussions have begun, moving Shein’s headquarters back to China is not a guarantee.

She says not getting an MBA was a ‘really good thing’\n-\nAs Gen Z questions the value of a degree, Epic’s billionaire CEO, Judy Faulkner, says she has never been a fan of MBAs—and built a $5.7-billion-a-year software giant without one. Unlike Apple CEO Tim Cook or General Motors CEO Mary Barra, who both attended business school, the 82-year-old charted her own path, including establishing 10 business “commandments,” like a directive to never file for an IPO or sell.\nWith recent graduates struggling to land jobs and the best business schools charging in excess of $150,000 for a degree, it’s left Gen Z’s aspiring business leaders questioning more than ever the value of going back to school.\nFor Epic Systems CEO Judy Faulkner, whose software powers many of the U.S.’s top hospitals, the answer is simple: A graduate business degree may have done more harm than good.\n“I never got an MBA, which I think is a really good thing,” Faulkner recently told CNBC.\n“They would have taught me, ‘Here’s how you do venture capital.’ We didn’t do it. ‘Here’s how you go public.’ We didn’t do it. ‘Here’s how you do budgets.’ We don’t have budgets. We say, ‘If you need it, buy it. If you don’t need it, don’t buy it.’”\nWhile the 82-year-old’s leadership style may sound unconventional, it has worked wonders for her business, which she started in her Wisconsin basement in 1979. Epic now rakes in an estimated $5.7 billion in annual revenue and has propelled Faulkner’s net worth to over $7.8 billion.\nHer secret to learning the ropes of business management still included reading books and taking multiday courses, but she’s just never been a blind follower. In fact, Faulkner even established her own set of principles, known as Epic’s 10 commandments, that are plastered all over the company’s sprawling 1,670-acre campus. They include “do not go public,” “do not acquire or be acquired,” and “software must work.”\nCEOs are divided on the value of business school\nWhile demand for business school is on the rise—a trend often seen in conjunction with economic uncertainty—business leaders have long expressed doubt about whether the skills taught in the classroom are worth it.\nIn fact, the richest person in the world, billionaire Elon Musk, has said that there are too many business school graduates running corporate America.\n“I think there may be too many MBAs running companies,” Musk previously told the Wall Street Journal. “There’s the MBA-ization of America, which I think is maybe not that great. There should be more focus on the product or service itself, less time on board meetings, less time on financials.”","content_hash":"61bce9315b87b1bc28c6c7b4b53f5e6a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2712,"method_rank":0}

This comes as shares have faced meaningful pressure in recent months, falling more than 13% over the past six months and more than 7% over the past month. That was exacerbated by a more than 11% drop earlier in August following the launch of Amazon's same-day delivery service of fresh foods in more than 1,000 cities and towns in the U.S., which analyst Scott Devitt believes has led to Prime becoming an \"even more compelling subscription for grocery shoppers, diminishing the appeal of Instacart.\" \"Instacart has demonstrated healthy GTV growth and an improving margin trajectory over the last few quarters, tempering some investor concern,\" the analyst wrote in a note Thursday. \"That said, the recent expansion of Amazon's same-day perishable grocery delivery service has intensified the competitive environment.\" CART 6M mountain CART, 6-month \"While we recognize Instacart may carve out a specialized focus, providing omnichannel support to local\/regional grocers with limited resources, we believe consumers will opt for more compelling and value-driven services,\" he continued. \"Management must now navigate this new dynamic to protect its market share, which we ultimately anticipate will erode over time as Amazon and others compete more closely.\" With these competitive pressures, the analyst said he has grown more cautious on the company's ability to achieve its longer-term targets, seeing mid-single-digit to low-single-digit gross transaction value growth year over year in the coming years. He also said the company will be pressured to increase its spending on incentives, sales and marketing and elsewhere to sustain growth, which will limit its outlook visibility.

The company also hopes to send over-the-air software updates to millions of Teslas already on the road that will allow them to drive themselves.\nInvestors enthusiastic about such plans have kept Tesla stock aloft despite plunging sales and profits due to boycotts over Musk's support for U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right politicians in Europe.\nThe safety agency said the probe will focus on why Tesla took so long to report the crashes, whether the reports included all the necessary data and details and if there are crashes that the agency still doesn't know about.\nTesla did not respond to a request for comment, but the agency noted that the company has told it the delays were “due to an issue with Tesla’s data collection,\" which Tesla says has now been fixed.\nThe new investigation follows another probe that began in October into potential problems with Tesla's self-driving technology in foggy weather and other low visibility conditions, which has been linked to several accidents including one death. That probe involves 2.4 million Tesla vehicles.\nThe crash reporting rule for vehicles using Level 2 driver-assistance software, or those that require drivers to pay full attention to the road, was implemented in 2021. Since then Tesla has reported 2,308 crashes when the software was used, the vast majority of the more than 2,600 reported by all automakers, according to agency data. The numbers are skewed by the fact that Tesla is by far the dominant maker of partial self-driving vehicles in the U.S.\nThe company has been offering robotaxi rides in Austin to only a select group of riders, but said it will allow any paying customer to hail its cabs starting sometime in September, according to a Musk post on X earlier this month. Tesla has also begun allowing limited robotaxi service in San Francisco with a driver behind the wheel as a safety check to conform with California rules.","content_hash":"3c26f0c9a614724d70133978b3101dad","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2708,"method_rank":0}

During Q2, consumers placed more than 760 million orders with DoorDash, an increase of 20% year over year, according to an earnings release.\nAdditional updates to DoorDash’s commerce platform include access to a free website built and maintained by DoorDash, built-in CRM tools to send out personalized email and SMS campaigns and an all-in-one dashboard to monitor marketplace and direct orders, loyalty programs and marketing tools.\nThe company will likely roll out additional tools for merchants in the near future. Earlier this year, it acquired hospitality software company SevenRooms, which provides various marketing, operations and guest experience tools.\nDoorDash also rolled out new plans for the Commerce Platform, with tiers for merchants to choose from. The plans include:\n-\nStarter ($0 per store\/month): A free branded website and commission-free online ordering (but (2.9% + $0.30 payment processing fee applies)\n-\nBoost ($54 per store\/month): Includes everything in Starter, plus automated emails\n-\nPro ($249 per store\/month): Includes everything in Boost, plus a branded mobile app, customizable marketing tools, and a cross-channel loyalty program","content_hash":"46ff036d17fcdbffad85acecc9d9c92a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2707,"method_rank":0}

In late-session action, the shares had lost more than 3% of their value, on discouraging news about one man who can make a powerful push toward legalization if he chooses to do so. The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), meanwhile, at that point was down by only 0.7%.\nProposals on the table\nPresident Donald Trump is reviewing a draft document detailing recommendations on promoting health in American youth, several media outlets reported that day. Among the suggestions is that the U.S. Surgeon General \"will launch an education and awareness initiative on the impact of alcohol, controlled substances, vaping, and THC on children's health.\"\nTHC is the psychoactive compound in cannabis that gets users high.\nThe language suggests that such an initiative would focus on the risks and potentially harmful effects of these substances. As current legislative efforts to reschedule marijuana are focused on a \"rescheduling\" of the drug that would make it de facto legal throughout the U.S., this document feels like a step in the opposite direction.\nIt is currently unknown if Trump has conducted his review. He has not yet commented on it.\nGetting Trumped?\nAlthough the president has leaned toward marijuana legalization, recently he has indicated a desire to leave it up to individual states to decide, rather than enact reform on the federal level. This would basically maintain the status quo, which is a patchwork of states that have enacted some degree of legalization, mixed with a handful that have kept the drug fully illegal.\nThis won't help the cannabis industry, which in my view can only improve significantly with de facto legalization, in addition to reform that allows it to directly access basic financial services.\nShould you buy stock in Curaleaf right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Curaleaf, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Curaleaf wasn’t one of them.

Tesla is part of the S&P 500; the index most analysts use to measure the overall market.\nExplore More: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nConsider This: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\nWhat does Tesla’s presence on the S&P 500 mean for investors in 2025? Here’s what you need to know.\nTesla Is Number 9 on the S&P 500\nAs the name implies, there are 500 stocks on the S&P 500. Tesla is number nine on this list, which means it carries more weight on the index than 98% of the companies on the list, per Slickcharts.\nFind Out: I Asked ChatGPT What the Stock Market Will Look Like in 100 Days — Here’s What It Said\nTesla Makes Up Nearly 2% of the Index\nThe S&P 500 is a weighted index, with the larger companies higher on the list and comprising a larger percentage of the overall metric. In the case of Tesla, its stock makes up 1.82% of the total S&P 500 index.\nTech Stocks Dominate\nThe top 10 stocks in the S&P 500, which make up 38% of the index, are nearly all tech or tech-adjacent stocks. They are Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, Alphabet (Class A), Alphabet (Class C), Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway.\nThis Can All Add Up to Volatility\nThe S&P 500 is a bellwether for the general market, so it is expected to have some volatility. But the heavy concentration of tech stocks could mean extra volatility, especially as tariffs take effect and companies are incented to move manufacturing to the U.S.\nTesla, for example, is up 68% in the past year but down 20% year to date, as of Aug. 7, 2025, according to Yahoo! Finance. Its 52-week range is $192.04 to $488.54 — a very wide spread, particularly for a company of its size.\nWhat Is the S&P 500?\nThe S&P500 consists of 500 of the largest U.S. stocks, weighted by market capitalization. This means that the largest companies are represented by a larger percentage than smaller companies. Nvidia is the largest company in the S&P 500 and represents 7.72% of the total index.\nThe S&P 500 is broadly used as an indicator for the stock market overall, and, by extension, the health of the U.S. economy. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average (commonly referred to as “the Dow” or even “the market”) is often what news outlets report on, that index consists of just 30 stocks. The S&P 500 represents more companies and therefore may be a better barometer for the health of the market.\nThe S&P 500 isn’t always the same 500 companies. Companies can be added and removed, based on decisions by the experts at the S&P Dow Jones Indices. These decisions are made four times a year.","content_hash":"03297ed9a2214a7b4346a8368aa6fc60","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2695,"method_rank":0}

The Palo Alto, California-based platform offers an online marketplace for global freelance talent, underpinned by AI, according to its website.\nFor its second quarter, Upwork reported a 47% year-over-year rise in net income to reach $32.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, as well as recording record revenue of about $195 million — a 1% YoY rise. Adjusted EBIDTA, meanwhile, jumped by 40% YoY to reach $57.1 million, according to its Q2 earnings results released Aug. 7.\nStrong growth in AI-related services helped drive these results, a factor that was also enabled by several strategic acquisitions in recent years. The company has made four acquisitions during the past three years. Integrating technologies from those acquisitions into its AI tools drove “some of the great growth that we've been able to show in Q2,” Gessert said.\nAs part of its Q2 results, Upwork announced its acquisition of workforce management company Bubty, as well as a plan to acquire Ascen, a “digitally native solution for contingent W-2 workers,” according to its earnings release. The moves follow the acquisitions of Objective AI in 2024 and Headroom, an AI-powered video conferencing platform, in 2023, according to company documents.\nHowever, an important factor of Upwork’s M&A strategy is “we would not have had the flexibility or optionality to do this … without worrying about accessing the capital markets, had we not made this big push to increase profitability [and] cash flow,” Gessert said.\nManaging the integration piece\nCFOs play a critical role in hitting the right balance between profitability and growth: it’s the job of the finance chief to remind the rest of the business that “profitability gives the business optionality for growth, and that's what it's done for us,” Gessert said. For its Q2, the company reported an 85% jump in free cash flow to reach $65.6 million, according to its earnings report.\nGessert joined Upwork in April 2023 after an eight-year tenure at PayPal, where she served in a number of roles, including a three-year span as its senior vice president, finance and analytics, according to her LinkedIn profile.

Two members of the six-strong policy committee even voted to cut by 50 basis points on Wednesday.\nAddressing a press conference, RBNZ Governor Christian Hawkesby said the outlook is data-dependent, though he added that if businesses and consumers remain cautious \"and need more support that might be something that prompts more action.\"\nThe quarter point cut in the official cash rate was in line with a large majority of economists in a Reuters poll, but the central bank's broadly bearish tone around economic risks and rates jolted markets.\n\"The fact that members gave serious consideration to an outsized 50bp cut is quite telling,\" said Abhijit Surya, a senior APAC economist at Capital economics.\nThe central bank has slashed rates by 250 basis points since August 2024 to underpin a fragile recovery, though it said \"consumption and investment demand appear to have weakened in the second quarter of 2025, partly in response to heightened trade policy uncertainty\" after a shakeup in U.S. tariff policy in April this year.\nThe RBNZ forecast in its Monetary Policy Statement that the cash rate will be at 2.71% in the fourth quarter, below a forecast of 2.92% in May. In the first quarter of 2026 it expects it to average 2.55%, from the previously forecast 2.85%.\n\"It is possible that pessimistic sentiment, together with the initial negative effects of the global tariff shock, have dampened the effects of the reduction in the OCR since last August,\" RBNZ said in its meeting minutes.\nTWO MORE RATE CUTS?\nMarkets quickly moved to narrow the odds on two more cuts, implying a 50% chance of a move in October and over 100% for November.\nThe bottom is now implied around 2.57%, compared to 2.76% before the RBNZ announcement.\nTen of 12 economists are picking the cash rate to bottom at 2.5%, compared with 2.75% in a broader pre-RBNZ poll last week.\nBank of New Zealand head of research Stephen Toplis said that given the central bank's dovish tone, the BNZ is now forecasting 25-basis-point cuts in both October and November.","content_hash":"1b31f3169b33464c73948986e51ca47d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2687,"method_rank":0}

Covrig Analytics reported Monday that Brazil's sugar mills are prioritizing sugar production over ethanol, crushing more cane for sugar. This trend is expected to continue as harvesting peaks, driven by drier cane crops that prompt mills to produce more sugar.\nNY sugar rallied to a 2-month high last Tuesday on concerns over weaker cane yields in Brazil.

Fiddelke's focus will be on merchandising style and design, store experience and using AI to boost the pace of decision making, \"make sense to us,\" he further wrote.\nRBC Capital Markets: Target's competitive positioning \"has worsened in key areas\" and the leadership transition spells an opportunity for the company to address these issues, Shemesh said. \"We’re hopeful that the Company announces a reinvestment cycle and re-bases 2026 EPS lower, which in our view would make the story attractive to investors,\" he wrote.\nThere could be some resistance to this strategy, since the current CEO, Brian Cornell, will remain with Target as executive chair of the board and the incoming CEO was part of the strategic planning over the past few years, the analyst stated. He raised the adjusted earnings estimates for 2025 and 2026 from $6.85 per share to $6.92 per share and from $7.41 per share to $7.67 per share, respectively.\nJPMorgan: Target's second-quarter results were broadly in line with expectations, with comps and earnings slightly better, Horvers said. Inventory was up only 2% year-on-year at the end of the second quarter, after ending the first quarter up 11%.\nThe new CEO is scheduled to take office on Feb. 1, 2026, and is likely to focus on \"better execution and higher urgency,\" the analyst stated. Fiddelke's strategies include \"enhancing Target's reputation as an on-trend retailer, providing a more consistent customer experience, and leveraging technology to improve efficiency throughout the business,\" he further wrote.","content_hash":"fc76d25cbd903a0dab9dd5061570eb0b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2676,"method_rank":0}

This tax provision allows real estate investors to defer capital gains taxes by rolling proceeds from property sales into new investments.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nWould You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early?

Mallah estimates he would owe approximately $50 million in taxes if he sold everything without utilizing 1031 exchanges. By continuously reinvesting rather than cashing out, he’s built an empire that generates consistent cash flow while deferring massive tax obligations.\n“Without the 1031 and banks, I would have remained a garbage man,” he added, emphasizing how this strategy accelerated his growth trajectory.\nMindset Over Money: The Mental Game of Wealth\nFor Mallah, financial success starts in the mind.

He described managing his portfolio as requiring “constant thought, homework, and calculation of tax ramifications, appreciation, depreciation, and cash flow” before making any property decisions.","content_hash":"28d5aa38fd2d009a78ebfe502053d03e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2673,"method_rank":0}

AI and renewable energy investment trends may also bring new areas of growth.\nFind Out: The $50 Mistake Warren Buffett Says Everyone Should Avoid\nInvest It Wisely\nIf you’re bringing $1,000 in savings into 2026 that you don’t need for an emergency fund, you should definitely consider investing it, Fu said.\n“If you have no high-interest debt, think about dividing it between low-risk, short-term assets (like money market funds or high-yield savings) and long-term growth investments (like ETFs or stocks) to balance liquidity and long-term appreciation,” he recommended.\nTake Risk Tolerance Into Consideration\nHowever, Fu said a lot depends upon the individual investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon.\n“For those investors seeking stable returns, consider investment-grade bond ETFs as insulation against inflation,” he said.\nFor those with a longer time horizon, placing some of the money in actively managed ETFs could allow an investor to “potentially profit from more opportunities than passive index funds.”\nPay Down High-Interest Debt\nIf you hold money in savings but you’re also carrying any high-interest debt, you might be surprised that it makes more sense to pay down the debt first, Fu said.\n“Usually, the interest rate on unsecured debt is much greater than the return you can realistically anticipate from investing, so I’d prioritize paying off the debt.”\nThough it may not feel like money going out is an “investment,” Fu said, “This is a sure return equal to the interest saved without taking on investment risk.”","content_hash":"f06c7be3aa115ac466e939b18be64271","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2671,"method_rank":0}

Today (21 August), Cholula sauces owner McCormick said it had struck a deal to take its stake in the venture from 50% to 75%.\nBrendan Foley, McCormick’s chairman, president and CEO, said the company has had “a long and successful partnership with Grupo Herdez and we look forward to continuing our collaboration”.\nHe added: “This marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for McCormick in Mexico. With this expanded ownership, we will advance our global flavour leadership and increase our presence in condiments and sauces.”\nMcCormick said the venture’s annual net sales are around $810m, excluding exports. The business’ products centre on mayo, including McCormick Mayonesa con Jugo de Limones, and it markets other McCormick-branded lines.\nThe company sees the venture’s sales growing “in the mid-single-digits range” and believes having majority ownership will give the group opportunities to expand further in the “high growth emerging market” of Mexico. McCormick already has a factory in Cuautitlán de Romero Rubio, north of Mexico City.\n“Additionally, this transaction creates a strategic platform for scaling our operations and distribution across Latin America,” Foley said.\nMcCormick sees Latin America as one of the company’s “growth accelerators” and told shareholders at last year’s annual investor day the region was a “large, growing and resilient market” where it planned to “build further scale”.\nPublicly listed Mexican group Grupo Herdez said it will support McCormick with sales and distribution.\nIn a separate statement, Grupo Herdez said the sale of a chunk of its shares in McCormick de Mexico would help the company “pursue other strategic opportunities, while continuing its portfolio reconfiguration”.\nChairman and CEO Héctor Hernández-Pons Torres added: “This transaction will allow Grupo Herdez to continue participating in future growth opportunities while preserving our scale and depth in the Mexican market.”\n\"McCormick buys majority of Herdez JV in Mexico\" was originally created and published by Just Food, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to give an update on the Fed’s monetary policy framework on Friday morning.\nMore News from Barchart\nPowell’s speech could give the market a new perspective on how much Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) support there is to lower U.S. interest rates in September.\nFollowing are some of the arguments that have been put forth by monetary policy doves (who want lower U.S. interest rates sooner) and hawks (who want no U.S. interest rate cuts anytime soon). Then I’ll give you my prediction for Friday’s Powell speech.\nThe Dove Case on Interest Rate Cuts\n-\nThe surprisingly weak U.S. employment report for July showed a modest increase in the unemployment rate, rising to 4.2% from 4.1% the previous month. While the headline number showed a small increase, the jobs growth was surprisingly minimal, with only 73,000 jobs added — and there were downward revisions to job gains in the May and June reports.\n-\nOther major central banks are starting to lower, or leaning toward lowering, their interest rates, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The U.S. Fed does not want to get behind the curve on global central bank monetary policy easing.\n-\nRecent U.S. inflation reports have been mostly tame. The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report rose 2.7% annually. That’s just slightly above what the Federal Reserve wants to see for annual inflation.\n-\nThe “Too late Powell” nickname from President Donald Trump gained some credence following the July jobs report. Trump’s needling of Powell for not lower U.S. interest rates faster may well have pushed Powell into a more dovish posture, to be revealed at Jackson Hole.\nThe Hawk Case on Interest Rate Cuts\n-\nThe hotter-than-expected July Producer Price Index reading of up 3.1%, year-over-year, raised eyebrows.\n-\nMost of the recent U.S. economic data has been upbeat, which supports a steady U.S. monetary policy stance.\n-\nU.S. tariffs are a wild card. While the tariffs have so far not sparked problematic inflation, there is the distinct possibility inflation will fire up in the coming months, as U.S. consumers may have to scramble to buy a shorter supply of goods on store shelves. Also, higher tariffs on imported goods to the U.S. suggest manufacturers and retailers will pass along those increased costs to consumers.\n-\nHolding steady on U.S. monetary policy and not lowering interest rates is bullish for the U.S. dollar.","content_hash":"b33d5a6e4a761acd4ff3cb8d8cc286b1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2663,"method_rank":0}

New investors include Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, Nvidia, and Pledge Ventures. Uber, which last month said it would make a “multi-hundred-million dollar” investment in Nuro as part of a broader deal with the electric car maker Lucid, also participated.\nNvidia’s investment follows years of technical collaboration with Nuro. The startup uses Nvidia GPUs for its large-scale data processing and model training, and its latest compute model is built on the Nvidia Drive AGX Thor platform.\nThe first $106 million tranche of Series E funding was announced in April. Investment accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Tiger Global Management, Greylock Partners, and XN participated in that first block.\nNuro has raised $2.3 billion to date. Its Series E post-money valuation is $6 billion. That’s a 30% drop from its $8.6 billion valuation in 2021 when Nuro raised $600 million in a Series D round.\nMuch has changed in the past four years for Nuro and the broader autonomous vehicle industry. Like most startups in the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector, Nuro was forced to examine its business model after economic conditions shut off the once-free-flowing tap of capital and ushered in a period of consolidation.\nNuro went through several rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023 before overhauling its business strategy. In 2024, Nuro scrapped plans to own and operate a fleet of low-speed, on-road delivery bots, and instead focused its efforts on licensing its technology to automakers and mobility providers, like ride-hail and delivery companies.\nThe pivot has appeared to gain some traction — notably in July when Uber announced plans to launch a robotaxi service using all-electric Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro’s self-driving tech. Under the deal, Uber invested $300 million in Lucid and agreed to buy “at least” 20,000 of the EV maker’s Gravity SUVs over the next six years.\nUber also said it would invest an undisclosed “multi-hundred-million dollar” amount into Nuro. One source familiar with the agreement told TechCrunch the amount is more than Uber’s investment in Lucid.\nA portion of Uber’s investment has gone toward the Series E round. The remaining investment will be parceled out to Nuro as the company hits certain milestones.","content_hash":"47aba2e5a4c9689e6ff77b9ea5947a13","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2656,"method_rank":0}

Yet too many fleets treat it like an afterthought. If you’re not planning fuel alongside your routes, you’re not running in the most effective way—you’re running blind. And in this market, blind spots cost real money.\nThe fleets that win don’t chase cheap pumps either. They engineer a fuel plan that ties directly into dispatch. They understand how IFTA works, they use their fuel card data, and they decide before they roll where those gallons are coming from. That’s how you stop bleeding profit at the pump.\nWhy Some Carriers Overspend on Fuel\nIt’s not always the pump price that kills you. It’s the lack of a system.\nHere’s what happens too often:\n-\nDrivers fueling wherever the tank runs low.\n-\nPicking stations out of convenience, not price.\n-\nFilling up without thinking about base price or state tax.\nOne week of that might not feel like much. But stretch it over a month, and you’re talking thousands in lost margin. Worse, your costs become unpredictable. If you don’t know your true fuel cost per mile, you can’t price loads confidently.\nFuel strategy is margin strategy. The carrier with a plan makes more from the same miles than the one winging it.\nUnderstanding IFTA Before You Pick a Pump\nSome small carriers misunderstand IFTA, and it’s costing them.\nHere is a way to break it down plain and simple: you don’t pay fuel tax where you buy fuel—you pay based on where you burn it.\nExample: You fuel in Missouri, where pump prices look cheap. Then you run most of your miles in Illinois, where taxes are high. Guess what? You still owe Illinois that higher tax difference.\nThat’s why the pump sign is misleading. What matters is the base price:\nBase Price = Pump Price – State Tax\nThat’s the number you should be comparing along your route. Smart carriers check base prices before dispatch, not at the pump.\nBuilding Fuel Into Your Route\nDon’t wait for the low-fuel light. Don’t leave it up to chance. Build fuel stops into your load plan the same way you schedule pickup windows or HOS breaks.\nHere’s how:\n1. Identify Fuel Zones\nLook at your pickup and delivery points, then overlay fuel tax zones and card discounts. Ask yourself:\n-\nWhere are the low base-price states?\n-\nWhich high-tax states should I avoid fueling in?\n-\nDo I have card discounts along this corridor?\nSometimes, topping off earlier—before entering a high-tax state—saves you hundreds. Thinking ahead always beats reacting.\n2. Use Your Fuel Card Tools\nIf you’ve got Comdata, EFS, or RTS, you’ve already got route-specific fuel data. Most carriers don’t even check it. Big mistake.","content_hash":"37abb921a864267c1151810c66ade142","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2656,"method_rank":0}

One in five Americans (20%) doesn’t have savings at all.\nRead Next: The No. 1 Key To Wealth, According To Wahei Takeda, the ‘Warren Buffett of Japan’\nLearn More: These Cars May Seem Expensive, but They Rarely Need Repairs\nWhile saving is important, it’s not the only way to build wealth. In fact, billionaire Mark Cuban argues that you shouldn’t just save — you should invest instead. GOBankingRates broke down Cuban’s advice on prioritizing investing your money over saving it.\nAggressively Invest Instead\nAccording to Mark Cuban, saving isn’t the best way to make your money work for you. The top 1% doesn’t just save. They aggressively invest in things like real estate and alternative assets (like gold IRAs).\nA 2025 CAIS-Mercer study supports this idea. Of the financial advisors surveyed, 92% said they allocate their funds to alternative investments. Nearly all of them (91%) said they intend to increase allocations in the future.\nTake Mark Cuban’s Advice With a Grain of Salt\nLeaving your money in a savings account, even one with higher-than-normal yields, might not be the best idea. After all, those yields may not even keep up with inflation. This means the value of your savings might fall rather than rise (depending on the account and how much you’re contributing).\nBut you might still want to have a little saved for emergencies.\n“Every individual should have [three to six] months of lifestyle expenses in savings — a checking account and a high-yield money market account. Once they have this money in savings, they should start investing,” said Richard Craft, CEO of Wealth Advisory Group.\nYou can save money for short-term goals — anything that takes under a year. But if you have long-term goals — anything over a year — investing is generally smarter.\nFor You: I’m Retiring a Multimillionaire: Here’s What I Wish I Knew in My 30s\nSaving Could Cost You Millions\nSay you have a savings account with 4.00% APY and a $50,000 balance. After one year, you’d have roughly $52,000. In 10 years, you’d have around $74,000. This assumes nothing changes in that account — no withdrawals, deposits or changes in yield.\nNow, say you invest $50,000 in the stock market instead. According to Investors.com, the stock market has seen an average annual return of 10.8% over the past decade. Assuming average returns and no additional contributions, you’d have nearly $140,000 after 10 years.\nThat’s nearly double — all because you invested. When you think even longer term, you could potentially be losing out on a lot more than that.","content_hash":"032bfa5a30ca1d4d21ec6f5a7f093016","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2647,"method_rank":0}

The conditions were tightened, and the lifetime allowance was reduced from £10m ($13.45m) to £1m.\nHarris commented: “For many years there was a 10% effective rate of Capital Gains Tax that owner managers could benefit from on sale\/retirement, but this ended on 5 April 2025, when the rate increased to 14% with the main rate of CGT having increased to 24% from 30 October 2024.\n“However, from next April, the rate of tax where BADR applies will be 18%.\n“In less than ten years the CGT payable on £2m of qualifying gains has more than doubled.\n“We want to highlight this and get people thinking about their options well in advance of any sale.”\nHarris indicated that those who are most likely to benefit from such advice include shareholders of trading companies planning to sell within the next one to five years, individuals with shareholdings exceeding £1m, or those who have more than they intend to spend in their lifetime, as well as people wishing to benefit family members from the sale proceeds.\nShe added: “Business Asset Disposal Relief has been a factor that has influenced how company ownership is structured. People have kept companies outside of a group structure so they can sell them separately, they have given 5% of the shares in their companies to spouses and, in some cases, other family members.\n“People with valuable companies need to determine whether their company structure still works for them, given these changes, particularly if their shareholdings are worth more than £1m and more than they would want\/need to spend.","content_hash":"7e8093e8fe13a724cc9d3b97a5dc9c4e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2646,"method_rank":0}

Together, the minutes and Powell’s speech could define market expectations for the September policy meeting.\nHere are some top macro highlights traders will likely watch this week to gauge how the Fed will react during next month's meeting.\nTariffs’ delayed bite\nMany companies have absorbed tariff costs to protect market share, but analysts warn they cannot do so indefinitely. Once passed on to consumers, these costs could drive prices higher and force the Fed to wait before cutting.\nSticky inflation data\nDespite some cooling, inflation gauges remain elevated. The producer price index, a key wholesale measure, has been hotter than forecast, suggesting persistent pressures that complicate any case for aggressive easing.\nCorporate limits\nU.S. executives have signaled they will eventually be forced to shift tariff costs downstream. If that happens, consumer inflation could accelerate in the coming months, making a September cut seem premature.\nMixed economic signals\nThe U.S. economy shows both slowing job growth and resilient consumer demand. This uneven picture could encourage Powell to argue for patience until the Fed has clearer evidence that growth can withstand tariff-driven costs.\nPolicy uncertainty\nTariffs intersect with fiscal and trade policies in unpredictable ways. That complexity increases the risk of missteps, making a hawkish tone at Jackson Hole more likely.","content_hash":"f898523f8b0beff5ddeb9a3395847f4b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2641,"method_rank":0}

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast home resales would be essentially unchanged from June at 3.92 million units. Sales edged up 0.8% on a year-over-year basis.\nNAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun saw the data as suggesting that some relief in the factors that have weighed on home sales - high borrowing costs and prices and limited inventory - may be in the offing. The sales pace over the last two years has averaged right around 4 million units a month, a weaker rate than seen even during the 2007-2009 recession that was triggered by a collapse in the housing market.\nThe average rate on a 30-year-fixed rate mortgage recently fell to the lowest level since last fall at 6.58%, according to data from Freddie Mac, but rates remain appreciably higher than they were coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWith the Federal Reserve widely expected to resume interest rate reductions next month, Yun said mortgage rates may have room to fall further in the months ahead.\n“The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,” Yun said in a statement. “Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices. Condominium sales increased in the South region, where prices had been falling for the past year.”\nSales rose month-over-month in the Northeast, South and West but fell in the Midwest.\nThe median sales price rose 0.2% from a year earlier to $422,400 - the 25th straight year-over-year increase - but slipped from June's record-high level.\nThe year-over-year price increase was the smallest since June 2023, Yun said.\nTotal inventory also edged up to 1.55 million units. At the current sales pace, that inventory would last 4.6 months, down from 4.7 months in June.\nThe share of all-cash transactions was 31%, which Yun described as unusually high. Investors made up 20% of all transactions, up from 13% a year ago.\nFirst-time buyers accounted for 28% of sales in July, down from 30% in June and 29% a year ago.\n“Homebuyers are in the best position in more than five years to find the right home and negotiate for a better price. Current inventory is at its highest since May 2020, during the COVID lockdown,” Yun said.\n(Reporting by Dan Burns; Editing by Andrea Ricci)","content_hash":"60a0f5c6826b7316f390ed0839eacf26","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2635,"method_rank":0}

Typically only small dollar amounts are involved, usually under $500, per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. However, these loans can be very costly because effective interest rate can be 300% or 400%, Kamel noted.\nCheck Out: Do Your Student Loans Affect Your Credit?\nBuy Now, Pay Later Plans\nWarshaw said she considers buy now, pay later (BNPL) plans just as dangerous as payday loans because of the potential for developing negative spending habits. BNPL loans can normalize borrowing for everyday purchases, encourage overspending and create a pattern of dependency on debt.\nCredit Cards\nThe next on the list was credit cards, with the experts highlighting their predatory nature and high interest rates.\nHigh interest rates and easy access make credit cards one of the most common and damaging forms of unsecured debt. As reported by LendingTree, citing Federal Reserve data, Americans hold a total $1.209 trillion in credit card debt as of the second quarter of 2025, and 46% of adults carried a credit card balance for at least a month in the past year. And the rates aren’t favorable, with an average APR in the second quarter of 21.16%.\nCar Payments\n“The car payment is what keeps you average. It’s what keeps you broke,” Warshaw said. And Kamel noted that this is one of the worst types of debt for the middle class.\nWhile technically secured by a vehicle, car loans are tied to a rapidly depreciating asset. According to Kelley Blue Book, your car can depreciate around 30% over the first two years. And many people will get a new car and a new payment as soon as they pay off their current car.\n“It’s just keeping you from building wealth,” Warshaw said.\nHELOCs\nThe experts brought up home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) later in the video, noting that they’re also a middle-class trap.","content_hash":"7c731643c6a7ae2bce8c08511c930c02","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2631,"method_rank":0}

Two activities that could be conducted at home with relative safety were working out or doing yoga, hence the rise in demand for athleisurewear. This coincided with the rise of Lululemon as a brand; the company had clothes and accessories that not only looked good but were highly practical for such pursuits.\nExcessive success leads to determined competition, and rivals inevitably piled into the space. At the same time, the company was maturing, a combination that slowed sales growth notably. From a 42% improvement in fiscal 2021, in the three subsequent years, growth withered to 30%, 19%, and finally 10% in 2024.\nTo its credit, Lululemon has been able to consistently land in positive territory on the bottom line. But investors are always hungry for meaningful revenue growth, and when that slows, they often bail.\nOne brand among many\nTo its credit, Lululemon has remained profitable, as it's continued to -- sensibly, in my view -- focus on that combination of product style, durability, and usefulness.\nYet with those determined competitors crowding its space, the company's wares aren't as distinctive as they used to be. Given that, I'd probably be hesitant to buy the stock for its growth potential until the company figures out how to better distinguish itself in the market again.\nShould you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica Inc. right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Lululemon Athletica Inc., consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lululemon Athletica Inc. wasn’t one of them.

S&P, which became the first ratings agency to cut the pristine U.S. government rating in 2011, said the outlook on the U.S. rating remains stable.\nLisa Schineller, primary U.S. analyst at S&P Global Ratings, said execution and effects of trade and budget policies will be decisive for future ratings.\n\"The outcomes of how you execute the budgetary legislation, how the tariff revenue comes, their combined impact on growth and investment that leads to either better or worse or similar fiscal out-turns, that's our focus,\" she told Reuters in an interview.\nNonpartisan analysts have said that the bill Trump signed into law last month could add $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade. Republicans have argued that extending and adding to tax cuts implemented during Trump's first term in 2017 and meant to expire in 2025, will not drive the debt higher.\nSchineller said S&P's forecast horizon when assessing the U.S. creditworthiness was about three, four years.\nWhile she did not expect the tax and spending bill as such to lower the U.S. budget deficit, she said tariff revenues expected over that horizon would offset - to a certain extent - the deficit-widening impact of the budget legislation.\n\"It is a potentially important offset,\" Schineller said.\nThe Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center, estimates the average effective tariff rate has shot up to 18.6% now from 2.4% in early January.\n\"It's that large of a change that we feel that will bring in important revenue,\" said Schineller.\nThe U.S. reported a $21 billion jump in customs duty collections from tariffs in July, but the government budget deficit still grew nearly 20% during that month to $291 billion. The U.S. national debt surged above a record $37 trillion last week.\nRatings agency Moody's in May downgraded the U.S. sovereign credit by one notch, citing rising debt levels and stripping the country of its last triple-A top rating.\nThat followed a 2023 downgrade by rival Fitch, which pointed to expected fiscal deterioration and repeated down-to-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations.","content_hash":"0bafe17c26e72e0c9f3ec046a3d38682","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2624,"method_rank":0}

The average 15-year mortgage rate declined slightly to 5.69%, from 5.71% a week earlier.\nTreasury yields, which mortgage rates closely track, have stayed relatively flat in recent days amid a quieter week for economic data releases. Investors have been closely monitoring inflation and jobs data for clues about the health of the US economy. Lower mortgage rates in recent weeks, after a weak August jobs report, combined with mixed readings on inflation, boosted the odds of a Federal Reserve rate cut next month.\nRead more: Mortgage rate predictions for the next five years\nTraders currently see a 77% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut next month, according to CME FedWatch. The Fed doesn’t control mortgage rates directly, though mortgage rates are influenced by market perceptions of the path of benchmark rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell will speak on Friday at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, an event Wall Street is closely watching for clues on the direction of interest rates from here.\nMortgage applications have remained stagnant even as rates have held at slightly lower levels. Refinancing activity dropped 3% through Friday from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, and applications to purchase a new home were essentially flat.\n“I think there are a lot of people on the sidelines just kind of waiting and seeing,” said Gary Pierce, a mortgage loan officer at Pure Funding in Weatherford, Texas.

Home prices nationwide are nearly flat from a year ago, though regionally, prices are falling in the West and South and rising in the Northeast and the Midwest. Higher inventory levels have also given buyers more negotiating power in many markets.\nExisting home sales rose 2% in July from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million homes, according to National Association of Realtors data released on Thursday. That’s a 0.8% improvement from a year ago, though still near historical lows seen since mortgage rates began rising in mid-2022.\n“One can say things are a little better today as a buyer compared to, say, a couple of years ago,” said Lawrence Yun, the NAR’s chief economist.","content_hash":"bc494295fd090f36a9b491d389642b62","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2615,"method_rank":0}

The latest sales figure topped the 3.92 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.\nHome prices rose on an annual basis for the 25th consecutive month, although the rate of growth continued to slow. The national median sales price inched up just 0.2% in July from a year earlier to $422,400.\nThat was the smallest annual increase since June 2023. Even so, the median home sales price last month is the highest for any previous July, based on data going back to 1999.\n“The ever-so-slight improvement in housing affordability is inching up home sales,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. “Wage growth is now comfortably outpacing home price growth, and buyers have more choices.”\nThe U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.\nThis year’s spring homebuying season, which is traditionally the busiest period of the year for the housing market, was a bust as stubbornly high mortgage rates put off many prospective homebuyers. Affordability remains a dauting challenge for most aspiring homeowners following years of skyrocketing home prices.\nFirst-time homebuyers, who don’t have home equity gains to put toward a new home purchase, accounted for 28% of homes sales last month, down from 30% in June, NAR said.

Despite the rather drastic adjustment, he maintained his recommendation of outperform (buy, in other words).\nAccording to reports, Wilkes wrote in his UnitedHealth update that he expects the company's performance to remain weak through this year, and has commensurately reduced his earnings estimate and target P\/E.

The Producer Price Index (PPI), a read on wholesale prices, also showed inflation pressures building.\n\"My biggest concern is that inflation has been too high for the past four years.

With many investors surely feeling left out, they assertively traded out of AMD stock, leaving it with a more than 5% loss on the day. The S&P 500 index also declined, but its fall was far less steep at 0.6%.\nTaking the decision hard\nThe company doing the investing was SoftBank, and its target was not AMD but the U.S. company's longtime rival Intel.\nAfter market close Monday, SoftBank announced that they had signed an agreement with Intel to invest $2 billion in the latter's common stock. That shakes out to $23 per each of the chip maker's shares, so it was hardly surprising that Intel vaulted past that level with a nearly 7% rise.\nAt a stroke, the deal makes SoftBank an important institutional investor in Intel (it'll be the fifth-largest investor overall). All told, it will hold around 2% of the American company.\nFor better and for worse, chip makers in this country have been flagged as businesses that could help widen the U.S. manufacturing base.

Sell a chunk of your company to raise venture capital. Make sales. Raise more venture capital, and make more sales.

What if you structured your company to sprint to profitability through slower, sustainable growth, rather than the reverse — unprofitable growth — as so many VC-backed companies do?\nThat’s the question that Pukar Hamal, founder and CEO of SecurityPal AI, asked himself after raising a $21 million Series A round in 2021 and, a year later, almost running out of money. The round was led by David Sacks’ Craft Ventures, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz’s Martin Casado and Okta co-founder Frederic Kerrest.\n“I started the company back in March of 2020. It’s my second company that I founded,” he said on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast this week.\nHis previous company, which sold via an acqui-hire, had raised its first capital before product-market fit, he said. That’s pretty common. Founders often raise before they’ve got a product that they know customers will pay well for.\nIn retrospect, Hamal described that decision as his big “mistake.”\nSo for SecurityPal, he did the reverse. He waited until the company hit $1 million ARR, which took about a year, and then did his first and only raise, the Series A.\nSecurityPal uses AI to speed enterprise security due diligence, which occurs in every large enterprise transaction when signing new IT contracts. SecurityPal promises to shrink the security review from months to days or even hours, helping companies to save money on the process while closing deals faster. It has big-name customers like Airtable, Figma, LangChain, and Grammarly, among others.\nBut in 2022, he faced a crisis. Interest rates rose and crashed the venture capital market. Raising more funds would be tough. “We were burning a lot of capital,” he said. “We were, like, 14 months away from running out of money.”\nIt was a wake-up call. Hamal had to drastically cut expenses, which meant a big layoff. That was so painful, he said, that he vowed to do things differently. “We extended our runway, and we tried to drive the company towards cash flow break-even, cash flow positive profitability,” he said.\nAlthough in 2025 VC money is flowing again, especially for AI startups, “we haven’t raised another round,” he said. The reason? He sees now that VC money comes with its own price tag.","content_hash":"690e0a5f461b6f7ad29f4626693d65ef","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2587,"method_rank":0}

The rulings will not be a sweeping win for small refiners, and will include some partial denials of waivers, according to one of the sources briefed on the decisions.\nThe administration is also expected to issue a supplemental rule as early as next week to seek public comment on whether larger refiners should make up for the exempted gallons in a process known as reallocation, the source said.\nHow the administration deals with exemption requests and the reallocation issues will have consequences for the oil and agricultural industries, and impact the price of commodities from gasoline and renewable diesel to soybeans and corn, along with the companies that produce them.\nIn the past, widespread exemptions without reallocation have sent renewable blending credit prices lower, denting prices for corn-based ethanol and soybean-based biofuel.\nThe EPA and White House did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool or by the tradable credits, known as RINs, from refiners who do. Small refiners can petition the EPA to receive an exemption if they can show financial hardship.\nThe EPA has a mounting backlog of such requests going back years - the result of political indecision and legal wrangling across multiple administrations. Both the agriculture and the oil industries are keen for resolution.\nGranting exemptions without forcing other refiners to make up the difference increases the supply of credits and puts downward pressure on their prices.\nFarm and biofuel groups have lobbied the EPA to limit the number of exemptions and to force other refiners to make up for exempted gallons.\nThe oil industry is strongly opposed to reallocation, arguing it creates an uneven playing field and imposes burdensome regulatory costs.\nThe EPA said earlier this year that it would force larger refiners to make up for future exempted gallons, but was silent on how it would treat exempt gallons from the dozens of backlogged requests.","content_hash":"3de781d795b709016ae30d3ed130fa20","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2583,"method_rank":0}

Gold doesn't get used — it changes hands and gets repriced,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts.\n\"The gold price reflects who is more willing to hold it and who's willing to let go,\" they added.\nThat makes gold very different from other commodities, where traditional supply-demand dynamics apply and higher prices could choke off demand.\n\"Its market clears through changes in ownership, not production-versus-use balances,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\nGoldman identifies two groups of buyers: \"conviction buyers\" such as central banks, ETFs, and speculators, who buy regardless of price, and \"opportunistic buyers\" — households in emerging markets like India and China — who step in only when the price is right. The second group provides a floor under gold prices during sell-offs, but it's the conviction buyers who set the trend.\nThat's where the Manhattan real estate analogy comes in.\n\"The total number of apartments is largely fixed, and the small amount of new construction each year is not what drives prices. What matters is the identity of the marginal buyer,\" wrote the analysts.\nIn Manhattan, there are also two groups of buyers: conviction buyers — those with deep pockets who will live there at any cost — and opportunistic buyers — those who will buy only at the right price and are otherwise content to live in New Jersey or Brooklyn, they wrote.\nIn both markets, prices shift not because of new supply, but because of who takes the keys.\nGoldman's analysis finds conviction flows explain about 70% of gold price's month-to-month moves. As a rule of thumb, every 100 tons of net buying by conviction buyers pushes prices up by about 1.7%.","content_hash":"8c54bdf68d7dae3d57220ee9d00af043","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2563,"method_rank":0}

Investors will be scrutinizing Powell’s address for signs that the Fed is ready to resume cutting interest rates in September after nine months on hold.\nPowell’s speech is the biggest event of the week for the stock market, and traders are positioning themselves accordingly. Options pricing suggests investors expect the S&P 500 to move about 0.8% in either direction through the end of this week. That’s nearly twice the S&P 500’s average daily move over the past month.\nWill History Repeat Itself at Jackson Hole?\nAt last year’s Jackson Hole, Powell declared the Fed was ready to begin cutting interest rates more than a year after policymakers hiked rates for the 11th and final time in their post-pandemic policy tightening campaign.\n“The time has come for policy to adjust,” Powell said. “With an appropriate dialing back of policy restraint, there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to 2 percent inflation while maintaining a strong labor market.”\nIt was the news Wall Street was hoping for. The S&P 500 jumped more than 1% to trade just shy of an all-time high. Though for investors last year, seeing was believing; it wasn’t until mid-September, when the Fed cut rates for the first time, that the index finally broke its previous record.\nRate Cut Expectations—and Stocks—Are Falling\nEvercore ISI analysts warned in a note on Sunday that Powell’s speech could deliver stocks a rough patch if Wall Street finds his comments inadequately dovish. “For a market that was eager to embrace '50 in Sept’, a balanced view could catalyze a near term -7% to -15% pullback into October,” the analysts wrote, referring to recent speculation that the Fed could make a jumbo, 50 basis point (bps) cut next month.","content_hash":"5467c203be57e439db671b3a00c27e38","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2557,"method_rank":0}

Unlike most equity sectors that recovered a significant proportion of their early-April declines after reciprocal tariffs were paused, the rebound among energy stocks was muted.

Oil prices have generally been trending down since 2022. While we understand the short-term concerns weighing on the sector, our interest remains on the long-term economics and valuations of our individual portfolio companies. Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, has a history of successfully navigating market volatility and delivering on its free cash flow and profit margin growth objectives from a combination of activity growth and pricing gains.

(NYSE:BTU) has abandoned its planned $3.8 billion purchase of steelmaking coal assets from Anglo American (OTC:AAUKF), citing a material adverse change following a March fire at the Moranbah North mine in Australia. The incident left the mine idled with no clear timeline for resuming longwall production.\nThe withdrawal comes less than a year after Anglo agreed to divest the portfolio to Peabody as part of a sweeping restructuring effort. The original deal, valued at up to $3.8 billion, was expected to close in 2025.\nThat package included an 88% stake in the Moranbah North joint venture, a 70% share of the Capcoal joint venture, and other key positions such as the Dawson and Roper Creek projects.\nAlso Read: Options Corner: Peabody Energy Could Ride A Red Wave Back To Relevance\nAnglo American CEO Duncan Wanblad had described the sale as a critical move to streamline operations and sharpen the company's focus on copper, iron ore, and crop nutrients. The divestment followed its earlier $1.1 billion sale of a Jellinbah Group stake.\nAt the time of the announcement, Jim Grech, Peabody's president and CEO, had called the portfolio \"world-class\" and said it would create long-term value by integrating with Peabody's global operations.\nHowever, after the fire at Moranbah North, the largest mine in the package, no revised terms were reached to offset the long-term impact.\nPeabody subsequently terminated both the acquisition and a related agreement to sell the Dawson mine to PT Bukit Makmur Mandiri Utama.\nAnglo had projected Moranbah would produce more than 5 million tons of saleable coal in 2025. Instead, the fire saddled the mine with roughly $45 million in monthly holding costs, undermining the deal's economics. The uncertainty around recovery ultimately became the deal's breaking point.\nPeabody now plans to emphasize growth from its Centurion Mine in Australia, a 25-year premium hard coking coal project, while continuing a four-part strategy built on safe operations, returning 65-100% of free cash flow to shareholders, organic growth, and balance sheet strength. The company said it remains well-positioned despite the failed acquisition.\nIn the wider coal sector, peers include Arch Resources Inc. (NYSE:ARCH) and Alpha Metallurgical Resources Inc. (NYSE:AMR).

The company's revenue increased 4.8% compared to the prior-year period, with total same-store sales up 1% and same-store sales in the U.S. up 1.8%. While the retailer's profit came in slightly weaker than expected, management's guidance suggested a better outlook on margins than some investors had anticipated.\nWhat's next for Home Depot?\nWith its Q2 report, Home Depot reiterated its guidance for annual sales growth of roughly 2.8%. The target actually fell short of the average analyst estimate's call for sales growth of roughly 3%, but investors seem to be betting that the retailer is being somewhat conservative with its targeting on the heels of solid growth last quarter.\nMore importantly, management confirmed that it plans to raise prices on some of its goods in order to offset the margin impacts created by new tariffs. Home Depot's guidance along those lines may be playing a significant role in the pullback for the broader market today, with its stated plans to raise prices potentially affirming fears that higher-than-expected inflation seen by wholesalers and producers will start filtering through to the consumer economy. Management's price-raising plans highlight macroeconomic risk factors facing the broader market, but they also suggest a better outlook for the retailer's margins.","content_hash":"1a7ba3aaaee12de1b879b0a94da72b29","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2545,"method_rank":0}

Ethereum recently traded near $3,679, up 40% over the past month, even while still 24% below its 2021 high. BMNR has rocketed over 725% year-to-date, peaking at $135 in July before settling near $58. For a company once synonymous with Bitcoin mining, the pivot has been nothing short of explosive.\nFor Lee, who has made a career out of contrarian calls, the message is clear: Ethereum's utility—staking rewards, smart contracts, and scaling—outweighs Bitcoin's static \"digital gold\" narrative. Institutional investors may be starting to agree. As Lee himself argues, ETH is fast becoming a Wall Street favorite, offering yield and real-world functionality that Bitcoin can't match.\nWhether Ethereum can overtake Bitcoin in market dominance remains an open question. Indeed, it has a long way to go. Between Aug. 11–15, Ethereum spot ETFs saw a record $2.85 billion inflow—the largest weekly gain ever.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin spot ETFs drew $548 million.\nU.S.-listed ETH ETFs now hold $28.15 billion (5.34% of ETH's market cap), compared with Bitcoin's $151.98 billion (6.54% of BTC's market cap).","content_hash":"f6b402b03ac0d81f99d1e5b00651fd31","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2537,"method_rank":0}

The company, which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to provide user-friendly voice control tools, had taken an 11% hit as of 3:07 p.m. ET on a consistent downward trend. There was no company-specific news driving this price drop, just a bearish market day undermining the stock's recent gains.\nWhat's going on?\nAll kinds of market darling stocks fell on Tuesday as earnings reports from the retail sector showed signs of tariff-based inflation.

Even so, SoundHound AI shares are changing hands at 41 times trailing sales -- after Tuesday's sharp price correction.\nStandard operating procedure for growth investors\nThis is just a normal Tuesday afternoon for richly valued growth stocks and their investors. SoundHound AI is incredibly volatile with a beta rating of 2.8. In other words, the stock tends to move in the same direction as the overall market, but roughly 2.8 times as far in either direction. That wobbly foundation sets the stock up for sudden moves likes today's price cut.\nSoundHound AI reported strong second-quarter results earlier this month, adding support to the stock's soaring valuation.

In many countries there is increasing pressure on banks to play a more active role in safeguarding the assets of customers targeted by scammers.\nThe new measure aims to curb financial fraud by preventing criminals from receiving and transferring a large amount of money at one time, and enabling timely freezing of illicit funds in order to increase the chances that victims will be able to recover at least some of their money, according to Daranee Saeju, the bank's assistant governor for Payment Systems Policy and Financial Consumer Protection.\nThe daily transfer limit will be applied to transfers in three different tiers: under 50,000 baht ($1,537), under 200,000 baht ($6,147) and above 200,000 baht ($6,147), depending on each customer’s risk profile and the banks’ assessment under know-your-customer, or KYC, rules.\nCustomers with established records of responsibility can continue transferring at their usual levels.\nThis measure will be implemented for new mobile banking and internet banking customers by the end of this month and for existing customers by the end of this year.\nThailand has around 12 million mobile banking users, according to a report Wednesday in the Bangkok Post newspaper. It said previous central bank safeguards capped mobile banking transfers at 50,000 baht ($1,537) per transaction — with facial recognition required — and 200,000 baht ($6,147) per day in total.\nIn June alone this year, 24,500 scam cases related to money transfers were reported to the authorities, causing total losses of 2.8 billion baht ($86.1 million) — an average of 114,000 baht ($3,504) per case. The largest single fraudulent transfer amounted to 4.9 million baht ($150,591), the Post reported, citing the central bank.\nOn average, scammers needed only three minutes to siphon off half of the stolen funds, while victims typically took 19–25 hours to report the crime, the newspaper reported.\nFor the first six months of this year, children under 15 were involved in 78,468 financial scam cases, while victims over 65 years of age accounted for 416,453 cases, it said.","content_hash":"eed9c5a207d93ec12b377d6300f1f45d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2527,"method_rank":0}

While the industry often experiences irregular sales patterns, the company’s limited traction with enterprise customers points to more conceptual ambition than practical adoption.

However, in 2025 alone, QUBT stock has fallen nearly 14%. So far in 2025, the broader index has climbed 9%, highlighting the volatility inherent in speculative tech plays.\nValuation metrics emphasize this divergence. QUBT trades at 6,813 times forward sales, far exceeding industry norms. Such figures reinforce that the stock is priced for future breakthroughs rather than present results.\nA Closer Look at Quantum Computing’s Q2 Earnings\nOn Aug. 14, Quantum Computing reported its Q2 2025 results, wherein revenue amounted to $61,000, a 67% decline from the prior year.

The comments from the home-improvement retailer suggests that overall inflation in the U.S. economy could start to accelerate again -- a development that could prove very damaging to cryptocurrency valuations.\nWhat's next for Dogecoin?\nLast week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published its Producer Price Index (PPI) report for July. Sequential monthly PPI inflation came in at its highest level in more than three years, which raised concerns that inflation faced by producers and wholesalers would soon start to appear at the consumer level of the economy. Home Depot's recent comments about price increases seem to be adding to those fears. Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen bullish momentum thanks to expectations that the Federal Reserve is poised to deliver significant cuts to interest rates, but that thesis could be dashed if inflation comes in at higher-than-anticipated levels.","content_hash":"175aff14e882784a9125ca7c6f89ff11","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2521,"method_rank":0}

The 30-year mortgage fell to a 10-month low at 6.55% last week, adding to losses after a poor July jobs report stoked more economic uncertainty. The crosscurrents are slowly shifting buyer fatigue from affordability issues to tariff-fueled inflation.\nA new Bright MLS survey confirms weakening demand and deteriorating sentiment. It concludes both buyers and sellers are holding back and successful transactions are \"more likely to be because people need to buy or sell, rather than that they want to buy or sell.\" Nearly three-quarters of agency respondents reported at least one buyer who chose to pause their home search, compared to less than two-thirds at the same time last year.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nWould you have invested in eBay or Uber early? The same backers are betting on this vacation home platform at just $2.90 per share.\n-\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nIn addition, just 32% of buyers walking away did so because they were frustrated by failed offers, typical in a strong seller's market. That percentage recorded a major drop from last year's 56%. Affordability issues are also fading, with respondents citing \"other financial issues\" and \"general uncertainty\" more frequently, compared to 2024 when \"affordability\" and \"high mortgage rates\" dominated buyer worries.\nOn the other hand, prospective homebuyers must be thrilled to see mortgage rates finally headed lower. United Wholesale Mortgage (NYSE:UWMC) Chief Strategy Officer Alex Elezaj told MarketWatch this shape-shifting market is offering \"lots of opportunity\" for buyers and sellers and notes that cheaper mortgages will allow buyers to \"afford more houses for their money.\"\nTrending: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It\nLower rates also allow homeowners looking to refinance to shorten their loan term and build principal at a faster rate. It has immediate benefits as well. Marketwatch offers the example of a $300,000 loan and 30-year fixed rate at 7.5%. Dropping the rate to the last week's low would reduce the monthly payment from $2,100 to $1,900, saving over $2,000 per year.","content_hash":"6e02ae65793ef09e42244c78c55bb50f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2521,"method_rank":0}

As a result, the company is at risk of seeing big sell-offs in the face of indications that macroeconomic conditions could be weakening.","content_hash":"c80de9d277f56562c13ad0886fc9617d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2517,"method_rank":0}

First, the retailer released its Q2 2025 results, which revealed it is still facing substantial sales headwinds.

The stock price is currently down nearly 10% to just above $95 per share. Here’s what you need to know.\nTarget’s disappointing Q2 2025\nToday, Target announced its second quarter 2025 results before markets opened. Those results came in slightly ahead of the already low investor expectations, but they were also still down from the same period a year earlier.\nFor its Q2 2025, Target reported the following:\n-\nEarnings per share (EPS): $2.05\n-\nRevenue: $25.21 billion\nAs CNBC notes, those figures actually came in slightly above LSEG analyst expectations, which were expected EPS of $2.03 and expected revenue of $24.93 billion.\nYet those small beats weren’t enough to discourage investors from dumping the stock. Target reported several other metrics that show the company is still struggling.\nThe company revealed that its net sales were down 0.9% for the quarter, with comparable sales decreasing by 1.9%. Its net income for the quarter was $935 million, which was down significantly from the $1.19 billion in net income in the same quarter a year earlier. Likewise, its revenue of $25.21 billion for the quarter was also down from a year earlier, when net revenue totaled $25.45.\nThe company also maintained its current full fiscal 2025 forecast of adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of between $7 and $9. This forecast expects the company to see “a low-single digit decline in sales.” The company previously cut back its initial full-year forecast back in May.\nMeet Target’s new CEO, Michael Fiddelke\nIn addition to announcing its Q2 2025 results, Target also revealed that it would be getting a new CEO. The company announced that its current CEO, Brian Cornell, will be stepping down from the role in February 2026. On February 1, its new CEO, Michael Fiddelke, will take the reins. Cornell has been Target’s CEO since 2014.","content_hash":"0cc44cf988ae09ce1a03bde364344b1b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2510,"method_rank":0}

Once dominated by both Ulta and Sephora (key competitors for share of mind and wallet in the prestige market), Amazon is now the largest beauty retailer in the U.S., as reported. Abroad, the U.K. appears to be the latest frontier, with Ulta acquiring Space NK just years after Sephora reentered the geography in 2023.\nBrok was pivotal to that debut, having architected Sephora’s acquisition of Feelunique in the U.K. and Zalando in Germany. At the time of his departure in 2022, it was “due to a divergence of views,” an internal memo said.\nIt’s the latest in a slew of big moves from Steelman, who took the helm of Ulta at the top of the year. Geographically, she’s overseeing expansions into Mexico and the Middle East. On the personnel front, she’s named Lauren Brindley its chief merchandising and digital officer, Kelly Mahoney its chief marketing officer, and also announced the ending of its partnership with Target Corp.\nBest of WWD\nSign up for WWD's Newsletter.

The retailer previously filed under Chapter 11 in 2018.\n“The Debtors left no stone unturned in their sale and marketing process,” the company told the court Wednesday, noting that it had “entered chapter 11 with multiple letters of intent and worked tirelessly with these counterparties since the Petition Date to convert the letters of intent into binding bids and, ultimately, an asset purchase agreement.”\nClaire’s reached out to 160 potential financial and strategic firms and executed more than 60 non-disclosure agreements, per court documents.\n“That effort was a success,” the company also said, and urged the court’s approval.\nThe development changes a lot. A couple of weeks ago, Claire’s initiated plans to close 700 locations, including all Walmart shop-in-shops and Icing stores, and warned that its entire fleet in the U.S. and Canada could ultimately shutter.

The Producer Price Index (PPI), a read on wholesale prices, also showed inflation pressures building.\nThe July jobs report showed hiring slowed last month, while over 250,000 job additions were revised away from the May and June data.\n\"We have a lot of things in balance right now in the economy, in my opinion,\" Schmid said.\n\"And I'm just trying to be very careful to [not] try and do too much. That will create an imbalance.\"\nFed Chair Jay Powell is set to speak in Jackson Hole on Friday in what is expected to be his signature policy speech of the year and his last at the symposium as Fed chair.","content_hash":"f306dac8c5d8077a628a85369b80f8f9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2466,"method_rank":0}

If he hints at a cut, that is seen as a boon for Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins.\nPowell’s speech on Friday “could potentially shape the outlook for the rest of 2025,” Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, the crypto exchange, told DL News. “If he signals that rate cuts are back in September with more to follow, markets will likely rally across the board.”\nJackson Hole, the Fed’s annual retreat in Wyoming, is one of the most closely watched events on the central bank calendar. Powell used the forum last year to telegraph a shift toward easing.\nFor crypto, the gathering carries outsized weight. Digital assets are highly sensitive to liquidity conditions, and Fed policy largely determines how much capital is available.\nThe event comes as the crypto market trembles just below the $4 trillion mark.\nBitcoin briefly dipped below $113,000 on Wednesday, down from a record $124,500 touched on August 14. Ethereum dropped to $4,100, while XRP and Solana were down about 10% and 7% respectively over the past week.\nShares of digital asset companies followed suit with crypto exchange Coinbase down nearly 6% and investment firm MicroStrategy over 7%.\nOther equities fell less sharply as the S&P 500 slipped 0.6% and the Nasdaq 1.5% while the Dow closed flat.\nThe divergence underscores how digital assets, reliant on speculative liquidity, are more exposed to shifts in interest rates than other investments.\n“The recent market selloff is a direct consequence of escalating geopolitical tensions and a growing fear that the Fed will disappoint investors in Jackson Hole,” Kyle Chasse, founder of venture capital firm MV Global, told DL News.\nThe Fed has held its benchmark rate at 4.25% to 4.50% all year.\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that the Fed should begin an easing cycle with a 50 basis-point rate cut next month.\nMarkets are pricing an 83% chance of a September cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That’s down from last week when chances were over 90%.\nLower interest rates support risk-on assets like crypto by making capital cheaper and pushing investors away from bonds and toward higher-yielding alternatives.\nLance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.

The Japanese government has pressed Washington to ease tariffs in return for that investment.\nThe announcement came shortly after the report that the U.S. federal government is mulling an investment that would make it Intel’s largest shareholder.

We'll start paying down the debt, and then at that point that can be used as an offset to the American people.\"\nThe U.S. economy could return to the \"good, low-inflationary growth\" of the 1990s, Bessent said, but he blamed higher interest rates for problems plaguing some pockets of the economy, singling out housing and lower-income households with high credit card debt.\nA cut in the Federal Reserve's key interest rate - which Trump has continually pressed for - could help facilitate a boom or pickup in home building, which would help keep prices down in one to two years, he said.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday reported a small increase in groundbreaking for single-family homes and permits for future construction in July, even as high mortgage rates and economic uncertainty continued to hamper home purchases.\nTrump's wide-ranging import tariffs have kept the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates this year, with most central bank policymakers wary of easing borrowing costs until they have more confidence the levies will not rekindle inflation, which has yet to return to the Fed's 2% target.\nRecent indications of softening in the job market, however, have largely convinced investors that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point when it meets in mid-September. That expectation has helped bring down mortgage rates in recent weeks.\nBessent has previously said a 50-basis-point cut in rates was warranted.\n(Reporting by Andrea ShalalEditing by Mark Potter and Leslie Adler)","content_hash":"3e5a704c061879b83ed59abf63c90169","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2399,"method_rank":0}

Bets against Palantir and Microsoft come with both stocks up year-to-date in 2025, including a huge 110% gain for Palantir.\nWhy It's Important: The increase in short interest in Meta could be for many reasons. Partsinevelos' tweet links the increase to investor betting against Meta's AI and metaverse spending and the negative impact of tariffs and slowing growth could have on the company's stock.\nPressure on advertising rates could be another factor that sends shares lower, especially after the year-to-date gains.\nMeta reported its second-quarter financial results in July. Without any negative catalysts between now and the end of October, short sellers may have to wait until the third-quarter results in late October to see shares take a turn down if the report is unfavorable.\nMeta has beaten analyst estimates for earnings per share in 10 consecutive quarters and revenue estimates in 13 straight quarters.\nThe company's consistent growth has helped the stock performance in recent years.\nWith more investors betting against the company, the likelihood is that the company's aggressive spending on new hires in the AI field and the continued spending on the metaverse could be negatives for the long term and hurt margins going forward.\nMETA Price Action: Meta Platforms stock is down 2% to $752.27 on Tuesday versus a 52-week trading range of $479.80 to $796.25. Meta stock is up 25.6% year-to-date in 2025.\nRead Next:","content_hash":"dda94cf8193a599f0e6d24a52e3ddc0d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2386,"method_rank":0}

In the August 15 Market on Close livestream, John Rowland, CMT, and team walked through why the current market setup deserves your attention — and how to prepare using Barchart’s tools.\nWhat “Mag-7 Concentration” Actually Means\nThe S&P 500 Index ($SPX) is market-cap weighted, so larger companies move the index more. And there aren’t too many bigger companies than the “Magnificent Seven” group of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA).\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nMarvell Technology Bear Put Spread Could Return 127% in this Down Move\n-\nPalo Alto Networks Stock is a Favorite of Value Investors After Its Latest Results\nRecently, multiple outlets pegged the Mag 7’s combined weight at around ~34% of the S&P 500 — an all-time high.\nConcentration cuts both ways:\n-\nWhen they rally, the index flies — even if many other stocks tread water.\n-\nWhen they wobble, the whole index can roll over, even if breadth elsewhere looks OK.\nRecent data also shows how the cap-weighted S&P has outpaced its equal-weight cousin, which keeps every stock weighted the same, underscoring how much leadership rests in a few names.\nThe “Probabilities” Discussion from the Show\nIn the clip, we reference a UBS note flagging that when Mag-7 weight crossed certain thresholds (~27.5% and ~34%) in the past, the S&P 500 went on to stage a short rally before falling roughly ~13% over the next two months — i.e., a textbook “correction.” That doesn’t guarantee a drop this time, but it’s a risk marker worth respecting. That’s particularly true since UBS and many others have already been vocal about concentration risks in 2025.\nAnother caution light comes from the equity risk premium (ERP). ERP is the expected return of stocks over risk-free Treasuries, and it has now slipped toward multi-decade lows, meaning stocks are expensive relative to bonds and forward returns can be thinner. That’s been highlighted by Bloomberg and others this summer.\nNone of this screams “go to cash.” It does argue for:\n-\nSmarter entry timing;\n-\nDiversification beyond the biggest names;\n-\nAnd a plan if market leadership stumbles.","content_hash":"180868e2309963993876f56a869ef78c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2304,"method_rank":0}

In May 2024, he told \"Fast Money\" that high-income shoppers were creating a \"bubble\" at Walmart.

And to the dismay of some fans, the chain's new logo now ditches the barrel itself.\nOr rather, the drawing many have associated with Cracker Barrel over the years. The man leaning on that barrel is also gone, as are the words “Old Country Store.” Instead, the new emblem features a simpler design with just “Cracker Barrel” written on a gold background, which also has a semi-updated shape.\n“Anchored in Cracker Barrel’s signature gold and brown tones, the updated visuals will appear across menus and marketing collateral,\" the Tennessee-based company wrote in a Tuesday announcement. Cracker Barrel added that its logo is \"now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and word mark that started it all.”\nAccording to Cracker Barrel, this latest look marks the brand's “fifth evolution” of its logo to date. It was unveiled as part of a campaign from the company called “All the More,” which also advertises some new fall menu items.\nCracker Barrel has been working on a wider rebrand for some time. Beyond a new logo, that's included remodeling its country-style restaurants and retail stores. The company began ramping up this overhaul last year by swapping out older, more antique-filled designs with lighter paint and modern furniture.\nFounded in 1969, Cracker Barrel operates nearly 660 locations across the U.S. today. Those attached to the chain's previous look have been quick to express ire about both the new logo and restaurant remodels online.\n“Our values haven’t changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven’t changed,” Cracker Barrel said in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Thursday. The company added that the man on its former logo, known as Uncle Herschel, “remains front and center in our restaurants and on our menu,\" as he represents “The Herschel Way,” which is “the foundation of how our 70,000 plus employees provide the country hospitality for which we are known.”\nShares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store fell more than 7% by market close Thursday.","content_hash":"a620ad73e1a44544598721ecbd4436ae","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2087,"method_rank":0}

That raised suspicions among several cybersecurity experts that there was a leak in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), which Microsoft uses to help security vendors worldwide, including in China, to learn about cyber threats before the general public so they can better defend against hackers.\nBeijing has denied involvement in any SharePoint hacking.\nMicrosoft notified members of the MAPP program of the SharePoint vulnerabilities on June 24, July 3 and July 7, Reuters has previously reported. Because Microsoft said it first observed exploitation attempts on July 7, the timing led some experts to allege that the likeliest scenario for the sudden explosion in hacking attempts was because a rogue member of the MAPP program misused the information.\nIn a statement, Microsoft said several Chinese firms would no longer receive \"proof of concept code,\" which mimics the operation of genuine malicious software. Proof of concept code can help cybersecurity professionals seeking to harden their systems in a hurry, but it can also be repurposed by hackers to get a jump start on the defenders.\nMicrosoft said it was aware that the information it provided its partners could be exploited, \"which is why we take steps – both known and confidential – to prevent misuse. We continuously review participants and suspend or remove them if we find they violated their contract with us which includes a prohibition on participating in offensive attacks.\"\nMicrosoft declined to disclose the status of its investigation of the hacking or go into specifics about which companies had been restricted.","content_hash":"a0362f4db3f08b6a67eb9c00a1c6be23","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2054,"method_rank":0}

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nMusk fired approximately 6,000 employees after his 2022 acquisition of Twitter, which he rebranded X. Several employees sued over their terminations and severance pay, and other lawsuits are still pending in courts in Delaware and California.\nThe settlement would resolve a proposed class action filed in California by Courtney McMillian, who previously oversaw Twitter's employee benefits programs as its \"head of total rewards,\" and Ronald Cooper, who was an operations manager.\nA federal judge in San Francisco dismissed the employees' lawsuit in July 2024, and they appealed to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Court of Appeals. The 9th Circuit had been scheduled to hear oral arguments on September 17.\nAttorneys for Musk and McMillian did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.\nThe lawsuit argued that a 2019 severance plan guaranteed that most Twitter workers would receive two months of their base pay plus one week of pay for each full year of service if they were laid off. Senior employees such as McMillian were owed six months of base pay, according to the lawsuit.\nBut Twitter only gave laid-off workers at most one month of severance pay, and many of them did not receive anything, according to the lawsuit.

Higher taxes, higher fees, higher wages that many businesses simply cannot sustain, and endless regulations that strangle growth.

When a stock trades above its 200-DMA, it is generally seen as being in an uptrend, while trading below it may signal potential weakness or a shift in momentum. Because of its role as a key support or resistance level, the 200-DMA is closely watched by both traders and long-term investors.\nIn recent years, the 200-DMA has been a notable level of support for MSTR.\nFor instance, in April 2025, during the so-called “Trump tariff tantrum,” the stock tested this level before rebounding. A similar pattern emerged during the summer of 2024, when MSTR once again found a floor around the 200-DMA before resuming its upward trajectory.\nWhether the current dip below this technical threshold proves temporary or signals a more sustained downturn will likely depend on both bitcoin’s price action and broader market sentiment.\nChanos notches a win\nFamed short-seller James Chanos has been publicly bearish on Strategy for a number of weeks, saying he's opened up a sizable bet against the Michael Saylor-led company by shorting MSTR against a long in bitcoin.\nOf late, the trade has been looking like a winner, with MSTR lower by 21% over the past month compared to bitcoin's very modest 3.5% decline.\nMarket technician J.C.
