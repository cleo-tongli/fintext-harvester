The data was accompanied by remarks from U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who suggested that the U.S. central bank should be open to a 50 basis-point rate cut in September. Optimism over a softer rate stance is further supported by easing global trade tensions and a much stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings season in the U.S.\nIn yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s three main equity benchmarks closed sharply higher. The Magnificent Seven stocks advanced, with Meta Platforms (META) rising over +3% and Microsoft (MSFT) gaining more than +1%. Also, chip stocks gained ground, with NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) climbing over +7% to lead gainers in the Nasdaq 100 and ON Semiconductor (ON) rising more than +6%. In addition, airline stocks surged after oil prices declined, with United Airlines (UAL) jumping over +10% to lead gainers in the S&P 500. On the bearish side, Cardinal Health (CAH) slumped more than -7% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 after the drug distributor posted weaker-than-expected FQ4 revenue and announced it had agreed to acquire Solaris Health for $1.9 billion in cash.\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report released on Tuesday showed that consumer prices rose +0.2% m\/m in July, in line with expectations. On an annual basis, headline inflation rose +2.7% in July, the same as the previous month and slightly weaker than expectations of +2.8%. Also, the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, rose +0.3% m\/m and +3.1% y\/y in July, compared to expectations of +0.3% m\/m and +3.0% y\/y.\n“Inflation is on the rise, but it didn’t increase as much as some people feared. In the short term, markets will likely embrace these numbers because they should allow the Fed to focus on labor-market weakness and keep a September rate cut on the table,” said Ellen Zentner at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\nRichmond Fed President Tom Barkin said on Tuesday that uncertainty about the U.S. economy’s trajectory is easing, but it remains unclear whether the central bank should place greater focus on curbing inflation or supporting the labor market. “We may well see pressure on inflation, and we may also see pressure on unemployment, but the balance between the two is still unclear. As the visibility continues to improve, we are well-positioned to adjust our policy stance as needed,” Barkin said. At the same time, Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said he supports holding interest rates steady for now to prevent strong economic activity from adding to inflation pressures. “With the economy still showing momentum, growing business optimism, and inflation still stuck above our objective, retaining a modestly restrictive monetary policy stance remains appropriate for the time being,” Schmid said. He added that he is prepared to shift his stance if demand growth begins “weakening significantly.”\nMeanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in a 96.2% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 3.8% chance of no rate change at the conclusion of the Fed’s September meeting.\nToday, investors will hear perspectives from Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic.\nOn the earnings front, network infrastructure provider Cisco Systems (CSCO) is set to report its FQ4 earnings results today.\nOn the economic data front, investors will focus on U.S. Crude Oil Inventories data, which is set to be released later in the day. Economists expect this figure to be -0.900M, compared to last week’s value of -3.029M.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.256%, down -1.21%.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up +0.73% this morning amid risk-on sentiment, driven by growing expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Defense and technology stocks led the gains on Wednesday. Final data from the Federal Statistical Office released on Wednesday confirmed that Germany’s annual inflation rate held at 2.0% in July. Separately, final data from the National Statistics Institute confirmed that Spain’s annual inflation rate rose for the second month to a 5-month high of 2.7% in July. Meanwhile, European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are set to speak with U.S. President Donald Trump later today ahead of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In corporate news, Tui AG (TUI1.D.DX) gained over +4% after Europe’s largest tour operator reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year profit guidance.\nGermany’s CPI and Spain’s CPI data were released today.\nThe German July CPI rose +0.3% m\/m and +2.0% y\/y, in line with expectations.\nThe Spanish July CPI fell -0.1% m\/m and rose +2.7% y\/y, in line with expectations.\nAsian stock markets today closed in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +0.48%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +1.30%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index closed higher and hit a more than 3-1\/2-year high today as the extension of the tariff truce between the U.S. and China continued to boost sentiment. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Tuesday that U.S. trade officials will meet again with their Chinese counterparts within the next two to three months to discuss the future of the economic relationship between the two nations. Also, expectations for a Fed interest rate cut next month lifted global risk appetite, and “emerging and developed equity markets resonated,” according to analysts at Guoyuan Securities. Meanwhile, China announced it will provide interest subsidies for businesses in eight consumer service sectors, as well as for individual consumers, to bolster services consumption. Eligible businesses and consumers can receive an annual interest subsidy of one percentage point on loans. “It will support domestic consumption to become a major driving force of the national economy,” China’s Vice Finance Minister Liao Min said on Wednesday. In other news, trade tensions between China and Canada intensified after Chinese authorities announced plans to impose a steep tariff of around 76% on canola shipments. In corporate news, WH Group climbed over +6% in Hong Kong after the pork processor posted a 10.4% increase in first-half operating profit. Investor focus this week is on a slew of China’s official data, including industrial production, retail sales, fixed asset investment, and unemployment figures, which will provide the most comprehensive view yet of the country’s economic momentum in July.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher and reached a new all-time high today, tracking Wall Street’s overnight rally. Electronics and machinery stocks led the gains on Wednesday. Data released on Wednesday showed that Japan’s annual wholesale inflation eased for the fourth consecutive month in July, reinforcing the Bank of Japan’s view that upward price pressures from raw material costs will fade. Still, wholesale prices for food and agricultural products continued to climb, signaling broadening price pressure that will likely sustain market expectations for a BOJ interest rate hike. Separately, a Reuters Tankan poll showed that Japanese manufacturers became more upbeat about business conditions in August following a trade deal between Tokyo and Washington, though they remained cautious about the outlook due to potential impacts from U.S. tariffs. Meanwhile, Japanese government bonds fell on Wednesday after a five-year bond auction drew the weakest demand in over five years, sparking a wave of selling by investors. In other news, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said on Wednesday that the country has initiated an anti-dumping probe into hot-dip galvanized steel from China and South Korea. In corporate news, Yokohama Rubber climbed over +8% after the tyre maker posted strong first-half results and raised its full-year earnings guidance. Investors are awaiting Japan’s preliminary second-quarter GDP data, scheduled for release on Friday, following the BOJ’s reiteration that growth is expected to moderate. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -0.65% to 24.50.\nThe Japanese July PPI rose +0.2% m\/m and +2.6% y\/y, compared to expectations of +0.2% m\/m and +2.5% y\/y.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nIntapp (INTA) soared over +29% in pre-market trading after the AI cloud company posted upbeat FQ4 results and announced a $150 million stock buyback.\nSapiens International (SPNS) jumped more than +44% in pre-market trading after the company agreed to be acquired by Advent for $2.5 billion.\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) rose over +1% in pre-market trading after Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold with a price target of $220.\nCoreWeave (CRWV) slumped more than -9% in pre-market trading after the AI cloud vendor reported a wider-than-expected Q2 loss.\nCAVA Group (CAVA) plunged over -24% in pre-market trading after reporting much weaker-than-expected Q2 same-restaurant sales growth.\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Wednesday - August 13th\nCisco (CSCO), Elbit Systems (ESLT), Coherent (COHR), JBS NV (JBS), Performance Food Group Co (PFGC), Stantec (STN), StandardAero (SARO), Brinker (EAT), Loar Holdings LLC (LOAR), GlobalE Online (GLBE), Equinox Gold (EQX), HudBay Minerals (HBM), Ultrapar Participacoes (UGP), Dlocal (DLO), ReNew Energy Global (RNW), Alvotech (ALVO), PagSeguro Digital (PAGS), Marex (MRX), Fidelis Insurance Holdings (FIHL), Nayax (NYAX), Endeavour Silver (EXK), Sapiens (SPNS), ARS Pharmaceuticals (SPRY), Arcos Dorados (ARCO), Madison Square Garden Entertainment (MSGE), Stratasys Ltd (SSYS), Ibotta (IBTA), Borr Drilling (BORR), Avino Silver Gold (ASM), Kimball Electronics (KE), North American Construction (NOA), SBC Medical Holdings (SBC), Kamada (KMDA), Galiano Gold (GAU), Oncology Institute (TOI), Euroseas (ESEA), Innoviz Technologies (INVZ), FrontView REIT (FVR), Global Water (GWRS), Sanara Medtech (SMTI), Codexis (CDXS), Brainsway (BWAY), European Wax Center (EWCZ), Allogene Therapeutics (ALLO), Radcom (RDCM), B.

In my column today I look at the blizzard of U.S. labor market data - often conflicting, sometimes distorted - and ask which number best shines a light through the fog. Could it now be continuing jobless claims?\nIf you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.\n1. Fed structure may be in flux, not just rates: Mike Dolan 2. Trump's Fed pick wanted to upend its protection frompolitics 3. Trump opens door to sales of version of Nvidia'snext-gen AI chips in China 4. Debt market jitters signal caution for high-flyingstocks 5.

One of the quietest sessions in a while. * COMMODITIES: Gold slips 1.4%, soybean futures rise 2.5%- both related to tariff-related comments from Trump.\nTariffs, CPI nerves soften sentiment\nWall Street closed lower on Monday, even as the Nasdaq touched fresh highs, with the latest news related to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff war generally sapping risk appetite rather than strengthening it.\nTrump signed an executive order on Monday extending the China tariff deadline for another 90 days, with only hours to go before U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were due to snap back to triple-digit rates.\nThis came after a U.S. official told Reuters over the weekend that chip companies Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of revenue from sales of advanced chips to China.\nThe news was surprising and confusing.\n\"It's wild,\" said Geoff Gertz, a senior fellow at Center for New American Security, an independent think tank in Washington, D.C. \"Either selling H20 chips to China is a national security risk, in which case we shouldn't be doing it to begin with, or it's not a national security risk, in which case, why are we putting this extra penalty on the sale?\"\nA rise for Nvidia shares this week would mark a record-breaking 12 consecutive weekly gains. The stock now accounts for 8% of the entire S&P 500 market cap, the biggest weight of any individual stock in the wider index since the data began in 1981, according to Apollo's Torsten Slok.\nThe so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap stocks, of which Nvidia is one, now account for a record 35.3% of the S&P 500's total market cap. The top 10 stocks make up a record 40% of the index's market cap.\nThis concentration risk is nothing new, of course, but the steady advance deeper into uncharted territory is bound to unnerve some investors.\nMeanwhile, U.S.-Brazil relations show no sign of improving. Brazil's Finance Minister Fernando Haddad said on Monday that his virtual meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent scheduled for later this week has been canceled, a blow to Brasilia as it attempts to get the 50% tariff on many Brazilian exports to the U.S. reduced.\nSpeculation continues to swirl around who Trump will nominate to replace Fed chair Jerome Powell, whose term officially ends next May. As of Monday, no fewer than eight names appear to be under consideration, according to media reports.\nThe main economic indicators on Monday were from China, which showed producer prices fell more than expected in July and no change in consumer prices. Deflation still stalks China, in contrast to the U.S. where tariffs are putting upward pressure on prices.\nAttention on Tuesday turns to Australia, where the central bank is expected to reduce its cash rate by a quarter point to 3.60%, and then to CPI inflation figures for July from the U.S.\nWhich data point may shine light through U.S. jobs fog?\nAmid a blizzard of contradictory signals, it's becoming increasingly difficult to get any visibility on the U.S. labor market. But of all the numbers that feed into the all-important unemployment rate, the one worth paying most attention to may be continuing weekly jobless claims.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said that while he and his colleagues look at the \"totality\" of the data, the best gauge of the health of the labor market is the unemployment rate. That's currently 4.2%, low by historical standards, and consistent with an economy operating at full employment.\nBut it is a lagging indicator, meaning that once it starts to rise sharply, the economy will probably already be in a very precarious position. And it is also being depressed by labor demand and supply factors unique to the U.S.'s current high tariff, low immigration era.\nLOW FIRE, LOW HIRE\nEconomic growth is slowing. Broadly speaking, it is running at an annual rate of just over 1%, half the pace seen in the last few years. Unsurprisingly, firms' hiring is slowing too.\nThe latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed hiring in June was the weakest in a year, while July's nonfarm payrolls report and previous months' revisions were so disappointing that President Donald Trump fired the head of the agency responsible for collecting the data.\nBut the unemployment rate isn't rising, largely because firms aren't firing workers. Why? Perhaps because they are banking on tariff and inflation uncertainty lifting in the second half of the year. It's also possible that firms are still scared from the post-pandemic labor shortages.\nWhatever the reason, the pace of layoffs simply has not picked up, the monthly JOLTS surveys show. Layoffs in June totaled 1.6 million, below the averages of the last one, two and three years.\nMeanwhile, lower immigration, increased deportations, and fewer people re-entering the labor force are offsetting weak hiring, thus keeping a lid on the unemployment rate. The labor force participation rate in July was 62.2%, the lowest since November 2022.\nAnd what about weekly jobless claims, another key variable in the labor market picture? In previous slowdowns, rising layoffs would be reflected in a spike in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time.\nThat's not happening either. Last week's 226,000 initial claims were right at the average for the past year, and only a few thousand higher than the averages over the past two and three years.\n\"It's a low fire, low hire economy,\" notes Oscar Munoz, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities.\nREGULAR CHECK-UP\nOne high-frequency number that has gone under the radar, but which merits more attention is continuing jobless claims, which measures the number of workers continuing to file for unemployment benefits after losing their jobs. Rising continued claims suggest people actively looking for a job are struggling to get one, a sign that the labor market could be softening.\nThat figure spiked last week to 1.97 million, the highest since November 2021, which in theory should put upward pressure on the unemployment rate.\nUsing the 'stock' versus 'flow' analogy, continuing claims are the 'stock,' and weekly claims are the 'flow'. Everyone will have their own view on what's more important, but right now initial claims are offering no guidance while continuing claims are pointing to softening in the job market.\nFed officials are on alert, but what would move them to cut rates?\nMunoz and his colleagues at TD Securities estimate that continuing claims of around 2.2 million would be consistent with an unemployment rate of 4.5%, a level of joblessness most economists agree would prompt the Fed to trim rates.\nThat's also the year-end unemployment rate in the Fed's last economic projections from June, a set of forecasts which also penciled in 50 bps of easing by December.\nAn unemployment rate of 4.4% would probably tip the balance on the Federal Open Market Committee, while 4.3% would make it a much closer call, perhaps a coin toss.\nFurther muddying the picture, other indicators suggest the labor market is ticking along nicely. July's payrolls report showed that average hourly earnings last month rose at a 3.9% annual rate, consistent with the level seen in the past year. And the average number of hours worked was 34.3 hours, right at the mean for the past two years.\nThese numbers and the JOLTS data are released monthly, and there will be one more of each before the Fed's September 16-17 policy meeting.\nBut if the increased focus on the unemployment rate means investors want a more regular labor market temperature check, they should keep a close eye on weekly continuing claims.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* Australia interest rate decision * India CPI inflation (July) * UK employment, earnings (July) * Germany ZEW sentiment index (August) * Brazil inflation (July) * U.S. CPI inflation (July) * U.S. federal budget data (July) * U.S. Fed officials on the stump: Richmond Fed PresidentThomas Barkin, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.28%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -0.40%.\nStock indexes on Monday gave up an early advance and settled lower. Position squaring and long liquidation pressures ahead of this week's US inflation reports on July CPI and PPI weighed on stocks Monday.\nStocks on Monday initially moved higher, with the S&P 500 posting a 1-week high and the Nasdaq 10 posting a new record high. Recent dovish Fed comments have bolstered the outlook for Fed rate cuts sooner rather than later and are supportive of stocks. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she supports an interest rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and that she favors three interest rate cuts this year. Stocks also garnered support Monday when CNBC reported that President Trump is extending the tariff truce with China, which was to expire on Tuesday, for another 90 days.\nStocks were also under pressure as hopes dim for an imminent end to the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough to end the war in Ukraine when he meets with Russian President Putin this Friday in Alaska, saying the summit is a \"feel-out meeting\" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.\nStocks are seeing support from speculation that recent weaker-than-expected US economic news and dovish Fed commentary will push the Fed to lower interest rates as soon as next month. On Saturday, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she supports cutting interest rates at the FOMC's next meeting in September and that she favors three rate cuts this year to \"help avoid a further unnecessary erosion in labor market conditions and reduce the chance that the committee will need to implement a larger policy correction should the labor market deteriorate further.\" The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 88% from 40% earlier this month.\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) rose more than +1% Monday to a 4-week high, boosted by strong demand from institutional investors and corporate buyers, which are helping to lift the entire cryptocurrency market. According to data from Coingecko, digital-asset treasury companies, listed vehicles that accumulate cryptocurrencies, have amassed a Bitcoin stockpile worth $113 billion thus far.\nIn recent tariff news, CNBC on Monday reported that President Trump will extend the tariff truce with China, which was to expire on Tuesday, for another 90 days. Last Wednesday, President Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nThe market's focus this week will be on corporate earnings results and any new trade or tariff news. On Tuesday, the July US CPI is expected to edge up to +2.8% y\/y from +2.7% y\/y in June, and the July CPI ex-food and energy is expected to climb +3.0% y\/y from +2.9% y\/y in June. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -1,000 to 225,000. Also on Thursday, the July final-demand PPI is expected to increase to +2.5% y\/y from +2.3% y\/y in June, and the July PPI ex-food and energy is expected to rise to +2.9% y\/y from +2.6% y\/y in June. On Friday, July US retail sales are expected to climb +0.5% m\/m and retail sales ex-autos are expected to rise +0.3% m\/m. Also on Friday, July manufacturing production is expected to remain unchanged m\/m. Finally, the University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to climb by +0.3 to 62.0.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 88% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 62% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets on Monday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 fell from a 1-week high and closed down -0.30%. China's Shanghai Composite rallied to a 10-month high and closed up +0.34%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 was closed today for the Mountain Day holiday.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) Monday closed up +2 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield fell -0.4 bp to 4.279%. T-notes posted modest gains on Monday on mounting speculation that the Fed may soon cut interest rates after Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she supports an interest rate cut at the September FOMC meeting and that she favors three interest rate cuts this year. T-notes also have carryover support from last Thursday, when President Trump nominated Stephen Miran for Fed Governor to replace Adriana Kugler for the rest of the year. Miran views President Trump's policies as disinflationary and would support a more dovish Fed policy.\nEuropean government bond yields on Monday settled mixed. The 10-year German bund yield rose by +0.6 bp to 2.696%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell -3.6 bp to 4.565%.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 6% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nMonday.com (MNDY) closed down more than -29% on growth concerns after it failed to boost its full-year revenue guidance from the current estimate of $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion.\nC3.ai (AI) closed down more than -25% after DA Davidson downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral with a price target of $13, citing preliminary earnings results that were \"significantly below guidance.\"\nAAON Inc.

Even so, some stocks have yet to catch up – and for investors, those laggards could hold an intriguing comeback potential.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nThe trick is spotting companies at or near the bottom of their cycle. Sure, every seasoned advisor will tell you that “timing the market” is impossible – and they’re right – but timing still matters. Buying low is the name of the game, and that means recognizing when a stock’s price is depressed and presents investors with an opportunity.\nThat’s where Wall Street’s pros can lend a hand. Lately, Piper Sandler analysts have been busy flagging stocks that are hovering near their lows and could be primed for a rebound.\nUsing the TipRanks database, we dug into two of their top rebound candidates. Both have tumbled more than 30% this year, but Piper Sandler sees each as having the potential to turn things around. Here’s a closer look – along with the analysts’ take on what could spark that recovery.\nHubSpot (HUBS)\nThe first stock we’ll look at here is HubSpot, the well-known marketing software platform. The company was founded in 2006, and over the past two decades has turned itself into the ‘go-to’ software stop for online marketing teams. HubSpot’s software provides a set of marketing tools, based on a unified platform and designed to solve the day-to-day problems and issues that arise in CRM, social media management, content management, and SEO. The platform has proven popular with direct marketers, inbound sales experts, and customer service teams.\nHubSpot’s product line includes tools for a wide range of functions, from ad placement to Google ad optimization, to content writing, to marketing automation, to newsletter building, to email marketing, to building chatbots. It’s a long list, with something to meet every conceivable need in digital marketing. The company has built a reputation for innovation, and in recent years, HubSpot has integrated AI technology into its software offerings.\nHubSpot was quick to realize that AI can enhance digital marketing in myriad ways. The company’s Breeze AI gives marketers a toolkit of AI-powered applications, including both generative and agentic AI in the mix. These can be used to enhance a customer’s existing set of HubSpot tools, or set up a new AI-powered marketing suite. The system is designed to operate independently, based on the human operator’s instructions and preferences. Since introducing Breeze AI last year, HubSpot claims that users have seen significant gains – on the order of 40% to 50% – in ticket and customer contact resolutions.\nHubSpot works on the proven ‘freemium’ model. That is, the company offers a basic set of tools and services to all users, free of charge – with more options, more sophisticated tools, and more in-depth service available through paid subscription packages. The model has proven successful in the world of software-as-a-service, and HubSpot has used it to build a $23 billion company, that has generated $2.8 billion in revenue over the last 12 months, and can boast some 268,000 customers.\nIn its last reported financial results, for 2Q25, HubSpot’s quarterly revenue came to $760.9 million, for a 19% year-over-year gain, and beat the forecast by $20.8 million. Subscription revenue, red meat for a SaaS company, grew 19% year-over-year to hit $744.5 million. At the bottom line, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of $2.19 per share, 7 cents per share better than had been anticipated. The company finished Q2 with deep pockets; it had $1.9 billion in cash and other liquid assets available as of June 30 this year.\nDespite all of this, HUBS shares are down 35% for the year-to-date. Piper Sandler’s Brent Bracelin has an idea what’s behind the downbeat stock action and thinks the scene is set for a rebound. He writes, “Q2 was better-than-feared evident by the $22M top-line beat, especially against a backdrop of negative investor sentiment across PLG SaaS models that pressured HUBS shares… Skeptics may still point to the ~$5M FX tailwind that contributed to ~23% of the Q2 beat and 2H guide that implies cc growth slows to 16% (vs. 18%). However, we argue that below the surface there are early signs that HUBS is at the forefront of a product-driven growth+margin rebound… We upgrade to Overweight on a potential 2026 growth+margin recovery and favorable risk-reward after the sell-off. Next catalyst: 9\/3 analyst day.”\nBracelin’s Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating is accompanied by a $675 price target that implies a 50% upside potential in the next 12 months. (To watch Bracelin’s track record, click here)\nLike many tech stocks, HubSpot has picked up plenty of Wall Street attention. The 29 recent analyst reviews include 25 to Buy against just 4 to Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus rating, while the $686.59 average price target points toward a one-year gain of 53% from the current trading price of $449.72. (See HUBS stock forecast)\nGoDaddy (GDDY)\nThe second stock we’ll look at here is GoDaddy, an internet company offering both domain hosting and website building services. The company was founded in 1997, during the tech expansion that led to the dot.com bubble, and in the years since then this proven tech survivor has built itself into an $19 billion player in the industry.\nGoDaddy is best known for hosting domain names. Customers can register names with the service, locking in their ownership of the name, and to date, GoDaddy boasts that it hosts some 81 million domain names. In addition, GoDaddy allows prospective customers to search for or generate unique domain names, and allows investors to appraise name values and enter domain auctions. On the website side, the company offers website design and building services, with a free trial website builder available. GoDaddy also provides web hosting, and can even host sites built through WordPress.\nGoDaddy offers plenty of additional services. These include web security services, including SSL certificates, and marketing services, such as a logo maker and a content and photo creator. The company even offers professional email hosting, through Microsoft 365, with several pricing packages available.\nOver the past year, GoDaddy has seen its revenues take a modest upward trend, but the stock is down 32% since the start of the year. The drop in share price came primarily in two large steps, one in February, when the company missed expectations in its 4Q24 earnings report, and again last week, when the 2Q25 report showed a beat vs. the profit forecast – but by less than investors had hoped.\nIn the quarter, GoDaddy’s total revenue came to $1.2 billion. This was up 8% year-over-year and in-line with expectations. The company reported a GAAP EPS of $1.41, which represented year-over-year growth of 40 cents per share and was 3 cents per share over the estimates. GoDaddy’s cash and liquid asset holdings at the end of the quarter came to $1.09 billion, and the free cash flow of $391.5 million was up 21% from the prior-year period.\nThis stock has caught the eye of Piper Sandler analyst Clarke Jeffries, who takes particular notice of the sharp decline in the share price that we noted above. Jeffries says of GoDaddy, “We believe shares have entered oversold territory. GoDaddy is a remarkably consistent business, but a 32% retreat in shares since the Q4 print would have you believe otherwise. Sitting today, GDDY is valued at ~12x CY26 FCF (8% FCF yield) encroaching on the multiple the business carried prepandemic despite demonstrative progress on AI product packaging, margins & shareholder return focused capital allocation. We believe GDDY is well on the path to $13 FCF\/share in 2026 – easily justifying in our minds $180+ per share. On a more tactical level, cash conversion improvement has driven a sizable raise in FCF growth from 11% FY FCF growth entering the year to now 18% growth with 2H NEBITDA expansion looking very conservative. It’s time to revisit GDDY in our view.”\nJeffries gives GDDY shares an Overweight (Buy) rating, which he complements with a $182 price target, suggesting a 36.5% one-year upside for the stock. (To watch Jeffries’s track record, click here)\nThe 16 recent analyst reviews of GDDY break down to 11 Buys and 4 Holds, for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $133.35 and its $193.79 average price target implies a gain of 45% in the year ahead.

That’s exactly what’s happening with ZOOZ Power (ZOOZ), a little-known Israeli energy technology company that’s suddenly making headlines far beyond the EV charging industry. In a surprise strategic pivot, Jordan Fried, blockchain entrepreneur and a founding team member of Hedera Hashgraph, has taken over as CEO with a vision to turn ZOOZ into what could be the next MicroStrategy (MSTR) of the Bitcoin (BTCUSD) world.\nThe plan? Alongside its existing flywheel-based power boosting and energy management business, ZOOZ will allocate the vast majority of proceeds from a $180 million private placement toward building a Bitcoin reserve. Supporters see the move as visionary — a chance for a niche clean-energy player to align itself with “digital gold” while differentiating from rivals. Skeptics, however, question the risks of tying a penny stock’s fortunes to Bitcoin’s notoriously volatile price swings, particularly when its core business remains far from profitability.\nIn this article, we’ll break down the details behind ZOOZ’s Bitcoin pivot and explore whether this new direction offers a genuine path to MicroStrategy-like returns — or if it’s simply too big a bet for this penny stock to handle.\nAbout ZOOZ Power Stock\nValued at a market cap of just $20.6 million, ZOOZ Power (ZOOZ) is a leading provider of flywheel-based power boosting and energy management solutions. The company offers the ZOOZTER-100, a flywheel-based kinetic power booster designed to support the sustainable and cost-effective deployment of ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations in grid-constrained areas. Alongside its core energy technology operations, upon closing the private placement, ZOOZ will become the first company dual-listed on the Nasdaq Exchange and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange to implement a long-term strategic Bitcoin treasury. This strategy positions ZOOZ as a trailblazer in sustainable, high-performance EV charging and a forward-looking allocator of capital.\nShares of the flywheel‑energy firm have slumped 30% on a year-to-date basis.\nOn July 29, ZOOZ announced a $180 million private placement (PIPE) with accredited institutional investors as part of its plans to implement a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy. The company stated that its Bitcoin reserve will serve as a “strategic asset” complementing its energy hardware, helping drive growth and set it apart as global financial infrastructure continues to evolve.\nThe PIPE deal, pending shareholder approval, will involve ZOOZ issuing 180 million ordinary shares and prepaid warrants at $1 each to a syndicate led by Pantera Capital, FalconX, Arrington Capital, UTXO Management, ATW Partners, and Israeli investor Alex Rabinovich. According to the company, roughly 95% of the net proceeds will be allocated to establishing a Bitcoin reserve, with the remainder used to repay $3 million in debt and fund general corporate purposes.\nAlongside the fundraising, ZOOZ’s board appointed blockchain entrepreneur Jordan Fried, a founding team member of Hedera Hashgraph, as CEO effective July 31, tasking him with immediately executing the company’s digital asset treasury strategy. Notably, former CEO Erez Zimerman remained with the company to lead ZOOZ Power’s flywheel-based advanced solutions, overseeing power boosters and energy management systems worldwide. Also, the board was strengthened with the appointments of former Citigroup CFO Todd Thomson and former Bank Leumi chairman Dr. Samer Haj-Yehia, both of whom joined on July 31. In addition, activist investor Jonathan Christodoro, who has served on the boards of PayPal (PYPL), Herbalife (HLF), and Lyft (LYFT), along with Jonas Grossman, co-founder of Chardan, have been nominated for election as directors at the upcoming annual meeting.\nThe PIPE’s closing is contingent on a shareholder vote, scheduled for on or around Sept. 8, 2025, to approve its terms, amend the company’s articles of association to increase authorized shares, elect two directors, and address other related matters. The PIPE is expected to close soon after receiving shareholder approval.\n“This move lets investors in Israel and the US gain direct exposure to our Bitcoin treasury strategy,” Fried said, adding that the dual listing equips ZOOZ with “every tool to grow our holdings and signal innovation and confidence to the market.” He noted that Bitcoin has delivered a compound annual growth rate of about 82% over the past decade. Separately, Chairman Avi Cohen described the shift as “a landmark moment” that positions ZOOZ “at the cutting edge of financial innovation while reinforcing our long‑term resilience.” Cohen stated that holding digital assets aligns the company with “an increasingly digital future” and has the potential to generate “significant shareholder value.”\nMeanwhile, ZOOZ recently completed the first phase of its major fundraising effort, securing $5 million through an initial private placement. The company issued about 2.5 million ordinary shares and pre-funded warrants, priced at $2.00 each. Each ordinary share or pre-funded warrant was accompanied by a warrant to purchase two additional ordinary shares at an exercise price of $3.06 per share. The company plans to allocate part of the net proceeds toward repaying a portion of its outstanding promissory notes, with the remainder designated for general corporate purposes.\n“We are pleased to have successfully closed the Initial Private Placement as part of this larger Private Placement financing, which represents an important first step in executing our new Bitcoin reserve strategy,” said Fried. “This initial capital infusion demonstrates investor confidence in our vision, and we look forward to securing shareholder approval for the full $180 million Private Placement. With this support, we intend to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve aimed [at enhancing] long-term shareholder value and position the Company for a new era of financial strength and innovation.”\nWhat About ZOOZ’s Core Business?\nAfter exploring ZOOZ’s Bitcoin treasury ambitions, let’s shift our attention to the part of the business that currently generates its revenue. The company last released its financial results on March 6. Given the company’s market cap, it’s reasonable not to expect substantial revenue or profitability. That said, its revenue grew 36% year-over-year to $1.04 million in 2024, driven by sales of ZOOZTER-100 systems. The company’s full-year net loss stood at $11 million, or $1.09 per basic and diluted share, compared with $11.8 million, or $1.99 per share, in the prior year. As of Dec. 31, 2024, ZOOZ held roughly $7.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term deposits.\nA single analyst covering the company expects its net loss to narrow by 11.93% year-over-year to $0.96 per share in fiscal 2025, while projecting a 23.15% decline in revenue to $0.8 million. Notably, the company is projected to post its first annual profit in fiscal 2029.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for ZOOZ Stock?\nZOOZ stock has light analyst coverage on Wall Street, with just two analysts following the company and assigning it a consensus rating of “Moderate Buy.” One analyst has a “Strong Buy” rating on the stock, while the other recommends a “Hold.” Meanwhile, ZOOZ’s average price target of $5.00 suggests upside potential of roughly 200% from current levels.\nThe Bottom Line on ZOOZ Stock\nPutting it all together, I believe investors should avoid buying ZOOZ stock for two primary reasons.\nFirst of all, there’s no real need to reinvent the wheel, as investors already have numerous ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin — whether by purchasing MicroStrategy shares or buying Bitcoin directly on any crypto exchange.\nSecondly, I am somewhat skeptical about the company’s Bitcoin treasury plans. Let me explain this point in more depth. Given its small market cap, the stock could experience substantial volatility in response to BTC price movements, potentially rising or falling at much greater rates than BTC itself. Moreover, management views bitcoin as “digital gold” and anticipates “long-term, asymmetric upside.” However, Bitcoin’s price action doesn’t exactly support this thesis, as any shift in global markets toward a risk-off sentiment almost always triggers a sharp decline in its value. This implies a significant risk for the company, as any substantial drop or prolonged pullback in Bitcoin’s price could drive ZOOZ’s stock below $1, potentially resulting in a Nasdaq delisting.\nWith that, the risk-reward profile here is far from attractive, and as noted earlier, purchasing MSTR stock or Bitcoin directly appears to be a much smarter move.\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Welcome to another edition of The China Connection.\nThis week, I look at how the World Robot Conference put China's ambitions for humanoid robots on full display, even as engineers and investors acknowledge that integrating them into everyday life is still a distant prospect.\nThis report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\nThe big story\nAt the World Robot Conference in Beijing, which concluded Tuesday, the mood was a blend of optimism and caution: Businesses showed off increasingly lifelike humanoid robots even as they conceded that technological gaps keeping these machines from mainstream usage remain wide.\nThousands turned up to watch humanoid robots to perform an array of unusual feats: from clumsily serving popcorn and drinks, spinning handkerchiefs, sparring in a boxing ring to playing chess and showcasing football skills.\nBut none of these feats amounted to a technological breakthrough. While there have been improvements in design, maneuverability and appearance, the androids still struggle to process and respond to their surroundings, a limitation that keeps them from most real-life workplace roles.\nSo far, their commercial use is mostly confined to guiding visitors at exhibition halls, shopping malls and, more recently, testing at factories for repetitive tasks like sorting materials and performing quality checks.\n\"When will humanoid robots be able to do 80% of the physical work that human can do? That's decades away,\" said Jay Huang, managing director and head of Asia industrial technologies sector at Bernstein.\n\"But what we will see is these individual tasks, like material handling, being multiplied into a much bigger scale. They can be used in very different format, different settings,\" Huang added.\nSome tasks like using a robot to make a bed are still in the \"very early\" stage, with low success rate, Huang said, \"but that's the right direction to push the industry forward.\"\nTake PsiBot's mahjong-playing droid displayed at the event: It still misidentifies tiles, often confuses the game's rules and plays at a relatively slow pace, according to local media reports.\nThe technological bottleneck for large-scale integration of humanoids into daily life stems from a lack of cutting-edge AI models and insufficient training data, said Bob Chen, economist at Shanghai-based FG Venture. The venture-capital firm has invested in robotics startups including Hangzhou-based DEEP Robotics that makes quadruped-robots — machines that mimic movements of four-legged creatures.\nAndroids rely on vast troves of motion-capture, visual, tactile and audio data, along with simulations, to build the sensory and behavioral maps they need to navigate and interact in the real world.\n\"Large language models have rather narrow function: language in, language out. But robots require far more complex, multimodal inputs, and their outputs are not words but actions and behaviors,\" said Chen, according to CNBC's translation of his comments in Mandarin.\nSeveral startups in China have invested in building \"data factories,\" hiring people to operate robots or wearables to capture machine-interaction data to train bots.\nRace for adoption\nHumanoid robots are emerging as another front in China's tech rivalry with the U.S.— where they could prevail with cheaper prices and faster deployment.\n\"China, the U.S. and other countries are playing on a quite leveled playing field,\" Huang said. \"Just like in electric vehicles, autonomous driving, in humanoid robots, China acts extremely fast in product and use-case multiplication, while U.S. players seem to shoot for the holy-grail solution.\"\nIn robot manufacturing, Tesla's humanoid project Optimus appears to be leading in the U.S., with CEO Elon Musk saying the company plans to produce about 5,000 units this year.\nWhile Musk's ambitious plans could give it a leg up on other American competitors that have yet to hit the mass market, Chinese companies have been racing to make their models more affordable.\nThey are also believed to have been undercutting global peers in terms of price, thanks to superior cost controls. That's despite the real-world applications of robots remaining uncertain.\nIn the lead up to the WRC, Unitree rolled out its third version of R1 model, priced at 39,900 yuan ($5,249) on e-commerce site JD.com, significantly cheaper than the its other models. The company's H1 model was sold for 650,000 yuan per unit and G1 robot for 99,000 yuan.\nAt the conference, prices for a humanoid robot ranged from tens of thousands of yuan to over 100,000 yuan, and the high-end models capable of more complex tasks were priced above 500,000 yuan.\nUniX AI touted its entry-level humanoid droids at just 88,000 yuan each. Shenzhen-based Engine AI has announced plans for a rival model starting at 38,500 yuan.\nSome U.S. companies such as Apptronik could see their attempt to rival Chinese humanoid robots be further undercut by U.S. tariffs as they still rely on some components from China.\nChina already has an edge in integrating machinery into factory workflows and, in many cases, is outpacing rivals in marrying artificial intelligence with robotics, said Arthur Kroeber, founding partner of China-focused economic research firm Gavekal Dragonomics.\nKroeber predicts that within two to four years, Chinese factories will achieve major efficiency gains across industries by combining top-tier industrial robots with AI systems that make them far more effective in varied settings.\nSome of UBTech Robotics' humanlike droids have been deployed at factories of carmakers BYD and Geely, at electronics manufacturer Foxconn and logistics giant SF Delivery, Chinese state media reported in April.\nHowever, during trainings, humanoid robots moved slowly, operating at just 20% of human efficiency, the report pointed out.\n\"Enabling humanoid robots to map their moving routes, speed up movements and operate for long periods of time in uncomfortable temperature environments still requires vast amounts of data,\" it said.\nWhile widespread deployment of humanoid robots that enhance productivity might still be a distant prospect, Chinese companies are pushing ahead as their tech race with the U.S. heats up.\nTop TV picks on CNBC\nJeff Moon, founder and president of China Moon Strategies and former assistant U.S. trade representative for China, said the U.S. and China's overtures are well-choreographed and happening in a planned sequence, but they won't solve many of the underlying problems between the two countries.\nGraham Allison, Harvard professor and former assistant secretary of defense, said he expects a \"grand rapprochement\" or friendship between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, especially as Trump needs a strong economy heading into the midterm elections.\nHao Hong, managing partner and CIO of Lotus Asset Management, said traders and fund managers are not very concerned about weakening fundamentals in the Chinese markets as long as liquidity remains strong.\nNeed to know\nU.S. and China secured a truce extension. The two countries agreed to delay by another 90 days the higher tariffs, imposed in April, on each other's goods.\nBeijing discouraging companies from using Nvidia chips. Chinese officials have asked companies to explain why they need to buy Nvidia chips instead of ones from domestic suppliers, according to a Reuters report.\nTrump says open to Nvidia selling downgraded version of advanced chip to China. Trump indicated that he will meet with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang regarding the company's high-end Blackwell chip. Huang has said he hopes to sell more advanced chips to China.\nIn the markets\nChina and Hong Kong stocks rose as Asian markets tracked gains on Wall Street after the latest U.S. inflation data raised expectations that the Federal Reserve could cut interest rates next month.\nMainland China's CSI 300 added 0.74%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes major Chinese companies — had gained 2.2% as of 2:22 p.m. local time (2:22 a.m. ET). The mainland benchmark is up over 6% year to date, data from LSEG showed.\nThe Hang Seng Tech index, which tracks the some of the largest mainland Chinese technology companies listed in Hong Kong, rose over 2%, lifted by Tencent Music Entertainment, which surged over 14%, a day after the company beat estimates for second-quarter revenue and profit.\nChina's 10-year government bond yield currently stands at 1.723%.\n— Lee Ying Shan\nComing up\nAug 14: NetEase, JD.com June-quarter earnings\nAug 14-17: World Humanoid Robot Games\nAug 15: Urban investment, industrial output and retail sales, urban unemployment rate, house prices for July\nAug 19: Xiaomi, Xpeng June-quarter earnings","content_hash":"cfd327da13fbcddee5476ade48e1f989","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8951,"method_rank":0}

Now, Asia is leading a reinvention—building a blockchain ecosystem that doesn’t just trade coins, but tokenizes roads, solar farms, and financial instruments. It’s a shift from roulette wheels to regulated rails, from speculation to scaffolding.\nThe first uses of the blockchain were purely virtual: cryptocurrencies and NFTs that reflected digital assets with no real-world counterpart. Yet the next wave of financial innovators are trying to make blockchain work in the “real world” by tokenizing real-world assets like artwork, real estate—and, if two small Asia-based financial startups have their way, clean energy.\nIf predictions hold true, real-world assets on the blockchain can be a lucrative opportunity: Standard Chartered believes the market could be worth $30.1 trillion within the next decade.\nAmber Premium, a Singapore-based institutional crypto services provider, and Evolve, a tokenized infrastructure company specializing in renewable energy, are tiny by global standards: Amber’s market capitalization hovers around $600 million, while Evolve manages a relatively small asset base.\nUnlike crypto giants such as Binance or Coinbase, Amber and Evolve are niche, but their focus on tokenizing real-world infrastructure is an example of how Asia is transforming the realm of digital finance.\nWhat connects both Amber and Evolve are tokens: the conversion of real-world assets into digital tokens onto a blockchain. In principle, this offers institutions a compelling alternative to legacy investment structures. Rather than have layers of financial intermediaries, investors have direct, auditable ownership through the blockchain. Users can then divide and trade these tokens however they wish, and set up smart contracts to automate yield distribution.\nThese tokens represent tangible physical or financial assets—solar arrays, government bonds, EV fleets—bringing real yield, lower volatility, and legal transparency to crypto markets, Evolve’s tokens are linked to solar farms and battery networks, seamlessly bridging the gap between industrial infrastructure and digital finance.\nAmber Premium, led by CEO Wayne Huo—a former Morgan Stanley trader—recently merged with iClick, securing a Nasdaq listing and establishing itself as a fully regulated institutional crypto player. Amber’s regulatory framework spans multiple jurisdictions: Its Singapore arm (formerly Sparrow Tech) operates under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), while other subsidiaries hold licenses adapted to local Asian markets. The firm invests heavily in compliance infrastructure, aiming to meet the expectations of institutional clients and regulators alike.\nAmber’s Nasdaq listing established the company as a U.S.-listed institutional gateway into “Web3”—shorthand for an internet built on decentralized blockchain technologies. Huo took over as CEO, giving the company a bridge to traditional finance.\nAmber Premium’s clientele is distinctly institutional. As of Q1 2025, the platform counted roughly 928 active clients—an increase from 891 the previous year—which collectively held $1.275 billion in assets under management. These clients span regional banks, family offices, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries across Asia, the Middle East, and North America. A significant share of Amber Premium’s clients are looking for exposure to digital assets amid uncertainty around Asia’s treatment of cryptocurrency.\nAmber is still a tiny company, generating just $14.94 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, up from $1 million a year prior. Amber Premium has yet to turn a profit, instead prioritizing infrastructure, licensing, and regulatory compliance over short-term earnings.\nRevenue has tracked the ups and downs of the crypto market: The affiliated Amber Group generated just $33 million in revenue in 2024, down from $308 million in 2021, the height of the COVID-era crypto boom.\nAmber Premium’s shares have lost half their value since the listing, falling from a peak of around $12.80 in March to around $6.50 today. Analysts blame low awareness, thin trading volume, and skepticism about the viability of crypto-finance hybrids after FTX’s spectacular collapse in 2022.\nEvolve, founded by Maverick Hui, a pioneer of Canadian crypto ETFs and early digital asset regulation, is turning renewable energy infrastructure like battery-swapping stations, solar farms, and EV-charging networks into digital tokens that deliver proportional returns to investors. Several of its ETF offerings, including those tied to Bitcoin and Solana, have received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission. The company partners with U.S.-licensed custodians like Coinbase Custody Trust for cross-border holdings.\nHui, from Evolve, is focusing on yield-generating clean-energy assets, particularly through e-scooter and battery station manufacturer Mile Green. In early 2025, Mile Green secured $50 million from CMAG Funds, a Singapore-based private investment firm, to expand battery-swapping and EV-charging infrastructure across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.\n(Fortune’s parent company holds a minority stake in CMAG Funds. Chatchaval Jiaravanon, Fortune’s owner, is also an investor in Amber, Mile Green, and Evolve. Chatchaval recently took part in a $25.5 million private placement in Amber.)\nMile Green is Evolve’s infrastructure partner: Mile Green develops the clean energy assets, which Evolve converts into investment-grade digital tokens. Investors can now track performance through these tokens rather than company filings.\nAsia is taking the lead in tokenized finance, thanks to clearer regulatory frameworks, innovation sandboxes, and startups that are eager to experiment. Even mainland China, which bans most cryptocurrency trading and mining, is experimenting with enterprise blockchain through its state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) and central bank digital currency, the e-CNY.\nThe financial hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore are among Asia’s most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Yet regulators in both cities are still cautious about cryptocurrency. Tokenized products still face strict limitations, retail access is tightly controlled, and approval processes can be unpredictable. One major constraint is the difficulty of transferring tokenized assets between wallets. As a result, wallet-to-wallet transfers are often restricted or require complex approvals, limiting broader adoption.\nChanging winds in Washington are also buoying Asia-based crypto platforms. The second Trump administration is taking a decidedly more pro-crypto stance. In January, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting responsible blockchain growth. He paused enforcement actions against crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, and Trump’s SEC then launched a “Crypto 2.0” task force to clarify rules on crypto, moving away from the preceding Biden administration’s more skeptical stance.\nIn March, the White House announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, naming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano as national digital assets. Then, in August, new rules opened 401(k) retirement plans to crypto, private equity, and real estate—unlocking trillions in potential institutional capital.\nThe administration also backed the GENIUS Act, which clarifies rules for stablecoins. Together, these moves are ushering in what the crypto industry hopes will be a more friendly, legally stable foundation for growth.\nThese shifts benefit both Amber and Evolve. Amber, as a Nasdaq-listed company, gains regulatory legitimacy and improved U.S. market access. Evolve’s yield-bearing, tokenized infrastructure may soon appeal to pension funds and fiduciary investors seeking new types of assets.\nAs the U.S. softens its stance and Asia doubles down on digital finance, companies like Amber Premium and Evolve are quietly building the financial plumbing for the next phase of blockchain adoption—and getting the real world on the blockchain.\nThere’s still a long way to go. Liquidity remains thin, valuation remains depressed, and the sector remains vulnerable to global regulatory swings. Then there’s the ownership question: How do you ensure a digital token on the blockchain grants a clear and enforceable claim on the real-world asset in question?\nTokenized finance may still be in its early innings—but the infrastructure is maturing. Asia didn’t invent blockchain. But it may be where blockchain becomes real.\nCorrection, August 14, 2025: A previous version of this article misstated details about Amber Premium, including its headquarters and its revenue.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","content_hash":"654c53a74fee9e87aba7b8b42a0812c6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8798,"method_rank":0}

The data do not include sales by South Korea’s low-volume commercial vehicle manufacturers including Tata-Daewoo and Edison Motors, while import brands are covered in a separate report later in the month.\nThe domestic vehicle market last month continued to be supported by the recent rollout of new products, particularly by the country’s largest automakers Hyundai and Kia. Overall vehicle demand in the country remains sluggish, however, due to high household debt and weak consumer sentiment. The country’s GDP expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter, according to preliminary government data, after shrinking by 0.2% in the first quarter, helped by a further 25 basis point interest rate cut to 2.50% in May – the fourth cut in the last year from a peak of 3.50%.\nIn the first seven months of the year the country’s five main domestic vehicle manufacturers reported a 2.5% increase in domestic sales to 799,353 units combined, up from 779,516 units in the same period last year. Hyundai reported a 2.3% rise to 411,127 units, while Kia’s sales increased just slightly to 321,440 units. GM Korea was the worst performer, with sales plunging by 40% to 9,347 units, while KG Mobility reported a 19% drop to 22,777 units. Renault Korea was the best performing brand, with domestic sales surging by 153% to 32,065 units following the recent launch of the Geely-based Grand Koleos Hybrid SUV.\nGlobal sales by the country’s “big-five” automakers, including vehicles produced overseas, increased by less than 1% to 4,650,796 units in the first seven months of 2025 from 4,619,077 units a year earlier – with overseas sales also up slightly to 3,851,443 from 3,837,223 units.\nHyundai Motor’s global sales rose by just 0.5% to 334,794 vehicles in July 2025 from 333,294 a year earlier, with domestic and overseas sales both slightly higher. In the first seven months of the year the company sold a total of 2,401,786 vehicles, slightly higher than the 2,397,138 units sold in the same period last year.\nDomestic sales rose by 0.4% to 56,227 units last month from 56,009 a year earlier, resulting in a 2.3% increase to 411,127 units in the first seven months of the year from 401,713 previously. Overseas sales increased by 0.5% to 278,567 units in July from 277,285 units a year earlier, while year-to-date volumes were down slightly to 1,990,092 from 1,995,695 units, underpinned by strong sales in North America.\nThe company’s new EV plant in the US state of Georgia became operational last October, producing the Ioniq 5, followed by the Ioniq 9 earlier this year. A Kia model is also set to go into production in 2026. The automaker said it will expand capacity at the plant to 500,000 units per year later in the decade from 300,000 at present.\nEarlier this year Hyundai set a target of 4,174,000 global vehicle sales for 2025, including its Genesis luxury brand, representing a slight increase over 2024 volumes. This includes 710,000 domestic sales and 3,464,000 overseas sales. In response to the recent US import duty hikes and rising international competition, the automaker said it will “continue to respond flexibly to customer demand and implement optimal sales strategies, including production optimization for high-demand models and making improvements for other key models.\"\nKia’s global sales increased just slightly to 262,705 vehicles in July from 261,798 a year earlier, supported by recently-launched battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hybrid models, and strong demand for core SUV models such as the Sportage and Seltos, with 46,901 and 28,538 deliveries respectively, and the Sorento with 17,852 units. In the first seven months of the year, Kia’s global sales rose by 1.8% to 1,850,241 units from 1,817,495 a year earlier.\nDomestic sales declined by 2.2% to 45,017 units last month from 46,010 units a year earlier, with the Carnival MPV being its best-selling model with 7,211 domestic deliveries, followed by the Sorento with 7,053 sales and the Sportage with 5,424 units. Domestic sales in the first seven months of the year increased slightly to 321,440 units from 321,250 a year earlier. The company sold a further 2,597 special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in this period, down from 2,655 a year earlier, most of which were military vehicles delivered domestically.\nOverseas sales rose by 1% to 217,188 units in July from 215,188 a year earlier, but were up by over 2% to 1,526,204 units year-to-date from 1,493,590 units, driven by an 8% rise in US sales to 487,634units. The Sportage was the brand’s best-selling model overseas last month with 41,477 deliveries, followed by the Seltos with 23,617 units.\nKia is targeting a 4% increase in global sales to 3,216,200 units in 2025, including 550,000 domestic sales, 2,658,000 overseas sales and 8,200 SPV sales, supported by the recent launch of the new K4 and revamped K5 sedans and the Syros SUV in India. In the first quarter of the year the company rolled out its new Tasman pickup truck and the EV4 battery-powered sedan, to be followed by the PV5 and EV5 models later this year. The company’s medium-term plan is to sell 4.3 million vehicles globally by 2030, including 1.6 million BEVs.\nGM Korea’s global sales rose by 23% to 32,244 units in July from 22,564 units a year earlier, reflecting sharply higher overseas sales, while in the first seven months of the year volumes dropped by 3.6% to 281,599 from 291,986 units. The Trailblazer SUV and Trax crossover vehicle remain by far the company’s best-selling models, with most output shipped overseas.\nDomestic sales continued to plunge last month, by 44% to 1,226 units from 2,199 units a year earlier, while year-to-date sales were down by 40 % to 9,347 units from 15,656 units - as the automaker struggled with rising competition from other domestic manufacturers and from importers.\nExports surged by 52% to 31,018 units in July from 20,412 a year earlier, but we down by 1.4% to 272,252 units year-to-date from 276,377 units. Around 85% of output was shipped to the US last year, making the company particularly vulnerable to US import tariff hikes.\nKG Mobility (KGM) reported a 16% increase in global sales to 9,620 vehicles in July from 8,313 units a year earlier, driven by strong domestic sales which more than offset a sharp decline in exports. Total sales in the first seven months of the year were still 3% lower at 62,892 units, compared with 64,878 a year earlier. The company, previously known as Ssangyong Motor, was acquired in late 2022 by a consortium led by local steel and chemicals firm KG Group.\nDomestic sales rose by 5% to 4,456 units last month from 4,237 a year earlier, helped by the recently launched Actyon Hybrid, but were still down by 19% at 22,777 units year-to-date from 28,215 units, as the automaker struggled to keep up with rising competition from other domestic manufacturers and from importers.\nOverseas sales increased by 27% to 5,164 in July from 4,076 a year earlier, helped by strong deliveries of its Torres EVX in Turkey. This resulted in a 9% rise to 40,115 units year-to-date from 36,663 units a year earlier, as the company continued to expand its global market coverage.\nKGM plans to further expand its zero-emissions vehicle range, following the launch of a new minivan version of the Torres EVX battery-powered SUV last September. Earlier this year the company launched the new battery-powered Musso EV pickup truck.\n\"South Korea report: domestic sales rise 1% in July\" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\nThe dispatch\nAfter several years in the Big Apple, I knew my return to London would be a culture shock.\nInstead of Times Square with its skyscrapers and blinding lights, I would roam around Piccadilly Circus and its Victorian buildings; Dunkin Donuts on every major intersection would be replaced by Greggs on street corners, and I'd be ordering a sausage roll instead of a bagel for lunch.\nBut beyond the trivial switch-ups, I was in for a bigger shock than I thought — on the economic front.\nFirstly, the cost of living, from rent and utilities to public transport, has risen significantly.\nA return train ticket from London to my family home in Norwich is now over 30% higher – costing a whopping £72, compared to the £54 it used to cost me 8 years ago.\nIt should perhaps not have been such a shock; the U.S. has, after all, experienced markedly lower inflation than the U.K. over recent years.\nMore recently, prices in the U.K. rose 3.6% in the year to June 2025, compared to a 2.7% increase in the U.S. The Bank of England now expects inflation to peak at 4% in September, only returning to its 2% target by mid-2027.\nWhen I moved to New York, it was a year and a half after the Brexit referendum. All these years later, and Brexit continues to dominate discussions.\nIn conversations with CEOs and business leaders, I hear how Brexit still hamstrings the economy, particularly through trade barriers, increased border costs and reduced productivity compared to staying in the European Union.\nEqually concerning is that London's reputation as a leading global financial center is increasingly in question, as it struggles to compete with the likes of New York, Hong Kong and Frankfurt.\nFundraising from initial public offerings in London, meanwhile, has tumbled to its lowest level in at least 30 years, according to data from Dealogic, in a sign the U.K.'s equity markets are losing their attractiveness.\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey told me last week that business uncertainty in the country remains very high, after I asked him about the effectiveness of interest rate cuts by the central bank.\n\"There is a much higher level of uncertainty and given that many investment decisions are irreversible once we take them, the value of waiting therefore goes up, and that is what is happening,\" he said.\nAnother hot topic in London over recent months has been changes to the so-called non-dom tax rules for wealthy foreigners.\nLondon's property market has been particularly impacted by the uncertainty, according to property website RightMove, which cited confusion around the rules as one reason behind reduced demand from buyers — both domestic and foreign — in the capital's housing market, as house asking prices fall.\nReviving London as a financial hub\nDespite the challenges and setbacks, all is not lost. Business leaders tell me there is still hope and opportunity for London.\nWhile there are upside risks to inflation, the Bank of England cut interest rates this month. The bank's monetary policy committee cited progress in disinflation in underlying domestic prices over the past couple of years, as core CPI and services inflation remain flat, while highlighting the reduction in wage growth.\nLower interest rates could help to spur consumption and investment, as well as help to get the property market back on track. More affordable mortgages may ultimately allow for more parity between buyers and sellers in the second half of the year.\nWhen it comes to Brexit, business investment in the U.K. stalled after the vote to leave the bloc in 2016. However, there have been some signs of recovery, with a focus on specific sectors like technology and pharmaceuticals. The U.K. has been seeking new trade deals outside of the EU, including with Australia, New Zealand and India — and of course, the U.S.\nIn fact, Britain's trade deal with President Donald Trump — although worse than during his first term — is still better than the EU's agreement with the U.S.\nLondon-based chartered accountants and business advisors Lubbock Fine noted that the U.K.'s substantial tariff advantage could benefit the country as a manufacturing hub for EU companies, seeing them relocate to the U.K.\nYet, when it comes to rebuilding London's reputation as a powerhouse in financial services, there is more work to be done.\nCrucially, it will entail policymakers creating an environment that is conducive to doing business.\nIn my recent conversation with Antony Jenkins, former Barclays CEO, he highlighted the need to drive access to capital for start-ups and minimize the cost of doing business.\nHe was positive on the reforms that are being made to encourage more investment into the private sector and is interested in retargeting the R&D tax credit toward higher-growth businesses. But ultimately, Jenkins says there needs to be a bigger focus on growth policies to boost GDP per capita and attract entrepreneurial talent.\n\"Let's face it, there's many attractive things about the U.K. We have market leadership around the world in things like financial services, technology, AI, the creative industries, and the U.K. is a great place to live, so we have all these strengths,\" he said.\n\"What we need to do is amp up the other things that will make this place more attractive for business.\"\n— Ritika Gupta\nTop TV picks on CNBC\nAndrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, discusses the central bank's interest rate cut, inflation and the uncertainty surrounding future decisions on monetary policy.\nCNBC's Ritika takes a look at the capital's housing market.\nEngland Lionesses and Gotham FC's Jess Carter tells CNBC's Tania Bryer that social platforms \"need to do better\" to protect people online.\n— Holly Ellyatt\nNeed to know\nElon Musk's Tesla launches bid to supply electricity to British households. The Texas-based company formally submitted its request for an electricity license to the British energy regulator Ofgem at the end of last month.\nThe government won't admit it, but tax rises are coming — and there are no good options. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about suggestions that tax rises would be necessary in autumn, but said he did \"not recognise\" the figures. Nonetheless, he declined to rule out hiking VAT, income tax and corporation tax.\nBank of England chief says no rift with UK government as Revolut licence delay draws scrutiny. Authorizing Revolut as a fully licensed bank has become an important issue for the U.K. government, particularly as key figures in the tech industry have challenged tax changes that affect the wealthy.\n— Holly Ellyatt\nIn the markets\nThe U.K's FTSE 100 has had a muted week, slipping 0.1% over the past 7 days to end Tuesday at 9,147.81.\nAfter a jump in July (when it rose over 4%), the index seems to have put its feet up in August — much like many traders — following the uncertainty and accompanying market volatility surrounding Trump's tariffs regime.\nSterling, meanwhile, has risen against the dollar over the past week. It was trading over 0.6% higher at $1.3517 late Tuesday after U.K. jobs data — which showed a cooling of the U.K. jobs market, but strong wage growth — and U.S. inflation figures, which sent the dollar lower.\nU.K. government bond yields have also ticked higher, with the 10-year yield trading around 4.626% on Tuesday.\n— Katrina Bishop\nComing Up\nAug. 14: U.K. second-quarter GDP; trade balance data for June; RICS house prices for July\nAug. 20: U.K. inflation data for July; retail price index for July\n— Holly Ellyatt","content_hash":"d3eb2f000f6995c7595a41f64e13287d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7627,"method_rank":0}

The CPI rose 0.2% month on month in July. It was 2.7% year on year, the same level as the month before. Core inflation edged up to 3.1%, however, keeping it above the Fed’s 2% target. Flatter headline inflation and falling energy prices bolstered expectations for a September rate cut, though analysts warned that sticky service costs and potential tariff impacts could limit further easing in 2025. Markets rallied on the data, but Fed officials are likely to remain focused on upcoming jobs reports before committing to additional cuts.\nJuly’s inflation report went about as well as the Fed (and the White House) could have hoped for.\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) summary released Tuesday reported inflation notched up 0.2% in July, that’s down compared with the 0.3% increase in June. Over the past 12 months, this brings the headline inflation rate to 2.7%—admittedly still comfortably ahead of the Federal Reserve’s 2% target but the same level as it was in June.\nShelter was the primary factor for the overall rise, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said, rising 0.2% in July. Meanwhile, key categories such as the food index were largely unchanged, with food at home falling 0.1% and food away from home rising 0.3%. Elsewhere, the energy index fell 1.1% while gasoline costs were also reduced by 2.2%.\nSupporters of Trump 2.0 will use the relatively flat report as ammunition to urge Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut the base interest rate, arguing that tariffs are not (yet) proving as inflationary as many economists previously feared.\nIndeed, President Trump wrote on Truth Social moments after the data was released: “Jerome ‘Too Late’ Powell must NOW lower the rate. Steve ‘Manouychin’ really gave me a ‘beauty’ when he pushed this loser. The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we’ve blown through Powell and the complacent board.”\nWhen the White House announced its tariff regime, particularly following its “Liberation Day” announcements in April, analysts and investors feared the significant added costs to global trade would be passed to American consumers. Surveys indicate that this is the intention of the majority of businesses: to pass the increased levies on to the public, thus pushing up inflation.\nBut with various agreements with key partners now made, and delays with the likes of China to boot, economists are now beginning to wonder when (or if) the sharpest end of the tariff agenda will be felt.\nThe report is likely to have eased some of the friction members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) were readying themselves for. For many months, the FOMC had been warning it was mindful of the two sides of its mandate when making decisions about the base rate.\nThose two sides are maximizing employment and keeping inflation to 2%. With a shocking and negative update on the labor market from earlier this month, a spiking inflation report for July would have put those two factors at even greater odds.\nAs it is, many analysts are seeing the inflation report as another tick in the box for a cut at the FOMC’s next meeting in September. After all, they believe it means Powell and the FOMC can breathe easier about tariffs and give the economy and employment market a boost by lowering interest.\nAt the opening bell, investors certainly seemed to think so: The S&P 500 was up 0.65%, the Dow Jones 0.6%, and the Nasdaq 0.76%.\nHowever, while headline inflation stayed below 3%, core inflation (excluding the often volatile food and energy categories) rose to 3.1% over the past 12 months.\nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, wrote in a note seen by Fortune that July inflation data isn’t hot enough to “derail the Fed from cutting rates in September. There is some sign of tariff pass-through to consumer prices, but at this stage, it is not significant enough to ring alarm bells.”\nBut Shah added that further cuts in 2025 are not a foregone conclusion: “The concern for the Fed is that, with inventory run down, the tariff-induced boost to inflation is likely to grow over the coming months, meaning that inflationary pressures are likely to pick up just as the Fed starts to resume rate cuts. Markets like today’s inflation print, as it means the Fed can lower rates unheeded next month; rate cut decisions in October, December, and beyond may well be more complicated.”\nWhile Powell has been fending off criticism from the White House, analysts are warning against baking in further and significant cuts for the remainder of the year.\nThe FOMC has its next meeting in September, followed by two more in October and December, and one member, Michelle Bowman, has already confirmed she would be open to such a trajectory.\nIndeed, UBS’s Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO for the Americas and global head of equities, wrote in a note to clients: “With overall inflation likely under control amid a slowing economy, our base case remains that the Fed will resume rate cuts at the September meeting and continue cutting for a total of 100 bps.”\nAnd CME’s FedWatch shows more than 94% of the market expect a cut at the next meeting.\nYet analysts are wary of being overly confident about the next meeting. Elyse Ausenbaugh, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management, wrote in a note to clients that she was still expecting a 0.5% cut in rates by the end of the year, but is proceeding with caution: “It seems fair to say that the Fed could be considering a move in September, but I don’t think a cut at that meeting is as much of a given as market pricing is implying. We will get plenty of data between now and then that could give the Fed pause one more time before taking action in the fourth quarter.”\nMichael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to Fortune that the details of the CPI report don’t even guarantee a September cut.\n“The larger rise in core prices in July provides mixed evidence around the tariff boost to inflation. For the Federal Reserve, inflation is much further from its target than the unemployment rate, which is why we expect them to hold off rate cuts another few months. However, another weak set of jobs data in August would force their hand early,” Pearce wrote. “Core inflation edged up to 3.0% in July, and we expect it will rise further to a peak of 3.8% by the end of the year as tariffs bleed through more fully to consumer prices.\n“In our view, the upside risks to inflation will keep the majority of the FOMC preferring to sit on the sidelines for a few more months. The large downward revisions included in the July employment report heightened concerns around the labor market, and another weak report in August could tip the odds in favor of a September rate cut.”\nPearce was echoed by Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, who said the Fed is now less likely to cut because the inflationary factors in the July report came from sticky service prices as opposed to tariff-related goods. Adams said: “Jobs data scheduled for release in early September will have more sway over the Fed’s next decision than this inflation report.”\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com","content_hash":"d42bacf0810ff92700f1d2a3bcc45238","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7357,"method_rank":0}

Meanwhile, the short end of the Treasury curve is doing even better with a -4.2 bp decline to 3.689% in the 2-year T-note yield today, adding to Tuesday's -3.8 bp decline.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent today said that interest rates are \"too constrictive\" and that rates \"should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower.\" He added, \"There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September.\" The Fed is currently targeting the federal funds rate in the range of 4.25%-4.50% and the effective rate is currently at 4.33%.\nThe markets have started to think about the chances for a -50 basis point rate cut in September, based on Monday's largely benign CPI report and the fact that the US labor market is slowing, with average monthly payroll growth in May-July of only +35,000. On a year-on-year basis, Tuesday's July headline CPI of +2.7% y\/y was slightly weaker than expected, but the core CPI of +3.1% y\/y was slightly stronger than expected.\nThe federal funds futures market today boosted the odds to 100% for a -25 bp rate cut in September and a slight 1% chance of a -50 bp rate cut. The market late Tuesday was discounting the odds of a -25 bp rate cut in September at 96%, up from 40% before the July payroll report released on August 1. The federal funds futures market is currently discounting an overall -63 bp rate cut by the end of this year to 3.70%, and an overall -133 bp rate cut to 3.00% by the end of 2026.\nThe markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump on Monday downplayed expectations of a breakthrough, saying the summit is a \"feel-out meeting\" to end the war in Ukraine. Also, recent comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump early Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. Last Wednesday, Mr. Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nThe market's focus this week is on corporate earnings results and any new trade or tariff news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to fall by -1,000 to 225,000. Also on Thursday, the July final-demand PPI is expected to increase to +2.5% y\/y from +2.3% y\/y in June, and the July PPI ex-food and energy is expected to rise to +2.9% y\/y from +2.6% y\/y in June. On Friday, July US retail sales are expected to climb +0.5% m\/m and retail sales ex-autos are expected to rise +0.3% m\/m. Also on Friday, July manufacturing production is expected to remain unchanged m\/m. Finally, the University of Michigan's Aug US consumer sentiment index is expected to climb by +0.3 to 62.0.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 100% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and at 70% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 82% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.86%. China's Shanghai Composite today rallied to a 3.75-year high and closed up +0.48%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 today closed up +1.30% and posted a new record high.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) are up +10 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -4.1 bp at 4.248%. T-note prices are higher as expectations strengthen for interest rate cuts through year-end. T-note prices have underlying support from Tuesday's CPI report, which was largely in line with market expectations and did not contain any nasty surprises. The 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate today is little changed at 2.387%, following Tuesday's -1.3 bp decline.\nEuropean government bond yields today are lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -4.9 bp at 2.695%. The 10-year UK gilt yield is down -2.0 bp at 4.606%.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 7% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nThe Magnificent Seven are all trading higher. Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) are leading the group with gains of more than +1%.\nChip stocks continue to show strength from expectations for interest rate cuts. AMD (AMD), Align Technologies (ALGN), and ON Semiconductors (ON) are all showing gains of +3% or more.\nHanesbrands (HBI) is up +7% today, adding to Tuesday's +28% rally that occurred after the Financial Times reported Canadian-based Gildan Activewear (GIL) will acquire Hanesbrands. The official acquisition announcement was made today, with an equity purchase amount of about $2.2 billion. Gildan is up +12% today after Tuesday's -3.7% loss.\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) shares are up about +1% on an upgrade by Deutsche Bank to buy from hold.\nC3.ai Inc (AI) is up about +1% despite a downgrade by Oppenheimer to market perform from outperform following the company's recent preliminary earnings results that were considered weak.\nKinderCare Learning (KLC) is down more than -20% after disappointing Q2 results, including weaker-than-expected enrollment numbers and a reduction in full-year guidance.\nEarnings Reports (8\/13\/2025)\nLoar Holdings Inc (LOAR), Performance Food Group Co (PFGC), StandardAero Inc (SARO), Coherent Corp (COHR), Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO).\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

That was in line with reporting yesterday by CNBC. The executive order postponed today's original deadline. That followed previous news that Nvidia and AMD agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues on sales of certain lower-powered AI chips sold to China in exchange for export licenses to allow those sales. However, Bloomberg reported today that China's government urged Chinese companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 processors, particularly for government-related purposes.\nThe markets are awaiting this Friday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska for any progress in ending the Russian-Ukrainian war.

Kevin OLeary sets the record straight on their worth","published_at":"2025-08-13T12:00:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n“Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary is known for his unfiltered takes on money and investing. And when it comes to a certain tangible asset — one he literally wears every day — he doesn’t hold back.\n“Is investing in a luxury watch a good investment, or a stupid flex?” he asked in a recent YouTube video, flashing two high-end timepieces — one on each wrist.\nWhile watches keep time, O’Leary explained, they also mark time — especially when purchased to commemorate life’s milestones. “Maybe you had a great deal, maybe you had a child, or you went to college, you graduated, whatever it is, you're always going to remember that event from your watch,” he said.\nIndeed, many people buy luxury watches to celebrate personal achievements — and O’Leary’s done that himself, many times. But he says there’s one golden rule to follow:\n“The real rule is — never borrow money to buy a watch, ever. Just buy a watch you can afford.”\nHe even offered starter recommendations: “Start with entry level products, great products like Grand Seiko or Tudor and then when something good happens, go nuts.”\nTo drive the “go nuts” point home, he brought both wrists closer to the camera. On one: a Rolex “Rainbow” Daytona, which can fetch more than $400,000 on the secondary market. On the other: a Patek Philippe Aquanaut Luce “Rainbow” — even more rare and even more expensive.\nTo be sure, while some watches have appreciated in value over the years, that’s far from guaranteed. Not every model or brand sees gains — and even those that do rarely go up in a straight line.\nAccording to the ChronoPulse Watch Index — a global price indicator for the secondary watch market from luxury marketplace Chrono24 — luxury watch prices surged in 2020 and 2021, but began falling after peaking in March 2022.\nFor example, ChronoPulse’s Rolex Index has dropped 19% from its March 2022 peak. The Patek Philippe Index — which saw an even more dramatic surge in early 2022 — is now down more than 40% since its peak.\nThe good news? Watches aren’t the only alternative assets investors can explore. If you’re interested in tangible investments, here are three coveted assets favored by the ultra-wealthy.\nGold\nWhen it comes to preserving wealth, few assets have a track record as long and storied as gold. For centuries, the yellow metal has served as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty, market volatility and inflation.\nUnlike watches, gold doesn’t depend on fashion trends or collector demand to retain value. It’s globally recognized, highly liquid and — unlike paper currency — can’t be printed at will by central banks.\nIn fact, central banks around the world have been stockpiling gold. Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, recently highlighted gold’s importance in a resilient portfolio.\n“People don't have, typically, an adequate amount of gold in their portfolio,” he told CNBC earlier this year. “When bad times come, gold is a very effective diversifier.”\nOver the past 12 months, gold prices have climbed by more than 35%.\nOne way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\nTo learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market? Gain potential quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire. Here’s how to get started with as little as $10\nReal estate\nFew tangible assets work harder for investors than real estate — especially when it comes to generating passive income. While property values can fluctuate — just like stocks — real estate doesn’t rely on a booming market to generate returns.\nEven in an economic downturn, high quality, essential properties keep generating passive income through rent. In other words, you don’t have to wait for prices to rise to see a payoff — the asset itself can work for you.\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett has often pointed to real estate as a prime example of a productive, income-generating asset.\nIn 2022, Buffett stated that if you offered him “1% of all the apartment houses in the country” for $25 billion, he would “write you a check.”\nOf course, you don’t need billions — or even to buy an entire property — to benefit from real estate investing. Crowdfunding platforms like Arrived offer an easier way to get exposure to this income-generating asset class.\nThe process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase and then sit back as you start receiving any positive rental income distributions from your investment.\nAnother option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.\nWith a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.\nSimply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.\nFine art\nIt’s easy to see why great works of art tend to appreciate over time. Supply is limited and many famous pieces have already been snatched up by museums and collectors. Art also has a low correlation with stocks and bonds, which helps with diversification.\nIn 2022, a collection of art owned by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen sold for $1.5 billion at Christie’s New York, making it the most valuable collection in auction history.\nInvesting in art was traditionally a privilege reserved for the ultra-wealthy.\nNow, that’s changed with Masterworks — a platform for investing in shares of blue-chip artwork by renowned artists, including Pablo Picasso, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Banksy. It’s easy to use and with 23 successful exits to date, every one of them has been profitable thus far.\nSimply browse their impressive portfolio of paintings and choose how many shares you’d like to buy. Masterworks will handle all the details, making high-end art investments both accessible and effortless.\nMasterworks has distributed roughly $61 million back to investors and new offerings have sold out in minutes, but you can skip their waitlist here.","content_hash":"5cb671a7f409b98e9b1882915f82f5c9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7111,"method_rank":0}

Subscribe to our free daily Wealthmanagement newsletter.\nWhen Shari Greco Reiches and her team finalized the deal to sell the $1.2 billion registered investment advisor she co-founded in 2005, they didn’t choose the highest offer, but she believes they chose the best one.\n“All of them were high, but some were a little higher,” she said of the buyers who bid for Rappaport Reiches Capital Management. “But this was my baby. I wasn’t going to go with a firm just because they were going to give 10% more—you want what’s best for your staff and your clients.”\nAfter more than 20 Zoom calls with prospective buyers, Reiches, her team and M&A advisory Republic Capital Group, who the firm hired for the deal process, narrowed the list down to four firms. From there, EP Wealth emerged as offering the right mix of full firm integration, additional services for clients and career paths for its 13 staff members and two founders, including Reiches and David Rappaport, who became partners and regional directors.\n“They weren’t even on our initial shortlist,” Reiches said of EP Wealth. “But you have to be open-minded. This was not retirement; it was the next chapter. So we wanted to know what our staff roles would be and what their comp would be—we didn’t want any surprises, and we wanted them to be happy.”\nThe sale of the Skokie, Ill.-based RIA was about a year in the making. It included taking a succession planning program held by Charles Schwab, interviewing multiple consultants and attorneys to find the right partners, and doing extensive due diligence on the final offers.\n“Everyone we interviewed was impressive,” Reiches said. “But just because they are a great firm doesn’t mean they are the right fit. ... You can’t be just focused on the numbers; you have to look at the full picture.”\nNot focusing on the numbers may be easier said than done for RIAs looking to sell. According to industry players, valuations are at record highs, and most predict continued frothiness barring a major market setback. That is also why, according to the experts, firms such as Reiches, which are looking to be acquired but also keep growing, need to consider every deal carefully and not just target the highest bid.\nValuations are coming in at 15x to as high as 22x earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, according to M&A experts. But often, those high multiples aren’t what advisors ultimately see at earn out, and the type of due diligence that Rieches and team underwent may point firms to lower bids in the hope of better long-term math.\nJessica Polito, founder and principal of Turkey Hill Management, said the multiples cited in the marketplace are “meaningless without context.” They are most often only achieved if a firm achieves very ambitious growth rates, she said.\n“Talk of those multiples is driving some of the unrealistic expectations in the market,” she said. “You can get into the high teens if you retain all of your revenue and then grow a lot over a two- or three-year time period, which just doesn’t happen much.”\nShe said sellers should focus on the guaranteed payments, not the high end of the multiple.\n“Unless you are already growing rapidly, anything on top of that guaranteed payment is found money,” she said.\nJohn Orsini, a director at consultancy and M&A shop Marshberry, said buyers are extremely diligent when it comes to offers, but they may also be prone to “flex up” in price when they identify a firm that fits a specific need.\n“Even though this year we are expecting close to 400 transactions, it’s still a generally illiquid market,” Orsini said. “For instance, if you are looking for something in the Western suburbs of Chicago, there might be a handful of transactions that happen in a year, and if that’s a gap in your offering, you’re going to bid that up.”\nDavid DeVoe, CEO and founder of DeVoe & Company, noted that high valuations will likely continue barring major market disruptions. In the firm’s recent survey of some of the industry’s most active acquirers, 85% expect valuations to hold steady over the next six months, with the remaining 15% being evenly split between a slight uptick or a modest decline.\n“The highest valuations being paid are rational for those particular buyers,” DeVoe said via email. “Many of these consolidators have developed the capabilities to drive acquired firms’ organic growth and increase their margins. These key value drivers, plus the historic valuation arbitrage between what they can buy firms at versus what the next PE sponsor will value them at, yields the business case for extremely high valuations.”\nDeVoe said sellers should always pay close attention to the deal’s structure, not just the price tags.\n“The old joke is ‘I will pay you any valuation you want ... as long as I get to choose the terms,’\" he said. “Sellers need to be thoughtful about their goals and ensure they are getting good advice. The deal structure can undermine a perceived high valuation. And the wrong buyer will make a seller’s life—and their clients’ and staff’s lives—miserable.”\nHe also pointed out what happened in late 2007 and 2008, when the financial crisis took out markets and “both valuations and M&A activity dropped dramatically.”\n“More importantly,” he said, “many unqualified and sub-par acquirers were washed out of the market.”\nFor now, the risks in today’s market are more about execution and integration, or what DeVoe calls “misalignment.”\n“If firms overpay and can’t integrate, operate or grow the acquired business effectively, the whole thesis breaks down,” he said. “And in a rising cost or slower-growth environment, that gets harder to hide.”\nOrsini of Marshberry said buyers also conduct due diligence, often focusing on a firm’s ability to show consistent organic growth.\n“There is absolutely risk to these buyers for paying too much, but that is why the quality of these diligence teams across the buyer space is so high,” he said. “The amount of rigor that they are putting into the diligence and the questions they are asking gives me confidence.”\nEven so, Orsini said there can be risk when diligence is “abbreviated” to get deals through the pipeline. But for now, the offers will likely keep coming for sellers to evaluate and decide on their needs.\n“We can’t predict where the market will go, but we still have a conversation or two a month with a new private equity-backed acquirer,” he said. “As long as new capital is flowing, with demand outpacing supply, valuations will remain strong for quality firms.”\nReiches, in the meantime, recommends sellers stay engaged and diligent throughout the entire sales process. She took her own deal down to the wire, flying the team out to California to meet with EP Wealth before signing.\n“They were joking with us about all the questions we were asking about our staff,” Reiches said. “The money is good, but you have to make sure it’s the right setup for you and your clients. No question is silly. Surprises may come along the way. But you keep asking and asking and asking.”","content_hash":"3ae5320bfa47b69d1ec820724d88dd74","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7088,"method_rank":0}

High-net-worth investors (HNWIs) are no longer confining their sustainable investment focus to clean energy and low-carbon sectors alone.\nIncreasingly, they are directing capital toward “transition investing” - backing companies in high-emission industries that are actively reshaping their operations to meet the demands of a low-carbon economy. A recent report spanning eight key markets from Standard Chartered reveals that 87% of HNWIs now have an appetite for such investments.\nThat figure is striking, given that many of these investors built their fortunes in sectors like manufacturing, energy, and heavy industry - sectors under the sharpest pressure to decarbonise. Far from shunning these industries, they see an opportunity: to help future-proof them, and to reap the rewards of companies that lead their peers in adapting.\n“Clients in our markets understand the concept of climate transition as many of them have built wealth in high carbon industries,” says Eugenia Koh, Global Head, Sustainable Finance, Wealth and Retail Banking at Standard Chartered.\n“They are keenly aware of the opportunities and risks – some of them may be seeing demand from international companies come through to their own business and acknowledge that companies that are ahead of transitioning will be competitive and the leaders of tomorrow.”\nBeyond Altruism - Toward Financial Resilience\nAlthough transition investing might seem like a natural offshoot of broader sustainable investing, the emphasis here is firmly on financial materiality. “Investors in our footprint are very pragmatic,” Koh explains. “They are not looking at sustainable trends just for altruistic reasons but trends that are also focused on financial materiality.”\nThis is the first year the survey has explored transition investing specifically, yet the trend mirrors previous patterns in sustainable finance. The motivation is not just about “doing good” but ensuring portfolios are prepared for a world where carbon prices, regulatory changes, and shifting consumer demands could reshape industries overnight.\nMarkets with Distinct Motivations\nWhile the global appetite is broad, the drivers vary sharply by region.\nIn Hong Kong, personal values (61%) are the top motivator, followed closely by improved returns (also 61%), with social and environmental impact in third place.\nMainland China shows higher-than-average investor scepticism, particularly around risk and the tangible impact of investments. A lack of benchmarks is also seen as a hurdle. Yet the leading driver here remains environmental and social impact (64%), followed by returns (59%) and compliance with social norms (55%).\nIn the UAE, positive societal and environmental outcomes lead (55%), with financial returns and personal values tied in second (53% each). Here, one of the top barriers is access - 36% cite limited availability of suitable investment products, a concern unique among the surveyed markets.\nYet despite strong appetite, understanding of the concept is still limited.\n“While investor appetite is strong, the findings indicated a gap in understanding, with only 15% of investors able to fully define the concept of transition investing,” Koh notes. “Many still relate it just to climate investing or renewable energy, rather than a broad sector approach of supporting companies in high carbon sectors which are actively reducing their carbon emissions.”\nClosing the Knowledge Gap\nTo close this gap, Koh and her team are stepping up education efforts. “We continue to educate clients on this when we meet with them, and reports like this alongside our Transition Investing Guide are useful resources in educating our clients.”\nThe guide offers a framework and key questions for evaluating transition-related funds, mirroring earlier sustainable fund frameworks aimed at helping investors navigate greenwashing concerns.\nAligning with Broader Sustainability Goals\nFor Koh, whose remit spans global wealth and retail banking, transition finance is more than a niche offering. Standard Chartered has committed to mobilising $300bn in green and transition finance by 2030. “We understand that the markets and sectors that require the most financing to transition to low carbon business models are often left out of green finance,” she says.\nOpportunities on the Horizon\nOver the next decade, the financial and societal opportunities from transition investing could be vast. “Investing in the leaders transitioning their sectors will be an important theme in the next 5 to 10 years as companies globally face increasing regulations and costs of operations such as carbon taxes,” Koh says.\nInvestor interest is particularly strong in low-emissions fuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Green hydrogen has potential, but scalability remains inconsistent. By contrast, CCS is gaining traction, with projects like the UK’s East Coast Cluster aiming to capture and store up to 4 million tonnes of CO₂ annually by 2030 - “equivalent to removing 1.5 million cars from the road.”\nThe Societal Imperative\nEmerging markets are where the stakes are highest. “The markets and sectors that require the most financing to transition to low carbon business models are often left out of green finance,” Koh says.\n“In emerging markets, they also tend to be the sectors that are essential for livelihoods and economic growth. The same regions can be the most vulnerable and least prepared for the increasing frequency and severity of weather events from climate change.”\nThe economic cost of inaction is already visible. “According to Zurich Resilience Solutions, damage from global natural disasters in 2023 totalled $380bn in economic losses – with only $118bn of these losses covered by insurance.”\nFuture Focus\nAs the market matures, Koh expects a sharper focus on financial materiality in transition metrics, much as investors now scrutinise material ESG indicators.\nFor those still hesitant, her advice is clear: “Climate risks are growing for companies and climate risk is investment risk. It is therefore important for investors to also think about their portfolios from this lens, and to be able to incorporate this as part of looking at risks and opportunities in their investments.”\nTransition investing, then, is not a speculative bet on a distant future. It is an informed strategy for navigating the realities of today’s shifting markets - and for shaping the resilient, low-carbon economy of tomorrow.\n\"Transition Finance Goes Mainstream\" was originally created and published by Private Banker International, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Management credited disciplined execution and productivity initiatives for improved operating margins, while highlighting that higher student demand, especially in working adult online programs, contributed to revenue gains. CEO Eilif Serck-Hanssen cited “strong growth in working adult-focused fully online programs” and emphasized the significance of recent campus developments in supporting the company’s expansion strategy.\nLooking forward, Laureate’s updated guidance is shaped by ongoing investments in new campus openings and digital learning offerings, especially in high-growth Latin American markets. Management believes that macroeconomic stability in Mexico and Peru, combined with rising middle-class participation in higher education, will support further enrollment gains. Serck-Hanssen noted, “We are broadening our academic portfolio, scaling our digital offering to better serve working adults and strategically expanding our footprint through targeted campus openings in high-growth areas.”\nKey Insights from Management’s Remarks\nManagement attributed the quarter’s performance to robust enrollment trends, efficiency efforts, and digital program expansion, while macroeconomic conditions in Mexico and Peru provided a supportive backdrop for growth.\nOnline program momentum: Growth in fully online programs for working adults remained a standout, with management reporting “double-digit” expansion in Peru and continued success in Mexico. This shift toward digital offerings has enabled Laureate to reach new student segments and support enrollment growth without significant increases in physical capacity.\nCampus expansion strategy: Two new campuses—one in Monterrey, Mexico and one in Lima, Peru—are on track to open in September. Management described “robust interest and demand” for both locations, viewing these investments as central to the company’s multi-year growth plan targeting high-demand regions.\nAcademic calendar timing impact: CFO Richard Buskirk explained that shifts in class start dates, especially in Peru, moved revenue and expenses between quarters. This seasonality led to higher reported revenue in Q2, with an expected offset in the second half of the year.\nEfficiency initiatives drive margins: The company’s ongoing focus on operational efficiency, including cost controls and campus consolidations, contributed to margin expansion in both core markets. Buskirk indicated this was supported by “productivity gains and revenue flow-through,” especially in Mexico.\nMacroeconomic backdrop supportive: Management noted that both Mexico and Peru are benefiting from improving macroeconomic conditions, including stable inflation, low interest rates, and favorable regulatory trends. Serck-Hanssen suggested these factors position Laureate for sustained growth and resilience against external volatility.\nDrivers of Future Performance\nLaureate’s outlook for the coming quarters is driven by ongoing digital expansion, new campus launches, and macroeconomic stability in its core markets.\nDigital and blended learning growth: Management expects continued momentum in online and hybrid programs, particularly for working adults in both Mexico and Peru. Expanded digital offerings are seen as critical to reaching new students and maintaining high enrollment growth without major increases in capital expenditures.\nCampus investments support scale: The company’s plan to open one to two new campuses per year, with further locations identified for development, underpins its strategy for sustained revenue and enrollment expansion. Management projects that these investments will require higher capital spending (approximately 5% of revenues), but will also lift long-term growth rates.\nMacroeconomic and regulatory risks: While near-term conditions in Mexico and Peru are favorable, management flagged ongoing monitoring of U.S.-Mexico trade negotiations and local political developments as potential sources of risk. Any negative shifts in these areas could impact the pace of foreign investment and student demand.\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters\nIn the coming quarters, the StockStory team will be tracking (1) enrollment trends for both young and working adult students, especially as new campuses open; (2) the pace of adoption and revenue impact from expanded digital and online programs in Peru and Mexico; and (3) developments in the regulatory and macroeconomic environment, particularly around U.S.-Mexico trade negotiations.

Management pointed to strong growth in both online casino and sports betting, with CEO Richard Schwartz attributing the momentum to “broad-based performance across our business.” Notable market highlights included substantial year-over-year growth in Michigan, West Virginia, Delaware, and Ontario, as well as momentum in Latin America, particularly in Colombia and Mexico. Management also highlighted improved marketing efficiency and ongoing gross margin expansion.\nLooking ahead, management’s updated guidance reflects confidence in continued market share gains in both North America and Latin America. CEO Richard Schwartz emphasized the significance of anticipated launches in Alberta and product innovation like multistate poker, stating, “This market represents a significant opportunity for us to leverage our success in other North American online casino markets.” CFO Kyle Sauers noted that guidance incorporates ongoing tax headwinds, particularly in Colombia, and an expectation for higher marketing spend in the second half as the company pursues further customer acquisition.\nKey Insights from Management’s Remarks\nManagement attributed second quarter outperformance to robust product and market diversification, disciplined marketing spend, and continued success in key North American and Latin American jurisdictions.\nOnline casino outpaced sports betting: Management reported that online casino revenue grew 25% year over year, surpassing the 15% growth in sports betting. CEO Richard Schwartz highlighted the company’s focus on markets that allow for casino offerings, which has driven higher engagement and player value.\nNorth America market strength: Markets such as Michigan, West Virginia, and Delaware experienced accelerated growth, with Michigan up 42% and Delaware showing continued momentum six quarters post-launch. Ontario in Canada grew 25%, which management attributed to focused investment and product differentiation.\nLatin America momentum: Latin America, particularly Colombia and Mexico, delivered high player growth rates—Colombia’s gross gaming revenue was up over 70%, while Mexico’s revenue grew more than 125%. Management attributed this to effective regional partnerships and tailored user experiences.\nMarketing efficiency gains: Marketing spend represented less than 14% of revenue, the lowest since going public, yet the company achieved its highest number of first-time depositing customers in company history. Management noted that this was accomplished without launching new North American markets during the quarter.\nProduct innovation and cross-sell: The recent launch of multistate poker was cited as a strategic move to drive engagement and cross-sell between casino, sports betting, and poker. Management pointed to unique product features such as seamless transitions between gaming verticals and exclusive content as key differentiators.\nDrivers of Future Performance\nRush Street Interactive expects continued revenue and margin growth, underpinned by new market entries, product innovation, and disciplined operational execution, while managing regulatory and tax headwinds.\nExpansion in new jurisdictions: The anticipated launch in Alberta and ongoing growth in Mexico are expected to be significant contributors, as management positions the company to leverage its online casino platform in newly regulated markets.\nOperational discipline and marketing investment: Management plans to increase marketing spend in the second half of the year to support further player acquisition, while maintaining a focus on efficiency and cost leverage, particularly in general and administrative expenses.\nTax and regulatory challenges: The company’s outlook incorporates continued temporary VAT tax headwinds in Colombia and higher state taxes in the U.S. Management highlighted the importance of flexibility in adapting strategy, especially with potential changes in the regulatory environment and competitive landscape.\nCatalysts in Upcoming Quarters\nGoing forward, we are closely tracking (1) the launch timeline and early performance in Alberta, (2) the pace and sustainability of player growth in Mexico and other Latin American markets, and (3) management’s ability to navigate tax and regulatory developments, particularly in Colombia and key U.S. states.

And it’s only Wednesday. On Monday, Trump revealed his administration will take a 15% cut of sales of Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD’s (AMD) chips to Chinese companies in exchange for allowing the AI hardware to flow back into the country.\nHe also met with Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan on Monday after calling for his ouster last week. At the end of the day, Trump appeared to back away from his initial demand, saying Tan’s “success and rise is an amazing story.”\nOn their face, the developments appear to be positive for the trio of chip giants. But Trump’s lightning-fast whiplash between stances raises important questions about the companies’ futures, including whether Nvidia and AMD will be able to continue selling their chips in China, despite the administration’s prior protestations about national security concerns, and what kind of toll the president will extract from Intel moving forward.\nNvidia and AMD get a win… for now\nTrump’s decision to restart the sale of Nvidia and AMD chips into China for a fee means both companies will be able to recoup some of the losses they took when he initially banned processor shipments there in April.\n“[The] companies can use some part of their prior written-off inventory so even with 15% penalty they get some gross profit recovery, and … China resumption maintains the original goal of engaging with an important (China) AI ecosystem and of potentially keeping competitors (Huawei) in check,” BofA Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a research note following Trump’s announcement.\nNvidia, in particular, could end up passing along the 15% fee to its China-based customers, thanks to the strong demand for its offerings.\n“From my perspective, it is a positive for those companies,” Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen told Yahoo Finance. “As you know, it opens a market where there's still high demand. Nvidia, especially, still has a lot of cache with their name.”\nBut Trump’s latest AI chip move also introduces some thorny questions. The first of which is whether Nvidia and AMD will continue to be able to sell their AI processors into China moving forward, or if Trump will change his mind again.\nAfter all, the administration originally pulled Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308 on national security grounds, and as Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon explained to Yahoo Finance, this deal doesn’t appear to address the matter.\nArya similarly warns against getting too comfortable with the idea of China as a reliable source of revenue for either company.\n“It isn't clear if [the US government] will continue to provide approvals next year,” he wrote in a research note. “Restarting supply chains to produce more AI chips could take 8-9 months … [and the] rapidly evolving AI landscape could reduce demand from certain China customers.”\nThere’s another problem lurking for Nvidia, though. According to The Information, Chinese officials are urging companies like ByteDance, Alibaba Group (BABA), and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) to suspend the purchase of Nvidia chips over potential security concerns.\nNvidia says its chips don’t pose any kind of security threat.\n“As both governments recognize, the H20 is not a military product or for government infrastructure. China has ample supply of domestic chips to meet its needs,” an Nvidia spokesperson wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance.\n“It won't and never has relied on American chips for government operations, just like the U.S. government would not rely on chips from China. Banning the sale of H20 in China would only harm US economic and technology leadership with zero national security benefit.”\nAll of this comes amid the backdrop of the US and China’s ongoing trade negotiations, leaving Nvidia and AMD uniquely vulnerable to further political intrigue.\nCompanies are also weighing the risks, struggling to interpret the president's order amid Trump's unpredictable decisions, while experts are also wondering if this offers a path to enter the Chinese market despite export controls.\n“This is truly bizarre and unusual, and the troubling thing — beyond the individual instances of AMD and Nvidia — is the possibility that this will be expanded,” said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n“Everything is now ‘national security,’ according to the new definition, which means it’s all subject to export licenses and then they give you a license based on your contribution.”\nIntel’s Trump meeting\nIntel is also contending with its own Trump-related issues. Last week, the president said in a Truth Social post that Tan was “highly conflicted and must resign,” adding that there was “no other solution to this problem.”\nTrump’s statement came after Republican Sen. Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel questioning Tan’s investments in Chinese companies.\nIt didn’t help that the Justice Department announced in July that Cadence Design Systems, where Tan previously served as CEO, would pay a $140 million settlement related to charges about shipping chip design products to a Chinese military university. Tan also has a number of investments in Chinese companies.\nAfter Tan’s meeting with the president on Monday, the company released an additional statement saying, “We appreciate the president’s strong leadership to advance these critical priorities and look forward to working closely with him and his administration as we restore this great American company.”\nTrump, for his part, said in a Truth Social post that the meeting was interesting and that his members will meet with Tan to give him suggestions over the next week. It’s unclear what the suggestions would be for.\nIn a research note, Rasgon wrote that Intel could petition for “further support, both monetary and, conceivably, through customer 'encouragement' either for volume … or more direct investment.”\nThe biggest question then is what Trump will seek from Intel in return for his help.\n“We do know [Trump] tends to be transactional, and loves making deals where he (and, hopefully, the US too?) come out ahead,” Rasgon wrote.\n“Would a successful Intel be enough all by itself to satiate that desire? We aren’t sure, but given recent behavior (just yesterday extracting dollars from [Nvidia] and AMD to sell AI chips into China) we feel that his largesse, if obtained, likely won’t come free.”\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

From April 4 through the morning of Aug. 11, the stock shot 139% higher.\nA rapidly growing user base is the main reason SoFi stock keeps producing big gains, but it isn't the only one. There are several good reasons to be enamored with SoFi stock right now.\nFinding excuses to be excited about SoFi's future is easy, but there are also a couple of good reasons to be cautious about buying the stock. Let's look at three reasons to be enthusiastic about the up-and-coming bank before looking at a couple of reasons to remain cautious.\n1. Why buy: Outstanding user growth\nSoFi's bears like to remind investors that consumer banking changes very little over time. While the same basic banking principles apply regardless of the underlying technology, SoFi is attracting new customers at a pace that suggests it has built a unique experience that resonates with American consumers.\nSoFi began refinancing student loans in 2012, and didn't launch SoFi Money, the operation that includes basic checking and savings accounts, until 2019. SoFi Technologies acquired a banking license in 2022 and ended that year with 5.3 million members using 7.9 million products. By the end of this June, its business grew to 11.7 million members using 17.1 million products.\nTo put a little perspective on how difficult it is to get people to switch banks, consider Wells Fargo. In 2017, it admitted to creating millions of bogus credit card, checking, and other types of accounts for customers without their consent.\nIn the years since, Wells Fargo hasn't been as transparent about customer account numbers as SoFi Technologies is now. The publicly traded bank still has to report top-line revenue figures, though. Looking at this metric, the fake account scandal didn't even register.\n2. Why buy: Room to continue growing\nMany SoFi customers will start with one product, such as a personal loan or checking account. Once they become members, though, getting them to engage with another product like a mortgage, stock brokerage account, or credit card has been relatively easy. In the second quarter alone, SoFi added 1.3 million new products, which worked out to 1.5 products per new customer added during the period.\nInvestors can likely look forward to more new customers coming on board in the years ahead. Brand awareness recently reached an all-time high, but 91.5% of Americans still haven't heard about SoFi Technologies.\n3. Why buy: A consumer bank with fintech chops\nIn 2020, SoFi acquired Galileo, the technology platform that provides payment processing and other technology support for SoFi's customer-facing applications.\nNow that SoFi has its own banking charter, it probably isn't fair to call it a financial technology stock. That said, it's wholly owned technology platform sports more customers than most businesses in the financial technology space. H&R Block, Toast, Eli Lilly, and more than 100 other partners rely on Galileo to manage 158 million accounts for their customers.\nThe Galileo business isn't just a way for SoFi to lower its own technology expenses. Second-quarter revenue from the segment rose to $110 million, and plenty of that revenue hits the bottom line. Over the past year, more than 30% of technology segment revenue has been recorded as profit.\nThe first reason I'm not buying more SoFi stock right now\nThe last time I purchased SoFi Technologies shares, they were trading at around 2 times the bank's tangible book value. I'd gladly buy more at this valuation, but it's not an option. The stock has been trading at an extremely high 5.5 times its tangible book value.\nWell-established consumer banks rarely trade above 2 times their tangible book value. If SoFi's rapid expansion loses steam over the next few years, its valuation could quickly resemble its more-established peers. Although it looks like rapid growth can continue for several more years, this isn't a risk I'm willing to take.\nThe second reason I'm not adding to my SoFi position now\nSoFi is building up its mortgage business, but it mostly relies on unsecured personal loans and student loans for revenue. Credit performance has been pretty good so far. The bank's net charge-off percentage on personal loans fell to 4.5% in the second quarter, or just 2.8% if you account for the delinquent loans it's been able to sell.\nLike Upstart, SoFi Technologies uses its own system to evaluate individual credit risk. Less reliance on third parties like Fair Isaac, the company that sells access to FICO scores, is great for profitability, but this bank hasn't had a real chance to prove itself yet. Americans haven't experienced a long recession in over a decade.\nIt isn't SoFi's fault that the U.S. economy has been generally strong for an unusually long time. That said, you probably shouldn't buy any up-and-coming lender at a valuation that is more than double that of its established peers unless you're twice as confident about its future credit performance. Over time, I think SoFi can prove itself. For now, it presents more risk than most investors should feel comfortable accepting.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SoFi Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SoFi Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoFi Technologies wasn’t one of them.

But times have changed. This spring, fast-casual chains saw foot traffic decline as sales slowed down or even shrank.\nTo explain the downturn, executives have said that diners are \"cautious,\" in the words of Sweetgreen CEO Jonathan Neman, or dealing with an economic \"fog,\" according to Cava CFO Tricia Tolivar.\nAnd just as diners are finding reasons why to cut back on their Shake Shack burgers or Chipotle bowls, investors are trimming their fast-casual holdings after rewarding the companies last year for outperforming the rest of the industry. So far in 2025, Shake Shack shares have fallen 16%; Chipotle stock has slid 28%; Cava shares have tumbled 37%; and Sweetgreen stock has plunged 70%. Of the notable publicly traded fast-casual chains, only Wingstop has managed to stay in the green this year, with gains of 20%.\nMore broadly, investors have grown more cautious about betting on any restaurants, given weak traffic trends and concerns about consumer spending, according to a research note on Sunday from UBS. Even fast-food companies have struggled with the traffic declines and sluggish sales growth, despite their historical reputation as a safer bet during economic uncertainty.\nWhile some fast-casual chains flagged company-specific reasons for their weaker-than-expected results, executives also said that economic uncertainty is weighing on consumers – and hurting their sales.\nGenerally, fast-casual diners are higher income and more likely to have white-collar jobs. However, Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright blamed a pullback from low-income consumers for the chain's same-store sales declines of 4% in the second quarter.\n\"You have to look no further than what's going with our competitors with snack occasions or $5 meals. That's where the consumer is drifting towards, [with] value as a price point, because of low consumer sentiment. I think as sentiment improves, the business will improve. I think that's probably the biggest headwind we face,\" he told analysts on the company's earnings conference call on June 23.\nThe University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment slid in April to 52.2, one of its lowest-ever recorded readings. It held at that level in May before rising in June to 60.7.\nFast-casual chains are seeing consumers' economic anxieties in their own research, too.\n\"Through our regular consumer research, we hear concerns about elevated prices, future job prospects and general anxiety about the future,\" Wingstop CEO Michael Skipworth said on the company's earnings conference call in late July.\nThe chicken wing chain reported same-store sales declines of 1.9% for the quarter, a dramatic reversal compared to its growth of 28.7% in the year-ago period.\nOn the company's earnings conference call on Thursday, Sweetgreen's Neman said that the chain saw \"a more cautious consumer environment starting in April\" — coinciding with the drop in consumer sentiment. A \"subdued industry backdrop,\" particularly in several of the chain's biggest urban markets, contributed to Sweetgreen's \"really, really rough quarter,\" according to Neman.\nThat's one reason why the salad chain reported a steeper-than-expected decline in its same-store sales and cut its full-year forecast for the second straight quarter. Sweetgreen executives also attributed the weak quarterly performance to a tough comparison to last year's steak launch and the transition of its loyalty program.\nTo improve its value perception among customers, Sweetgreen is increasing its chicken and tofu portions by 25%, improving its chicken and salmon recipes and implementing some promotional pricing, like $13 menu bowl drops for its loyalty program members.\nAs for Cava, the company had been wowing investors with impressive same-store sales growth since its initial public offering two years ago. But this quarter, the Mediterranean chain reported same-store sales growth of 2.1%, well below Wall Street projections of 6.1%. Executives said that it faced difficult comparisons to the year-ago period's same-store sales growth of 14.4%, which was fueled by its own steak launch and strong demand at newer restaurant locations that waned this year.\n\"Cava isn't so special after all. After blowing out same store sales in Q1 of 10.8%, it fell in line with the industry at 2.1% in Q2. It's not negative, so that's helpful,\" Tracey Ryniec, stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research, said.\nCava executives also acknowledged that economic concerns are weighing on diners.\n\"Certainly, we're operating in a fluid macroeconomic environment and it's one that sort of creates a fog for consumers where things are changing constantly and it's hard to see the clear. And during those times, they tend to step off of the gas,\" Tolivar said on the company's conference call on Tuesday evening.\nStill, Cava isn't seeing consumers trade down to cheaper protein options, or experiencing any other deeper business concerns, co-founder and CEO Brett Schulman said. And as it enters the third quarter, its same-store sales have improved, Tolivar said.\nAnd Cava isn't the only fast-casual eatery anticipating a return to form in the latter half of the year, especially as consumer sentiment improved in June and July.\nChipotle said its traffic started growing again as the burrito chain exited the quarter and continued into July. Sweetgreen has seen \"modest\" improvement in its same-store sales so far into the third quarter, according to Neman.\nAnd while Wingstop executives said that they're still seeing weaker consumer demand, the chain is facing easier comparisons to last year's performance.","content_hash":"5e459a7a1a4f67d2cc66eb5d72b7481b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5951,"method_rank":0}

Subscribe here to receive future editions.\nA new program from the Trump administration aims to make setting up manufacturing plants in the U.S. less of a headache for the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced a new \"PreCheck\" program, which will use a two-phase approach to help boost domestic drug manufacturing after it shrunk dramatically over the past two decades.\nThe announcement is a direct response to President Donald Trump's executive order in May calling on the FDA to reduce regulatory hurdles for domestic drug production in the U.S.. That order asked the agency to cut the amount of time it takes to approve new plants by eliminating unnecessary requirements, while also increasing the fees for and inspections of manufacturing facilities abroad.\nIt follows a flurry of plans for new U.S. manufacturing investments from several drugmakers, such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Eli Lilly, in a bid to build goodwill with Trump. Still, the president could impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. any day now — a move that the industry argues could harm innovation and patient access to certain treatments.\nSo, why has Trump made reshoring drug production a key facet of his trade policy?\nMore than half of pharmaceuticals distributed in the U.S. are manufactured overseas, according to a release from the FDA. Only 11% of companies that produce active pharmaceutical ingredients are based in the U.S., while a significant share are in China and India, the agency added.\nThe White House also estimates that it can currently take five to 10 years to build new manufacturing capacity for pharmaceuticals, which it previously called \"unacceptable from a national-security standpoint.\"\n\"Our gradual overreliance on foreign drug manufacturing has created national security risks,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in the release on Thursday. \"The FDA PreCheck initiative is one of many steps FDA is taking that can help reverse America's reliance on foreign drug manufacturing and ensure that Americans have a resilient, strong, and domestic drug supply.\"\nHere's how the two phases of the program work:\n- Facility Readiness Phase: Drugmakers will be able to engage more frequently with the FDA at \"critical development stages\" such as facility design, construction and pre-construction, the agency said. Companies will also use \"Drug Master Files,\" a facility-specific document that provides comprehensive information, including site layout and operations.\n- Application Submission Phase: The agency said this step would involve the FDA and drugmakers holding pre-application meetings and giving early feedback to resolve issues and streamline assessments of \"quality information in a drug application and inspections.\" (That is referring to the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls, or CMC, section of an application, which provides a comprehensive overview on the drug substance, its manufacturing process and controls in place to ensure its quality and stability.)\nThe FDA will host a public meeting on Sept. 30, where it will present on the program and discuss other proposals to \"overcome current onshoring challenge,\" among other issues.\nUntil then, concrete details on the program are sparse. It's unclear what requirements the FDA could eliminate, and how much less time it could take to approve new sites.\nWe'll continue to watch as this program gets finalized and implemented, so stay tuned for our coverage!\nFeel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com.\nLatest in health-care tech: OpenAI is leaning into health care with the launch of GPT-5\nLike it or not, more and more patients are turning to OpenAI's artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT to answer questions about their health care. And the company is paying attention.\nOpenAI launched its latest large-scale AI model called GPT-5 last week, and the startup said it's the \"best model yet\" for health-related queries. The product is designed to proactively flag health concerns, ask relevant questions and generate more precise and reliable responses, the company said in a blog post.\n\"Health care is maybe the area where there's the strongest improvement of any (is this one extra?) of any category,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in an interview about GPT-5 on Friday.\nAltman said health-related questions make up a \"huge fraction\" of ChatGPT usage. In a post on X, he said he hopes GPT-5's health capabilities will \"provide real service to people.\"\nOpenAI said GPT-5 scores \"significantly higher\" than previous models on its health-care AI benchmark called Health Bench.\nThe company released Health Bench in May, and it's designed to measure how well AI models perform in realistic health scenarios. HealthBench was developed alongside 262 doctors from 60 countries. OpenAI said it's based on 5,000 conversations that simulate interactions between individual users or clinicians and AI models.\nOpenAI is also touting GPT-5 as a helpful tool for medical research.\nThe company released a two-minute-long video with Dr. Derya Unutmaz, a professor and human immunologist, which demonstrates how he has been using the model. Unutmaz said GPT-5 is able to help him brainstorm, interpret data and save him time by predicting outcomes of potential experiments.\n\"I think GPT-5 will help the patients to advocate for themselves, and I think that will empower the patients to feel more confident when they talk to their doctors,\" Unutmaz said in the video.\nRead more of CNBC's coverage about GPT-5 here.\nFeel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Ashley at ashley.capoot@nbcuni.com.","content_hash":"3a7641a2e2ee4e0d798e95b98dc0e33a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5861,"method_rank":0}

Huge and even record yields could be forecast for U.S. corn (ZCZ25) and soybean (ZSX25) crops.\nA Dow Jones Newswires survey of grain analysts shows they expect U.S. corn production this year at 15.991 billion bushels, with an average yield of 184.3 bushels an acre. The record for U.S. corn production, according to USDA, is the 15.186-billion-bushel crop grown in 2024, with a record average yield of 183.6 bushels per acre. The Dow Jones Newswires survey expects U.S. soybean production in 2025 at 4.371 billion bushels and an average yield of 53.0 bushels an acre. U.S. soybean production in 2024 totaled 4.37 billion bushels, which was also a record. The average yield per acre was 50.7 bushels,\nBearish USDA Data Expected for Corn and Soybeans, But…\nPrice action in corn and soybean futures early last week saw significant selling pressure, with December corn hitting a fresh contract low and November soybeans scoring a four-month low.\nHowever, by the end of the week both markets had stabilized, suggesting that the bears had become exhausted, especially in the corn market. I suspect traders last week were factoring into futures prices the expected bearish USDA crop report on Tuesday. Such suggests that a classic “sell the rumor, buy the fact” scenario may play out following Tuesday’s crop report.\nU.S. Midwest Weather Still Leans Bearish for Corn, Soybeans\nWeather in the U.S. Corn Belt is still non-threatening, with generally adequate soil moisture levels and rains still falling in the region. Weather forecasters say such will likely be the case for at least the next two weeks. There will also be a lack of widespread heat for at least another week. Warmer- to much-warmer-than-normal temperatures will be most common through the next week, but widespread, excessive heat is not expected, according to weather forecasters. August is arguably the most important growing month for most of the U.S. soybean crop.\nExport Demand for U.S. Corn Picking Up Steam\nUSDA last Friday reported another daily U.S. corn sale of 125,000 metric tons of corn to unknown destinations during the 2025-26 marketing year. Last Thursday, USDA reported weekly old-crop U.S. corn sales of 170,400 metric tons for 2024-25 for the week ended July 31, down 50% from the previous week and down 71% from the four-week average.\nHowever, new-crop corn sales totaled a solid 3.163 million MT. The 2025-26 marketing year corn export sales pace is now more than double the rate seen one year ago at this time. It may be difficult for corn market bears to continue to press the downside in corn futures if the U.S. corn export sales pace continues to be strong.\nOctober will find the U.S. corn harvest in full swing, and with a bumper crop expected, rallies and an extended price uptrend in corn futures will likely be limited by commercial hedging pressure. A better handle on the size of the U.S. crop will also come likely at that time, with combines rolling and yields from farmers rolling in.\nSoybean Meal Futures Providing Early Bullish Clues\nThe soybean meal futures market had a good week last week, as spreaders unwound long bean oil (ZLU25), short meal (ZMU25) trades. If meal continues to perform well this week, that would be an early sign the soybean futures market has also put in a near-term low.\nSoybean bulls continue to anxiously await new-crop purchases from China. If the U.S. and China agree to a trade deal in the coming weeks or few months, the soybean market likely would get a significant price boost. Conversely, a deterioration in U.S.-China trade relations would be a bearish weight on the soybean futures complex.\nWheat Market Bulls Are Still Struggling\nAfter swooning to contract lows last week, the winter wheat futures (KEZ25) (ZWZ25) markets posted decent rebounds Wednesday and Thursday and saw just modest corrective pullbacks Friday. Key for the bulls this week will be to show some price strength to better suggest near-term market price bottoms are in place. Wheat traders will be looking to the corn market for daily price direction.\nTuesday’s midday USDA supply and demand report is also in focus for wheat traders. The Dow Jones Newswires survey of grain analysts shows they expect all U.S. wheat production to come in at 1.925 billion bushels.\nU.S. wheat harvesting weather has been favorable in the Midwest and northern Plains. Harvesting in the central Plains is winding down. The Canadian Prairies wheat region has seen some dry weather that hurt wheat production potential.\nUSDA last Thursday reported weekly U.S. wheat sales of 737,800 MT for the week ended July 31, up 25% from the previous week and four-week average. Sales exceeded pre-report expectations. U.S. wheat sales abroad will need to continue to improve in the coming weeks to get the winter wheat markets out of their slump and possibly begin sustainable price uptrends.\nU.S. winter wheat harvest will be mostly completed in the coming weeks, which suggests less commercial hedging pressure on futures prices. The wheat market bulls will be looking to new trade deals between the U.S. and other countries, including China, to potentially boost U.S. wheat export prospects in the coming months.\nTell me what you think.

Various companies across the space are well below highs while the broader stock market chugs along at all-time highs.\nBut just because something isn't hot right now doesn't mean investors shouldn't be digging for deals. Scooping up winners at discounted prices usually leads to good things over the long term.\nThe reality is that people and animals will always need medicine, treatments, and other products to live long and comfortable lives.\nThese three healthcare stocks are poised to perform well over the coming years and will pay you dividends. The best part? You can own all three for under $1,000.\n1. Zoetis\nAnimal health can fly under the radar, but it's a massive industry. Zoetis(NYSE: ZTS) provides various drugs and other healthcare products used to treat companion animals and livestock across the world. The company continuously innovates with a portfolio spanning seven major product categories and approximately 300 product lines. Animal health continues to grow as younger generations show increased interest in companion animals and global population growth spurs demand for animal proteins.\nThe company offers a nice blend of growth and dividends. Zoetis has outperformed the S&P 500 on a price appreciation basis since spinning off from Pfizer in 2013, plus it pays a dividend that it has raised every year since the spinoff. Management estimates the animal health market will grow from $48 billion in 2023 to $75 billion-$85 billion by 2033, and the company has historically grown faster than the industry.\nZoetis trades well off its 52-week high despite raising earnings guidance in its recent earnings report. The stock's price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio is 25, its lowest ever. Analysts estimate Zoetis will grow earnings by an average of 9% to 10% annually over the next three to five years, making the stock a no-brainer for long-term investors.\n2. Johnson & Johnson\nLooking for peace of mind? Look no further than Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ), a pharmaceutical and medical device behemoth. Most associate the company with its former consumer products segment, but Johnson & Johnson spun that off as Kenvue in 2023. The spinoff enabled Johnson & Johnson to focus on its faster-growing segments, and it has invested in innovation to bolster its drug pipeline and medical equipment portfolio.\nFrom a dividend standpoint, Johnson & Johnson is royalty -- a Dividend King. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 63 consecutive years, a remarkable feat and a testament to the high-quality business that Johnson & Johnson has built itself up to become. The stock is somewhat of a glacier, a slow and steady mover that won't make you rich overnight. That said, you can sleep peacefully holding shares and collect a 3% dividend yield that goes up each year.\nJohnson & Johnson isn't perfect; the company still has some litigation hanging over its head related to its talcum powder. Fortunately, its AAA-rated balance sheet should help it absorb whatever fallout eventually comes of that. Right now, the stock is a solid bargain at a P\/E ratio of 18, with Wall Street expecting just over 7% annualized earnings growth over the coming years.\n3. Zimmer Biomet\nPeople's bodies break down due to age or sometimes due to injuries. Zimmer Biomet(NYSE: ZBH) develops many of the products that make people whole again. Think joint replacement implants, dental implants, and products used to help repair ligament injuries in athletes. Additionally, Zimmer Biomet is into surgery robotics. The company is positioned well for steady long-term growth as the general population ages over the coming years. Management sees its addressable market growing at a mid-single-digit rate.\nZimmer Biomet doesn't have a long dividend track record; it only began paying one in 2012. Additionally, management doesn't raise it every year. The company actively acquires other companies as part of its growth strategy, so it tries to maintain a low payout ratio. The current dividend is just 12% of its estimated 2025 earnings, so this stock has massive dividend growth potential if management decides to return more of its profits to shareholders.\nTariff concerns have weighed on the stock, but Zimmer Biomet just popped after raising its 2025 guidance on the realization that tariffs won't impact the company as severely as initially feared. There is still time to buy. Zimmer Biomet trades at just 11 times 2025 earnings estimates, a fantastic price for a proven company that Wall Street expects will grow earnings by 5% to 6% annually over the next three to five years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Zoetis right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Zoetis, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Zoetis wasn’t one of them.

Many growth stocks have made investors much richer, though not every growth stock will turn out to be a winner.\nHere are four growth stocks to consider, each of which has a promising future and a reasonable recent valuation. See which one(s) are a good fit for your long-term portfolio.\n1. Nvidia\nIt's hard not to notice Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) these days, as it has posted boffo gains over many years. Over the past 15 years, it has grown at an average annual rate of 56.1%, enough to turn $1,000 into more than $790,000! Over the past three years, it has averaged annual gains of 116.5%.\nBetter still, it's not even seeming overvalued at recent levels, with a forward-looking price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 41, roughly on par with its five-year average of 39. Nvidia has plenty of growth potential left, as it's become a key supplier of semiconductor chips for data centers (used heavily for artificial intelligence (AI) computing, among other things. Indeed, Nvidia's data center business has exploded from $3 billion to $115 billion in annual revenue over just five years, with more growth expected.\n2. Alphabet\nLike Nvidia, Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is among the \"Magnificent Seven\" fast-growing giants. Alphabet is home to not only the dominant Google search engine, but also the YouTube video platform, the Chrome browser, the Nest suite of smart home products, the Android operating system, the Google Cloud Platform, and more.\nAlphabet has become a leader in (AI), as well, incorporating it into offerings such as search. It's also a major player in cloud computing, with its Google Cloud. It has become a dividend-paying stock now, having initiated a payout in 2024 and recently increasing it by 5%.\nSome worry about Alphabet being broken up due to antitrust concerns, but that's not necessarily bad for shareholders, who may end up owning all the pieces, which could be worth more separately. Meanwhile, the stock's valuation is attractive, with its recent forward P\/E of 20, below the five-year average of 22.\n3. Waste Management\nWaste Management(NYSE: WM) is a growth stock? A trash collection and recycling specialist? Yup, it is. Consider this: Over the past 15 years, it has averaged annual gains of 14.4% -- and over the past five years and 10 years, it has averaged more than 17%.\nWaste Management should be appealing if you're at all worried about an economic slowdown or recession, as its business is fairly recession-resistant. People might put off going on vacation or buying a new refrigerator when they're financially stressed, but garbage collection will go on.\nWith a recent forward P\/E of 30, a bit above the five-year average of 27, Waste Management's stock seems only slightly overvalued. It's not easy to catch the shares when they're undervalued, so if you're a long-term believer, you might want to consider buying a few shares.\nAnother plus for the company is its dividend yield, recently 1.4%. That may not seem like a lot, but it's been growing briskly. The total annual payout was recently $3.15, up from $2.18 in 2020 and $1.54 in 2015. Waste Management offers both growth and income.\n4. Vanguard Information Technology ETF\nFinally, there's the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT). It's technically not a common stock; it's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- a fund that trades like a stock. So you can buy shares of it from any good brokerage. This ETF will instantly have you invested in more than 300 stocks, each of which is in some way a tech stock. Its top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Palantir Technologies.\nHere's why I'm suggesting you consider it as a growth stock: Over the past five years, it has averaged annual gains of 18.4%. Over the past decade and the past 15 years, its average annual gains have been 21.5% and 19.6%, respectively. This is one high-performance ETF.\nSo, give any or all of these suggestions some consideration for your long-term portfolio. Do keep in mind, though, that should the market suffer a pullback (as happens every now and then), growth stocks will often pull back more sharply than their value-stock counterparts. If you can't handle some volatility, think twice before focusing on growth stocks.\nAnd remember that for some or all of your long-term dollars, you can do quite well just sticking with a simple S&P 500 index fund, too.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,119,863!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,060% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.

I think everybody will be at a 2019 level.\"\nAmong U.S. manufacturers, inventories have roller-coasted this year as they rushed to beat Trump's deadlines for tariff hikes, only to see them repeatedly delayed. But since their post-pandemic expansion, inventories have mostly contracted, according to U.S. Institute for Supply Management data.\nInstead, \"just in time\" inventory management - which aims to increase efficiency and reduce waste by ordering goods only as they are needed - is back.\nBut how can firms run lean inventories even as tariffs fluctuate, export bans come out of the blue, and conflict rages?\nOne of the answers, they say, is artificial intelligence.\nCarpenter says he uses AI to digest the daily stream of news that could impact Toro's business, from Trump's latest social media posts to steel prices, into a custom-made podcast that he listens to each morning.\nHis team also uses generative AI to sieve an ocean of data and to suggest when and how many components to buy from whom.\nIt is a boom industry. Spending on software that includes generative AI for supply chains, capable of learning and even performing tasks on its own, could hit $55 billion by 2029, up from $2.7 billion now, according to U.S. research firm Gartner, driven in part by global uncertainties.\nHYPE\n\"The tool just puts up in front of you: 'I think you can take 100 tonnes of this product from this plant to transfer it to that plant. And you just hit accept if that makes sense (to you),\" McKinsey supply chain consultant Matt Jochim said.\nThe biggest providers of overall supply chain software by revenue are Germany's SAP, U.S. firms Oracle, Coupa and Microsoft and Blue Yonder, a unit of Panasonic, according to Gartner.\nGenerative AI is in its infancy, with most firms still piloting it spending modest amounts, industry experts say.\nThose investments can climb to tens of millions of dollars when deployed at scale, including the use of tools known as AI agents, which make their own decisions and often need costly upgrades to data management and other IT systems, they said.\nIn commenting for this article, SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL), Coupa (CPNG), Microsoft (MSFT) and Blue Yonder described strong growth for generative AI solutions for supply chains without giving numbers.\nAt U.S. supply chain consultancy GEP, which sells AI tools like this, Trump's tariffs are helping to drive demand.\n\"The tariff volatility has been big,\" says GEP consultant Mukund Acharya, an expert in retail industry supply chains.\nSAP said the uncertainty was driving technology take-up. \"That's how it was during the financial crisis, Brexit and COVID. And it's what we're seeing now,\" Richard Howells, SAP vice president and supply chain specialist, said in a statement.\nAn AI agent can sift real-time news feeds on changing tariff scenarios, assess contract renewal dates and a myriad of other data points and come up with a suggested plan of action.\nBut supply chain experts warn of AI hype, saying a lot of money will be wasted on a vain hope that AI can work miracles.\n\"AI is really a powerful enabler for supply chain resilience, but it's not a silver bullet,\" says Minna Aila, communications chief at Finnish crane-maker Konecranes and member of a business board that advises the OECD on issues including supply chain resilience.\n\"I'm still looking forward to the day when AI can predict terrorist attacks that are at sea, for instance.\"\nKonecranes' logistics partners are deploying AI on more mundane data, like weather forecasts.\nThe company makes port cranes that are up to 106 metres (348 ft) high when assembled. When shipping them, AI marries weather forecasts with data like bridge heights to optimise the route.\n\"To ship those across oceans, you do have to take into consideration weather,\" Aila says.\nRISING COSTS\nBy keeping inventories low, firms can bolster profit margins that are under pressure from rising costs. Every component or finished product sitting on a shelf is capital tied up, incurring finance and storage costs and at risk of obsolescence.\nMcKinsey has been surveying supply-chain executives since the pandemic. Its most recent survey showed that respondents relying on bigger inventory to cushion disruptions fell to 34% last year from 60% in 2022. Early responses from its upcoming 2025 survey suggest a similar picture, Jochim said.\nGartner supply chain analyst Noha Tohamy says that without AI, companies would be slower to react and be more likely to be drawn into building up inventories.\n\"When supply chain organisations don't have that visibility and don't really understand the uncertainty, we go for inventory buffering,\" Tohamy says.\nBut AI agents won't put supply chain managers out of work, not yet, consultants say. Humans still need to make strategic and big tactical decisions, leaving AI agents to do more routine tasks like ordering and scheduling production maintenance.\nToro supply chain chief Carpenter says that without AI, supply chain managers might need to run bigger teams as well.\nIs he worried that AI is coming for his job one day? \"I hope it doesn't take it until my kids get through college!\"\n(Reporting by Mark Bendeich; Editing by Sharon Singleton)","content_hash":"f62a42a4a4b5764ea23808150023e9b8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5727,"method_rank":0}

We will remain in close coordination.

The move was widely seen as a bid to get the tech giant out of Trump's crosshairs on tariffs — and appears to have worked for now.\nAltogether, analysts say the deals show just how important it is for the world's largest companies to find some tariff relief.\n\"The flurry of deal-making is an effort to secure lighter treatment from tariffs,\" Paolo Pescatore, technology analyst at PP Foresight, told CNBC by email.\n\"In some shape or form, all of the big tech companies have been negatively impacted by tariffs. They can ill afford to fork out on millions of dollars in additional fees that will further dent profits as underlined by recent quarterly earnings,\" Pescatore said.\n— Sam Meredith\nS&P 500, Nasdaq open at new intraday record highs\nBoth the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite opened at new intraday record highs on Wednesday morning.\nThe broad market index rose 0.4%, and the tech-heavy index added 0.5%.

Of course not,\" she continues. \"But job seekers can maybe breathe a little bit of a sigh of relief and say, 'OK, it really isn't just me.'\"\nA \"recipe for disaster\"\nAccording to Zety's report, workers currently face a number of obstacles in the job search, including vague job listings, slow application and interview timelines, increased competition for the same roles and being \"ghosted\" during the process.\nA primary concern is that companies are offering lower salaries, Escalera says.\n\"It's a company market right now,\" she says. \"Companies have the upper hand, which is unfortunate, and I think they're using that to their advantage by lowering salaries.\"\nHelp us help you: Take our survey on work, money and life goals\nMeanwhile, the report found that 62% of laid-off workers are dipping into their savings and emergency funds to tide them over until their next job, while 54% rely on credit cards or loans. Almost 1 in 10 laid-off workers are using government aid like SNAP to stay afloat.\nThese conditions create \"a recipe for disaster\" for workers, Escalera says, with long-term consequences for their financial stability.\n\"We're dealing with a job seeker who's likely stressed because they've been laid off, maybe a little bit desperate, feeling the financial insecurity and instability — and then finally, they land a job, and that job isn't even paying them market value,\" she says.\nEven after finding another job, their anxiety lingers: 62% of workers reported feeling very concerned that a potential recession could affect their new role.\n\"It's kind of a traumatic experience for a career professional to be laid off, especially if you didn't know it was coming,\" Escalera says.\nTop tips for job seekers\nMost job seekers are using the right tactics to secure a new role, Escalera says, but it's difficult to stand out in the current market.\n\"The basic things that we used to tell job seekers to do, all job seekers are doing,\" she says.\nThough you may feel reluctant to bring up your layoff in job applications, Escalera recommends being open about your current employment situation. According to the report, 94% of laid-off job seekers included a cover letter addressing their layoff.\n\"There is no such thing as a linear career, and so there is no reason to shy away from talking about a layoff,\" she says.\nIf you've been unemployed for several months, explaining your situation to hiring managers will help clarify the gap on your resume, Escalera says. It also gives you an opportunity to mention any programs, certificates or skills you've been working on in the interim.\nRight now, networking should be \"top of mind,\" according to Escalera: \"My advice for anyone in this job market right now is really focus on human to human interactions.\"\nYou can also find support from other job seekers, \"especially if you happen to be caught in a wave of layoffs,\" Escalera says.\n\"Being with other job seekers who are also going through it will help you validate your experiences, get the support you need, hear about what other people are doing in their job search and give you some new and fresh ideas,\" she says.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Concern about smaller sugar supplies from Brazil is boosting prices. Covrig Analytics said last Friday that reports of smaller cane yields from Brazil's sugar farmers may knock Brazil's 2025\/26 sugarcane production below 600 MMT, much lower than Brazilian government crop forecasting agency Conab's forecast of 663.4 MMT.\nAn excessive short position by funds could exacerbate any short-covering rally in sugar futures. Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds increased their net-short positions in NY sugar futures by +25,923 positions to 151,004 short positions in the week ending August 5, the most in almost 6 years.\nLast Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. On July 31, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y\/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Tuesday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 500.8 mm as of August 4, or 4% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices have retreated over the past four months, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low last month and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025\/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025\/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y\/y.\nSigns that the recent slide in sugar prices to 4-year lows has sparked a pickup in demand are positive for sugar prices. China's June sugar imports soared by 1,435% to 420,000 MT. Also, Coca-Cola agreed to use cane sugar in Coke beverages sold in the US instead of high-fructose corn syrup, which could boost US sugar consumption by +4.4% to 11.5 MMT from 11 MMT currently, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nSugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025\/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y\/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024\/25 sugar production rose +14% y\/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024\/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023\/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024\/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025\/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y\/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025\/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y\/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y\/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +25% y\/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025\/26 sugar production will climb +2% y\/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle, appearing Wednesday on CNBC, defended the call and said the firm was undeterred by Trump's criticism.\nIn a Truth Social post, the president suggested CEO David Solomon fire the economist who wrote the piece or consider resigning himself.\nHowever, if every market economist who is in the same camp on tariff impacts were to be dismissed, there would be a lot of empty desks on Wall Street.\nInflation to creep higher\nMost see at least a steady grind higher in prices as tariff clarity emerges and what looks to be effective rates around 18% — compared with around 3% at the start of the year — take root, with some caveats.\n\"It appears that the downward trend in core inflation has been broken as tariffs start to feed through into retail prices,\" UBS senior economist Brian Rose wrote. \"We expect inflation to continue on a gradual upward trend as businesses pass along their higher costs, but slowing shelter inflation and push-back from increasingly stretched consumers should help offset some of the tariff impact.\"\nNo one is predicting runaway inflation — more like monthly gains of 0.3%-0.5%. That's enough to push the Federal Reserve's preferred core measure to somewhere in the low- to mid-3% range.\nMoreover, whatever the acceleration ends up being, it's not expected to dissuade the Fed from starting to lower interest rates after staying on the sidelines through all of 2025 so far. Economists figure a deteriorating labor market along with a belief that the inflation move will be temporary will allow for easier monetary policy.\nHowever, in the near term rising inflation could hold back consumer spending and dent growth through the rest of the year. JPMorgan sees the hit to gross domestic product, two-thirds of which comes from consumption, at \"a bit under 1%.\"\nThe Blue Chip Economic Indicators report for August, which surveys the leading economic names on Wall Street, sees GDP growth averaging just 0.85% in the second half of this year. But that's actually better than the 0.75% forecast from July as some of the most pessimistic forecasters changed their outlooks on the view \"that the constraining effect of tariffs is expected to be temporary, as projected growth improves considerably next year,\" the August report said.\nWorries ahead\nCauses for concern in the near term include the Aug. 29 expiration of de minimis tariff exceptions, which had allowed goods valued at under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. That could hit retail goods in particular.\nPantheon Macroeconomics forecasts a 1 percentage point gain to core inflation, which it sees ultimately hitting 3.5% by the end of the year.\n\"Only about a quarter of that uplift has filtered through to consumers so far, so we see a strong chance core goods prices will rise at a faster pace over coming months,\" the firm said.\nBNP Paribas noted that it expects the price increases to go beyond goods as recent surveys are \"suggesting upward pressure in services input prices.\"\n\"The Fed's main worry about inflation is less the exact level and more the question of stickiness,\" the firm added in a note. \"The July [CPI] print, with surprising strength in core services, is therefore not compellingly good news.\"\nThe issue of inflation \"stickiness\" is important as well.\nThe Cleveland Fed's measure of sticky-price CPI inflation, which includes items such as rent, food away from home, insurance, household furnishings and the like, has shown a steady uptick. It's at 3.8% on a three-month annualized basis, the highest since May 2024. Flexible-price inflation, such as food, energy and motor vehicle parts, is running much lower.\n\"Tariffs will lead to higher inflation in the months ahead,\" PNC chief economist Gus Faucher wrote. \"With the core CPI picking up in July, and higher prices coming as businesses pass along higher tariff costs to their customers, core PCE inflation is set to move even further above the Fed's target in the months ahead.\"\nThough most of the Street expects the path to rate cuts opening, higher inflation could give policymakers some hesitation even with a weaker labor market, Faucher said.","content_hash":"9c1bf8c64d7c5fa9bf47afc51d7a6366","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5307,"method_rank":0}

Tata Consultancy Services, one of the country's biggest private sector employers, announced last month that more than 12,000 staff in mostly middle and senior management roles would be cut. That accounts for around 2% of TCS' global workforce, making it one of India's biggest IT layoffs thus far . The company attributed the layoffs to mismatched skillsets , but others cited automation as a factor. Elsewhere, Infosys has reportedly slowed down fresher recruitment while Wipro has trimmed roles. The layoffs add a layer of uncertainty to the sector, as firms such as TCS and Infosys recently reported muted earnings growth . \"Indian IT services companies exploded over the last six months and we've gradually reduced our positions and sold all of them in our portfolio,\" said Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors' Asia ex Japan equity team. Duhra had held Infosys and HCL Technologies ' shares in his portfolio but gradually sold them off in the last few quarters. \"The level of growth for Indian IT stocks is really low single digit at best. And for that kind of growth, valuation and yield, it doesn't make any sense to own it in Asia-Pacific where there are opportunities to buy much cheaper companies with higher yield and growth,\" Duhra said. Indian versus Asian tech stocks The portfolio manager sees better opportunities in other markets in the region. Some of them have better yields, valuations and \"massive upside and transformation\" than their counterparts in India, he added, naming Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings as examples. India's Nifty IT Index — which comprises 10 Indian IT companies listed on the National Stock Exchange — has plunged nearly 20% so far this year, underperforming the 22.2% surge in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index and the 12.16% gain in the Nasdq-100 Technology Sector Index. The specialization of Indian tech firms is fundamentally different from that of their regional counterparts, said Abhishek Bhandari, executive director at Nomura. He also added that the weight of IT stocks in India's indices is only in the \"early teens,\" unlike in other economies. Indian tech companies are services-oriented and typically support the IT functions of global conglomerates, he said. That means they're often affected by headwinds from a slowing economy, weaker currency and tariff uncertainties. By contrast, tech firms in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan predominantly specialize in hardware and semiconductors, Bhandari said. The generative artificial intelligence boom, he added, has given them \"positive tailwinds\" because of their higher expenditure on hardware. Not a unique problem But Vikas Pershad, portfolio manager for Asian equities at M & G Investments, said the problems arising from automation that Indian tech firms face are not unique to the country. \"Tech companies across the region are reassessing staffing needs in light of automation and AI. At the same time though, we are seeing new opportunities emerge for those firms integrating AI meaningfully into their workflows,\" he told CNBC Pro . Nevertheless, although the worst of the layoffs by India's tech giants appear to be behind us, the portfolio manager said, their effects have spread to other sectors. Pershad remains underweight on the sector, saying it's \"difficult to make a case for an uptick in valuations given the current earnings outlook and the starting point for valuations.\" \"An inflection point, driven by stronger revenues, improved margins or valuations, or a re-rating of the business model, does not appear to be in our base case at this time,\" he added. Stock picks But despite the bleak outlook, Nomura's Bhandari is \"largely neutral on the overall sector,\" and sees pockets of opportunities. Infosys is his \"top-pick\" among large-cap Indian IT services players. \"We expect Infosys to post 3.8% y-y USD revenue growth in FY26F (including around 40 basis from acquisitions ),\" he said, adding that he has a buy rating at a price target of 1,880 Indian rupees ($21.47), giving it 31.86% upside potential. Bhandari also pointed out that the company added 210 staff in its fiscal first quarter ended June, which represents a quarter-on-quarter growth rate of around 0.1% after accounting for attrition. Another plus is Infosys' plans to hire 20,000 graduates this year, he added. Nomura has a buy rating on the stock at a price target of $97, giving it 41.05% upside potential from its Tuesday close. Elsewhere, Bhandari has his eye on mid-caps in India's IT sector, as he expects them to \"generally do better\" than large-cap names from a growth perspective. \"Their growth has now become almost 2-4 times the industry level,\" he added. Coforge is Bhandari's \"preferred pick\" in this segment, as he forecasts it can \"easily deliver around 30% revenue growth this year — multiples of what large-caps are going to do.\" Of 34 analysts covering the stock, 23 give it a buy or overweight rating, four have a hold rating, while seven have a sell or underweight call, according to FactSet data. The analysts have an average price target of 1,895.32 Indian rupees for the stock, giving it 16.7% upside potential.","content_hash":"e5ffe41235191eff4a119a8113d6dcc2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5289,"method_rank":0}

Such price action points to problems investors either did not understand previously or ignored for whatever reason. This is likely the case with The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) after announcing its earnings for the second quarter of 2025, and the price fell 39% the following trading day.\nIn The Trade Desk's case, investors dealt with elevated expectations and valuations. They have also become increasingly aware of the effects of the \"walled gardens\" that limit engagement with the largest ad platforms such as Alphabet's Google and Amazon.\nDespite such concerns, The Trade Desk may still be a buy, and here is why investors should still consider owning this stock that is widening its competitive moat through artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe Trade Desk's Q2 earnings\nFor the second time this year, the stock fell after releasing an earnings report that arguably brought more positives than negatives.\nIts second-quarter revenue was $694 million, a 19% yearly increase and slightly ahead of analyst expectations. The company also beat analyst estimates on earnings, though the $90 million in net income rose by 6% compared to year-ago levels, primarily due to a 56% in its provision for income taxes.\nStill, the company's third-quarter revenue forecast of $717 million fell slightly short of expectations. It also implied a 14% yearly growth rate, increasing concerns over the company's long-term growth.\nThe company announced the departure of its chief financial officer. When combined with the increased concerns over the \"walled gardens\" eating into market share and a pre-announcement price-to-earnings ratio (P\/E) of 108, that could have prompted investors to rethink what had become an elevated valuation.\nThis decline slightly surpasses its one-day drop following fourth-quarter earnings, when investors sold the stock after it missed its own revenue target for the quarter. Although The Trade Desk's stock rose after first-quarter earnings, this may undermine investor confidence.\nWhy investors should consider buying The Trade Desk anyway\nNonetheless, the sell-off has made the valuation more attractive. The trailing P\/E that was 108 has now fallen to 65. Moreover, the stock sells for 31 times forward earnings.\nEven if revenue growth slows to 14%, that could still prompt rapid net income growth at the same time investors become more accustomed to a tax rate more fitting of a consistently profitable company.\nFurthermore, AI is on track to supercharge this growth. The company is in the process of switching from Solimar to Kokai. Solimar specializes in optimizing digital ad campaigns, but with the AI-driven Kokai platform, users have a more holistic approach to media buying, applying deep-learning algorithms to every aspect of the process.\nThus, Kokai leverages AI for better forecasting, predictive bidding, and impression scoring. Moreover, it enables users to allocate ad budgets more effectively and curate premium ad inventory.\nAnd The Trade Desk offers a neutral platform targeting digital ad opportunities on every platform. This lack of bias helps advertisers and ad agencies place ads where they can best perform, unencumbered by biases that a Google or Amazon might have toward those platforms.\nFurthermore, the numbers are likely lower amid a sluggish economy. Still, that price action is probably cyclical, and the predictions for 17% revenue growth in 2025 and 18% the following year do not point to a significant slowdown. That means growth could easily accelerate, reinforcing the buy case for the stock.\nThe Trade Desk buying opportunity\nAmid the considerable drop in the stock price, investors have a tremendous opportunity to buy it at a significant discount. Indeed, the sell-off is the second huge post-earnings sell-off over three quarters, and such price behavior could diminish confidence in the stock.\nHowever, thanks to the discounted price, the forward P\/E of 30 makes the stock particularly attractive. Also, forecasts so far indicate that the slowing to 14% revenue growth may be temporary. Assuming a reacceleration of revenue growth occurs, investors will likely wish they had bought shares at current prices.\nShould you buy stock in The Trade Desk right now?\nBefore you buy stock in The Trade Desk, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and The Trade Desk wasn’t one of them.

The company provides software for design and website creation. It's ideal for collaborating on projects. Back in 2022, Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) announced plans to acquire Figma for $20 billion, as it saw the business as a big part of its long-term growth. Regulatory hurdles, however, led to the deal being abandoned.\nNow, anyone can invest in Figma. And after the first few days of trading, the stock looked to be in high demand, hitting a high of just under $143 on Aug. 1 after opening at $85 the previous day. But since then, the stock has been sliding, as investors appear to be growing worried about its rapidly rising valuation.\nAre the concerns about Figma's valuation justified, or is the market simply taking a breather from a hot start? Here are the bullish and bearish cases for investing in Figma today.\nThe bullish case for investing in Figma\nOne of the attractive features of Figma is that it offers relatively affordable plans. For professionals, plans that feature Figma's full suite of design products cost just $16 per month. With Adobe, just a subscription to Photoshop alone costs $23 per month. And for the full suite of Creative Cloud products, users can pay as much as $70 per month.\nFigma may be appealing to users who don't need the advanced capabilities that come with Photoshop and other Adobe products. At a time when consumers are looking to cut costs, Figma's products can be attractive alternatives, especially since they make collaboration easy. Figma's business was enticing enough for Adobe to pursue it, but regulators in Europe saw the companies as potential competitors in the future, which is ultimately why the acquisition fell through.\nThe proof of Figma's popularity is evident in its strong growth. Last year, the company's revenue totaled $749 million, which was an increase of 48% year over year. And through the first three months of 2025, its sales totaled $228 million, representing a 46% increase.\nThe company currently has a net dollar retention rate of 132%, which means consumers are spending more with the business now than they did in the previous year. And a staggering 95% of Fortune 500 companies use Figma, with two-thirds of its users being non-designers, highlighting just how easy its software is to use.\nThe bearish cash for avoiding Figma\nFigma's business is promising, but it also comes with risks. A big one is a lack of profitability. In each of the past two years, the company has reported an operating loss. And while this year, it has been doing well, through the first three months, its earnings per share (EPS) totaled just $0.04. That would translate into an annualized EPS of $0.16 -- putting it at a price-to-earnings multiple of close to 500, given a share price of around $80. Even with respect to sales, the stock is expensive, trading at a price-to-revenue multiple of around 50.\nWhile the company has high gross margins, its operating expenses are also high. In the most recent quarter, they accounted for approximately three-quarters of Figma's top line. Without lower overhead and operating costs, it's going to be difficult for the company to generate much earnings growth.\nWhen investors are paying such high multiples for a business, they are effectively paying a premium for future growth. The problem is that artificial intelligence is enhancing many design tools and, thus, can give users many more alternatives. Such alternatives may even be more advanced than Figma's. That can make it challenging for the company to continue to grow at a rate fast enough to justify its high valuation. Amid slowing growth, the stock's valuation could drop drastically.\nShould you buy Figma stock today?\nFigma may seem like the shiny new tech stock to own right now, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it. There's growing competition in the design space, and for users looking to cut costs, there are plenty of free options to consider (I've been a Gimp user for years), which is why I'm not sold on Figma's long-term growth potential. It's doing well right now, but that's while its numbers still aren't all that big.\nUnless Figma's stock comes down significantly in price, I would steer clear of it.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Figma right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Figma, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Figma wasn’t one of them.

The latest to join this list is Firefly Aerospace (FLY), a space and defense technology company.\nClosing at $60.35 on Aug. 7, much above its expected IPO price range of $41 to $43, shares of the company have corrected to trade near $54 currently. Thus, the question remains whether investors should look beyond the volatility of the share price and add Firefly to their portfolios. Let’s find out.\nFounded in 2014, Firefly develops small- to medium-lift rockets, lunar landers, and on-orbit infrastructure. Its mission is to make space missions affordable, reliable, and end-to-end, spanning Earth launch to lunar surface operations.\nFirefly counts some key defense contractors such as L3Harris (LHX), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as its partners.\nIncreasing Revenues, Widening Losses\nFirefly has seen its revenues multiply but losses widen as well over the past year.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2025, Firefly’s revenues stood at $55.86 million. This was almost 7 times higher than the previous year’s figure of $8.32 million. Spacecraft solutions revenue surged to $50.69 million from $7.01 million in the prior year, and launch revenue of $5.17 million was much higher than the prior year's $1.30 million as well.\nIn 2024, the company reported revenues of $60.79 million for the full year, up from $55.23 million in 2023.\nNet losses widened to $60.09 million in the quarter from $52.77 million in the year-ago period. On a per stock basis, the losses were at $1.65 compared to $1.43 in the previous year. 2024 saw the company report losses of $231.13 million compared to $135.46 million in 2023.\nComing to its backlog, a key indicator of the demand for a company’s solutions, it stood at $1.12 billion at the end of March 31, 2025. This was double the previous year’s figure of $559.37 million.\nNet cash flow from operating activities remained negative at $56.53 million for the quarter, lower than the previous year’s $60.58 million outflow. Overall, Firefly’s cash balance at the end of the quarter stood at $176.88 million, which was much higher than its short-term debt levels of about $8 million.\nDoes Firefly Have The Wings to Fly High?\nThe sky in which Firefly wishes to spread its wings is quite large. Overall, consulting major McKinsey sees space to be a whopping $1.8 trillion opportunity.\nBut the moot question is: Is Firefly's wings big enough?\nThe company’s portfolio is anchored by two primary launch vehicles, Alpha and Eclipse. Eclipse, developed in collaboration with Northrop Grumman, is capable of carrying payloads of about 16,000 kgs, while Alpha supports payloads of about 1,000 kgs. Beyond launch services, revenue streams are also derived from its spacecraft solutions segment. This includes the Blue Ghost Lander, designed for lunar surface missions, and Elytra, intended for applications such as space domain awareness and other mission-critical activities.\nNotably, the addressable market for these offerings is expanding rapidly, propelled by growing demand for satellites serving both commercial and defense purposes. Growth is also underpinned by renewed strategic interest in defense capabilities in space and an accelerating push toward broader space exploration initiatives. These include potential ventures in extraterrestrial resource extraction and space-based energy generation.\nFirefly has also positioned itself prominently within the space industry by claiming the first successful commercial lunar landing. The company maintains active contractual relationships with NASA, the U.S. Space Force, and multiple defense entities. Further, product development efforts are also advancing, with Elytra, co-developed with Lockheed Martin, envisioned as a reusable vehicle. Preparations are underway for its inaugural mission, planned as a test flight within the current year. In parallel, the company is developing Ocula, a lunar imaging service designed to assist in identifying suitable landing sites and mapping mineral resources on the Moon’s surface.\nHowever, competition remains fierce in this domain with cash-rich names like Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Amazon’s (AMZN) Project Kuiper in the fray along with direct competitors such as Rocket Labs (RKLB) and Intuitive Machines (LUNR). Further, space is a capital-intensive industry where the margin of error is minuscule. Thus, any product failure exposes the company to a significant decline.\nThe Bottom Line on FLY Stock\nFirefly Aerospace’s impressive IPO and rapidly growing revenues highlight its strong positioning. However, widening losses, steep competition from industry giants, and the high-risk, capital-intensive nature of the space industry mean the stock may face turbulence ahead.\nInvestors will need to weigh its long-term growth potential against near-term financial volatility.\nOn the date of publication, Pathikrit Bose did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The SPDR S&P Retail ETF(NYSEMKT: XRT) posted a total return of 12% over the last year, far behind the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index's 19%. Stretching the view to a four-year span is even worse. The S&P 500 saw a 44% total return in this period, as of Aug. 11, while the leading exchange-traded fund (ETF) of retailer stocks saw a negative-10% return.\nBig-box retail veteran and dividend kingTarget(NYSE: TGT) has lagged behind the broader market and the retail sector in these periods. It's not a close race, and the four-year overview is kind of scary:\nBut I think Target is poised for a robust rebound, starting from this low point. The company is getting back to the brand experience people used to love, under the mock-French \"Tar-zhay\" banner.\nTarget shouldn't try to out-bargain the low-cost kings\nTarget's management has figured out that the company can't compete with archrivals Walmart(NYSE: WMT) and Costco(NASDAQ: COST) on price alone. That strategy has been tried and abandoned, as the penny-pinching marketing message fell flat. As a result, Target's sales have been swooning since 2022 while Costco and Walmart experienced revenue growth of more than 16%.\nIt's not a complete disaster for Target, though.\nBalancing out the slower sales, Target's profit margins are among the best in the business. Walmart's and Costco's focus on affordable goods leaves them with slim margins across the board. Target's customers are prepared to pay a little more for a better shopping experience. Target's strong margins are not new, but I'd like to point out that they have stayed in the lead despite the recent revenue challenges.\nThe fancy French twist has deep roots\nThe playful Tar-zhay moniker is also a pretty old idea. I mean that both as a cultural phenomenon and a business strategy.\nTarget embraced the glitzy twist on its name in 2017, along with a new set of store-brand names for different product types. The commitment didn't really stick, as Target never really built its marketing around the Frenchified name itself, but the idea has been explored before. And long before that, I found a lot of people in the upper-crust parts of Miami and Jacksonville using the French-flavored Target name unironically. This was in the late 1990s.\nSo Tar-zhay is a well-known little twist on the Target brand, reflecting a common view of its stores as a nicer place to shop. You don't go to Tar-zhay when you want the lowest price on bananas, jeans, and cat food. That's what Costco and Walmart are for. Here, you're supposed to enjoy the shopping experience in wider aisles with better lighting and maintenance. Human assistance should be easy to find. And the store brands exude a certain je ne sais quoi that even Costco's Kirkland can't always match.\nPremium Tar-zhay shares at a discount -- where do I sign up?\nIn that sense, the renewed Tar-zhay strategy takes Target back to a proven success story. I mean, it's not a top-shelf luxury store like RH(NYSE: RH) or the Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) store. But it's also a significant step above Walmart's extreme bargain hunt or Costco's overcrowded warehouses.\nTarget's leadership has rediscovered this longtime business advantage, and is busy rebuilding that modestly high-end reputation in 2025.\nMeanwhile, Target's stock is on fire sale. After years of underperforming the stock market and retail sector, Target shares carry the bargain-bin valuation of 11.4 times earnings and 0.45 times sales. The stock could double or even triple in price and still look affordable next to Walmart or Costco.\nAnd if you buy Target shares right now, you're locking in a generous 4.4% dividend yield -- miles ahead of Walmart's 0.9% and Costco's 0.5%, and near the highest yields in Target's dividend-paying history.\nTurnaround stories don't always have happy endings, but this one is off to a good start.

In recent days, there have been a series of upgrades and price target increases as the market reassesses the idea of CyberArk becoming part of Palo Alto. The deal talks were first rumored on July 29, and the stock sank 5.2%. The next day, Palo Alto officially announced its $25 billion offer to buy CyberArk, and shares lost another 5.6%. The day after that, the stock lost nearly 5.2%. The losing streak, which extended three more sessions, finally ended on Aug. 6 — but not before shares fell 17.5% on worries about the price tag of the deal. Palo Alto stock has since recovered some of those declines. Deutsche Bank, late Tuesday, was the latest to upgrade Palo Alto to a buy rating from hold. It also raised its price target to $220 per share from $200. Piper Sandler also upgraded Palo Alto stock this week to an overweight buy from neutral and increased its price target to $225 from $200. Last week, Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $496 from $380. Analysts from all three firms cited the growth potential of the CyberArk deal. Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club, said Wednesday that CyberArk is the \"missing piece\" of identity security, allowing Palo Alto to enhance its platformization strategy, which is all about getting customers to buy entire suites of products and consolidate all their cybersecurity spending under one roof. Jim Cramer doubled down Wednesday, saying Palo Alto's bid for CyberArk was \"shrewd,\" given the addition of a new solution to its product portfolio. Jim called the recent weakness in Palo Alto shares a \"buying opportunity,\" as he first did on July 30 in the teeth of the decline. The Club finally got to buy more shares Monday, when our trading restrictions on the stock lifted. We have our buy-equivalent 1 rating on the stock and a $225 price target. In addition to the deal premium, the bears have also misinterpreted the motivation behind the CyberArk deal, assuming Palo Alto's core business must be doing poorly. Jim said on Tuesday that such \"chatter is wrong,\" stressing the company \"wouldn't be buying CyberArk if their business were falling apart.\" He added, \"I think Palo Alto is doing incredibly well.\" The company stands to do even better when considering identity security accounts for about 25% of enterprise security spending, according to Deutsche Bank. The analysts called CyberArk a \"meaningful organic accelerant\" to Palo Alto's already strong business and argued the stock underperforming the broader cyber sector by 15% year to date is \"overblown.\" Piper Sandler analysts referred to CyberArk as a \"very high-quality asset\" that fills a large gap in the company's portfolio and sees a favorable share setup from current levels. Morgan Stanley also sees the acquisition as a \"clear strategic fit\" given the long-term artificial intelligence security opportunity and increasing consolidation in the cybersecurity space. PANW 5Y mountain Palo Alto Networks 5 year performance Palo Alto stock has a track record of getting dinged when it makes strategic decisions. When CEO Nikesh Arora first introduced platformization in February 2024, the stock got crushed, losing more than 28% in one session and closing just below $131. The strategy has proved to be a massive success — and a year later, shares hit a record high of $208 on Feb. 18. Before the CyberArk-driven plunge, Palo Alto stock was less than $4 per share away from that record. We viewed this indiscriminate selling as short-sighted. As long-term investors in the name, it was a chance to bulk up our position at a discount. Palo Alto is scheduled to report fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter results after Monday's close. We'll be anxious to see the numbers and hear more about the CyberArk deal and Palo Alto's business overall during the post-earnings conference call. Palo Alto is one of two cybersecurity companies in the Club portfolio, in recognition of the critical importance in a world of rising digital threats. The other one is CrowdStrike , which does offer identity protection services as part of its Falcon platform. We currently have a hold-equivalent 2 rating on CrowdStrike and a $520 price target.

Typically, people lean into escapism to avoid following through on obligations like cleaning the house or completing a project, or having challenging conversations.\n\"It's doing the thing instead, that is the escapism. Doing it because is self-care,\" Sarkis says.\nPeople can often confuse the two, she explains, but there are some distinct differences. Here's how you can differentiate self-care from escapism.\nSelf-care or escapism? Here's how to spot the difference\nConsider how what you're doing makes you feel\nThe same activity could be viewed as self-care or escapism depending on how it makes you feel. Let's use reading as an example.\n\"You could do it as a self-care strategy, like 'Hey, I've had a long day. I think I just need to sit with a book a little bit and read something and just unwind,'\" Sarkis says.\n\"Escapism is, 'I gotta call these people for work, and I really don't want to do it. I think I'll read instead.'\"\nWhen you're doing something for self-care, you'll feel more grounded, present, relaxed and better about life in general, she notes. While escapism tends to make people feel regret, remorse or even anger at themselves.\nAsk yourself these 3 questions\nIf you're unsure what your intention is before engaging in an activity, Sarkis says it could be helpful to ask yourself a few questions:\n- Does it feel like I'm avoiding, or does it feel like I need to do this because it's important to check in with myself?\n- Am I doing this because I want to enrich myself, or am I doing this because I need to check out for a while?\n- Am I doing this as almost a form of dissociation, or am I doing this to be more present?\n\"When you are escaping, your brain may be still on that task that you're supposed to be doing, or that event or trauma you need to work on,\" Sarkis says.\n\"But when you're doing it for self-care, you're actually able to be more present and be aware that you're doing it.\"\nTo shift out of escapism, focus on what you can change\nSome level of escapism every now and then is fine, and should be expected, Sarkis says. \"It might actually be appropriate for the moment, until we can collect our thoughts,\" she notes.\n\"Maybe you can change it into a self-care activity [by] letting go of the shame and blame, and looking at it more as, 'I deserve to take a rest.'\"\nBut frequent escapism can be a sign of chronic stress, Sarkis says. When you're avoiding tasks constantly, it can indicate that you feel out of control of your life, with too many things on your plate.\nConstantly seeking an escape from your reality can have long-term consequences like \"an erosion of self-esteem, because you're not dealing with the things you need to deal with,\" she says.\n\"You may have increased cortisol levels. You may have some physical effects from it, because you aren't taking care of the thing that you should be taking care of. And that stuff can stack up on us, not only emotionally, but physically as well. It can lead to missed deadlines. [And] it can lead to maybe not fully participating in your life.\"\nTo shift out of practicing escapism too often, you should first ask yourself why you're engaging in it in the first place, Sarkis suggests.\nThen, consider which resources or support systems you can tap into to help you break out of it, whether that means talking to a mental health professional for guidance, speaking with your supervisor about managing your workload or hiring a specialist to help you declutter your home.\n\"It's really examining, 'What things can I change?'\" Sarkis says.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

That alliance is now paying off, CEO Alexandre L'Heureux said on a second-quarter earnings call Aug. 7.\n“In our bidding group … we believe that very soon we will be able to reduce some of our human output by close to 80%,” L’Heureux said. “So that's not de minimis, because we have bidding groups across each and every segment and across each and every country. So that's an example of where we feel we can make a tremendous improvement and reduce human intervention.”\nIt’s not just AI creating those results, though: In the past decade, the Montreal-based construction giant’s revenue per employee has seen constant growth while labor became cheaper, according to L’Heureux.\n“Our revenue at the moment is growing much faster than our headcount,” L’Heureux said. “That's why today, unlike perhaps five, six, seven years ago, I am not talking as much about headcount as we used to. To me, it's becoming more irrelevant.”\nAlthough the market is still “very, very dynamic,” WSP has not seen much election-related disruption amid recent or upcoming votes in major markets including New Zealand, the U.K., Australia, Canada and the U.S., according to L'Heureux.\nEven with regime change in the U.S. and U.K., infrastructure spending remains a top priority for both of those countries, L’Heureux said. Although President Donald Trump’s administration has brought some shifts in priorities — for instance, away from renewables and towards fossil fuels — he aims to facilitate and expedite investment.\nProjects and sectors\nData centers and related projects remain hot, with “robust activity across all of our geographies,” according to L’Heureux.\n“Mandates encompass site acquisition, due diligence, master planning for new AI factories, greenfield data center design projects, brownfield data center upgrades and the growing power and water infrastructure demand,” L’Heureux said.\nWSP has also seen “tremendous growth in power generation,” L’Heureux said, citing thermal and nuclear energy in particular. To that end, Power Engineers, the Hailey, Idaho-based engineering and environmental consulting firm it purchased in August 2024, had an organic growth rate of 16% this quarter.\n“It was a must-do deal, and I'm extremely pleased that we completed this acquisition. It's very, very strategic for our platform,” L’Heureux said. “I'm feeling very bullish on this acquisition and very bullish around this [power generation] sector.”\nWater continues to benefit from investment across most of WSP’s geographies, L’Heureux said. The firm recently secured a role in an Ontario wastewater treatment plant expansion, as well as a major PFAS project for the U.S. Air Force in the Midwest that “shows our strong position in the combined defense and water markets,” according to L’Heureux.\nDespite the Trump administration’s reversal of environmental projects and protections, WSP’s environmental backlog has continued to grow, even in the U.S., L’Heureux said. In particular, WSP’s biodiversity and marine expertise are in high demand in Canada.\nThe transportation infrastructure sector, including rail, continued to perform well, per L’Heureux. WSP won a role in the $3.9 billion Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel project in Virginia, as well as in the new terminal of Perth International Airport in Australia.\nBy the numbers\nWSP reported revenues of $4.5 billion Canadian dollars ($3.3 billion) in its second quarter earnings, up 14.6% from CA$3.9 billion in Q2 2024. The firm’s profits grew to CA$279 million in Q2 2025, up nearly 52% from the same period last year.\nBacklog stood at CA$16.3 billion, a 10.9% increase from Q2 2024.\nThat was due mostly to continued strong performance in Canada, the Americas and Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, according to WSP CFO Alain Michaud, and to the fact that WSP reduced its presence in the Asia-Pacific region in the first half of the year after its performance slowed.\n“Clients are recognizing the expertise that we bring to the table,” L’Heureux said. “It allows us to be more selective in the projects that we undertake, but it also allows us to charge for the great work that our engineers are doing.”\nMore M&A\nAlthough L’Heureux noted last quarter that election-related uncertainty was dampening the M&A market, he said his firm is continuing to pursue merger and acquisition opportunities.\nIn June WSP acquired Lexica, a U.K.-headquartered consulting firm specializing in healthcare and life sciences, which adds 90 experts to the firm’s Planning, Property and Advisory business in the region and forms a new Healthcare and Life Sciences Advisory team.\nWSP also announced an agreement in June to purchase the U.K.-based consultancy Ricardo, which delivers strategic advisory and engineering solutions that intersect the global transport, energy and environment agenda.","content_hash":"584f3475648a2a62d628d6b5132f206f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5014,"method_rank":0}

CoreWeave — which rents out Nvidia chips to companies — posted second-quarter revenue of $1.21 billion, above the $1.08 billion that analysts surveyed by LSEG had estimated. The company also issued better-than-expected forward guidance. While CoreWeave shares more than doubled over the past three months, soaring 107%, the stock was down 12% in early trading Wednesday. CRWV 1D mountain CRWV, 1-day Some analysts said the move lower could be tied to lock-up expiration effective at the close of the market on Thursday — when insiders will be allowed to start selling shares following the company's March initial public offering — which could also affect CoreWeave's planned takeover of Core Scientific . Nvidia owned about a 5% stake in CoreWeave at the time of its IPO. \"This could have direct implications for the announced all-stock acquisition of CORZ as the implied valuation is directly tied to the performance of CRWV's stock,\" said Citizens JMP analyst Greg Miller, who rates CoreWeave as market perform. \"As such, we believe any downward pressure resulting from increased share supply or insider selling could affect the deal dynamics and increase investor opposition.\" While the lock-up expiration adds one element of uncertainty, investors may also be questioning CoreWeave's operating cash flow and planned capital spending, which \"again disappointed in-quarter,\" Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow, who rates the stock equal weight, said. In fact, most of the Street only has a neutral view of CoreWeave, with 16 of 24 analysts rating it a hold, according to LSEG. Only five rate it a strong buy or buy. Here's what other analysts said about CoreWeave on the heels of its results. Morgan Stanley: Equal-weight rating, $91 price target Analyst Keith Weiss' target implies downside potential of almost 39% from Tuesday's close. \"Bottom line, accruing and expanding large contracts from the most demanding GenAI users provide strong validation of CoreWeave's strong positioning for the ramping GPU build-out, broadening the customer base likely proves key to increasing investor confidence in the durability of this growth. … While we remain on the sidelines awaiting further evidence of the broadening of the software story at CoreWeave, for investors with strong conviction in the build-out of the GPU economy and longer-term investment horizons, CRWV should be considered as a core holding.\" JPMorgan: Overweight, $135 Analyst Mark Murphy's target calls for more than 9% downside compared with where CoreWeave closed Tuesday. \"The fundamental drivers and business trends remain very solid, with the company speaking to strong demand that is outstripping supply and conveying robust pipeline momentum. … Net-net, there could be a wide range of outcomes for CoreWeave. For this reason, we expect the stock to provide a wild, lumpy, volatile ride, requiring a risk tolerance that may not exist for most investors. If we end up with heightened economic volatility, CRWV shares would probably suffer disproportionately due to risk-off positioning. However, our sense is that investors are pricing in the glass-half-empty view more than the other view.\" Citigroup: Buy, $160 Analyst Tyler Radke sees more than 7% upside potential. \"CoreWeave notched another impressive revenue beat with slightly greater $ upside vs. last quarter and a strong Q3 revenue\/FY25 guidance raise (+$159M). Though a strong revenue performance, the booking\/capex figures were not as spectacular with incremental backlog additions (ex previously announced OpenAI contract) at just $200M, while profitability was mixed (EBIT beat but EBIT $s reiterated for the full year on higher spending). That said, guidance implies a significant ramp in capex\/revenue acceleration in Q4 which is likely driven by Blackwell and significant data capacity online, which we see as a positive catalyst ahead. … we'd expect shares to be volatile but expect weakness to be bought with AI demand remaining strong and revenue acceleration ahead.\" Bank of America: Neutral, $168 Analyst Brad Sills' target implies about 13% upside. \"While the magnitudes of the Q2 topline beat and Q3 raise were slightly below the Q1 print, results were solid, validating that CoreWeave remains well positioned as a leading AI infrastructure vendor. … the lockup expires on Friday, which is likely to place pressure on the shares … we believe CoreWeave remains well positioned to benefit from a ramping AI infrastructure industry.\" Stifel: Hold, $120 Analyst Ruben Roy's target would equal more than 19% downside. \"We remain constructive long term and are encouraged by today's data points, but see near-term upside capped by the potential CORZ related dilution and uncertainty, and the pending lock-up expiration on Thursday.\"","content_hash":"a214d78df9dffcdad65e9bc248eca374","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4946,"method_rank":0}

According to most lists, SpaceX is the most valuable private company in the world. Unfortunately, Musk has given no indication that he is even remotely interested in taking SpaceX public.\nHowever, there's another possibility that could be interesting. SpaceX is the parent company of the Starlink satellite internet service, and there is a strong possibility that Starlink could be spun off at some point and go public, either by the traditional IPO process or via special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.\nWhat we know, and what we don't\nOne thing we know with near certainty is that SpaceX is unlikely to go public in its entirety -- at least not anytime soon. But SpaceX could spin off Starlink and take it public as a standalone business, and most reports and comments from insiders have indicated that it's the most likely route the company could take.\nWe also know that CEO Elon Musk has addressed this issue several times. In fact, one of the reasons that many investors think a Starlink IPO could be coming soon is that in 2022, Musk told SpaceX employees that a Starlink IPO wasn't likely until 2025 or later. He said that the business needed to achieve predictability and to be \"in a smooth sailing situation\" before an IPO, and with most reports indicating that Starlink is nicely profitable and generating billions in recurring revenue, there's an argument to be made that Musk's benchmarks have been met.\nOn the other hand, in a 2023 post on X, Musk told investors that Starlink wasn't having any problems raising money through private investors, and therefore it didn't make sense to go through the trouble of taking Starlink public.\nMore recently, Musk said at a 2025 conference that it's \"possible that Starlink may go public at some point in the future,\" but he didn't seem to be in any rush to make it happen.\nHow much could Starlink be worth as a public company?\nSpaceX, the parent of Starlink, is reportedly valued at about $400 billion in the private markets, based on a $1 billion share sale in July.\nWhen it comes to the standalone value of Starlink, which makes up the bulk of SpaceX's revenue according to most estimates, it's a little more difficult. Plus, the potential valuation depends on whom you ask. One analyst estimates that Starlink will reach $12.3 billion in revenue in 2025.\nAs far as how this might translate into a market value, estimates have varied widely. Most estimates have been in the $30 billion to $100 billion range, although billionaire investor Ron Baron said that Starlink will go public at a valuation in the $250 billion to $300 billion range, but that it won't happen until about 2027.\nThe bottom line\nWhile a Starlink (or SpaceX) IPO isn't out of the question, I don't view it as likely to happen in 2025. For one thing, Starlink has become a cash machine for SpaceX and is instrumental in funding its development. And as we've seen with virtually every private funding round and stock sale, SpaceX has absolutely no difficulty in raising money through private investors. As mentioned, Musk indicated this in a 2023 post, and I'd argue that it's even easier for Starlink to raise money now.\nIf Starlink does go public, I'd say there's a higher probability of a traditional IPO than a SPAC. It would likely be the largest SPAC target of all time if it chooses that route, and while both processes have their pros and cons, the poor record of SPAC IPO performance might scare Musk away from this route.\nTo sum it up, I'm not holding my breath for a Starlink IPO in 2025, even though Musk has said that he'd eventually like to do one. It may come later, but I just don't see Musk in any particular rush to take the company public.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

So, something's got to give.\"\nMeshnick noted that the CapEx has grown dramatically for AI companies.\n\"As revenues grow, they're also spending more money to continue that growth rate,\" he said. \"And so they're probably looking more like a manufacturing company.\"\nThe panel discussed opportunities in the current market and Meisler said that in this earnings season even if a company meets or beats Wall Street's expectations, the stock is gapping down or going nowhere.\nFocusing on 'macro safe havens'\n\"We're having a lot more gapping down in July, and you have a lot more stocks that are going nowhere,\" she said. \"The majority of stocks right now have been in a correction for six or seven weeks. And it seems to me they're probably still in a correction.\"\n\"I think a lot of people were happy about what happened in April,\" Weidner said. \"It gave them an opportunity to buy up. I think a lot of large wealth managers were happy to buy that dip for their clients.\"\n\"A lot of people bet on American exceptionalism, for what it's worth,\" he continued. \"I don't know if a lot of people see the long tail of what's going to happen, but they saw a dip and they bought it, and we are back where we started. We're well-above where we started.\"\nLlanes said he was focusing on what he called \"macro safe havens,\" such as gold, mining, and as well as \"the AI tailwind concept that made quite a bit of money on Palantir, Nvidia, and surrounding.\"\n\"I still think that that trend is in play,\" he said. \"There is some consumer resilience in certain areas. DoorDash. And then the re-industrialization, like CSX. Freight is likely to continue and actually to improve.\"\nLlanes said his biggest position currently focused on growth in the slowdown, such Hershey (HSY) --\"which everybody hated\"-- and Constellation Brands (STZ) .\n\"I've always talked about quality valuation, evaluation, and technicals,\" he said. \"The best investments that I've had in my career have been when you can get alignment on those.\"\nRegarding cryptocurrency, Weidner said he believes that \"that among sports, gambling, stock trading apps, and crypto, one of these businesses doesn't know that they're all in the same business.\"\n\"I would expect that if the stock market were to start falling, you would start to see crypto falling,\" he said. \"You would start to see gambling behavior falling. You would start to see people not using prediction markets as much.\"","content_hash":"3cb6a3889f5d996878ff9dc9cc65d0b8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4465,"method_rank":0}

Fresh off his controversial stint as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, he's knee-deep in rolling out autonomous cars for ridesharing in key markets like Austin and San Francisco.\nThe ridesharing push is critical to re-energizing Tesla's brand, which was heavily damaged worldwide during his time in the Trump administration.\nTesla's sales have free-fallen in key areas once considered friendliest to electric vehicles, including California and Europe, causing profits and the company's stock price to sink.\nThe headwinds remain stiff, but Tesla's shares have recently surged higher on autonomous driving optimism and, according to Fundstrat analyst Mark Newton, the move may not be over.\nTesla gets a new stock price target amid robotaxi launches\nTesla's robotaxi opportunity is significant.\nGoldman Sachs predicts the global robotaxi rideshare market may grow to $12 billion by 2030, an estimated 90% compound annual growth rate. They also think it could continue to increase, reaching $47 billion in 2035.\nTesla won't capture all that market opportunity, given that it faces stiff competition. Waymo is already testing autonomous driving in many markets, and Amazon-backed Zoox is testing vehicles in key markets like Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\nMeanwhile, ridesharing giant Uber has partnered with Waymo, providing Waymo rides via its app, and it recently cut a deal with Lucid to roll out 20,000 vehicles powered with Nuro Driver, an autonomous driving software. It expects to launch in its first US city in 2026.\nStill, there's no debate that Tesla is a leader and that the autonomous vehicle market is in its early days, providing plenty of room for growth.\nThe opportunity ahead of it is likely a big reason why Tesla's stock price has climbed 12% since August 1. This move was large enough for Tesla shares to recapture their 200-day moving average and attract the attention of Fundstrat's Head of Technical Strategy, Mark Newton.\nNewton has been using technical analysis to evaluate what's likely to happen to stocks in the future for over twenty years. This week, he updated his Tesla outlook, offering a new price target of $488 by the end of 2025.\nThe analyst is encouraged by Tesla's rally happening on above-average daily trading volume.\n\"$TSLA has broken out this morning of the triangle consolidation which had kept this range-bound since late May and volume today is already nearing 55 mm,\" wrote Newton on X, formerly Twitter, on August 11. \"Last Friday's minor push to new multi-day highs happened on 91 million shares, the highest since late July.\"\nHe pointed out that triangle technical patterns following big moves like Tesla's enjoyed off the April lows usually resolve higher. He thinks a breakout is forthcoming \"literally any day now.\"\nUltimately, Newton believes Tesla will test all-time highs near $488 set in December.\n\"Overall, the higher this closes up off the lows, as volume expands, the better the prospects technically for the next few days. Very good breakout move this morning.\"\nIs bad news priced into Tesla's shares?\nNewton thinks it's very unlikely for Tesla to undercut its early year lows and his upside outlook suggests that Tesla's retreat earlier this year may have priced in a lot of bad news.\nAnd there's certainly been plenty of bad news to go around. Tesla's second quarter earnings largely disappointed with vehicle unit sales, revenue, and profit declining from last year.\nTotal vehicle deliveries slumped 13% from one year ago, causing revenue to fall 12% to $22.5 billion and profit per share to slump 23% to 40 cents per share.\nThe lackluster demand was most evident in key markets like California, where the California New Car Dealers Association says Tesla registrations dropped 18.3% in the first half of 2025 year over year. Tesla's California market share fell 2.9% year-over-year in the second quarter.\nThe news isn't much better in Europe. Tesla sold 10,000 vehicles in Germany year-to-date through July, 57.8% fewer vehicles than in the same period in 2024, according to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA).\nStill, Tesla's stock gains amid the sales slump may support Newton's view that the bar has been set so low that any news that's even marginally better than feared could serve as a catalyst for additional upside.","content_hash":"97787e2d1187f18b1ab3db50df325886","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4347,"method_rank":0}

The move was widely seen as a bid to get the tech giant out of Trump's crosshairs on tariffs — and appears to have worked for now.\nAltogether, analysts say the deals show just how important it is for the world's largest companies to find some tariff relief.\n\"The flurry of deal-making is an effort to secure lighter treatment from tariffs,\" Paolo Pescatore, technology analyst at PP Foresight, told CNBC by email.\n\"In some shape or form, all of the big tech companies have been negatively impacted by tariffs. They can ill afford to fork out on millions of dollars in additional fees that will further dent profits as underlined by recent quarterly earnings,\" Pescatore said.\nWhile the devil will be in the detail of these agreements, Pescatore said that Apple leading the way with its accelerated U.S. investment will likely trigger \"a domino effect\" within the industry.\nRead more\nApple, for its part, has long been regarded as one of the Big Tech firms most vulnerable to simmering trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\nEarlier this month, Trump announced plans to impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, albeit with an exemption for firms that are \"building in the United States.\"\nApple, which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices and incurred $800 million in tariff costs in the June quarter, is among the firms exempt from the proposed tariffs.\nA 'bizarre' deal\nThe Nvidia and AMD deal with the Trump administration has meanwhile sparked intense debate over the potential impact on the chip giants' businesses and whether the U.S. government may seek out similar agreements with other firms.\nSome strategists described the arrangement as a \"shakedown,\" while others suggested it may even be unconstitutional and comparing it to a tax on exports.\nWhite House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that the legality and mechanics of the 15% export tax on Nvidia and AMD were \"still being ironed out.\" She also hinted deals of this kind could expand to other companies in future.\nRay Wang, founder and chairman of Constellation Research, described the Nvidia and AMD deal to pay 15% of China chip sales revenues to the U.S. government as \"bizarre.\"\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday, Wang said what is \"really weird\" is there is still some uncertainty over whether these chips represent a national security issue.\n\"If the answer is no, fine OK. The government is taking a cut out of it,\" Wang said. \"Both Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Lisa Su at AMD both decided that OK, we've got a way to get our chips into China and maybe there is something good coming out of it.\"\nInvestor concerns\nWhile investors initially welcomed the deal as broadly positive for both Nvidia and AMD, which once more secure access to the Chinese market, Wang said some in the industry will nevertheless be concerned.\n\"As an investor, you're worried because then, is this an arbitrary decision by the government? Does every president get to play kingmaker in terms of these deals?\" Wang said.\n\"So, I think that's really what the concern is, and we still have additional tariffs and trade deals to come from the China negotiations,\" he added.\nLooking ahead, Dan Niles, founder and portfolio manager at Niles Investment Management, said the question for investors is whether the Trump administration's \"hands-on\" approach is positive or negative for U.S. companies.\n\"I think for each company, it is very different. So, it certainly it is something I take into account. The bigger thing for me is do you have some stability of policy? Do you have a policy one week and then it flips the next?\" Niles told CNBC's \"Closing Bell: Overtime\" on Monday. \"Right now, that is what concerns me a little bit more.\"\n— CNBC's Arjun Kharpal and Kif Leswing contributed to this report.","content_hash":"1ab56533369165d4a0dee76807ca8dad","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4321,"method_rank":0}

Luigi Mangione, 27, has been charged with his murder in both federal and state courts in New York.\nOn Dec. 7, Daley left a fourth voicemail on Paulette's office phone, according to the affidavit.\nPaulette is not identified by name in the affidavit.\nBut its description of \"Victim-1\" makes clear she was the messages' recipient. The affidavit says that in one of the messages, Daley mockingly quoted a public statement Paulette Thompson issued in the wake of her husband's assassination.\nThe transcriptions of the voicemails also feature sexist language and refer to the Thompsons' children.\nThompson's slaying generated public sympathy for his family, but also led to an outpouring of anger at U.S. health-care companies, including UnitedHealthcare, which is a division of UnitedHealth Group.\nDaley's calls were \"more than callous and cold-hearted,\" said Christopher Raia, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office.\n\"They were threatening and terrified a family already suffering following the violent death of their loved one,\" Raia said.\nThe affidavit said investigators linked Daley to the messages because his personal cellphone number was recorded by Paulette's company leaving the four voicemails and making five other calls to her work line.\nThe FBI and other law enforcement officers on July 30 stopped Daley near his home and executed a search warrant to seize his phone, the affidavit said.\nThe FBI agent who wrote the affidavit said that when he talked to Daley that day, he recognized his voice as the same one who left the threatening messages.\n\"When asked, Daley initially denied placing any threatening and harassing calls,\" the agent wrote.\nBut when questioned about \"the December 2024 time frame, Daley asserted that he had been drinking during that period and conceded that it was possible he made such calls,\" the agent wrote. \"Daley also informed me that he was the sole user of the ... phone.\"\nDaley, who lives in the small Saratoga County town of Galway, appeared before a magistrate judge in Albany on Wednesday afternoon. He was released from custody after agreeing to several conditions, including GPS monitoring and refraining from possessing firearms or drinking alcohol, a spokesman for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York confirmed to NBC News later Wednesday. He is expected to appear in court again Thursday, the spokesman told NBC.\nHis defense attorney, Samuel Breslin, declined to comment on the case.\nIf convicted, Daley faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, according to the Justice Department. Judges often deliver sentences far below the maximum penalty after taking into account factors including federal sentencing guidelines.\n\"Daley, as alleged, gleefully welcomed this tragedy and did all that he could to increase the Thompson family's pain and suffering,\" said John Sarcone, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York, in a statement Wednesday afternoon.\n\"My office and its partners will now do all that we can to hold him accountable for this vicious and outrageous conduct,\" Sarcone said.","content_hash":"d5c66e330b3fc702a09ed38f22b48591","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4116,"method_rank":0}

The company's guidance was more guarded, he continued, which made Wall Street fear that it's bracing itself for a slowdown. Expedia, on the other hand, gave \"unambiguously robust\" guidance for the current quarter, Cramer said, as it raised its full-year forecast for gross bookings and revenue growth. He also suggested that expectations were greater for Airbnb because it has a higher price-to-earnings multiple than Expedia.\nBut beyond earnings, Cramer said there are other factors that make Expedia more attractive than Airbnb right now. Expedia's online travel agency has a business-to-business division, while Airbnb is primarily focused on consumers, he pointed out. Cramer said he thinks the strength of Expedia's B2B arm gave management the confidence to raise its full-year forecast. But Airbnb is \"completely hostage to the consumer,\" so management had to be more cautious, he added.\nCramer also argued that Expedia is engaged with its core business — flights, hotels and rental cars. Meanwhile, he said, Airbnb is exploring new opportunities beyond its primary home rental business, whose success is not assured. The company is working on a services division that targets wealthier consumers. Some of the newer offerings would allow guests to book a chef or personal trainer to come to their rental or add spa treatments to their stay. Airbnb is betting on pricier endeavors, Cramer said, even though it seems consumers are more value-conscious right now.\n\"They've gone upmarket, and it represents a risk,\" Cramer said. \"Expedia, on the other hand, is simply focused on execution, and that's working as consumers keep coming to their platform to get the best prices when they want to travel.\"\n\"It's still early, but we're seeing great momentum behind Airbnb Services and Airbnb Experiences, and we're excited about the long-term growth potential,\" a spokesperson for Airbnb told CNBC in an email. \"Guest ratings since launch average 4.9 out of 5 stars – even higher than our stays business. Over 60,000 people have applied to be hosts, and about 10 percent of bookings for services so far are from locals or people nearby.\"\nExpedia did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

As a result, renewables are projected to overtake thermal power as the primary source of Italy’s electricity generation in 2030 and will continue to increase their share to 55.9% in 2035.\nRenewable power dominated Italy’s capacity mix in 2024 with a 43.4% share. It is expected to be the leading technology in 2035, accounting for a 70.6% share. This was closely followed by thermal power, which accounted for a 42.3% capacity share in 2024 and is expected to see a decline to 21.4% in 2035. In 2024, thermal power dominated the generation mix with 51.3%, while renewables accounted for 34.9% and large hydropower for the remaining 13.8% share.\nItaly is not known for possessing substantial domestic fossil fuel reserves and is heavily dependent on imports. As the second-largest importer of gas in Europe, after Germany, the country sources natural gas from Azerbaijan, Algeria, Libya and other nations. Italy meets most of its gas requirements through imports, which may offer a short-term solution. However, the government is actively seeking to expand renewable energy capacity to reduce reliance on foreign sources.\nItaly is poised to invest in two primary sectors: solar and wind power generation. Driven by its substantial potential and environmental objectives, the government has resolved to elevate the proportion of renewable energy in its total energy consumption to 40% by 2030.\nItaly is aiming to achieve a 40% renewable share in gross final consumption and 65% renewable electricity generation by 2030, when the country also has a target of 27% of its power capacity from renewables. It aims to increase its total renewable installed capacity to 93.2GW and 186.8 terawatt hours (TWh) of power generation through renewables by 2030. It targets 50GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity, 74TWh power generation through solar PV, and 18.2GW of wind capacity by 2030.\nA primary force shaping Italy’s power market is its dedication to climate objectives, both at the national level and as a member of the European Union (EU). Italy is obligated to adhere to the EU’s Fit for 55 package and the European Green Deal, which collectively seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThese ambitious targets have compelled Italy to expedite the decarbonisation of its electricity sector, transitioning from fossil fuel-based power generation to renewable energy sources, including solar, wind and hydropower. The national strategy places a significant emphasis on the electrification of end-use sectors — transportation, heating and industry — which is anticipated to markedly increase electricity demand. This ongoing transformation is guiding investment decisions, grid modernisation and infrastructure planning throughout the power market.","content_hash":"7b21efdcb7471e00f3633530fef47c50","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3059,"method_rank":0}

Now the agency is shifting to buying connectivity as a service, much like it does for launch and astronaut transport.\nThat pivot has sparked a race, with major contenders pitching ways to keep Mars missions online. What’s at stake isn’t a single contract: it’s the data pipe to Mars.\nThis new approach, which will mix NASA assets and commercial infrastructure, would gradually replace the patchwork relay network the agency relies on today. Generally, that works by orbiters like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN that pick up data from rovers and landers and transmit it to the Deep Space Network’s (DSN) giant antennas on Earth.\nNASA’s relay spacecraft are still healthy, but they were never meant to be a permanent backbone. The agency’s latest senior review on planetary missions calls out MAVEN’s critical role as a relay and provides steps to keep it available into the early 2030s. But eventually, this hardware will decay.\nAt the same time, NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program, which manages the DSN, is looking for solutions to augment these aging assets. The aim, according to an RFP released in July and due today, is to create an interoperable marketplace where NASA can be one of many customers instead of the owner-operator.\nThe current request is specifically for capability studies, not immediate hardware buys. The ask is twofold: a “lunar trunkline” between the moon and Earth and end-to-end Mars communications that move data from assets on the surface, through Mars orbit, and to operations centers on Earth.\nIt’s a formidable challenge. Any architecture must contend with the vast distance between Earth and the moon and Mars, long latency, periodic solar interference and Earth visibility windows, and high requirements for fault-tolerant systems. That’s why NASA is asking for plans, to gauge how industry might solve these puzzles, rather than immediately jumping to procurement.\nWhile TechCrunch can’t confirm which companies are submitting concept proposals, a handful have already staked their place in the race.\nBlue Origin just unveiled a Mars Telecommunications Orbiter built on its Blue Ring platform, pitched as maneuverable, high-performance spacecraft to support NASA missions to Mars as soon as 2028. Rocket Lab has touted its own Mars telecom orbiter concept, which the company says is a core element of its proposed architecture for the Mars Sample Return campaign.\nIn 2024, NASA’s Mars Exploration Program separately funded 12 short commercial services studies, including a trio of studies for next-gen relay services, to SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, and Blue Origin. SpaceX’s proposal to “adapt Earth-orbit communication satellites for Mars” will likely be derived from its Starlink internet satellite constellation.\nThe long-term goal is to transform the agency’s planetary exploration agenda from pure-science missions to a permanent human presence on the moon and, eventually, on Mars.","content_hash":"dacdd968f19c9d283b2936ea05fda9f7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3058,"method_rank":0}

Retirement plan recordkeepers and the Trump administration’s Department of Labor have praised the move, while industry experts and advisors warn it could lead to confusion, conflicts of interest, and harm to clients whose money moves into less-stable investments they don’t understand.\nAlternatives aren’t prohibited in 401(k)s but have historically been rare due to their risks and laxer regulation. Their inclusion in the past has sparked numerous lawsuits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, alleging plan committees breached their fiduciary duty to act in clients’ best interests. The order aims to reduce “burdensome lawsuits” and “regulatory overreach,” offering participants greater access to private equity, private credit, cryptocurrencies, commodities, infrastructure and real estate.\nWill this deliver great private market returns for clients, or open the door to conflicts? “It’s another windfall for Wall Street at the expense of retirees,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, told Advisor Upside.\nREAD ALSO: Yieldstreet Losses Highlights the Potential Dangers of Private Investments and Wealth Management M&A Hits Record High, Fidelity Reports\nIn the Record Books\nEmpower, one of the largest recordkeepers with roughly $2 trillion in assets under administration, welcomed the order. “By opening the door to additional types of assets, we can offer everyday savers access to the same opportunities that have historically powered institutional portfolios,” company CEO Edmund Murphy III said in a statement.\nT.

Highlighting alternatives’ illiquidity, high costs, and opaqueness, Knut Rostad, president of the Institute for the Fiduciary Standard, said it’s “breathtaking” how little the administration understands advisor responsibilities. “This represents a frontal assault … on the heart of what fiduciary means,” he said in a Friday webinar.\nPhyllis Borzi, former assistant secretary for the Employee Benefits Security Administration under President Obama, warned of potential conflicts of interest, with brokers and consultants receiving high commissions to push smaller employers and participants toward alts. She also questioned the timing, noting widespread concerns over Americans’ low financial literacy. “You can’t go to any convention or meeting in the investment world … without people talking about the severe lack of financial literacy among many participants and plan sponsors,” she said during the Fiduciary Institute webinar.","content_hash":"c9ff3ab6f47cc3679c08f5a1eeab3983","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2983,"method_rank":0}

While many pockets of the West, Southwest, and Southeast have seen home prices decline at least some from the peak, nationally aggregated single-family prices are still pretty close to all-time highs.\n-\nAmortization of ultralow mortgage rates. Many homeowners locked in ultralow mortgage rates during the Pandemic Housing Boom. With fixed rates around 2% to 3%, those monthly payments included a larger proportion of principal repayment from the start. That means borrowers have been paying down their balances more aggressively than they would under higher-rate loans. As of Q4 2024, 54% of outstanding mortgage holders have rates below 4.0%, which has helped some borrowers build equity faster and give them a greater buffer.\n-\nFew buyers actually purchased at the peak in correction markets. Even in boom-to-correction markets like Cape Coral, Florida, or Austin, only a small share of homeowners bought at the absolute top of the market in spring 2022. Most current homeowners in those areas either bought before or after the peak. This limited exposure at the peak helps explain why negative equity, so far, hasn’t been a big problem, even in some of the hardest-hit metros.","content_hash":"7488b733d40433b40f190b96a3cfabf4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2960,"method_rank":0}

New-home prices dropped in 30% of large U.S. cities last quarter\n-\nHousing costs have surged more than 50% since the pandemic, but the traditional price gap where new-construction homes cost significantly more than existing homes has narrowed. There are notable price drops and incentives, especially in the South and West, making new homes more affordable. Furthermore, new homes often provide better value per square foot, and builders tend to offer incentives.\nNo matter the type of home you buy, housing has become more expensive over the years. Just since the pandemic, home prices are up by more than 50%, and mortgage rates continue to hover near 7%.\nWhile new-construction homes have historically been more costly than buying an existing house, that trend is changing in some markets. Last quarter, year-over-year median listing prices for new builds dropped in 30 of the largest U.S. metros, according to an Aug. 7 Realtor.com report.\nHistorically, the price premium of new-construction homes has largely been driven by costly modern amenities and customization, rising materials and labor expenses, and strong demand for more housing. The median listing price for a new home in the second quarter of 2025 was about $450,000, while the median existing-home price was roughly $418,000, according to Realtor.com.\nBut price drops have been prominent in the South and West as builders try offering more affordable options through incentives. Meanwhile, increased competition on existing homes and weaker buyer demand has driven down new-construction prices, according to Realtor.com.\n“In a market still grappling with a shortage of nearly 4 million homes, affordable new construction plays a critical role in restoring balance,” Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale said in a statement. “Even with recent slowdowns in starts and permits, builders continue to deliver new homes to the market at a healthy pace.”\nAlthough the overall home price for a new build is higher than an existing home, buyers can get a better price per square foot, Realtor.com data shows. Nationally, new builds typically list for about $218 per square foot, compared with $226.56 for existing homes, according to Realtor.com.\nThe top five markets where new-construction home prices dropped year over year last quarter, according to Realtor.com:\n-\nLittle Rock, Ark. (-15.6%)\n-\nAustin, Texas (-8.5%)\n-\nWichita, Kans. (-7.9%)\n-\nJacksonville, Fla. (-7.8%)\n-\nCape Coral, Fla. (-7.4%)\nShrinkflation is also a factor at play making new homes more affordable in some markets. Builders are making homes smaller, and therefore more affordable, for new buyers. A July 2024 report from John Burns Research & Consulting showed about a quarter of new homes were downsized to cut costs. To make smaller homes more enticing and practical, builders have cut the number of hallways and increased flex space in the home.","content_hash":"2af24f0be12ddcf51b08bdf191edbe4e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2945,"method_rank":0}

The return of the shares follows a July 4 decision by the court in Singapore, where the shares were being held.\nMore from WWD\n-\nSMCP Q2 Sales Up 3% With Full-price Strategy Boosting Growth\n-\nSMCP Secures Singapore Court Victory in Battle Over Disputed Share Transfer\n-\nPrincess Beatrice Brings Understated Flair in Striped Sandro Look to First Day of Wimbledon 2025\n“The return of the shares clarifies SMCP’s shareholding situation,” the company said in a statement. “The group remains focused on executing its profitable growth strategy, leveraging the desirability of its brands, its operational agility, and ongoing efforts in cost management.”\nThe 15.5 percent stake has been at the center of a years-long shareholder dispute dating back to the financial collapse of Chinese conglomerate Shandong Ruyi, which had acquired a majority stake in SMCP in 2016 through European TopSoho ahead of the group’s 2017 initial public offering.\nThis is the latest twist of the “missing shares” case that began in 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital “disappeared” from Luxembourg and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later.\nThey reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by European TopSoho director Chenran Qiu, the daughter of Shandong Ruyi’s founder. European TopSoho had sold them to Dynamic Treasure Group for a symbolic one euro.\nIn the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu’s involvement in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market.\nThe Singapore court ruling followed a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. Jurisdiction moved to Singapore, where the shares were being held in local accounts.\nEuropean TopSoho, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 2023, is now under the control of a court-appointed administrator in Luxembourg.\nThe return of the 15.5 percent stake won’t immediately change control of SMCP but does bring greater transparency to investors.\nLondon-based GLAS currently acts as trustee for European TopSoho’s creditors, including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan, who remain SMCP’s largest shareholders. Last year, GLAS revealed its intention to offload 37 percent of the group’s shares — a move that could trigger a mandatory takeover under French law if a single buyer snaps them up.","content_hash":"a0e62ac6e661affc808e2fc176002e53","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2933,"method_rank":0}

Sarah Merrill, a spokesperson for the fleet told CNBC that the USS Higgins was conducting a \"freedom of navigation operation\" in accordance with international law.\n\"China's statement about this mission is false ... The United States is defending its right to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as USS Higgins did here. Nothing China says otherwise will deter us,\" Merrill added.\nThe incident comes at a time when Washington and Beijing are locked in a trade spat that has seen the two issue incendiary statements, with China in March warning that it was prepared for \"a trade war or any other type of war,\" with the U.S., before tensions subsided.\nOn Tuesday, a Chinese warship had crashed into one of its own coast guard vessels as it chased a patrol boat belonging to the Philippines.\nChina claims almost all of the South China Sea as its own under its \"nine-dash-line,\" which rejects a 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court in the Netherlands, that found no legal or historical basis for Beijing's claims.\nThere have been several clashes between Chinese and Filipino ships in the South China Sea, with the Philippines accusing Beijing's forces last year of pursuing Philippine vessels and directing lasers at patrolling aircrafts near another contested reef.\nClashes have involved boat collisions, water cannons and injuries to Filipino sailors, according to Filipino officials.\nIn May 2024, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said that should a Filipino citizen be killed in the South China Sea via an incident with the Chinese Coast Guard, it would almost certainly be a \"red line\" and come \"very, very close to what we define as an act of war.\"\nHe added that \"our treaty partners I believe, also hold that same standard,\" referring to U.S. forces.

For the third quarter, the company indicated revenue growth would slow further, forecasting at least $717 million in revenue or growth of at least 14%. In an environment where digital advertising spend has been strong, that forecast sparked several downgrades from Wall Street analysts.\nHowever, there was another item in the earnings report that likely compounded the Friday sell-off. The Trade Desk said that Laura Schenkein was stepping down as CFO to be replaced by Alex Kayyal, who is joining the company after serving as a board member for several years. Kayyal was previously an executive at Salesforce and was a co-founder of Hermes Growth Partners, a venture capital firm that was one of The Trade Desk's earliest investors.\nThe CFO transition\nLaura Schenkein, who will reportedly be stepping down on Aug. 21, was with the company for nearly 12 years, serving in a variety of finance leadership positions before becoming CFO in June 2023. Schenkein, who is in her early 40s, is not close to retirement age. And the news release didn't make clear why she is leaving the company. The only hint she gave in her remarks on the earnings call is that she is transitioning to a \"new challenge.\"\nBased on that language, she has likely taken a new role at a different company, but that has not yet been announced. Investors may learn where she is headed once Kayyal replaces her on Aug. 21. Schenkein will stay on as a non-executive officer through the end of the year and will work with Kayyal to seamlessly transition responsibilities.\nIs it a red flag for The Trade Desk?\nSome investors believe that a CFO departure can be a red flag. After all, the CFO has a better sense of the numbers than anybody else at the company, and could choose to jump ship if the business is heading in the wrong direction, or worse, if there are problems with its financial reporting.\nThere's no immediate indication that anything unscrupulous is taking place with The Trade Desk. While the slowing growth in the business may have contributed to Schenkein's decision to leave the company, this seems like more of a normal executive transition than any reason to be concerned. Despite their reputation as potential warning signs, most CFO transitions are a normal function of business, and they are as common as other executive transitions.","content_hash":"030fcf11e2047b61db3a3c65db5919fb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2889,"method_rank":0}

That was a boon to the business during the coronavirus pandemic, but it has been a bit of a trouble spot now that the world has learned to live with COVID-19. In fact, the stock now trades at around the same levels it did prior to the stock's pandemic rally. Is this package delivery giant stuck in neutral, or is there hope for the future?\nWhy did investors get so excited about UPS?\nWall Street has a really bad habit of getting a story in its teeth and then running with it. Investors usually run too far, leading to a deep snapback in the share price of whatever investments got caught up in the story. That is the backdrop for UPS' huge price advance in 2020 and 2021. And its subsequent crash in 2022, which is still ongoing today.\nEssentially, the stock has made a full round trip from bull to bear, currently trading hands at around the same levels it did prior to the pandemic rally. What changed? During the pandemic, people were stuck at home and did a lot more online shopping. That led to increased demand for delivery services like the one UPS operates. Investors appear to have reasoned that demand would grow forever. It didn't.\nWhen the world moved past COVID, UPS realized it had to change things up. It started by slimming down and using more technology. At the same time, however, it had to deal with a new, more costly, union contract. As it started to get a handle on its business overhaul, it proactively chose to halve the low-margin business relationship it has with Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), its largest customer.\nThe near term is likely to remain bumpy\nHere's the problem: UPS' current efforts are all near-term headwinds, even though they are likely to be long-term positives. For example, slimming down has included exiting certain businesses, which shrinks UPS and leads to volatility and uncertainty on the income statement. Closing facilities and increasing the use of technology both increase costs in the near term, even though they will likely reduce costs over the long term.\nThe union contract's pay raises increased costs. But it creates more stability over the long term, since the dispute is resolved. And while focusing on more profitable business will likely lead to improved margins, it might also result in top-line weakness. That's particularly true with UPS' decision to materially reduce its work with Amazon. However, less revenue that is more profitable is better than growing the business by leaning into mediocre delivery niches.","content_hash":"c69f61b96df441a5774cf2f957d74c25","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2876,"method_rank":0}

The Texas state House Democratic caucus said in a post on social media that they were meeting and “still assessing their strategies going forward,” and declined further comment.\nThe Texas mapping duel has erupted into a national controversy as Republicans seek to protect their narrow majority in the US House of Representatives. While states across the country usually adjust district lines every 10 years to reflect population changes, Trump has pushed state lawmakers to redraw the maps now in a way that could add as many as five Republican-leaning House seats.\nCalifornia and New York Democrats have threatened to rewrite their own maps in a way that would risk Republican seats in those states, should Texas Republicans force through new district lines. Other Republican-controlled states, including Florida, Indiana, and Missouri, are similarly eyeing redistricting to add seats where possible. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom said this week that Democrats in his state would back down from redistricting if Trump told Republican leaders to halt their plans.\n“You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make,” Newsom wrote to the president on Monday.\nTexas state House Democrats left the state in early August in a bid to stall the bill, scattering from Illinois to New York and depriving the Texas House of Representatives of the minimum number of lawmakers present to hold a vote — a tactic known as a quorum break. Absent members have racked up fines of $500 per day, a penalty established after Democrats similarly broke quorum in 2021.","content_hash":"649a42c7ee35259e88b9e02e83d65e66","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2869,"method_rank":0}

The robust increase in electricity demand is progressively supported by clean energy. The country’s power consumption is forecast to reach 13,757TWh in 2030, registering a compound annual growth rate of 6.3% during 2024-2030.\nChina’s real GDP (in US dollars, 2015 prices) is set to increase from $2,01bn in 2024 to $2,31bn in 2030, driving the demand for electricity. Despite a decline in China’s population from 1,412 million in 2020 to 1,410 million in 2024, the electricity consumption has consistently shown over 6% growth in recent years, and the trend is expected to continue with rapid industrialisation and electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure development.\nIn recent years, China’s electricity consumption has expanded at a significant pace relative to that of other nations. The growth in generation from hydropower and renewable energy sources has resulted in excess generation capacity at numerous coal-fired power plants. Consequently, the Chinese government has imposed a moratorium on the construction of new coal-based facilities in the key economic regions of Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing.\nAs China pivots from heavy industries to service and high-tech sectors, and increasingly emphasises sustainable development, the demand for coal is anticipated to decline further. Nonetheless, coal is projected to remain the predominant source of power generation throughout the forecast period.\nIn the short term, China is confronted with the challenges of elevated energy costs and commodity prices. However, its partnership with Russia is expected to present an opportunity to secure oil, coal, and gas imports through advantageous agreements.\nIn 2024, the industrial sector occupied a dominant share in power consumption, accounting for 67%. This was followed by the residential sector with 15.6%, and the commercial sector with a share of 4.4%. The transport sector held a share of 2.3% whereas other segments together contributed to a 10.7% share.\nEmerging industries, including EVs, AI, data centres, semiconductors, and 5G infrastructure are experiencing rapid growth. These sectors are notably electricity-dependent and are anticipated to propel the demand for power within the country.\nChina presents three principal areas of investment opportunity: gas-based power generation, renewable power generation, and smart grid infrastructure. The prospects for gas-based generation are poised to increase, driven by the government’s initiative to curtail coal-based power generation. The country has achieved significant advancements in renewable power, with wind and solar energy poised for continued expansion.","content_hash":"52f711d68ac492acc6d0d4e455a51505","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2849,"method_rank":0}

Typically used alongside Plaque Analysis, FFRCT creates detailed 3D models of the arteries to assess the impact of blockages on blood flow.\nPlaque Analysis received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2022 and is claimed to be the only AI-based plaque quantification tool currently cleared by the agency. FFRCT received FDA clearance in 2014.\nTo reach the IPO milestone, HeartFlow maintained a focus on testing its product offerings alongside physicians, generating real world evidence, taking on feedback and refining as needed, and ensuring they were truly ready to scale.\nHeartFlow also navigated the structural barriers of getting its product to market; again, real-world evidence – with over 3,000 peer-reviewed papers demonstrating its products’ efficacy – spurred the company’s commercialisation efforts.\nMedtech industry veteran, Brent Ness, CEO of Aclarion, who served as HeartFlow’s chief commercial officer from 2014 to 2015, told Medical Device Network that HeartFlow’s work on the underlying economic factors around its product, including working on contractual relationships with imaging centres to get them on board with the product, pre-reimbursement, have proven a key part of its success.\n“Between FDA clearance and reimbursement, lots of technologies can't make it through that journey because there's no reimbursement, and therefore there's no adoption, and they run out of cash,” Ness explained.\n“Part of the structural barrier stage of development involves getting the provider economics right and that market access work that needs to take place between the early payors and the key opinion leaders (KOL) advocating for the product. But payors aren't going to turn it on just because a KOL says so.\n“This is why the shining jewel in HeartFlow’s history has been their absolute commitment to leading with evidence.”\nAI’s recognition in healthcare and its future\nAccording to Ness, the success of HeartFlow’s IPO reflects the market validation of the overall rationale for using AI in imaging and the deployment of software-as-a-service (SaaS) based products as the “raw material” underpinning the technology’s ability to provide clinically actionable information and improve patient outcomes.","content_hash":"1bdadcb2b6360730c9ad4b8d3f8d188b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2845,"method_rank":0}

On a local currency basis, the U.S. and Mexico produced double-digit growth, while Canada reached a high-single-digit growth year-to date. Separately, in retail, Asics’ Meatpacking store posted a net sales growth of 15.5 percent in the quarter, aided by implementation of omnichannel initiatives to bolster the in-store assortment mix.\n“The consistent demand for Asics footwear products across the region speaks to our relentless pursuit of developing technically advanced performance running products while remaining very aware of broader cultural and lifestyle trends to support the sportstyle category,” Koichiro Kodama, president and chief executive officer of Asics North America, said.

Andrea Makkai, its corporate controller, was appointed as its principal accounting officer, with both appointments also effective Aug. 5.\n-\nThe CFO departure comes as the company looks to continue addressing material weaknesses related to its internal controls for financial reporting identified after an audit of the years ended December 2023 and 2024, according to a May 14 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Following his departure, Urgently entered into an advisor agreement with Huffmyer to provide “certain transitional services” to the company until Oct. 31.\nPort’s appointment as CFO came shortly after the company announced it was “in the process of reorganizing our finance department, including the expansion of our accounting, control and compliance functions to develop and implement continued improvements and enhancements to address the overall deficiencies that led to the material weakness” as part of its remediation efforts, according to the May 14 filing.","content_hash":"bcc9b22f3fe32233c5d30e9f7f88f513","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2820,"method_rank":0}

Whether a company meets, beats, or misses expectations for a given quarter, the results can be a notable spike or slide in its share price. The problem is that paying too much attention to such fluctuations can drive both investors and management toward short-term thinking.\nIf you're an investor who can keep your focus on the long term, though, you don't have to worry as much about how a company in your portfolio does during any single quarter, and can be guided instead by the bigger picture.\nBased on its long-term prospects, one stock I see as particularly intriguing now is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), also known as just AMD. It recently reported earnings numbers that didn't beat the analysts' consensus across all key metrics -- its adjusted per-share profit missed expectations by one cent, which led to a (brief) decline in its share price. While a large-scale sell-off isn't underway, the stock could still be a terrific buy right now.\nAnd there was one particular statistic in that report that points to the sheer potential that AMD possesses in the long run -- a stat that some investors who were focusing on the top and bottom lines may have overlooked.\n7 of the top 10 companies focused on AI and building models are using AMD's new chips\nThe big question for AMD has been whether its newest AI accelerators will be able to compete with (and take some market share from) those of its massive rival, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). If they can, then AMD, which is a fraction of the size of Nvidia, would surely be a no-brainer buy. AMD's new Instinct MI400 chips will be available next year, and previously, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said his company would use them and was enthusiastic about what they could do.\nIt appears OpenAI is far from the only tech leader interested in AMD's chips. On the second-quarter earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su said that \"seven of the top 10 model builders and AI companies use Instinct.\" She was referring to the company's current chip, the MI350. The more advanced one coming to market next year may be even more popular, as AMD looks to narrow the gap between itself and Nvidia.\nThis is an impressive stat because it may indicate that companies are seeing AMD's chips as potential alternatives to Nvidia's. AMD may have been slower out of the gate when the AI revolution was first heating up, but now, as it's ramping up its AI chip development, it could take some meaningful market share away from Nvidia. The proof, as it usually is, will be in the numbers.","content_hash":"70fb19a1b52a97b42f2c3daccc8d547d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2797,"method_rank":0}

Among his most enduring insights is the principle that “for the investor, a too-high purchase price for the stock of an excellent company can undo the effects of a subsequent decade of favorable business developments.” This quote serves as a cautionary reminder that valuation matters — even when the underlying business is exceptional.\nBuffett originally made this observation in his 1982 shareholder letter, addressing a fundamental misunderstanding in investing: the belief that buying shares of a high-quality business guarantees strong returns. His message is clear: no matter how resilient or well-managed a company may be, paying an inflated price at the outset can severely diminish, or even negate, the investor’s eventual gains.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nThis High-Yield (7%) Dividend Stock Is Down Significantly in 2025. Should You Buy the Dip?\n-\nDear CoreWeave Stock Fans, Mark Your Calendars for August 14\n-\nTesla Is Axing Its Dojo Supercomputer Plans. What Does That Mean for TSLA Stock Here?\nThis view is consistent with Buffett’s long-standing adherence to value investing — a discipline he learned from his mentor, Benjamin Graham. Buffett’s approach centers on purchasing companies with strong fundamentals, sustainable competitive advantages, and capable management, but only when their market price is below or fairly aligned with their intrinsic value. In his view, investment performance is ultimately determined not just by what you buy, but by the price you pay.\nBuffett’s credibility in issuing this warning is hard-earned. Over more than five decades at Berkshire Hathaway, he has built a track record of acquiring businesses that not only perform well operationally, but are also acquired at attractive valuations. He has frequently avoided investing in trendy or overhyped companies, even when their operational success was undeniable, if he believed their share prices were too high to justify a purchase.\nIn the decades since Buffett first made this statement, its relevance has only grown. Markets have seen multiple periods of elevated valuations, where investors justified high prices with expectations of continued growth. Examples include the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, the tech-driven rally of the 2010s, and more recently, the rise of high-growth companies trading at steep earnings multiples. In many cases, the companies themselves went on to perform well, but investor returns lagged due to the high starting valuations.","content_hash":"8357b59268424c475fa4b50e8f18abdf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2790,"method_rank":0}

In times of uncertainty, CFOs prioritize resilience.\nThat’s what Stephen Philipson, vice chair and head of wealth, corporate, commercial, and institutional banking at U.S. Bank, told me he’s hearing from finance chiefs. “Our CFO clients are cautious, but they’re not standing still.” Overall, CFOs are focused on optimizing liquidity, managing risk, and maintaining optionality in the current environment, he said.\n“We’re seeing solid financing demand from companies for both upcoming liquidity needs and long-term growth drivers,” Philipson explained. In addition, there’s a noticeable uptick in working capital finance, which reflects a proactive stance on cash flow management.\nResearch points to trade policy and tariffs remaining a top concern for CFOs. But Philipson said much of their cautiousness is driven by three main issues: heightened anxiety around the tariffs, a weaker dollar, and rising working capital needs.\nU.S.-based importers are facing higher costs due to the weakening dollar and new tariffs, prompting firms to seek more financing and unlock idle cash to meet rising working capital demands, he said.\nMeanwhile, foreign exchange (FX) risk management is front and center. For example, he’s seeing more use of collars (an options strategy that protects against large losses) to hedge downside risk while preserving upside potential. “And many firms are shifting to pay foreign vendors in local currencies to meet supplier demands and reduce costs,” Philipson noted.\nThere’s also an uptick in receivables finance and supply chain finance usage. These tools help firms hold cash longer while enabling suppliers to get paid faster, he said.\n“It’s been interesting to observe how middle-market firms are stepping up their risk-management efforts this year,” he said. Middle-market firms are increasingly looking to proactively mitigate risks like interest rates and FX, while large corporations—with robust treasury operations—continue to deploy hedging tools.\nWhen asked about the M&A outlook, Philipson said momentum is building as we move into the second half of the year. “The bank loan and bond markets are offering attractive conditions, with credit spreads near historical tights,” he said. This indicates that investors see little extra risk in corporate debt, keeping borrowing costs low for companies.\n“We’re seeing more mid-tier deals—larger than tuck-ins but not fully transformational—as companies grow more comfortable with policy and market dynamics,” Philipson said.\nHe continued, “We expect M&A activity to continue picking up as companies get increasingly comfortable with ‘certainty around continued uncertainty’—the idea that macro headlines are likely to persist and must be part of the calculus around strategic decisions.”","content_hash":"9fa583b659111f4ec55b90b398eea48f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2778,"method_rank":0}

SpaceX's flight-test strategy is known for pushing spacecraft prototypes to the point of failure, then fine-tuning improvements through frequent repetition.\nThis has appeared to run afoul at times with the FAA's mission of safeguarding the public and the environment as it exercises its regulatory jurisdiction over commercial spaceflight.\nEarlier this year, the FAA grounded Starship test flights for nearly two months after back-to-back post-launch explosions rained debris over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to change course. The FAA ended up expanding the aircraft hazard zone along Starship's launch trajectories before licensing future flights.","content_hash":"9f41d7399a5f53f83a4de93de1803fa3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2764,"method_rank":0}

Apollo’s Torsten Slok has already calculated that the top 10 S&P 500 companies today are more overvalued than in the late ’90s tech boom. Now the investment bank Stifel is predicting that even as “euphoric markets party like it’s 1999,” a stock market correction and stagflation are ahead.\nStifel’s strategists, led by Barry Bannister and Thomas Carroll, wrote in a research note that they are simply “uncomfortable” with the S&P 500 gaining 32% off its April 7 intraday low as the latest GDP figures show the actual economy slowing almost to a crawl. They further warn that “hopium” is a powerful drug and that stock markets may be “whistling past the graveyard.”\nSimply put, Bannister and Carroll say consumers are not as rich as their account balances show, following the “money illusion” of COVID-era fiscal stimulus that they described as a “World War–level” effort.\nWith the mighty American consumer running out of breath amid an economic slowdown in the second half of 2025, Stifel sees a decline of 10% or more in the S&P 500.\nReal economic pain is brewing\nAccording to Stifel, the apparent health of the U.S. consumer belies an underlying slowdown, with personal consumption—responsible for 68% of GDP—showing effectively 0% growth year to date. Their research highlights several red flags.\nThey note that growth in real wage income, the main driver of personal consumption, has slowed to an annual rate of just 1% as stagflation hits.\nIn addition, monetary and fiscal policies are in a “tug-of-war” that counteract each other, resulting in a minimal boost to consumer spending.\nAnd unlike in 2022–23, there is significantly less consumer savings to support consumption.\nAbout that money illusion: Stifel’s data shows that from September 2019 to March 2022, household cash balances increased 44%, while consumer spending doubled against the historic median. Bannister and Carroll argue that the illusion kept spending afloat and helped drive asset prices upward, but it’s now fading after the “helicopter dump” of cash in the early 2020s.\nThe tell here, they say, is that savings rates have come back into balance with equity net worth, after a period when excess money moved first through consumption, then assets. Put another way, America is essentially cash-poor.\nWhat’s more, Stifel’s calculation shows that the personal savings rate has fallen dramatically since COVID, so Americans have binged on spending and now have less cash on hand than in the years before the pandemic.","content_hash":"b81f9b6a652327f7f89ed26409c06637","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2761,"method_rank":0}

The first deliveries began last month. NdFeB magnets, which are primarily composed of neodymium, iron and boron, are considered the strongest type of permanent magnet commercially available. They are used in a wide variety of automotive and industrial applications.\nThe company is supplying GM with sintered magnets, a manufacturing process that results a very strong magnetic field. Once the alloys are ground into a powder, the material is pressed into a mold under high pressure. The sintering process heats the pressed blocks of alloy to temperatures of roughly 1,100°C, which fuses the particles together, forming a dense, solid magnet, according to Noveon.\nNoveon is currently the only active manufacturer of sintered NdFeB rare earth magnets in the U.S., according to the release. The company intends to scale production as demand for these magnets accelerates across the automotive, energy and industrial sectors.\nAlthough NdFeB magnets are used in both electric and internal combustion engine vehicles, they are a key component for the electric motors of EVs and hybrid vehicles. They are also used in regenerative braking systems, electric power steering systems and other EV powertrain components. For ICE vehicles, NdFeB magnets are used for 12-volt electric motors and actuators, such as wiper motors, power door locks, alternators, fan motors and engine control sensors.\n\"Working with domestic manufacturers like Noveon allows us to increase the resiliency of our supply chain while supporting American jobs and strengthening our industry and economic security,\" said Jeff Morrison, GM global chief procurement officer, in the release. \"Noveon's magnets will support our most popular vehicles and help continue to deliver a leading portfolio of choice for our customers.\"","content_hash":"2c5d4e9c3c5707fc317df48db4072e80","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2750,"method_rank":0}

That's hundreds of millions of dollars gone to scammers pretending to be from trusted places like the government or big companies.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90\/share.\n-\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30\/share.\nWhy Are Older Adults Being Targeted?\nScammers know older adults often have savings and might be more trusting or less familiar with the latest scam tricks. While younger people also get targeted, the FTC says it's the older folks who report the really big losses — sometimes their entire life savings.\nIn fact, total losses over $100,000 went from $55 million in 2020 to a staggering $445 million in 2024.\nThe Scams Tell the Same Three Lies\nMost of these scams follow familiar patterns. The FTC reports three things that scammers typically say:\n-\n\"Someone is using your accounts.\" You get a call or message saying they're from your bank or a company like Amazon, warning you that someone's messing with your money.\n-\n\"Your information is being used to commit crimes.\" They claim they're government officials and say your Social Security number or other details are being used in illegal activities like drug trafficking or money laundering.\n-\n\"There's a security problem with your computer.\" You might see a fake alert pop up on your screen telling you to call a number because your computer has been hacked.\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nSometimes, scammers even pretend to be with the FTC itself. They'll tell you to send money to Bitcoin ATMs or hand cash or gold to couriers — something the real FTC would never ask you to do.\nHow to Stay Safe\nThe good news? There are simple steps the FTC recommends to protect yourself:\n-\nDon't move your money just because someone tells you to. No matter how official they sound, don't transfer or send money after an unexpected call or message.\n-\nHang up and check. If you're contacted by someone claiming to be from a government agency or company, call the official number listed on their website — not the one they gave you.\n-\nUse call blocking tools. These can help stop scam calls before they even reach you.","content_hash":"155ab19b8d169775605a0d526bd57bd9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2747,"method_rank":0}

And after weathering “about four or five crashes,” he’s still betting on crypto’s future — just not in the places most retail investors are looking.\n“There’s a flight to quality happening,” he said. “And there’s a flight to familiarity, because there’s some low-quality, shitty old tokens that have been around for a while that for some reason are pumping.” Included in that mix are memecoins.\n“My bet personally is that memecoins will be like NFTs of the last cycle,” Vaidya said. “I don’t think it’s coming back.\"\nInstead, Maelstrom has focused on the real businesses quietly building under the surface: Stablecoins, DeFi infrastructure, and AI agents. One of Maelstrom’s first bets was on stablecoin protocol Ethena, well before the GENIUS Act supercharged institutional interest. “Having seen what Ethena and its other competitors were able to achieve without the GENIUS Act… now imagine a world afterwards. It’s pretty exciting.”\nThe demand, he said, is tangible. The rise of stablecoins has opened up a new way to access the U.S. dollar —especially in emerging markets. “It didn’t make sense to serve 80% of the population in most developing countries, and now it does,\" he said.\nThat dynamic has also kicked off an unexpected bull case: U.S. debt distribution is changing. “You’re going to have a lot of diversification in holders of U.S. debt that we’ve really never seen as a nation before.” Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino would certainly agree. He recently told Coinage that stablecoins replacing certain sovereign nations as major holders of U.S. debt will be the lynchpin in Trump's tariff gambit.\nIt’s that kind of structural shift that Maelstrom is looking to capitalize on. And as crypto matures, it's also opening more traditional M&A activity in the industry as well.\n“Usually [in crypto M&A] they overpay… You’re just combining two businesses. But what we haven’t seen much of yet — and what we’re trying to do — is financial sponsors who just want to buy a company, run it better for a few years, and sell it,\" he said.","content_hash":"f4e7a8c73d82551e38ae6b63ef1fe91b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2736,"method_rank":0}

While GPT-5 is great for OpenAI's early backers, I see its creation as a massive -- albeit overlooked -- win for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors.\nLet's explore why GPT-5 is a big deal as the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative continues to unfold, and assess why Nvidia stock is positioned to benefit from the rise of more sophisticated LLMs.\nGPT-5 is more than just a new chatbot; it's rewriting the playbook for enterprise AI\nGPT-5 does not represent a routine upgrade compared to prior models released by OpenAI. Rather, large corporate enterprises are demanding more advanced functionality across a host of use cases and applications from LLMs.\nNew models such as GPT-5 doesn't simply mean \"smarter\" chatbots.

While there’s nothing wrong with any of those things, you can do them all and still not end up rich. At least, that’s what financial influencer Ramit Sethi argued in a recent YouTube video.\nFind Out: Never Do These 3 Things With Your Money, Says Personal Finance Pro Humphrey Yang\nRead Next: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\nSethi outlined 13 common pitfalls that may be holding you back from achieving your financial goals. See if any apply to you.\nNot Questioning Your Financial Mindset\nYour perspective on money is shaped by your culture, your parents, your friends, social media and many other sources. Often, Sethi argued, we don’t question the money messages we receive: “We quietly believe it.”\nBut just because an idea is pervasive doesn’t mean it’s correct or valuable to you. You can shift your perspective on money to one that better aligns with your goals and priorities. Sethi did exactly that.\nCheck Out: The $50 Mistake Warren Buffett Says Everyone Should Avoid\nAvoiding Budgeting\nThere’s a misconception that “budgeting means restriction.” The way Sethi sees it, budgeting is about “spending guilt-free on the things you love while automatically saving and investing for your future.”\nThat kind of reframing can make budgeting much more positive and impactful in your life.\nSurrounding Yourself With the Wrong People\nPeople say “you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with,” and there’s some truth to that. Sethi pointed out that the financial attitudes and practices of those around you will begin to seem normal and influence your own behavior.\nTry to surround yourself with people who make smart financial decisions you want to emulate.\nNot Having Enough Curiosity\nWhen Sethi used to pass restaurants he couldn’t afford to eat in, he reframed his thinking to be curious about what those restaurant patrons were doing to afford to eat there. He asked himself, “What can I learn from that?”\nBeing curious and always willing to learn more will set you up for success in your financial journey.\nBeing Overly Cautious\nSethi argued that “a lot of people use caution to seem smarter than they are.” While thinking your actions through is a good thing, you can’t let fear stop you from making the right moves.\nListening to the Wrong Advice\nThere’s tons of financial advice out there. Everyone has some idea of what you should do to get rich, but those ideas don’t all have merit. Sethi’s recommendation is to take financial advice from someone only if you would trade places with that person, financially speaking.","content_hash":"1df62598ffb850bec839a508409732ea","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2724,"method_rank":0}

The extra supply, along with concern about the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, has weighed on oil this year.\nSupply is rising far faster than demand in the IEA's view. It expects world oil demand to rise by 680,000 bpd this year and 700,000 bpd next year, both down 20,000 bpd from the previous forecast.\n\"The latest data show lacklustre demand across the major economies and, with consumer confidence still depressed, a sharp rebound appears remote,\" the agency said in the report that linked its higher output forecast to increased OPEC+ production targets. \"Oil market balances look ever more bloated.\"\nIEA demand forecasts are at the lower end of the industry range, as the agency expects a faster transition to renewable energy sources than some other forecasters. OPEC on Tuesday maintained its forecast for demand to rise by 1.29 million bpd this year - almost double the IEA figure.\nOil prices extended losses after the IEA published its report at 0800 GMT, with Brent crude trading lower than $66 a barrel.\nIMPLIED SURPLUS TO RISE\nThe report implies that supply may exceed demand by almost 3 million bpd next year, driven by growth from outside the wider OPEC+ group and a limited expansion in demand.\nDespite higher OPEC+ production, non-OPEC producers will continue to lead supply growth this year and next owing to rising output in the U.S., Canada, Brazil and Guyana, according to the IEA.\nStill, additional sanctions on Russia and Iran may curb supplies from the world’s third and fifth largest producers, the IEA said.\nThe U.S. announced new sanctions on Iran last month and the European Union lowered a price cap for Russian oil as part of its latest sanctions on Moscow.\n\"It is clear that something will have to give for the market to balance,\" the IEA said.\nContinued Chinese stockbuilding due to major institutional and policy developments aimed at enhancing energy security may help absorb the surplus, the agency said. This helped support prices earlier in the year, analysts have said.","content_hash":"381f570b31bbd0ebc4a7657b1781b406","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2713,"method_rank":0}

Global pharmaceutical companies are bracing for the outcome of the investigation, which will usher in sector-specific tariffs that Trump has said could start small and eventually rise to 250%.\nThe Republican president said as recently as last week that his plan relies on phased-in tariffs, giving drugmakers time to increase manufacturing in the United States as he pushes to alter what he says are global trade distortions in many industries.\nOne government official in Europe and a source with knowledge of the White House process, as well as two sources at European drug firms familiar with the process, told Reuters that the report and tariffs announcement was not imminent and likely weeks away. These sources spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA White House spokesperson, asked about media reporting indicating that the results of the probe could be several weeks away, cautioned that such reports were pure speculation unless confirmed by the White House. The spokesperson declined to give further details about the timing of the pharma probe or one involving semiconductors.\nThe investigation is examining pharmaceutical imports ranging from finished prescription drugs to active pharmaceutical ingredients, called APIs, and other raw materials, with the results to be disclosed in a Commerce Department report.\nLutnick said last month the tariff plan that will be based on the report would be completed by the end of July. Lutnick then said on July 29 it would be two more weeks.\nThe investigation was launched under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. While the investigation is ongoing, the pharmaceutical sector has been exempted from the sweeping tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.\nThe United States has reached bilateral trade deals with the UK, Japan, South Korea and the European Union that promised more favorable terms for their pharma exports than those expected to be levied on the sector globally.\nA European government official said that an announcement before the end of August appears unlikely but cautioned that the timeline could shift depending on other developments.","content_hash":"ed2c05f8176d0dedabce637611da0b20","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2698,"method_rank":0}

Health Choice Alliance has also filed previous legal action against Eli Lilly in the past.\nIn the latest filing, Paxton and Health Choice Alliance claim that Eli Lilly’s actions cost Texas Medicaid “millions of dollars”. The claimants argue that prescriptions were covered by the government insurance programme, resulting in claims to Texas Medicaid that were “tainted by Eli Lilly’s illegal marketing and quid pro quo arrangements”.\nAs per the filing, Lilly is alleged to have participated in two schemes to induce and influence providers. In the first, the pharma company, with the help of third parties, apparently provided free nursing services. The second scheme alleges that Lilly continues to offer reimbursement support services to get their drugs prescribed over rivals.\nAn Eli Lilly spokesperson told Pharmaceutical Technology that it intends to “vigorously defend against these allegations”.\nThe spokesperson added: “Multiple courts and the federal government have rejected claims by this same corporate relator against Lilly as meritless. In fact, the United States Government determined that ‘the relators’ allegations lack sufficient factual and legal support’ in a prior case, explaining that federal healthcare programs have a strong interest in ensuring that, after a physician has appropriately prescribed a medication, patients have access to basic product support relating to their medication.\"\nThis referred to similar kickback claims previously made by Health Choice Alliance. Lilly was originally sued by the organisation in 2017, alleged to have participated in a “multi-tiered kickback scheme” along with other pharma companies, including Bayer. This involved offering free nursing services in exchange for preferential drug prescriptions.\nThe case was dismissed a year later by a judge in Texas. In 2021, a court of appeals upheld the prior decision to scrap the case amid attempts to revive the lawsuit.","content_hash":"8cf94589d8f6a52eb7d5e8d7ea9e947d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2695,"method_rank":0}

The dollar is also being undercut by weaker dollar interest rate differentials, with the 10-year T-note yield down -5.4 bp today and the 2-year T-note yield down by -5.6 bp.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent today said that interest rates are \"too constrictive\" and that rates \"should probably be 150, 175 basis points lower.\" He added, \"There's a very good chance of a 50 basis point cut. We could go into a series of rate cuts here, starting with a 50 basis point rate cut in September.\" The Fed is currently targeting the federal funds rate in the range of 4.25%-4.50% and the effective rate is currently at 4.33%.\nMore News from Barchart\nThe markets have started to think about the chances for a -50 basis point rate cut in September, based on Monday's largely benign CPI report and the fact that the US labor market is slowing, with average monthly payroll growth in May-July of only +35,000. On a year-on-year basis, Tuesday's July headline CPI of +2.7% y\/y was slightly weaker than expected, but the core CPI of +3.1% y\/y was slightly stronger than expected.\nThe federal funds futures market today boosted the odds to 100% for a -25 bp rate cut in September and a slight 1% chance of a -50 bp rate cut. The market late Tuesday was discounting the odds of a -25 bp rate cut in September at 96%, up from 40% before the July payroll report released on August 1. The federal funds futures market is currently discounting an overall -63 bp rate cut by the end of this year to 3.70%, and an overall -133 bp rate cut to 3.00% by the end of 2026.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump extended the tariff truce with China, which was to expire on Tuesday, for another 90 days. Last Wednesday, President Trump announced that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, Mr. Trump announced last Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.","content_hash":"6efaee580279d4ef0016dc4c0a1f35bc","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2692,"method_rank":0}

Yet, it's made many investors wealthy.\nOne thousand dollars invested three years ago is now worth an incredible $10,640 as of Aug. 11.\nViking Therapeutics: The best may be yet to come\nThe excitement around the stock centers on its lead development compound, VK2735. It's a GLP-1\/GIP dual agonist for the treatment of obesity. Vikings VK2735 is following in the footsteps of Eli Lilly's GLP-1\/GIP dual agonist tirzepatide (branded as Zepbound), and investors are hoping VK2735 can achieve similar levels of success.\nWhere is this promising drug now\nVK2735 is in phase 3 trials in subcutaneous (injection) form, with results probably not due until 2027, and, arguably more excitingly, it's in phase 2 trials in an oral form. The latter has obvious benefits of convenience and comfort for patients, and management expects to report on the phase 2 trial this year.\nInvestors have high hopes, as the phase 2 subcutaneous trial resulted in up to 88% of patients experiencing more than 10% weight loss.\nThe phase 1 trials in oral form were also impressive (remember that phase 1 trials are fundamentally exploratory and often aim to understand safety and tolerability), with a mean weight loss of 8.2% after 28 days of dosing.\nThese results are enough to encourage Viking investors that VK2735 could prove to be a hugely successful compound, and the results of the latest tests of the oral form are eagerly anticipated, not least by potential larger pharmaceutical companies that may try to buy the company and take VK2735 (oral) through phase 3.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Viking Therapeutics right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Viking Therapeutics, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Viking Therapeutics wasn’t one of them.

And recessions are indeed a normal part of the business cycle, and it’s highly unlikely they’ll ever go away.\nBut in reality, recessions normally occur many years apart, with the economy often growing a decade or more between contractions. According to data from the National Bureau of Economic Research, for example, there have only been six recessions since 1980, a span of 45 years.\nCheck Out: 8 Smart Ways Frugal People Are Living Like There’s Already a Recession\nDiscover More: 9 Downsizing Tips for the Middle Class To Save on Monthly Expenses\nThat being said, there hasn’t been a major recession in 16 years, not counting the shortest recession on record that occurred at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. With high interest rates, markets at peak valuations and prices on everything from groceries to cars remaining elevated, it could be a good time to implement some recession-proof money habits in 2025.\nBest of all, these sound financial practices will also help you preserve and grow your wealth even if a recession never comes.\nBuild Your Life Around Having Excess Cash\nWhen it comes to staying out of trouble financially, cash flow is king. No matter how much money you earn, if you spend all of it, you’ll never be financially secure.\nThis is why financial advisors always caution about lifestyle creep. If your income jumps from $50,000 to $60,000 per year, for example, it’s extremely common for your spending to increase by $10,000 per year also. Resist the temptation to spend every last dollar you earn or else you’ll always live paycheck to paycheck.\nWhat are some ways to accomplish this? Setting aside money for savings and investments before you even pay your bills is a great way to build long-term wealth while learning to live beneath your means. Paying off high-interest credit card debt — or never getting into debt in the first place — is a great way to get a handle on your finances and free up your cash flow.\nRead Next: 4 Surprising Things That Could Impact Your Wallet If a Recession Hits\nStock Your Emergency Fund\nMost financial advisors recommend that you stock an emergency fund with three to six months of expenses to cover things like unexpected vehicle or medical bills. But job loss during a recession certainly qualifies as an emergency, as well.\nIf for some reason it seems as if a recession is imminent — especially if you are concerned about your status at work — it might be a good idea to boost that emergency fund to hold up to a year’s worth of expenses. This way, you’re likely to survive even the very worst of recessions.","content_hash":"6c5bf4ccace208dfc011b24ab8f9b604","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2681,"method_rank":0}

Economists expected the index, which tracks price changes across a broad range of goods and services, to rise 2.8% year-over-year.\nConsumer prices rose 0.2% on a monthly basis, following a 0.3% increase in June, which represented the largest month-to-month increase to CPI since January.\nThe price of Bitcoin ticked up to $118,000 following Tuesday’s snapshot, while showing a 1.1% decrease over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Ethereum rose 3.2% to $4,300, while Solana fell 1.7% to $176, over the same period.\nAspects of the report pointed to underlying price pressures. Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 3.1% year-over-year, coming in slightly above economists' expectations.

But there have been repeated calls to lower rates from the president and criticism directed at Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nLower interest rates tend to benefit risk assets like stocks and crypto, and the odds of a rate cut in September surged following a weaker-than-expected jobs report, which included downward revisions of 258,000 total jobs in May and June earlier this month.\nFollowing the inflation print, traders penciled in 82.5% chance that the Fed would lower interest rates next month. The odds have fallen slightly from an 86% chance on Monday, according to CME FedWatch.","content_hash":"04949d700b418adff772fcd9994fdfe8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2679,"method_rank":0}

The purchase is expected to help Western Union scale its presence in Latin America and build up its North American business as well, the release said.\n-\nBoth of the companies’ boards have approved the combination and they expect to complete the transaction by the middle of next year, the release said.\n-\n”This acquisition strengthens Western Union’s retail offering in the U.S., expands market coverage in high potential geographies, and is expected to accelerate digital new customer acquisition,” the release said.\nDive Insight:\nDenver-based Western Union, a money transfer business founded in 1851, has struggled to grow in recent years as digital competition increases, though it does offer a digital wallet in some countries.\nSome of the rival fintechs include Remitly, mainly in the consumer arena, and Payoneer Global, in the business-to-business category, with stablecoin plays coming on strong also.\nWestern Union’s global network has agents that handle its transfers in 200 countries, according to its annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company reported revenue last year of $4.2 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Still, net income jumped about 50% to $934 million, partly due to a tax benefit.\n“This acquisition is a disciplined, strategic step that strengthens our North America operations and expands our presence with key consumer segments across the U.S.” Western Union CEO Devin McGranahan said in the release.\nAnnual revenue at Miami-based International Money Express, also known as Intermex, was flat last year at about $659 million and the company’s net income was also little changed at about $59 million, according to its annual filing. The company has about six million customers, according to the release.\nThe price paid for Intermex wasn’t as rich as that paid recently for other fintech acquisitions, noted analysts at William Blair, who commented on the deal in a note to clients Monday. They cited geopolitical turmoil between the U.S. and Latin America, a recent 1% U.S. tax imposed on cash remittances and unspecified “uncertainties” in the traditional retail remittance market.\nWestern Union expects $30 million in “cost synergies” within 24 months, the release said. Such expense improvements often result from cutting employees as the companies merge operations.","content_hash":"6200d94f8af0dedb19745ee27263b7a3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2672,"method_rank":0}

Nearly the same share think they're more likely to win the lottery or become homeless in that same timeframe.\nIt's a dramatic comparison, but it shows just how far out of reach homeownership feels for many young adults, even as most still dream about it. 90% of Gen Z say they want to own a home someday, but 62% percent fear they never will.\nFrom Dreams to Desperation\nTwo-thirds of Gen Z say they're more concerned about housing security now than they were a year ago. Nearly a third have even considered squatting or living in their car.\nAffordability is the biggest barrier. Among those who doubt they'll ever own a home, 82% cite high prices — a sharp jump from 57% in 2024. Three out of four say the high cost of living has made saving for a down payment impossible, and nearly half think it's pointless to even try saving.\nFor some, the desperation shows in the compromises they're willing to make.

And learning those things early can mean the difference between you becoming a millionaire and you living paycheck to paycheck for decades.\nThe key is to understand your paycheck and to use your income to grow your wealth. GOBankingRates breaks it all down.\n1. Your Salary Is Not Your Take-Home Pay, Sadly\nThat’s right. However much you were hired for, that’s not actually how much you’ll take home. In fact, you’ll probably take home closer to two-thirds of your actual salary. From every single paycheck, you’ll automatically pay:\n-\nFederal income tax\n-\nState tax (in all but eight states)\n-\nSocial Security (6.2% of your salary)\n-\nMedicare (1.45% of your salary)\nYou’ll often hear people differentiate between your gross income and your net. Your gross income is how much money you get paid before taxes. Your net income is after those lovely deductions.\nFind Out: Are You Rich or Middle Class? 8 Ways To Tell That Go Beyond Your Paycheck\n2. You May Have Even More Deductions\nBut wait — it doesn’t stop there. Many employers in the United States also offer benefits packages that offer discounts on services like health insurance, dental insurance and retirement funds, like a 401(k) plan. If you sign up for any of these options, you’ll see those deductions come from your pay, as well.\nThese deductions will vary based on which options you choose and how much your employer contributes.\n3. Find Out How Often You Get Paid\nIt’s important to know how often you get paid. Some employers will pay you twice a month, on the 1st and the 15th, for example. Others will pay you every other week on the same day of the week.\nThis information is helpful because it can help you decide how much to spend and how much to invest.\nBiweekly pay gives you 26 paychecks per year, as opposed to the 24 you would get for semimonthly checks. That means you’d get an “extra check” two months out of the year, which you can plan to invest to grow your wealth.\n4. You Need a Budget\nNow that you’re making the big bucks, you want to use your money wisely. Far too many people start making money and then just spend it. Before the next paycheck comes in, all your money is gone, and you’ve begun the vicious cycle of living paycheck to paycheck.","content_hash":"2538cd33f137e3a6db3ce1e2b6c1ffa0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2646,"method_rank":0}

It is also the leading apartment developer, with 8,247 units started in 2024, and the No. 2 apartment builder, with 6,640 construction starts.\nIf approved the settlement would require Greystar to:\n-\nRefrain from using any program that generates rent price recommendations using nonpublic and\/or sensitive data from competitors or that incorporates certain anticompetitive features.\n-\nRefrain from sharing sensitive information with competitors.\n-\nAccept a court-appointed monitor for any use of uncertified third-party pricing algorithms.\n-\nNot attend meetings of competing landlords hosted by RealPage, or else report all details of the meeting to United States authorities.\n-\nCooperate with the United States’ monopolization claims against RealPage.\nThese restrictions will take effect on April 1, 2026, or 180 days after the entry of the final judgment, whichever is earlier.\nGreystar, in its own announcement, stated its belief that the company’s use of RealPage’s revenue management software is in compliance with all applicable laws. The company intends for this settlement to provide the multifamily industry with guidance around the government’s interpretation of the law regarding the technology.\n“The industry continues to face litigation and unclear regulatory guidance around the use of revenue management tools,” the statement reads. “The settlements provide clarity for Greystar and the industry at large. They acknowledge the shifting regulatory landscape while reinforcing our ability to deliver bespoke advice and leverage technology.”","content_hash":"51cd5a8cc58b8c05467687665ff1b8c6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2644,"method_rank":0}

With the new GOP tax law just passed, taxes aren’t going up. Does this mean conversions make less sense now?\nConfused About Conversions\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n-\nMy father was worth millions. I suspect my mother is stealing my inheritance. What can I do?\n-\nWhy Wall Street’s biggest bear is expecting a 14% stock-market pullback before the end of 2025\nDear Confused,\nFor most taxpayers, if a Roth conversion was a good idea before the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act bill was passed, it is probably still a good idea.\nYou have the strategic value of a conversion correct. You pay tax now to avoid tax later. If the rate you would pay today is lower than the rate you would pay in the future, converting pays off. The amount of that payoff depends on the difference between the present and future tax rates. The bigger the difference, the bigger the payoff.\nRead: How the passage of Trump’s megabill could benefit you at tax time\nFor instance, if you convert $10,000 from an IRA to a Roth IRA, and that $10,000 is subject to a 12% rate, the federal tax bill is $1,200. If in the future you were expecting a 22% rate on a $10,000 withdrawal from the IRA, you would have thus expected to pay $2,200 in tax.\nBy having the funds in the Roth IRA, you paid $1,200 in tax the year of the conversion but avoided $2,200 in tax on the future distribution so you are better off by $1,000. That $1,000 difference corresponds exactly to the difference in tax rates. 22%-12% = 10% and 10% of $10,000 is $1,000.\nNow, if the future tax rate were to be lower, say you are leaving the IRA to your church, a Roth conversion will cost you, not save you tax dollars. Using the same $10,000 example, you would pay $1,200 in tax to avoid the church paying tax, but churches are tax exempt and would pay no taxes on the bequest anyway. A conversion in that case makes no sense.\nIf the current and future rates are the same, 12% now and 12% later, the tax bill is $1,200 either way so there is no tax benefit to convert. There is also no tax negative to the conversion.\nBefore the tax bill was passed in July, tax rates were scheduled to revert to what they were for tax year 2017. Generally, this meant the 12% bracket would have been 15% and the 22% bracket would have been 25% starting in 2026. However, the new tax law removed the expiration of the 2017 bracket structure. Some taxpayers converted at 12% anticipating a 25% future tax rate. That won’t happen now but they are still looking at getting the benefit of converting at 12% and avoiding tax at 22%.","content_hash":"25af200b7f51f623e14306d7fbe35831","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2642,"method_rank":0}

The executive order applies to packages from all countries, building on the initial de minimis suspension that was slapped on parcels from China in early May.\nE-commerce businesses have long relied on the trade provision to bring in low-value packages into the U.S. as it allowed them to skirt paying duties. With the new suspension set to take place, these sellers will mostly have to pay duties equal to the tariff rates imposed by Trump for each individual country. Four million de minimis-eligible packages were shipped to the U.S. each day throughout 2024.\nShipBob revealed the program ahead of the company’s Fulfilled 2025 annual merchant event, which is taking place from Aug. 10-12 in Fort Worth, Texas, as part of its wider summer product release.\nWhen entering the program, sellers can onboard their technology and operations in as fast as one week across any of ShipBob’s more than 60 global fulfillment centers, the company said. Program members are eligible for a free tour a ShipBob hub in the U.S.\nEntrants will get discounts of up to 75 percent on implementation and onboarding fees, as well as a 50-percent discount on the first inbound order within the inventory placement program.\nShipBob is also discounting inbound receiving costs, as well as U.S. and cross-border fulfillment rates. Additionally, the third-party logistics (3PL) firm offers discounted VIP access to its referral network partners. These partners offer services including tariff mitigation strategies, HTS and HS-code optimization, importer of record documentation and product compliance services.\n“We launched the De Minimis Defense Program because our current and future customers needed a fast, strategic response to one of the biggest cross-border changes in years,” said Divey Gulati, chief operating officer and co-founder of ShipBob, in a statement. “Merchants that relied on low-duty or duty-free imports are suddenly facing massive cost, cash flow and compliance pressures.

Those estimated losses are based on a so-called 1-in-250-year tail event and factor in global supply-chain impacts and other related events.\nDragos researchers say the indirect losses, including the impact from disrupting normal operations, are the concerns that many companies fail to account for.\n“We see OT companies investing the majority of their cybersecurity budget on IT networks,” said Mark Stacey, VP, risk and resilience solutions at Dragos, adding that companies often assume OT functioning as normal when production is ongoing.\n“The potential impact of business interruption (whether direct through adversary action or indirect to an abundance of caution) is often underestimated,” he says.\nIn comparison, the average annual global risk, including business interruption claims, is $12.7 billion, the average global aggregated risk over the next 12 months is $31 billion.\nThe financial analysis is based on 10 years of breach and insurance-claims data from Marsh McLennan’s Cyber Risk Intelligence Center.\nThe report provides insights into the risks facing operational technology, which has experienced an increase in attacks in recent years. Manufacturing and other critical infrastructure sectors are increasingly dependent on connected technologies, including the need for remote-access tools that are often connected to the internet.\nThe report highlights how specific defense strategies can reduce overall risk. The three OT security controls most associated with risk reduction were maintaining a comprehensive incident-response plan, using defensible architecture and performing continuous monitoring to preserve visibility into a network\nIn recent months, companies have reported significant financial losses from cyberattacks that affected their supply chains or their ability to conduct online transactions.\nBritish department store chain Marks & Spencer took a $400 million hit after a social-engineering attack linked to the Scattered Spider cybercrime group.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 463 points, or 1%, while the Nasdaq composite added 0.1% to its own record set the day before.\nTreasury yields eased in the bond market as expectations reached a virtual consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut its main interest rate for the first time this year at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, though they risk worsening inflation.\nStock indexes in Asia jumped in their first trading after Tuesday’s better-than-expected report on U.S. inflation triggered a jump in bets that a cut to interest rates is coming. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng leaped 2.6%, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rallied 1.3% and South Korea’s Kospi climbed 1.1%.\nIndexes also rose in Europe, though the moves were more modest after they already had the chance to trade on the U.S. inflation data the afternoon before. Germany’s DAX returned 0.7%, and France’s CAC 40 rose 0.7%.\nOn Wall Street, stocks of companies that could benefit most from lower interest rates helped lead the way. PulteGroup climbed 5.4%, and Lennar rose 5.2% as part of a broad rally for homebuilders and others in the housing industry. Lower rates could make mortgages cheaper to get, which could spur more buying.\nThe hopes for lower interest rates are helping to drown out criticism that the U.S. stock market has broadly grown too expensive after its big leap since hitting a low in April.\nOne way companies can make their stock prices look less expensive is to deliver strong growth in profits, and Brinker International rose 1.6% after becoming the latest to report stronger results for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

The Chinese electric-vehicle (EV) maker's recently launched sub-brands, Firefly and Onvo, contributed 40% to its June sales, and that's what caught everyone's attention.\nAlthough Nio launched its first Onvo model L60 late last year, its all-electric large three-row L90 SUV sparked unprecedented optimism last month. In the two weeks following the start of L90 pre-sales on July 10, Nio's stock shot up over 40% on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The optimism spilled over to the U.S., and Nio shares surged on the New York Stock Exchange as investors bet on a potential turnaround.\nCan Nio stock fly higher?\nNio's deliveries of 24,925 vehicles in June was its highest so far this year. However, the company's July delivery numbers are already in, and it delivered only 21,017 vehicles in the month. That explains why Nio stock is down about 8% in August, as of this writing.\nShould investors be worried, though? I'd say no, because August should be a bigger month for Nio as it began deliveries of L90 on August 1.\nA local media report stated that Onvo president Shen Fei has set an internal target of delivering over 10,000 units of L90 in August alone. If Nio hits that number, the Onvo L90 will achieve the highest monthly sales among all of Nio's models in the company's history. Nio is aggressively ramping up production of L90 to fulfill deliveries.\nMeanwhile, Nio's other sub-brand Firefly, targeted to the mass market, is rapidly expanding overseas. Firefly launched its first namesake compact electric car in April this year to take on the BMW Mini and the Mercedes-Benz Smart. By the end of 2025, Nio expects Firefly to be available in 20 overseas markets, primarily across Europe.\nNio will also launch its next-generation ES8 SUV in the coming months, which management believes should drive its Nio brand sales to 25,000 units per month. If management's numbers fall in place, Nio could soon be selling over 35,000 cars every month.\nBack in April, I believed Nio stock was incredibly cheap and a top value EV stock to buy. Given the company's push into mass markets and aggressive goals for L90, I see a lot more upside in the stock price.","content_hash":"0b345f80c8ec06944f80dddd53934342","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2629,"method_rank":0}

It's up 220% over the past year as of Aug. 20, while the market is up only 21% at the same time.\nIt's a huge change from the pessimism of the past few years. Let's see how much money you'd have if you'd invested $1,000 three years ago in Lemonade.\nA great concept is finally taking off\nLemonade captured market attention when it went public in July 2020 because it offers a disruptive, tech-based insurance model that's refreshingly different. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to price policies, and it uses chatbots to onboard customers and process claims. It's a digital insurance solution for a changing world, and it's used AI to drive its business since it began operating a decade ago, well before AI became the buzzword of the day.\nAlthough it's been growing by leaps and bounds, with high customer additions and increasing premiums, Lemonade has had trouble establishing profitability. Insurance companies have a distinct model, since they pay claims from premiums, and the loss ratio tracks how much is being paid out. It has taken time for Lemonade to get its algorithms to work. That, along with high rollout expenses that have eaten away profits, has dragged on the stock. It's been and up and down over the past few years as the market began to lose patience, and even today, it's still 72% off of its all-time highs.\nInvestors who recognized the opportunity to buy on the dip have been rewarded. If you bought stock a year ago, when it was still close to all-time lows, your investment has more than tripled. But if you invested $1,000 three years ago, you'd still be still beating the market, with more than $1,700.\nIf you're worried you've missed the Lemonade gains, don't be. The company has lots of opportunity ahead.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lemonade right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Lemonade, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lemonade wasn’t one of them.

Last month, UCLA agreed to pay over $6 million to settle a lawsuit alleging antisemitism.

Over the last decade, for example, Eli Lilly stock averaged annual gains of 25.1%, enough to turn a $10,000 investment into a stake worth $94,204. (The S&P 500 index averaged a still-respectable 12.7% over the same period, turning $10,000 into $33,117.) Had you reinvested your Lilly dividends into more shares of stock along the way, your average gain would have been 26.9%, and your investment's value $108,082.\nIf you're not an Eli Lilly shareholder, you might be wondering whether you should become one. Well, there's certainly a solid green flag or two. Unfortunately, there's a red flag, too.\nA key reason to buy into Eli Lilly is its solid portfolio of drugs and drugs in development. It's already a leader in the increasingly popular realm of weight loss drugs -- with weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro -- and its cancer drug Verzenio is very promising, too. And those are just some of its drugs. My colleague Keith Speights has suggested that Lilly might become the first healthcare company to cross the $1 trillion mark in market value.\nOf course, not every drug will become a best-seller -- and some never even get approved. Eli Lilly reported some disappointing results for its weight loss drug orforglipron recently, which sent its shares downward -- even though patients taking it did lose significant weight.\nSo what's the red flag? Well, it's Eli Lilly's valuation. With a recent price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 61, well above its five-year average of 50, the stock seems a bit richly priced -- though not wildly overpriced. You could still load up on it if you're a long-term investor, or you could buy into the stock gradually over time.

Over the trailing twelve months, the composite returned 3.34% on a gross basis (2.62% net) versus the Russell 2500®, which returned 9.91% and the Russell 2500® Value, which returned 10.47%, over the same period. The fund’s top 5 holdings are also listed in the letter, showing the firm’s main investment positions heading into 2025. A copy of SouthernSun SMID Cap Strategy’s Q2 2025 investor letter is available for download here.\nOne of the companies mentioned in the letter is Boot Barn Holdings\n(NYSE:BOOT). Boot Barn Holdings (NYSE:BOOT) operates specialty retail stores in the United States and internationally, and its specialty retail stores offer western and work-related footwear, apparel, and accessories for men, women, and kids. Over the past month, Boot Barn Holdings (NYSE:BOOT) fell by -1.40%, but its shares gained 24.84% of their value over the last 12 months. On August 12, 2025, Boot Barn Holdings (NYSE:BOOT) shares closed at $172.90, with a market capitalization of $5.15 billion.\nHere is what they have to say about Boot Barn Holdings (NYSE:BOOT) in their investor letter:\n\"Boot Barn Holdings (NYSE:BOOT) was a top contributor in the second quarter. After a pullback in the first quarter which we believe was due to concerns about the cost of tariffs and weakening consumer confidence, BOOT recovered nicely after reporting their fiscal 4th quarter and full year (2025) results. For the full year, sales were up 14.6%, and same store sales increased 5.5%. (In the current quarter, they report that same store sales are up approximately 9%). They opened 60 new stores last year, bringing their total store count to 459, and they plan on continuing to open new stores at a rate of approximately 15% new floor space per year. They shared the tariff mitigation plan which includes meaningful supply chain moves away from China in the coming quarters. All in all, the BOOT thesis remains intact: growth through new stores and same store sales; growth in their higher margin proprietary brands; and their balance sheet is in excellent shape with no net debt.\"","content_hash":"d28dbb078c5b6dad8ff7298a865f8587","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2619,"method_rank":0}

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily ESG Dive newsletter.\nDive Brief:\n-\nMore than half of S&P 100 companies adjusted how they communicated diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in their annual securities filings this year compared to 2024, according to a new report by The Conference Board.\n-\nAmong S&P 500 companies, the use of the acronym “DEI” dropped by 68% compared to 2024, according to the report. Twenty-one percent of companies reduced or removed DEI-related metrics and targets.\n-\nWhile firms scaled back DEI language and commitments, 79% percent of S&P 500 firms disclosed board committee oversight of DEI, up from 72%, according to the report. For Russell 3000 companies, this figure jumped from 48.4% to 86.8%. Rather than simply abandoning DEI, this suggests that companies are being more cautious about external messaging while integrating DEI into governance to make it more legally defensible, according to the report.\nDive Insight:\nCompanies have been rolling back their DEI programs since the Supreme Court’s 2023 decision outlawing affirmative action in higher education.\nAfter President Donald Trump’s reelection, McDonald’s, Meta, a few banks and others preemptively adjusted policies in anticipation of backlash. When a January 2025 executive order directed heads of agencies to target private sector DEI, another wave of major companies — including Target, BlackRock and even law firms — dropped their DEI goals, a trend that continues. A July 23 report by Resume.org reported that 20% of companies have scrapped their DEI programs since Trump’s reelection.\nThe Conference Board report, based on 2025 Form-10K filings, largely aligns with the individual headlines. More companies in 2025 have limited disclosures of workforce or leadership diversity. The share of S&P 500 companies that disclosed data on women in management dropped from 71.2% in 2024 to 55.1% in 2025, and the share that disclosed the total number of female board members dropped from 90.5% to 60.4%.\nJust 2.5% of companies did not disclose any information about board racial diversity in 2024, but that number jumped to 33.9% this year. Among Russell 3000 companies, that figure leaped from 14.1% to 54.7%.\nIn recent years, some U.S. public companies have linked executive compensation to DEI-related goals. In 2024, 68% of S&P 500 companies and 41.6% of Russell 3000 companies disclosed in their annual reports that they linked these metrics. In 2025, this figure dropped to 35.3% for S&P 500 companies and 18.7% for Russell 3000 companies.","content_hash":"ad9bc9249ef2476d70097aeb0cca6eb3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2612,"method_rank":0}

The agreement combined 75 individual contracts into a single enterprise deal, establishing a \"comprehensive framework for the Army's future software and data needs.\"\nThese contracts also helped fuel bullish sentiment among several Wall Street analysts. Analysts at Piper Sandler initiated coverage on Palantir at an overweight (buy) rating, assigning a price target of $170 (the stock has since eclipsed that benchmark). The analysts cited Palantir's \"one-of-a-kind growth,\" suggesting the company can deliver a revenue run rate of $24 billion by 2032.\nAnalysts at Loop Capital were similarly bullish, maintaining a buy rating and increasing their price target to $178 (the stock has since surpassed that benchmark as well).

The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite scored fresh record highs on Tuesday, as expectations for a lower overnight lending rate from the Federal Reserve reawakened animal spirits on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs also pointed out that this latest run to all-time highs coincides with increased retail participation by Main Street investors — which could signal it's time to delve into meme stocks once again. \"Recent weeks have seen a resumption of retail buying activity in S & P 500 and [Nasdaq] 100 stocks, and we believe the meme stock resurgence has spread into the broader buying of large-cap stocks,\" strategist John Marshall wrote. \"Given the pickup in retail trading, we see the potential for elevated upside asymmetry in stocks with high retail participation in the coming weeks,\" he added. According to Goldman, among the S & P 500 stocks that have seen high retail participation over the past month in terms of net retail activity are the following: Palantir — $1.2 billion Advanced Micro Devices — $774 million KeyCorp — $163 million Electronic Arts — $42 million Albemarle — $19 million UPS — $123 million Warner Bros. Discovery — $167 million Marshall recommended clients buy call options on these stocks with high retail participation. A call option gives the owner the right to buy a stock at a predetermined price — or the strike — for a specified period of time. \"Our data shows that retail investors were more focused on small-caps in the crypto\/AI\/retail\/quantum-computing spaces during the past several weeks than on large-cap names. Professional investors have also stepped up their participation through the futures\/swaps\/options channels … and we see further upside, as the case for a September rate cut is more likely,\" Marshall said. To be sure, the retail momentum could be derailed if new data ahead of the Fed's September meeting shows a reversal to the upside in inflation trends. But for now, if Goldman is correct, investors may want to buy meme stocks like it's 2021. Elsewhere Wednesday morning on Wall Street, Piper Sandler raised its price target on Nvidia to $225 , signaling about 23% upside. The move comes ahead of the chipmaker's earnings due out later this month. \"We are expecting another positive quarter from NVDA and see upside to numbers for both the July and October quarters,\" analyst Harsh Kumar said. \"While we are modeling largely in-line for the July quarter and slightly below Street for October, we are calling for upside given the recent positive commentary from U.S. hyperscalers as well as the inclusion of revenues from China.\"","content_hash":"d658723efa2f90787ed1fccc029e7281","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2595,"method_rank":0}

It's not like dividend stocks completely faltered during that stretch, though. Many performed pretty well during that period, too, as evidenced by the performance of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSEMKT: VIG) over the course of the past five years.\nThen and now\nThe graphic below tells the tale. Had you invested $1,000 in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation fund in August of 2020, today you'd have $1,640 plus all the dividends it paid in the meantime. And if you'd reinvested those dividend payments in more shares of VIG, your $1,000 investment would be worth $1,800 now.\nThe dividend payments for this exchange-traded fund (ETF) have also grown during this time. July's quarterly payment of $0.87 per share is well above the same quarter's payment of only $0.60 in 2020, in line with this fund's actual dividend growth during this five-year period.\nNot the best ETF for dividend income\nIn this vein, you should know that while this Vanguard fund prioritizes reliable dividend growth over high yields or capital appreciation, Vanguard Dividend Appreciation also offers the latter at least as well as most other dividend-oriented ETFs. Only the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT: VYM) has fared better for the past five years, and only by a slight margin.\nCredit a quirk of the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF's underlying S&P U.S. Dividend Growers Index, mostly. It excludes the highest-yielding one-fourth of tickers that would otherwise be eligible for inclusion in the index. Standard & Poor's fears these high yields suggest their particular companies may be facing growth headwinds.\nRemoving these highest-yielding names from the mix, of course, also dials back this ETF's average dividend yield. VIG's trailing yield right now is a little less than 1.7%, which isn't much for anyone looking for above-average investment income. Point being, this fund is best used as a defensive, quality-capital-growth holding.","content_hash":"f72169ea3008e14ddbfb839a0c8185ce","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2593,"method_rank":0}

It also reported that its new oral (pill) weight-loss drug orforglipron didn't cut patients' weight quite as much as the company had hoped it would. But according to Bernstein analyst Courtney Breen, this steep decline in stock price has created a \"clear buying opportunity\" for new investors, as she writes in a note on StreetInsider.com today.\nLilly beat on both sales and earnings last week, notes Breen, and investors' decision to sell off the stock on less-than-stellar orforglipron results \"was overblown,\" subtracting almost $100 billion from Lilly's market capitalization. Tagging the new drug with an affectionate diminutive, Breen argues that \"Orfo\" can still play a \"market expanding role\" that will drive Lilly's already strong results even higher in future years.\nIs Lilly stock a buy?\nI think she's right about that. Consider:\nBreen predicts that Lilly will earn $22.84 per share this year, and most analysts agree that the stock can grow earnings 32% or better over the next five years. To get a price\/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.0, that would therefore imply a fair value of $730 for Lilly stock -- and right now, Lilly stock costs only $640 and change!\nAt minimum, I'd therefore forecast 14% upside for Lilly stock today. Add in a modest 1% dividend yield, and that makes Lilly stock a buy in my book.\nShould you buy stock in Eli Lilly right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

Its stock is up 26% in 2025 and 50% in the past year. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik reinforced the firm’s Buy rating after the news, with a price target of $220.\n\"We expect the UFC deal to deliver higher-than-expected financial gains and a new partnership to propel the brand forward,\" Konik said.\nAccording to Jefferies, TKO’s agreement with Paramount solidifies the company’s position as a dominant force in sports media. The seven-year deal gives Paramount+ exclusive US streaming rights for UFC events starting in 2026, including 13 numbered events and 30 Fight Nights annually.\nNotably, the deal is a shift away from the traditional pay-per-view (PPV) model. TKO CEO Dana White has said the agreement aims to make it \"more affordable and accessible to view the greatest fights on a massive platform.\"\nKonik wrote that removing the PPV barriers could drive higher fan engagement and broader reach. Additionally, TKO retains key international media rights and gained two minutes of additional ad inventory per hour, giving it flexibility to monetize content further.\nRaymond James analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a note that the announcement signals Paramount's management may be adopting a more aggressive, growth-focused strategy toward sports rights and content spending. The deal with TKO underscores broader competition among streaming platforms to secure premium live sports content.\nTKO, the result of a 2023 merger between UFC and WWE, has also won big deals for the wrestling league.\nLast week, ESPN reached a $1.6 billion agreement with TKO's WWE for exclusive rights to high-profile events like WrestleMania.

The Project Stress Index, a measure of construction projects that have been paused, abandoned or delayed, fell 24.3% between June and July.\nThat decline offered some relief for builders facing rising material costs and elevated borrowing rates. A 37.1% drop in abandonments in July drove the overall decline in project stress. On-hold and bid delays fell too, by 15.5% and 4%, respectively, according to the data.\nStress in the private sector eased most significantly in July. Private bid delays fell close to historic lows and on-hold activity dropped to around its long-term average, said Devin Bell, associate economist at ConstructConnect.\nBut both private and public sector abandonment activity remain near historic highs.\nEven with the improvement in stress in July, the index sits 14.1% above the 2021 baseline, said Bell. Over the past year, overall stress is up 25.9%, he said.\n“We typically see abandonment activity trail off after the first half of the year,” said Bell. “July has broken this trend with both sector abandonments near historic highs as we enter the second half of the year.”\nIn the public sector, abandonments remain near the index peak, up 76.7% year over year, despite the decline in July. At the same time, projects placed on hold in the public sector ticked up 2.1% compared to the same period in 2024, according to the data.\nPittsfield, Massachusetts-based Unistress Corp. and its subsidiary, Berkshire Concrete Corp. laid off 233 workers, according to a Massachusetts Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification notice filed for the week ending June 27. Unistress CEO Perri Petricca said the decision stems from the delay of two major contracts following volatility in steel prices.\nIrving, Texas-based Fluor also recently reported delays and cancellations on its backlog due to cost escalation, trade policy shifts and interest rates, according to its second quarter earnings call. Its CEO Jim Breuer told investors the construction market has entered a period of “short-term hesitation.”\n“The volatile economic environment continues to weigh on the construction market,” said Bell. “[That’s] potentially pushing some owners and developers toward abandonment.”","content_hash":"f4f81a2ce9b436cd3d18c7248d0a2d11","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2577,"method_rank":0}

According to the survey released this week, 65% would consider relocating their businesses out of the state, 4% reported they would likely retire from the industry altogether and 8% claimed they’d “consider” becoming employees.\nFSI CEO and President Dale Brown said the survey proved that independent advisors “don’t want to be employees,” calling advisors “entrepreneurs and business owners.”\n“This proposed rule threatens not only the businesses advisors have built, but also New Jersey families’ access to the advice they rely on to navigate life transitions and achieve financial security,” Brown said.\nThe report’s release followed Brown’s testimony earlier this year in opposition to the proposed rule, in which he revealed some findings.\nNew Jersey’s proposal follows a similar rule brought up at the federal level during the Biden administration, which the Department of Labor under the Trump administration put on hold earlier this year. (The FSI was similarly vocal in its opposition to a federal standard.)\nAccording to the New Jersey Monitor, Gov. Phil Murphy originally ordered a study of the contractor classification in 2018 to determine whether current classifications meant companies could deny employees mandated workplace benefits, including unemployment and family leave.\nAccording to Robert Asaro-Angelo, commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the rule would “prevent the illegal misclassification of employees” by offering “clear, reliable guidance to employers.”\n“Not only would these new rules protect workers’ rights, but they would also ensure that bona fide independent contractors understand what makes them independent contractors, rather than employees, so that they can continue to operate with autonomy,” Asaro-Angelo said.\nAccording to the FSI study, the proposed rule would “materially modify” the “ABC Test,” which is used to determine independent contractor status in New Jersey. This would mean that some independent advisors could be reclassified as employees of their affiliated firms.","content_hash":"ad8004bb27e326f9c8aca170a344987c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2577,"method_rank":0}

They both called for a quarter-point cut to the benchmark rate.\nOther Fed officials have predicted that price pressures will just temporarily spur inflation but stopped short of favoring imminent reductions in the federal funds rate.\n“Tariffs will boost inflation in the near term, but likely not in a persistent way that monetary policy will need to offset,” San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Wednesday in a speech.","content_hash":"f716925cf217dd1c5b6f69e964e8b0f6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2570,"method_rank":0}

The company's share price was down 8.6% at 11:15 a.m. ET and had been down as much as 10.3% earlier in trading.\nNew Fortress submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stating that the filing of its quarterly 10-Q report will be delayed.

The filing said that developments on that front could affect its long-term debt and related items on its quarterly report. New Fortress also said that it needed more time to complete its unaudited results in the interim and have a public accounting firm complete a review of the interim report.\nNew Fortress Energy faces some big challenges\nWhile it's not clear when New Fortress's quarterly report will be ready, the company did share that revenue from terminal operations in Q2 and across the first half of the year were down significantly compared to the respective prior-year periods. The energy specialist attributed the sales declines to the discontinuation of a power project in Puerto Rico, the sale of the company's Jamaican business, and softer cargo sales. Operating expenses across the first half of the year were also up significantly as a result of goodwill and asset impairments.\nIn July, New Fortress had seemingly been on track to secure a 15-year, $20 billion liquefied natural gas contract with Puerto Rico that would have provided substantial cash flows and helped the company to better manage its debt situation. The deal wound up hitting regulatory roadblocks, and Puerto Rico's negotiators ceased talks with the company after it refused to make concessions.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq raced more than 1% higher on Tuesday, the VIX \"fear index\" sank to the lowest of the year and futures are up again ahead of today's bell.\n* Bond market volatility cratered to its lowest in more than 3-1\/2 years, even as \"core\" inflation rose back above 3% for the first time in five months, as Treasury yields fell across the curve and the dollar index ebbed to its weakest in more than a fortnight. President Trump again lambasted Fed chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates more quickly and threatened a \"major lawsuit\" against him, while also hitting out at Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon and its chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius for the bank's research on tariffs and forecasts.\n* Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent talked about the Fed possibly cutting rates 50 basis points next month \"to make up for the delay\" and was hopeful the latest Trump appointee to the Fed board, White House advisor Stephen Miran, could be confirmed by the Fed's September meeting. Meantime, the White House said the plan was to continue publishing monthly employment statistics even though Trump's pick to head the embattled Bureau of Labor Statistics, E.J. Antoni, said this month that the BLS should suspend monthly payrolls releases until data problems were fixed - and rely instead on quarterly reports.\n* Once again, tech stocks led the charge higher on Wall Street on Tuesday. Alphabet shares rose 1.2% as Perplexity made a $34.5 billion cash offer to buy the company's Chrome browser and Intel climbed 5% after Trump met CEO Lip-Bu Tan and praised him, after claiming only last week that Tan was compromised due to Chinese links.

Road testing is being carried out in Luxembourg via mobility service provider Emile Weber, Peng said.\nPony AI is also trialing its technology in South Korea, where it has obtained nationwide permits for robotaxi operations. It has a tie-up with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority, and with Uber Technologies Inc. to deploy self-driving vehicles in the Middle East.\n“In a year or two, once the regulations are ready, the local users are on board, then I think those markets will take off dramatically,” Peng said of foreign regions.\nEarlier in August, Pony AI’s rival — Baidu Inc.’s Apollo Go — inked an agreement with US ride-hailing platform Lyft Inc. to deploy robotaxis in Europe, starting with Germany and the UK in 2026, pending regulatory approval.\nHome Market\nChinese regulators’ attitude toward autonomous driving technology seems to be warming up, too, despite a public debate that erupted in 2024 over Apollo Go’s robotaxi fleet in the central city of Wuhan. Taxi drivers protested the self-driving cars potentially taking their jobs, while residents complained about traffic disruptions.\nLast month, Shanghai granted licenses to companies including Pony AI and Apollo Go, allowing commercial operations in financial district Pudong. It became the latest Chinese urban center — following Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou — to permit fare-charging robotaxi operations.\n“This is a big step for making robotaxis a real business,” Peng said.","content_hash":"7ad72b6b3ad14ea386e518a330f8b221","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2562,"method_rank":0}

By several measures, stocks haven’t been this richly valued since around the 2021 market peak.\nMost Read from MarketWatch\n-\nMy father was worth millions. I suspect my mother is stealing my inheritance. What can I do?\n-\nWhy Wall Street’s biggest bear is expecting a 14% stock-market pullback before the end of 2025\nSo far, investors have been happy to pay a premium as President Trump’s tariffs haven’t pushed up consumer prices as aggressively as many economists had expected.\nBut as more data start to reflect the impact of the tariffs on the broader U.S. economy, the reality on the ground will become increasingly difficult for investors to ignore.\nThat is why Bannister, Carroll and their team of equity strategists have warned clients that investors are “whistling past the graveyard” in their latest report, which was recently shared with MarketWatch. Bannister is Stifel’s chief equity strategist and Carroll is the vice president of equity-portfolio strategy.\nQuarterly GDP data and recent consumer-spending updates have suggested that the economy has already started to cool in the first half of 2025, Bannister and Carroll said in the report.\nBut the Stifel team expects an even sharper slowdown in the months ahead. As companies raise prices to offset the impact of Trump’s tariffs, real unit sales of goods should begin to slow, as real wage growth likely won’t keep pace with higher prices. That could jeopardize consumers’ ability to keep ramping up spending, which could create problems for the broader economy. Consumption drives about 70% of economic activity in the U.S., official data show.\nThe result should be what Bannister and his team have described as “mild stagflation” that could kick off an “echo” of April’s stock-market tariff tantrum. That previous episode briefly sent the S&P 500 SPX skittering to the edge of bear-market territory. A bear market is defined as a drop of 20% or more from a recent high.\nBannister and his team don’t expect the selloff ahead will be quite as intense as what investors experienced in April. The Stifel team sees the S&P 500 falling as much as 14%, which would bring the index in line with their year-end call for it to hit 5,500. The S&P 500 was trading at around 6,389 on Monday, according to FactSet data.","content_hash":"26a5b867c3ebc29232d7bea469bd6f63","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2532,"method_rank":0}

As of this writing on Aug. 10, the company's share price has roughly doubled across 2025's trading.\nWhile the stock has posted big returns in 2025, investors who bought the stock exactly one year ago would have seen gains that absolutely dwarf that performance. Read on to see the incredible sum that $1,000 invested in D-Wave would now be worth and a look at key performance drivers for the company going forward.\nD-Wave stock has delivered more than 10x returns over the last year\nD-Wave Quantum went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in August 2022. The stock is up just 40% over the last three years, as I write this, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's total return level of roughly 59% across the stretch. On the other hand, the stock's performance over the last year has blown returns for the broader market out of the water.\nD-Wave Quantum stock has skyrocketed roughly 1,910% over the last year -- absolutely crushing the S&P 500's total return of approximately 21% across the stretch. With those gains, a $1,000 investment in D-Wave one year ago would now be worth more than $20,000.\nWith the second-quarter report that it published earlier this month, the company reported a non-GAAP (adjusted) loss of $0.08 per share on sales of approximately $3.1 million. For comparison, the average analyst estimate had called for the business to post an adjusted loss of $0.05 per share on sales of roughly $2.54 million, so it \"beat\" the top-line estimate but \"missed\" the bottom-line one.\nD-Wave is still in a very early growth stage. The speculative nature of the quantum computing industry at large and D-Wave's individual positioning in the space make the stock a very risky play, but it's possible that future tech breakthroughs will help power more big gains for the stock.\nShould you buy stock in D-Wave Quantum right now?\nBefore you buy stock in D-Wave Quantum, consider this:","content_hash":"6f8857f41761ecb0435e46422ae1b491","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2529,"method_rank":0}

NMMC has taken a central role in that effort, as the miner contributes 6.5% of GDP and ranks among the largest employers in the country.\n\"It's a very exciting time now from an investment point of view.

The country is among the world's top uranium producers, with operations managed separately under Navoiuran.\nNMMC's principal asset is Muruntau – the largest open-pit gold mine in the world.

In 2023, the company mined 2.9 million ounces of gold at one of the lowest production costs globally, $979 per ounce, generating $7.4 billion in revenue and $4.5 billion in EBITDA.\nPursuing the broader privatization agenda, the government plans to sell up to 5% of NMMC. Bloomberg reported that the deal would involve a dual listing on the London Stock Exchange and the Tashkent Republican Stock Exchange, citing anonymous sources.\nYet before that, NMMC reorganized into a joint-stock company, appointed independent directors, and adopted international reporting standards. The company has already tested investor appetite through two oversubscribed Eurobond issuances totaling $1.5 billion.\nThe management is also proud of the environmental, social, and governance plan, which targets 21% of energy from renewables by 2026.\n\"We don't just have an obligation to shareholders,\" Antonov said. \"We aim to be a sustainable producer for the benefit of the people of Uzbekistan.\"","content_hash":"e33e0ff45e254e7feb3d9e71392dbeb9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2528,"method_rank":0}

Yet, some companies are adapting quickly, pivoting their business models to capture new growth opportunities in a shifting market.\nOne such player is Opendoor Technologies (OPEN), which is undergoing the most significant transformation in its history. Moving away from its legacy single-product approach, the company is now rolling out a distributed platform that offers home sellers multiple options, from instant cash offers to agent-assisted listings and a hybrid “Cash Plus” product. CEO Carrie Wheeler calls this “the most important strategic shift in our history.”\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nThis High-Yield (7%) Dividend Stock Is Down Significantly in 2025.

And with the shift going from pilot to full-scale rollout in record time, Opendoor believes it’s laying the groundwork for long-term, capital-light growth.\nAbout OPEN Stock\nBased in Tempe, Arizona, Opendoor Technologies runs a digital platform for U.S. residential real estate transactions. Founded in 2013, it buys, sells, and lists homes, offering services such as brokerage, title insurance, escrow, and construction. Its products connect sellers directly with buyers or through its marketplace.\nUnlike Zillow (Z), which acts as a marketplace and takes a fee as an e-agent, Opendoor purchases homes outright, holds them in inventory, and resells them, a model that carries higher capital intensity and risk, as profits must cover holding and operating costs. It also earns revenue from ancillary services like title insurance and escrow.\nOpendoor Technologies stock has seen dramatic swings in 2025. Hit by falling revenue amid a challenging housing market, the real estate tech firm’s shares plunged about 65% in the first half of the year. Then, in a dramatic turnaround, July saw the stock soar 245% thanks to enthusiastic retail buying. It has managed to climb 54% in the year to date.\nDespite recent gains, Opendoor’s stock trades at extremely low multiples compared to real estate peers. For example, its price-sales (P\/S) ratio is only 0.3x forward sales, versus roughly 4x for the average S&P 500 real estate sector ($SRRE) component.","content_hash":"e9eb9423913178092acf1d90c9108cbd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2523,"method_rank":0}

Zep, Inc., while the sales rep was visiting a Zep client motel, a manager locked her in an office and asked if they could date. She said no, left the situation and later reported the events to her supervisor, who reassigned the client to another team.\nAround the same time, the sales rep was terminated, allegedly as a part of planned head count reduction related to poor economic performance. The sales rep then sued the company, alleging she was subjected to harassment, retaliation and discrimination based on her complaint about the client or because she is Black.\nA lower court dismissed her claims, and the rep appealed.\nThe 6th Circuit affirmed the lower court’s ruling and took the opportunity to evaluate an employer’s liability when it comes to harassment at the hands of a client, rather than an employee, of a company.\n6th Circuit breaks from EEOC, sister circuits\nBecause the client who harassed the sales rep was not an agent of Zep, the company would only be liable if it intended for her harassment to occur, the court said.\n“[W]e note that our holding departs from the conclusion reached by most circuit courts to have addressed the issue as well as the EEOC’s reading of Title VII,” the 6th Circuit said.\nIn harassment guidance issued last year, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission determined that an employer could be liable for a hostile work environment created by nonemployees if it was negligent — if it either “unreasonably failed to prevent the harassment” or “failed to take reasonable corrective action in response to harassment about which it knew or should have known.”\nCiting the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, Secretary of Commerce — which allowed courts greater latitude to diverge from agency interpretations of the law — the 6th Circuit said it did not find EEOC’s reading persuasive.\n“Having interpreted Title VII ourselves, we conclude, unlike the EEOC, that it imposes liability for non-employee harassment only where the employer intends for the harassment to occur,” the court said.","content_hash":"b8e689724f039374ad9edb471e2a0a05","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2522,"method_rank":0}

In fact, AMC broke even with a loss of $0, and sales were just under $1.4 billion.\nAMC Q2 earnings\nAMC actually did lose some money. (Only the adjusted results showed breakeven numbers.) When calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), AMC lost $0.01 per share -- which was still much better than the $0.10 per share the company lost in last year's Q2.\nThe best news of all, though, is that free cash flow for the quarter turned positive, with AMC generating positive cash profits of $88.9 million in the quarter. CEO Adam Aron argued this result \"showcased the impressive operating leverage inherent in our business,\" and expressed the hope that this is \"a harbinger of things to come.\"\nIs AMC stock a buy now?\nBefore you get too excited about AMC stock, however, there are some caveats to consider:\nFirst and foremost is that, while AMC generated cash in Q2, it burned a lot of cash in Q1, such that FCF for the first six months of this year is still deeply negative: $328.1 million -- and actually, a bit worse than the company was doing one year ago. To offset the cash burn, AMC is still taking on new debt ($240 million in Q2) and converting old debt to dilutive stock ($143 million).\nLong story short, breakeven is good.

It was 2015, and selfie sticks and hoverboards were all over. Apple debuted its Apple Watch to much fanfare, and...perhaps you invested in shares of Zoetis (NYSE: ZTS) stock? If you did, here's how you would have fared over the past decade.\nYou would have done pretty well: Your investment would have grown by a total of 227%, which is an average annual rate of 12.6%. So, $1,000 invested 10 years ago would now be $3,270. That might please you, if you're aware that over many decades, the stock market has averaged annual gains of close to 10%. Unfortunately for Zoetis investors, though, over the past decade, the S&P 500 averaged annual gains of 12.7%, a smidge above Zoetis' returns.\nWorse still, if you'd only held Zoetis stock for the past one, or three, or five years, you would have lost money. Zoetis shares sank by an annual average rate of 18.7%, 4.25%, and 0.43%, respectively, over those periods.\nDon't despair, though -- because anyone buying or holding onto Zoetis shares right now has plenty to look forward to, as the company has lots of growth potential. Recall that Zoetis used to be the animal health division of Pfizer, specializing in vaccines and diagnostic equipment and the like, and was spun off in 2013. Today it's leading in market share across multiple animal health segments and it has made some strategic acquisitions, as well.\nAnother appealing detail is that Zoetis is somewhat recession-proof, because taking care of animals' health is not optional for many people. Livestock need to stay healthy for business purposes and pets are often considered valuable members of families.\nFinally, Zoetis is a dividend-paying stock, with a recent dividend yield of 1.3%. That may not seem like much, but the total annual payout, recently $1.93 per share, is up from $1.30 in 2022 and $0.50 in 2018. Shares seem undervalued at recent levels, too, with the recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 24 is well below the five-year average of 32.\nShould you buy stock in Zoetis right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Zoetis, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Zoetis wasn’t one of them.

Palo Alto Networks — The cybersecurity stock rose 1.7% on the heels of Deutsche Bank's upgrade to buy from hold. Deutsche Bank said Palo Alto has a solid core business and management.

KinderCare posted earnings of 22 cents per share on revenue of $700.1 million. That's lower than the 26 cents in earnings per share and $705.7 million in revenue expected by analysts, according to FactSet.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Waste Dive newsletter.\nDive Brief:\n-\nQuest Resource Management Group reported an 18.6% year-over-year revenue decline in the second quarter, citing the sale of its business connecting mall tenants with waste services in April and softness in the industrial sector.\n-\nThe company is in the midst of a turnaround after what executives described as a \"very disappointing\" 2024. But Quest also pointed to recent wins, including $3.9 million in operating cash flow in Q2 and a $6.6 million reduction in debt year to date.\n-\nOutside of the industrial sector, Quest saw revenues improve with food and grocery sector clients. Executives also expect operational efficiency initiatives to improve the company's financial position through the second half of the year.\nDive Insight:\nQuest, a publicly traded asset-light commercial waste broker, stumbled last year due to what board chairman Dan Friedberg called \"execution issues\" with its existing book of business. Ray Hatch retired as the company's CEO in March and was replaced by Perry Moss, who was previously the company's chief revenue officer.\nQuest absorbed the mall waste business through its $33 million acquisition of RWS in 2021. It sold that business segment for $5 million to Lincoln Waste Solutions, part of Reconomy, in April.\nOn revenue, the combination of the mall-related business sale and reduced volumes among Quest's industrial clients resulted in a $16 million year-over-year decline, CFO Brett Johnston said. That was offset slightly by $8 million in new customer revenue.\nMoss previously said he's working to improve the company's culture. His appointment also came as Quest cut 15% of its employees and began a series of internal processes to improve billing and performance with existing customers.\nExecutives said on the Quest's earnings call on Monday that those initiatives were beginning to help, but \"it will take some time to see the full impact.\"\n\"We can clearly see a path for a more efficient, consistent and profitable business,\" Friedman told analysts on the call.\nOne of the initiatives Quest is pursuing is an improvement in the rate of billing customers. Moss reported an improvement in the \"order-to-cash\" process where Quest dispatches a waste service provider on behalf of its clients and later bills for the service. Since March, Quest has improved the percentage of customers billed on time from 69% to 75%.","content_hash":"82db3bbb82da10554306327eb3a6598b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2508,"method_rank":0}

In retrospect, that might not have been the wisest move. Following Monday morning's unveiling of its fiscal first-quarter release, investors generally traded out of the stock. It had slid by more than 3% in late-session trading at a point when the S&P 500 index was only down marginally.\nFalling short\nRoivant reported that its revenue for the period was slightly under $2.2 billion, which was quite some distance down from the nearly $8 billion it reaped in the same quarter last year. The situation was hardly better on the bottom line, as the company flipped to a more than $223 million ($0.33 per share) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net loss from the year-ago profit of $95 million.\nCompounding that, neither result met analyst expectations. The consensus pundit projection for revenue was far higher, at almost $7.7 billion, while that for net loss was narrower ($0.25).\nRoivant did not provide details for its financial line items either in its earnings release or the 10-Q quarterly-earnings statement it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); this somewhat black-box quality might have contributed to the negative investor reaction.\nAn industry outlier\nRoivant is atypical even for the extremely varied biotech sector in that it divides its business into \"vants\" -- subsidiaries -- based on a specific medication or cluster of drugs. Over time, some of these have been sold to business partners in order to raise capital.\nRegarding that subject, Roivant said that it had cash, equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities amounting to roughly $4.5 billion.

But, what if we could use options to manufacture our own dividend?\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nWhy Archer Aviation's (ACHR) Post-Earnings Tailspin Looks Like a Favorably Mispriced Opportunity\n-\nACHR, OKLO, PLUG: Here’s the Best Low-Risk, High-Reward Trade After Earnings\n-\nWhy This Cannabis Penny Stock Could Be Wall Street’s Next Meme Trade Breakout\nTesla Stock Dividend?\nLet's say I have $34,000 that I want to invest into TSLA stock, I could simply buy some shares and hope the stock rises.\nBut, if I want a more conservative play, I could sell a July 17, 2026 put with a strike price of $340 and set aside the $34,000 in case I am assigned on the short put.\nThat 340-strike put generates around $6,280 in option premium in just under 12 months.\nSo, my $34,000 investment into TSLA is giving me a 24.39% annualized \"dividend\".\nWhat’s The Catch?\nWell, much like owning TSLA shares, if the stock drops, I'm going to lose money in the short-term.\nIf TSLA is below $340 next July, then I will be forced to buy 100 shares at $340. So if TSLA is below $277, at expiration the trade loses money.\nBut, if TSLA stays above $340 then I achieve a 24.39% per annum return when the put expires worthless.\nCash secured puts are a bullish strategy but are considered slightly less bullish than owning Tesla stock because the potential gains are limited to the premium received.\nThe second risk with the trade is that if TSLA stock continues to rally, we miss out on any upside. The most we can make is the $6,280 from the option premium.\nGreeks and Equivalent Exposure Level\nThe 340-strike put currently has a delta of 38, so selling this put gives an exposure roughly equivalent to owning 38 shares of TSLA stock, although this will change as the stock moves up and down.\nOne method which can help cut the risk is to turn the trade into a spread and buy a $300-strike put. This turns the trade into a bull put spread and cuts the risk from $27,700 to only $1,950.\nThere's lots of interesting scenarios you can create with options.\nCompany Details\nTesla is the market leader in battery-powered electric car sales in the United States, with roughly 70% market share.","content_hash":"453ba6394f7ef0ae39c5f072ccd31052","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2459,"method_rank":0}

Menard was arrested in Sunrise, Fla. this week and indicted on 24 counts, including grand larceny and securities fraud.\n“Menard treated himself to luxury vacations and shopping trips at his victims’ expense, and now we are bringing him to justice,” James said.\nAccording to James, starting in July 2020, Menard began soliciting Haitians in Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland and Queens counties in New York, as well as in Florida and Georgia. Menard touted monthly returns between 12% and 20%, and although he wasn’t registered to sell securities, he told investors he was an experienced trader in stocks and crypto.\nAfter soliciting investors, Menard allegedly placed some of their funds into his own personal trading accounts, which he’d use for risky trading options, including day trading and options trading, which lost him over $670,000 between July 2021 and October 2022.\nAccording to James, Menard also spent hundreds of thousands of victims’ funds to repay previous investors, over $100,000 on trips to Turkey, Puerto Rico and Disney World, a 2021 Mercedes-Benz, a 2022 BMW, and purchases at Louis Vuitton and Gucci.\nTo satisfy investors’ questions, Menard allegedly concocted an ATM receipt showing an $8 million account balance and a fake trading screen showing net account values over $1 million.\nBut the Attorney General’s office found that between July 2021 and October 2022, Mernard’s highest net value in the trading account was $240,000, while the bank account balance only reached $301,000.\nNeither Menard nor counsel representing him could be reached for comment prior to publication.\nMenard was released with weekly reporting requirements, was ordered to surrender his passport and is not allowed to travel outside of New York and Florida pending trial. If he’s convicted of the top charges, Menard could face as much as 15 years in prison.\nLast June, the Securities and Exchange Commission also charged Menard, alleging he’d defrauded at least 50 individuals (mainly in the Haitian community) of at least $1.65 million.","content_hash":"40a55e2283cd25c0a346eebff2856622","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2434,"method_rank":0}

(NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of the best large-cap tech stocks to buy now. On July 31, Bank of America Securities analyst Tal Liani reaffirmed his Buy rating on Qualcomm and kept the $200 price target. His view comes after the company’s Q3 FY 2025 results, which showed continued strength outside the handset market, especially in automotive and IoT, both delivering solid growth. Liani noted that these areas now represent a sizable share of QCT revenue (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies segment) and should expand further in the years ahead.\nKārlis Dambrāns\/Flickr\nLooking at the finer detail of the results, for Q3, the company’s total revenue surged 10% year-over-year to $10.4 billion, and adjusted EPS rose 19% to $2.77 due to better operating leverage. While revenue in its licensing business (QTL) rose 4%, QCT revenue was up 11%. Within QCT, IoT (+24%) and Automotive (+21%) stole the show, while Handsets revenue was also up a healthy 7%. Notably, for Q4, the company expects Handset revenues to grow around 5% sequentially, whereas IoT is expected to remain flat.\nLiani believes that while handset demand, particularly in China, remains a headwind, Qualcomm’s upbeat guidance for the following quarter points to a rebound in that segment. He also sees meaningful upside from the company’s push into data center solutions, where it is aiming for leadership in CPU and NPU technologies. Taken together, these factors underpin the analysts’ constructive outlook on the stock.\nQUALCOMM Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor technology company that specializes in wireless communications.

However, net sales came in at $3.6 billion, falling short of projections and representing a modest decline of around 1% annually.\nFor the current fiscal year, ending in December 2025, analysts expect OTIS to report EPS growth of 5.2% YoY to $4.03, on a diluted basis. The company has topped the earnings consensus estimate in two out of the four trailing quarters, missing on the other two occasions.\nAmong the 12 analysts covering OTIS stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy,” an upgrade from the “Hold” rating a month back. The current rating is based on three “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” seven “Hold” ratings, and one “Strong Sell.”\nThe current configuration has remained largely consistent over the past few months. But compared to three months ago, it reflects a slightly improved sentiment, with a reduction in “Strong Sell” ratings.","content_hash":"f0fb33a12bedbb4dcf64244ef54588eb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2350,"method_rank":0}

What do we do with that?\nWe go for high returns, but define upfront how much we can lose if the asset we’re buying takes a dive and doesn’t recover any time soon.\nMore News from Barchart\nWith that broad concept in mind, I came to Bitcoin (BTCUSD). But not just any Bitcoin investment. A leveraged one, specifically the Volatility 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX), a 2x levered exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks Bitcoin’s price trend.\nI’d say this ETF is not for the faint of heart, since we have seen Bitcoin’s spot price fall from $63,000 to $33,000 in just 2 months back during the spring of 2021. And from $67,000 to $16,000 in about 12 months, from late 2021 through late 2022.\nBitcoin – and broader cryptocurrency – adoption have accelerated since that time. But I do sense that some of that continues to be a “number go up” situation. That is, many traders buy Bitcoin because it is going up and have heard the hype that cryptocurrency is a secular theme that will continue to take hold.\nI’m not here to throw cold water on any of that. I’m just here to manage risk.\nAnd increasingly, I find that this market, being both historically dangerous and opportunistic, draws me to assets I would not otherwise embrace for my trading. Like Bitcoin. And particularly, an ETF that offers double the upside, and twice the downside.\nNote that as with most leveraged ETFs, the math of investment loss is in play here. That means that if you lose, say 10%, you need to make about 11% to get back to where you started. These vehicles are geared to essentially be daily trading assets. However, I have found that in most cases, other than in extreme downside moves, they can sometimes be held for several days, weeks, or even months.\nThe appeal here is that if we collar it, we get most of the upside and cap our downside where we want to, for a set period of time. Let’s look at the history, the current chart, and some collar possibilities.\nThat chart above says a lot about BITX from a reward and risk perspective. During the 2-year timeframe shown for that ETF, it has been cut in half and then doubled since late December.

The agreement provides a highly valuable long-term earnings stream for Talen. When power delivery reaches scale in 2032, Talen expects the agreement to provide incremental annual free cash flow per share of at least $7. I think this guidance will prove far too conservative based on continued share repurchases. Talen continues to shift its activities away from merchant power production and toward providing clean energy to datacenters on long-term, highly predictable contracts. As a result, investors are starting to value Talen shares less like those of an electricity wildcatter and more like a quasi-regulated utility with a blue-chip end customer. Every business would love to find a way to make more money and take less risk doing it, and that’s exactly what Talen is achieving.","content_hash":"6e308b3ca9b9036389c85114f3268e8a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2096,"method_rank":0}

The businessman has since been working to resolve issues stemming from environmental investigation into ground subsidence in the northeastern city of Maceió, where Braskem had rock salt mines.\nIn a written response to Reuters on Monday, Tanure said settling this case is a non-negotiable term for his Braskem bid, whose current exclusivity period ends on August 21.\n\"An agreement with all entities involved in the Alagoas disaster is a sine qua non (condition), and especially applies to the non-transfer of criminal and financial responsibility to the new shareholders,\" he answered without elaborating on his next steps.\nThe incident was allegedly caused by Braskem's rock salt extraction activities, which began in the 1970s and were halted in 2019 after authorities determined they contributed to the sinking of five neighborhoods, leading to the displacement of thousands of residents.\nAs Tanure mulls his next moves, private equity firm IG4 Capital is biding its time, poised to launch a rival bid when Tanure-Novonor agreement lapses.

In the second quarter, the fund returned 17.22% gross of fees and 16.64% net of fees compared to 10.56% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index and 11.52% for the MSCI ACWI Total Return benchmark. The portfolio experienced a ~30% swing over the past quarter, due to heightened market volatility stemming from tariff worries. Despite these worries, the portfolio delivered positive results driven by capital flows seeking opportunities outside the U.S. and a rebound in domestic equities as tariff worries began to ease.

Despite this price movement, profit-taking has remained muted, averaging under $750 million per day on a year-to-date basis.\nFor perspective, Glassnode data shows that in January daily realized profits were around $2 billion, with similar spikes in July when bitcoin reached its all-time high of $123,000.\nGlassnode’s Realized Profit metric measures the total profit from all spent coins where the sale price exceeded the acquisition price. When broken down by Long-Term Holders (LTH) and Short-Term Holders (STH), it offers a more granular view of market behavior. This classification is based on the weighted average acquisition date, with LTH supply defined as holdings aged more than roughly 155 days.\nThe data reveals that LTHs have consistently realized far more profit than STHs. An exception occurred in July, when STH realized profits spiked as bitcoin hit its all-time high. Many of these short-term gains likely came from investors who bought during the March “tariff tantrum” sell-off, when bitcoin fell to $76,000.\nThe current low level of realized profit-taking, particularly compared with prior market peaks, is encouraging for bitcoin’s bullish outlook. It suggests that holders, both long and short term, are largely refraining from locking in gains despite recent price increases. If this trend persists, it could provide the market with the stability and momentum needed to push toward new all-time highs.","content_hash":"943731c6f4038a6580a30301b66f5f23","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1554,"method_rank":0}
