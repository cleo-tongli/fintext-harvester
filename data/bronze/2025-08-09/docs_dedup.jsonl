One month later, the stock had given back some of those record gains, dropping 13% by the end of July. You can call it profit-taking, or investor nerves, or just a price adjustment. Either way, I think it's high time to buy Netflix stock again.\nI'll admit that the stock isn't cheap. Even after July's price correction, Netflix trades at a lofty 49 times earnings. However, the company has earned every penny of that beefy stock price.\nRevenue rose 16% year over year in the second quarter. At the same time, the business grew more efficient, and operating margins increased from 27.2% to 24.1%. As a result, bottom-line earnings skyrocketed from $4.88 to $7.19 per diluted share -- a 47% jump. Free cash flow nearly doubled, and the company bought back more shares than it issued.\nIt would be one thing if this report were an outlier among several missed swings, but it wasn't. This is how Netflix runs its business nowadays, focusing on profitable growth instead of subscriber additions at any cost.\nAnd I don't see any game-changing missteps driving the stock lower in recent weeks. Again, you can call it profit-taking, or you can point to a shaky economy. But the company posted another analyst-stumping earnings report on July 17, and the stock price just kept sliding anyway.\nFair enough. Every stock has a fair value, and maybe Netflix investors took this one a little bit too high in the spring. This is a new era for Netflix's business plan that should be good for its investors in the long run. So despite the generous valuation ratios, Netflix stock just might never be this cheap again. It's time to buy Netflix.\nTime to bulk up on Costco\nDemitri Kalogeropoulos (Costco): Investors rarely get the chance to buy Costco stock at a compelling discount, which is why the retailer's July slump is worth a closer look. Shares are roughly flat so far in 2025, trailing the 9% spike in the S&P 500 through late July.\nSure, the warehouse giant's growth slowed recently. Comparable-store sales rose 6% in June, down from 8% gains in the past 10 months. But that boost still implies that Costco is seeing strong customer traffic in a competitive industry. Target's comps were negative in the most recent quarter, and Walmart reported a less than 3% uptick back in May.\nInvestors will get fresh details on Costco's expansion pace when the company reports July sales trends on Aug. 6. Watch for signs of stabilizing comps in that announcement.\nCostco's e-commerce growth has been stellar, too, which should help support higher profits over time. Sales on its website tilt toward expensive consumer discretionary purchases like furniture, jewelry, and electronics, so it's good news for margins when that segment outpaces the wider business. Digital sales are up 16% over the past 10 months, management said in early July. We'll get an update on that figure in early August, too.\nIt's true the stock isn't particularly cheap right now. Investors are paying 1.5 times sales for Costco compared to Walmart's valuation of 1.2 times revenue. Yet Costco's premium is down from nearly 2 times sales back in January. That represents a good deal for a company with a long track record of market share growth, stable, subscription-based profits, and excellent cash generation.\nIf you've been waiting for a better entry price on this attractive business, this could be the time to push Costco stock up to the top of your watch list.\nASML's long-term investment thesis has never been stronger\nDaniel Foelber (ASML): There's no sweeter sound to the ears of a long-term investor than when a top stock sells off for near-term factors. That's what's happening to Dutch photolithography semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML. And it's a phenomenal buying opportunity for investors this August.\nAt first glance, the semiconductor industry looks like it's on a tear, driven by epic gains in stars like Nvidia and Broadcom. But look closer, and there's a mini sell-off going on in much of the supporting cast.\nAnalog and embedded semiconductor supplier Texas Instrumentssold off after reporting earnings. So did Arm Holdings, Qualcomm, and ASML. All four companies posted solid earnings, but guidance pointed to a near-term slowdown due to factors such as shifting supply-and-demand dynamics, trade policy, and geopolitical tensions.\nIt was a reminder that the semiconductor industry -- although chock-full of multidecade growth prospects -- is highly cyclical and prone to cooling off, even during an evolutionary period in artificial intelligence (AI).\nASML stands out as my top pick from the sell-off in semiconductor stocks. The company has a virtual monopoly in systems for the printing (or scanning) stage of the semiconductor manufacturing process. This step involves printing circuit designs onto silicon wafers -- creating a highly complex, precise 3D structure. ASML has spent decades developing its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) systems.\nCompared to the older deep ultraviolet (DUV) systems, EUV can reduce costs for ASML's customers (chip fabs) and help them fulfill more complex orders faster by using wavelengths that are 14 times shorter than DUV light, reducing the number of process steps. The shorter wavelength allows chipmakers to pack more transistors per chip, which boosts their capabilities.\nOn its latest earnings call, ASML said it could not confirm growth for next year due to an uncertain geopolitical climate and macro concerns. The company's supply chain is sensitive to tariffs, and it has major customers in Taiwan, South Korea, and China -- making it vulnerable to trade policy. So I would expect ASML's stock price to react to trade-related news. However, management confirmed the company's 2030 targets due to explosive demand for its higher-margin EUV machines.\nAll told, ASML stands out as a compelling investment opportunity for folks with at least a five-year time horizon. The stock price could do just about anything in the near term, but the company is at the top of its game. It's the most exciting time ever to invest in ASML, but the market is too caught up in what could happen next quarter, so it's missing the big picture.\nPlay it safe with this monster dividend stock\nNeha Chamaria (Enterprise Products Partners): With the S&P 500 trading at historically high valuations, the Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner recommends dividend and value plays for a defensive stance now. I'm all for defensive dividend stocks now, especially companies backing their yields with steadily growing cash flows and payout.\nEnterprise Products Partners is one such stock that belongs in your portfolio. Shares of the oil and gas pipeline company yield a hefty 7%, and management has increased the dividend for 27 consecutive years. That's not even the best part.\nEnterprise Products' cash flows have comfortably covered dividends over the years. In fiscal 2024, for example, it generated record distributable cash flow (DCF) of $7.8 billion, providing 1.7 times coverage of the dividends declared for the year. That DCF coverage makes Enterprise Products' dividends very safe.\nAs it is, Enterprise Products' dividend is highly bankable because of the recession-proof nature of its business. Midstream energy infrastructure companies provide services like storage, processing, and distribution under long-term contracts with little exposure to oil and gas prices. What's more, the bulk of these contracts also have inflation escalation clauses to mitigate the impact of inflation on cash flows.\nBut here's the biggest reason why this defensive dividend stock is a solid buy now. Enterprise Products is bringing projects worth nearly $6 billion online this year, so management expects free cash flows to \"take a step up\" in 2026 and 2027. Read that as bigger dividends -- the bigger the company's cash flows, the bigger the dividends it can pay to its shareholders.\nA great growth stock for nervous investors\nKeith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): I'll readily admit to being something of a \"nervous Nellie\" right now. The stock market is near all-time highs. The Buffett indicator (the ratio of total U.S. stock market capitalization to GDP) is above a level that Warren Buffett has referred to as \"playing with fire.\" I suspect that many are underestimating the negative impact on consumer spending and the U.S. economy that the full brunt of tariffs will have.\nBut I think that Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a great growth stock to buy in August for nervous investors like me. This biotech stock is cheap if you factor in its growth prospects. Vertex's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which uses analysts' five-year earnings growth projections, is a super-low 0.58, according to LSEG.\nThere are no worries about a consumer spending decline or economic downturn hurting Vertex's business. The company markets the only approved therapies that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF). These CF drugs generate more than 90% of Vertex's revenue.\nMy main reason for excitement about Vertex, though, is its new products and promising pipeline candidates. The drugmaker launched Journavx earlier this year. It's the first new class of pain medication in over 20 years. I expect the non-opioid pain drug will be a smashing commercial success.\nVertex could have additional winners in the not-too-distant future. The company is evaluating inaxaplin in a late-stage clinical study for treating APOL1-mediated kidney disease. Povetacicept is another late-stage program targeting chronic kidney disease IgA nephropathy. Zimislecel advanced to pivotal testing after encouraging results in earlier clinical trials as a one-time treatment (i.e., cure) for severe type 1 diabetes. All three of these targeting indications have patient populations larger than CF.\nShould you buy stock in Netflix right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Netflix wasn’t one of them.

The most-active contract rose to a record intraday high above $3,534 an ounce.\nLate Thursday, President Trump said he had selected Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve as a Fed governor. Mr. Trump said that Miran, who must be confirmed by the Senate, would serve only the remainder of Adriana Kugler’s term, which ends in January.\nIn yesterday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major indices ended mixed. Fortinet (FTNT) plummeted over -22% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after the cybersecurity firm was hit with multiple downgrades and price target cuts following the release of its Q2 results and guidance. Also, Eli Lilly (LLY) plunged more than -14% after the drugmaker reported disappointing data on its new weight-loss pill. In addition, Caterpillar (CAT) fell over -2% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to Underweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $350. On the bullish side, chip stocks climbed after President Trump said firms that relocate production to the U.S. will be exempt from the proposed 100% tariff on chip imports, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rising more than +5% and Lam Research (LRCX) gaining over +3%.\nThe Labor Department’s report on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing for initial jobless claims in the past week rose by 7K to 226K, compared with the 221K expected. Also, U.S. Q2 nonfarm productivity rose +2.4% q\/q, stronger than expectations of +1.9% q\/q, and unit labor costs rose +1.6% q\/q, in line with expectations. In addition, U.S. consumer credit rose by $7.37 billion in June, weaker than expectations of $7.40 billion.\n“With the jobless claims beginning to rise again, this adds to concerns about the employment picture that were raised last week,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co.\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Thursday that he still sees one rate cut as likely this year, and reiterated that there are reasons to doubt that the inflationary effects from tariffs will be short-lived. “This question about whether tariffs are a one-time thing, or whether they’re going to be more persistent in their effects and might even cause structural changes, I think is perhaps the most important question that we have today,” Bostic said.\nIn other news, Bloomberg reported that Fed Governor Christopher Waller is emerging as a top candidate to become the central bank’s chair among President Trump’s advisers as they seek a successor to Jerome Powell.\nMeanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 89.4% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 10.6% chance of no rate change at the September FOMC meeting.\nThe U.S. economic data slate is empty on Friday. However, investors will focus on a speech from St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem.\nIn the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.249%, down -0.16%.\nThe Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.01% this morning, holding steady at the end of a week marked by tariffs, geopolitical developments, and a wave of corporate earnings. Mining and healthcare stocks advanced on Friday, while insurance stocks underperformed. The benchmark index is on track to post its biggest weekly gain since April. Meanwhile, the U.S. reversal on Japan has raised questions about the trade agreement with the European Union, according to Jochen Stanzl, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. “In Japan, there is relief today upon hearing that the various tariffs will not be cumulative. However, it remains unclear whether the same rules apply for Japan and the EU,” Stanzl said. Switzerland suffered a fresh blow on Friday as gold futures hit a new record after a report said that the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of one-kilo gold bars. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter said Thursday that her country would maintain intensive negotiations with the U.S., after departing Washington without securing relief from the 39% tariff rate. In corporate news, Novo Nordisk A\/S (NOVOB.C.DX) climbed over +5%, extending yesterday’s gains after a late-stage study of rival Eli Lilly’s weight-loss pill revealed it fell short of matching the effectiveness of Novo’s injectable obesity treatment Wegovy. At the same time, Munich Re (MUV2.D.DX) slumped over -7% after the German reinsurer cut its full-year insurance revenue forecast.\nThe European economic data slate is mainly empty on Friday.\nAsian stock markets today settled mixed. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed down -0.12%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +1.85%.\nChina’s Shanghai Composite Index gave up early gains and ended slightly lower today as caution prevailed ahead of the country’s inflation data and the looming U.S.-China trade truce deadline. Chip stocks slumped on Friday, pressured by a more than 8% slide in China’s largest chipmaker SMIC after it posted weaker-than-expected Q2 earnings. Despite Friday’s pullback, the benchmark index ended the week higher, buoyed by upbeat trade and services activity data. Meanwhile, investors are waiting for clarity on whether the tariff truce between Beijing and Washington will be extended ahead of the August 12th deadline. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he believed a deal was possible when asked about the possibility of extending the tariff truce. Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump said he could impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods, similar to the 25% levies placed on India over its purchases of Russian oil, depending on what happens. Morgan Stanley strategists advised investors to keep an eye on U.S.-China relations and highlighted the upcoming NPC Standing Committee meeting and Q2 earnings season as potential drivers of market direction. In other news, the combined market capitalization of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges is approaching the milestone level of 100 trillion yuan ($13.9 trillion), driven by strong fund inflows. Investor focus is now on China’s inflation data, scheduled for release on Saturday, for further clues about domestic demand and the overall state of the economy.\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed sharply higher today as clarity over U.S. tariffs and upbeat tech earnings boosted sentiment. Technology and automobile stocks led the gains on Friday. The benchmark index posted gains for the week. Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said following a Thursday meeting with his U.S. counterparts in Washington that the U.S. had confirmed it would end the stacking of universal tariffs on Japan and proceed with the promised cuts to car duties. Akazawa said American officials expressed regret that the stacking rule had been applied to Japan despite a verbal agreement, and noted that Washington would refund any overpaid levies. Meanwhile, a summary of opinions from the Bank of Japan’s July meeting showed that policymakers maintained their view for additional interest rate hikes despite elevated uncertainty surrounding tariffs. “If its outlook for economic activity and prices will be realized, the Bank, in accordance with improvement in economic activity and prices, will continue to raise the policy interest rate and adjust the degree of monetary accommodation,” according to the summary. On the economic front, government data showed that Japan’s annual household spending rose less than expected in June as higher prices, especially for food, deterred purchases and added strain to broader consumption trends. The data came after Japan on Thursday cut its fiscal 2025 growth forecast to 0.7% from 1.2%, citing U.S. tariffs and persistent inflation. In corporate news, SoftBank surged over +10% after the technology investor swung to a quarterly profit. Also, Sony Group rose more than +3%, extending yesterday’s gains after the game and camera maker lifted its annual operating profit guidance. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -1.79% to 24.70.\nThe Japanese June Household Spending came in at -5.2% m\/m and +1.3% y\/y, weaker than expectations of -3.0% m\/m and +2.8% y\/y.\nThe Japanese June Current Account n.s.a. stood at 1.348T yen, weaker than expectations of 1.480T yen.\nThe Japanese July Economy Watchers Current Index arrived at 45.2, weaker than expectations of 45.5.\nPre-Market U.S. Stock Movers\nExpedia (EXPE) surged over +17% in pre-market trading after the travel booking company posted upbeat Q2 results and raised its full-year gross bookings guidance.\nMonster Beverage (MNST) climbed more than +7% in pre-market trading after the company reported better-than-expected Q2 adjusted EPS.\nTake-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) rose over +6% in pre-market trading after the game developer posted stronger-than-expected FQ1 results and raised its full-year bookings guidance.\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) plummeted about -31% in pre-market trading after the ad-tech company issued weak Q3 revenue guidance and announced that CFO Laura Schenkein will be replaced by Alex Kayyal.\nPinterest (PINS) plunged more than -11% in pre-market trading after the photo-sharing website reported weaker-than-expected Q2 adjusted EPS.\nYou can see more pre-market stock movers here\nToday’s U.S. Earnings Spotlight: Friday - August 8th\nEmera Incorporated (EMA), Plains All American Pipeline (PAA), Lamar (LAMR), Tempus AI (TEM), Essent Group Ltd (ESNT), Algonquin Power (AQN), Plains GP Holdings (PAGP), Sotera Health (SHC), Atmus Filtration Tech (ATMU), Under Armour (UA), PAR Technology (PAR), The Wendy’s Co (WEN), Sylvamo (SLVM), Terawulf (WULF), Alpha Metallurgical Resources (AMR), ANI Pharma (ANIP), Calumet (CLMT), Fubotv (FUBO), China Yuchai (CYD), Docebo (DCBO), Koppers (KOP), Embecta (EMBC), Strawberry Fields Reit (STRW), American Axle&Manufacturing (AXL), Gray Television (GTNa), Gray Television (GTN), Himalaya Shipping (HSHP), AMC Networks (AMCX), Forum Energy (FET), Canopy Growth (CGC), CPI Card (PMTS).\nOn the date of publication, Oleksandr Pylypenko did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.04%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.38%.\nStock indexes gave up an early advance Thursday and settled mixed. Stocks initially moved higher Thursday as technology stocks rose after President Trump announced late Wednesday that companies would be eligible for exemptions from his proposed 100% tariff on chip imports if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. Market sentiment also improved on an easing of geopolitical risks after the Russian government confirmed that Presidents Putin and Trump will meet for summit talks on ending the war in Ukraine in the next few days.\nOn the negative side, Fortinet plunged more than -22% to drag cybersecurity stocks lower and weigh on the broader market after it narrowed its full-year revenue forecast. Also, Eli Lilly tumbled more than -14% on disappointing data from its new weight loss drug.\nStock indexes were also pressured Thursday afternoon after weak demand for the Treasury's $25 billion auction of 30-year T-bonds pushed T-note yields higher. The 10-year T-note yield rose +2 bp to 4.24%.\nSpeculation that weaker-than-expected US economic news will push the Fed to lower interest rates as soon as next month provided underlying support for stocks. Late Wednesday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said, \"The labor market has softened, and I would see additional slowing as unwelcome. All this means that the Fed will likely need to adjust monetary policy in the coming months.\" However, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he only sees one 25 bp rate cut by the Fed this year, as there are reasons to be skeptical that the inflationary effects from tariffs will be temporary. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 91% Thursday from 40% last Friday.\nToday's weekly news on jobless claims shows some weakness in the labor market, which was dovish for Fed policy. US weekly initial unemployment claims rose +7,000 to 226,000, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 222,000. Weekly continuing claims rose +38,000 to a 3.75-year high of 1.974 million, higher than expectations of 1.950 million and a sign that those currently unemployed are taking longer to secure new employment.\nUS Q2 nonfarm productivity rose +2.4%, higher than expectations of +2.0%. Q2 unit labor costs rose +1.6%, slightly stronger than expectations of +1.5%.\nUS June consumer credit rose by +$7.371 billion, slightly below expectations of +$7.5 billion.\nChinese trade news was better than expected, a supportive factor for global economic growth. China July exports rose +7.2% y\/y, stronger than expectations of +5.6% y\/y. Also, China's July imports unexpectedly rose +4.1% y\/y, the most in a year and stronger than expectations of a -1.0% y\/y decline.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective today. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 91% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 68% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEarnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 79% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 83% exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets on Thursday settled higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up sharply +1.31%. China's Shanghai Composite climbed to a 10-month high and closed up +0.16%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 rose to a 1.5-week high and closed up +0.65%.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Thursday closed down by -4.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose +1.8 bp to 4.244%. T-notes gave up a slight advance on Thursday and closed lower due to weak demand for the Treasury's $25 billion auction of 30-year T-bonds. The auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.27, well below the 10-auction average of 2.43 and a sign of tepid demand. T-notes were also pressured after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the effects of tariffs on inflation may persist.\nT-note prices initially moved slightly higher on Thursday after weekly US jobless claims and Q2 nonfarm productivity rose more than expected, dovish factors for Fed policy. Also, dovish comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly supported T-notes when she said the Fed may need to cut interest rates in the \"coming months.\"\nEuropean government bond yields on Thursday were mixed. The 10-year German bund yield fell -2.0 bp to 2.630%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.1 bp to 4.547%.\nGerman June industrial production fell -1.9% m\/m, weaker than expectations of -0.5% m\/m and the largest decline in 11 months.\nGerman trade news was better than expected as German Jun exports rose +0.8% m\/m, stronger than expectations of +0.4% m\/m. Also, Jun imports rose +4.2% m\/m, stronger than expectations of +0.8% m\/m and the largest increase in 5 months.\nAs expected, the Bank of England (BOE) lowered the official bank rate by -25 bp to 4.00% from 4.25%.

We also grew our bitcoin treasury to over $1B in value, all without raising capital through equity offerings since November 2024. Having achieved 5.8% of global hashrate under management and over one gigawatt of power contracted, CleanSpark is proving that our vertically integrated model is built not just for growth, but for leadership.

The Q2 report, Galaxy Digital’s first quarterly print since redomiciling in the U.S. and listing its shares on Nasdaq, “offered a clear signal that the company is entering a new era,” the analyst said. The firm believes the downdraft post-earnings was a “sell-the-news” reaction after shares had almost tripled since early April, but added that the report “reflected the company’s accelerated evolution as a hybrid digital asset\/AI data center platform.”\nCanaccord also raised the firm’s price target on Galaxy Digital to $34 from $33 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.

These milestones build on the restructuring of our mining business with the launch of American Bitcoin. In addition to completing an oversubscribed private placement and advancing toward a Nasdaq listing, American Bitcoin is now a dedicated anchor tenant for our Power and Digital Infrastructure segments…As we work to commercialize AI data center opportunities, we continue to apply the power-first, innovation-driven approach that has long defined our strategy and enabled us to build such partnerships. Initially energized during the quarter, Vega is a clear expression of that strategy: designed in-house and increasingly viewed by prospective partners as a prototype for next-generation AI infrastructure.”\nFollowing the report, B. Riley raised the firm’s price target on Hut 8 to $26 from $25 and kept a Buy rating on the shares. The company reported a soft Q2 but has a strong development pipeline, the analyst said.

In addition, increasing stablecoin competition will weigh on both Coinbase and Circle Internet’s valuations in the second half of 2025, the analyst said, Compass Point believes Coinbase’s Q2 and Q3 trends show weakening earnings despite the ongoing crypto bull market. The firm sees limited valuation support for Coinbase if crypto markets sell off further.\nAdditionally on Sunday, BofA lowered the firm’s price target on Coinbase to $369 from $383 and kept a Neutral rating on the shares. The firm updated models in the brokers, asset managers and exchanges group to reflect the Q2 reports.

The company’s aggregate bitcoin holdings amount to 628,791 as of August 3, the filing stated.\nAdditionally on Monday, Clear Street raised the firm’s price target on Strategy to $537 from $508 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.

However, no money manager has consistently generated outsized investment returns quite like Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett.\nAs of the closing bell on Aug. 1, the appropriately nicknamed \"Oracle of Omaha\" had overseen a nearly 5,750,000% cumulative increase in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) since becoming CEO six decades prior. This works out to a nearly 20% annualized return, which is almost double what the benchmark S&P 500 generated on an annualized total return basis, including dividends, over 60 years.\nSuffice it to say, Berkshire's billionaire chief has quite the following on Wall Street, with investors willing to mirror his trading activity and ride his coattails to big gains.\nNormally, Form 13F filings are used to track Buffett's buying and selling activity. This is a required filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that's due no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management. It provides investors with a concise list of which stocks the brightest asset managers bought and sold in the latest quarter.\nAlthough Berkshire Hathaway will file its 13F after the closing bell on Aug. 14, we don't have to wait that long to get a bead on what the Oracle of Omaha has been up to. Berkshire's recently filed second-quarter operating results have offered some big clues as to what's going on in the $281 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees.\nWarren Buffett continues to pare down his exposure to financials\nThere's not a sector Berkshire Hathaway's billionaire boss understands better than financials. Buying and holding bank stocks and insurance companies is a way for Buffett to take advantage of long-winded periods of economic growth.\nHowever, Page 8 of Berkshire's first- and second-quarter operating results holds sizable clues as to what Buffett and his team have been doing on the trading front. In particular, the total cost basis for \"Banks, insurance, and finance\" stocks held in Berkshire's investment portfolio fell from $14.268 billion on March 31 to $14.08 billion on June 30. In other words, Buffett has continued to reduce his company's exposure to financial stocks.\nThe likeliest culprit is Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), commonly referred to as \"BofA.\" Since July 17, 2024, Buffett has green-lit the sale of more than 401 million shares, equating to 39% of his company's peak stake in BofA.\nDuring Berkshire Hathaway's 2024 annual meeting, Buffett implied that selling activity in Apple had to do with the belief that the peak marginal corporate income tax rate would rise at some point in the future. Thus, locking in sizable unrealized gains at a favorable tax rate would, eventually, be viewed as a smart move by investors. Three consecutive quarters of selling activity in Bank of America may represent nothing more than tax-based selling.\nBut it might also signal that Berkshire's brightest investment minds are concerned about the Federal Reserve's rate-easing cycle. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's largest banks by total assets. While it benefited immensely from the Fed's aggressive rate-raising cycle from March 2022 to July 2023, its interest income may be disproportionately hurt by future rate cuts.\nThe Oracle of Omaha is also selling consumer products stocks\nIn addition to Warren Buffett continuing to dump financial stocks, Berkshire Hathaway's cost basis data shows a notable pare down in \"Consumer products.\" Between March 31 and June 30, the cost basis for this grouping fell from $13.76 billion to $13.418 billion.\nThis category is a bit trickier than financials because the Oracle of Omaha and his team have been active buyers of late. Specifically, Buffett and his team have purchased shares of Domino's Pizza and Pool Corp. for three consecutive quarters, and they've been adding pretty aggressively to alcoholic beverages company Constellation Brands.\nWe also know that Coca-Cola, the No. 4 holding in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio at the time of this writing, is viewed as an \"indefinite\" holding by Warren Buffett.\nThe question is: What was sold?\nWhile it's possible e-commerce giant Amazon was pared down, my best logical guess is that Buffett and his team took some chips off the table with grocery chain Kroger(NYSE: KR), which is up 56% since the start of 2024.\nThere's only so much juice that can be squeezed out of razor-thin grocery store margins. President Trump's tariff and trade policy throws potential monkey wrenches into the pricing power and operating margins of grocers.\nFurthermore, Kroger is trading at an estimated 14 times forward-year earnings per share. Even though this represents a discount to the S&P 500's forward-year price-to-earnings ratio, it's a premium for Kroger considering the company's projected annual sales growth of just 1% to 3%.\nBerkshire's billionaire boss is (likely) piling into his mystery stock\nThe final of three categories listed in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly reports is \"commercial, industrial, and other.\" Whereas the other two categories denote decisive selling activity, the cost basis for this segment rose from $49.097 billion on March 31 to $51.9 billion by June 30.\nDespite being a net-seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters, we do know that Berkshire's boss has done some buying. The problem is this segment is composed of a wide swath of sectors, such as technology, healthcare, and industrials.\nWhat's noteworthy is that Berkshire Hathaway's first-quarter 13F had at least one or more securities that were given confidential treatment by regulators. Confidential treatment allows a prominent money manager to build up a position in one or more stocks, with the goal of amassing a sizable position without investors driving up the price. For instance, when Berkshire's 13Fs reveal Buffett has purchased a new stock or added to an existing position, it's not uncommon for investors to pile into that stock and, at least temporarily, drive its share price higher.\nThough it's possible we get some additional clarity on the mystery stock Buffett has been buying on Aug. 14, it's far likelier that the confidential treatment tag will remain in place as Berkshire Hathaway builds its position.\nBased on the clues we've received from Berkshire's first- and second-quarter reports, I remain convinced that this confidential treatment stock is an industrial company, perhaps in the logistics space. Although tech stocks are hot and healthcare stocks are cheap, neither is Buffett's specialty.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bank of America right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bank of America, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bank of America wasn’t one of them.

The once-prospering mall, like many, has faced hard times with increased vacancies, exacerbated by the closing of two anchors, Sears and Bon Ton, in 2018.\nAs a result, the mall was put into receivership, where it remains. But the 162,000-square-foot former Sears space was sold to a local church, Crossroads, which has transformed 90,000 square feet of the former store into a house of worship and community hub with a traditional indoor entrance to the rest of the mall.\n\"Nothing says dying mall like having a church move in,\" said Rebecca Maguire, marketing manager of the Dayton Mall. \"But Crossroads has a huge following, and they are so community driven that I think any mall in the world would be lucky to have a partner like that.\"\nIt's fair to ask if a struggling mall is the right place for a church, and Matt Castleman, the pastor of Crossroads Church in Dayton, said the religious organization had its own reservations.\n\"People were asking, is chaining yourself to a mall wise?\" said Castleman.\nThe church, part of an eight-church network based in Cincinnati, celebrated its first services on this year's Easter Sunday and has drawn thousands to the once moribund mall. The church also decided to keep the complex open seven days a week, whenever the mall is open.\n\"We have 400 to 500 people a week pop in who have no affiliation to the church,\" Castleman said. Teenagers fan the mall after services to eat at the food court and show back up at the church with bags from stores like Claire's and Dick's Sporting Goods, Castleman said.\nOf course, Claire's bankruptcy filing this week is one more sign of how the hard times for long-time mall tenants are not going away. But filling old anchors with new, niche businesses or destinations, like in the case of the Dayton Mall with its new church tenant, is precisely the type of \"cross-shopping\" mall landlords are seeking.\nWhile a church is the unconventional salvation of the Dayton Mall, other malls are also finding out-of-the-box suitors to fill big empty spaces.\nThe fall of the American mall has long been chronicled, and not exactly greatly exaggerated. Enclosed malls with anchor stores, a bustling food court, and a stable of trendy fashion retailers sandwiched between were the centerpiece of post-WWII suburbia for generations. However, changing demographics, shifting shopping habits, and the rise of Amazon and e-commerce all contributed to the decline of malls.\nBut recent data and industry executives suggest that the enclosed mall could be positioned for a rebirth.\nThe trend of repurposing empty anchors, which in some cases began a decade ago, took a long time to bear fruit, said Stephen Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties, one of the largest mall landlords in the U.S. with more than 155,000,000 square feet of mall space.\n\"We have had a rebound and built a lot of positive momentum. These projects to backfill anchors don't happen overnight,\" Lebovitz said. And even when the old anchors were filled relatively quickly, it can take time to break through to customers.\n\"It has taken several years to recover from anchor closings in 2017-2018,\" Lebovitz said, referring to a wave of anchors that closed that year. The past decade has seen traditional anchors like Macy's, JCPenney, and Sears shutter.\nThe subdivided mall and 'cross-shopping'\nLebovitz said the key to success is subdividing formerly sprawling anchor stores into niche players that all draw in their cross-shopping constituencies. There are former Sears' locations in the CBL portfolio that were generating $7 million to $8 million a year, with newly filled, subdivided ones bringing in a combined five to six times that amount, according to Lebovitz. A variety of different businesses are filling those voids, from restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory, to large retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, entertainment options like Dave & Buster's, or hotels.\nLebovitz said that mall developers are also trying to add more experiential categories, such as games, bowling, and laser tag.\nOther mall owners are taking it even a step further, converting old stores into things like apartments or large food courts.\nBrookfield Properties, another major mall landlord, is seeing similar success from the same playbook. Brookfield's mall portfolio is more upscale, insulating it from some of the retail turmoil, but they've still had to repurpose some anchors (or \"reprogram the box\" in industry parlance).\n\"Gen Z loves the mall; they love the experience of the mall and being in person with each other at malls,\" said Kirsten Lee, executive vice president of luxury leasing at Brookfield Properties. Lee points to the post-Covid experience as a turning point when people sought out old comforts like the mall.\n\"People are seeing the shopping center as a community space,\" Lee said. To lean into that, Brookfield's Tyson's Galleria, for example, has added a bowling entertainment complex and yoga studio to the mix.\nThat has helped to increase the amount of crossover shopping, Lee said, with customers who may hit the lanes for some games of bowling and then go look for a new shirt.\nRecent data from Placer.ai shows that the positive mall vibes from owners are more than just corporate cheerleading, with a tangible increase in traditional enclosed mall traffic. R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, agrees with mall owners that the changes made to anchors over the past few years are finally taking hold.\n\"It takes time,\" Hottovy said, adding that open-air \"lifestyle centers\" were the first to adopt mixed-use strategies successfully. \"Now we are starting to see enclosed malls do it.\"\nHottovy credits much of the success to non-traditional anchor selections, with malls incorporating a variety of tenants into their mix. For the 2024 holiday season, mall visits were ahead of retailers, Hottovy said. People were going to malls for reasons other than shopping, including seasonal events, restaurants, and movie theaters.\nIn some cases, Hottovy said, the malls are experiencing a \"Barnes & Noble\" effect even when it isn't a formal anchor. At the Coronado Center mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Barnes & Noble accounted for 7.9% of visits to the mall in 2024, outperforming both Macy's and JCPenney. Barnes & Noble has approximately 660 stores throughout the United States, with 107 of them located in traditional enclosed malls.\n\"Malls are absolutely places we are interested in being a part of,\" said Jason Stryker, head of real estate and development for Barnes & Noble, which has been lauded for its turnaround. The company is considering adding 10 more enclosed mall locations this year and is actively exploring approximately a dozen now-vacant Forever 21 sites, which are often sprawling and sometimes two stories high, making it a good fit for a Barnes & Noble layout, Stryker said.\nStryker says the bookseller aims for a store in the 18,000 to 22,000 square foot range so that an old anchor is often carved up among niche retailers.\n\"We like to be around stores where people will cross-shop,\" Stryker said, adding that Barnes & Noble can be especially appealing to malls because \"We really don't compete with any other retailer there.\"\nDevelopers point to something intangible that malls capture, nostalgia, and they may be onto something.\n\"Most Gen X and millennials spent their adolescent years making memories in malls – going to the food court with their friends, smelling all the lotions or perfumes at a store, or just generally hanging out chatting,\" said Dr. Vassilia Binensztok, a Florida-based licensed mental health counselor and the founder of Juno Counseling and Wellness, a group psychotherapy practice. \"For many people, going to the mall can make them feel more like themselves as it evokes memories of those younger days,\" Binensztok said.\nMeanwhile, the coffee and free WiFi will continue to flow at Crossroads Church at the Dayton Mall while other malls look to unconventional anchor tenants.\n\"We want life, business, money, and energy to surge back into the mall,\" said Castleman.","content_hash":"f816e2b68070a1c18a174486be636a6b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8165,"method_rank":0}

Giving software and systems the capacity to make split-second decisions without human oversight is a game-changer for most industries around the globe. It's also the reason analysts at PwC foresee AI boosting worldwide gross domestic product by $15.7 trillion come 2030.\nWhile most Wall Street analysts have lofty expectations for the AI revolution, billionaire money managers have been more tempered with their optimism.\nFor example, Duquesne Family Office's billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller was an active seller of a number of brand-name AI stocks during the March-ended quarter. We know this, because institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter. A 13F provides a concise snapshot of which stocks the smartest fund managers have been buying and selling.\nWhile Druckenmiller was sending shares of AI-data mining specialist Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) and North American electric-vehicle (EV) leader Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) to the chopping block, he was also piling into an AI-driven business with an estimated addressable market of $50 billion.\nPopular AI stocks get the heave-ho from billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller\nBetween Dec. 31, 2024, and March 31, 2025, Duquesne's billionaire chief was a busy bee. The total number of securities overseen by Druckenmiller dropped from 78 to 52 in just three months. Two of the more prominent stocks that were pared down or jettisoned include Tesla, which was reduced by 50% (18,837 shares sold), and Palantir, where all 41,710 shares were sold.\nThere's no denying that both companies have enjoyed clearly defined competitive advantages. Palantir's government-focused Gotham platform has no one-for-one replacement, while its enterprise-driven Foundry service lacks large-scale competition. As for Tesla, it became the first automaker in more than a half-century to successfully build itself from the ground up to mass-production.\nHowever, these first-mover and scaling advantages didn't protect either stock from being reduced or removed.\nConsidering that the stocks overseen by Druckenmiller have an average hold time of less than nine months, it's quite possible this selling activity represents nothing more than profit-taking.\nShares of Palantir and Tesla both surged following Donald Trump's November victory. Palantir is a logical winner of a unified Republican government that (likely) favors strong defense spending. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk temporarily joining the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as a special employee was viewed as a positive for Tesla.\nThe worry is there may be more to this story than just benign profit-taking. While this is merely speculation, Stanley Druckenmiller may have been turned off by Palantir's and Tesla's respective nosebleed valuations.\nTesla's EVs, which heavily incorporate AI, have endured more than a half-dozen sweeping price cuts as competition picked up and inventory levels rose. This has pummeled Tesla's vehicle margin and reduced its earnings per share (EPS). Paying close to 130 times forward-year earnings for a company whose growth engine has stalled, and whose margins are floundering, may not be appealing to Duquesne's billionaire chief.\nLikewise, Palantir Technologies is valued at a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of more than 140! To offer some context, companies that are leading next-big-thing trends have historically topped out with P\/S ratios in the range of 30 to 40. No megacap company has ever been able to maintain such an absurd premium as that of Palantir. Seeing this may have coerced Druckenmiller to take his chips completely off the table.\nDuquesne's billionaire chief is piling into this up-and-coming artificial intelligence stock\nOn other end of the spectrum, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller oversaw the addition of one dozen new stocks to his fund's portfolio during the March-ended quarter. None of these new stocks was purchased more prominently than digital-signatures specialist DocuSign(NASDAQ: DOCU).\nDuring the first three months of 2025, Duquesne Family Office purchased 1,074,655 shares of DocuSign, which had a market value of approximately $87.5 million. In other words, it became a top-10 holding for Druckenmiller.\nDocuSign became a Wall Street darling during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. With people encouraged to stay in their homes to prevent a worsening of the pandemic, DocuSign's e-signature services became a staple in a host of industries. Though life has returned to normal in the wake of the pandemic, DocuSign has managed to hang onto the bulk of digital-signature market share. According to Datanyze, it currently holds a 71% share.\nBut e-signatures make up just around half of DocuSign's total addressable market. While the digital-signature market is estimated to be worth $26 billion, DocuSign has a fast-growing, high-margin opportunity in contract lifecycle management (CLM) that makes up another $24 billion in addressable opportunity.\nThe company's cloud-based CLM operations includes the relatively new Intelligent Agreement Management (IAM) platform, which leans on AI insights to analyze, tailor, and automate the entirety of the agreement lifecycle for businesses. DocuSign's IAM platform can also reduce errors associated with agreements and be integrated with other core systems, such as customer relationship management software, to improve efficiency.\nAlthough competition is picking up in the e-signature arena, and DocuSign's annual growth rate has slowed considerably from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company's balance sheet and valuation may be added lures for Druckenmiller.\nWhen DocuSign's fiscal first quarter came to a close on April 30, it had nearly $1.11 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and investments on its balance sheet, along with no debt. A pristine balance sheet has allowed for a steady diet of share repurchases, which tend to have a positive impact on EPS over time.\nIn terms of valuation, DocuSign is trading at 19 times forecast EPS for fiscal 2027. Even accounting for a slower annual growth rate, this represents a 37% discount to its average forward price-to-earnings ratio over the last half-decade.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Docusign right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Docusign, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Docusign wasn’t one of them.

The Dow has undergone significant changes in recent years, with the addition of growth stocks such as Salesforce in 2020 and Amazon and Nvidia in 2024. However, the index remains a great starting point for finding top dividend stocks.\nHere's why these Fool.com contributors think Honeywell International(NASDAQ: HON) of the industrial sector, financial sector representative American Express(NYSE: AXP), and consumer staples stalwart Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) are three great dividend stocks to buy now, even though they are hovering around all-time highs.\nHoneywell's breakup will create value for investors\nLee Samaha(Honeywell): Despite the recent sell-off of the industrial stock, it remains close to its all-time high price.\nThe investment case for this Dow Jones member currently revolves around its impending breakup and the amount of value that can be released in its constituent parts as they trade as stand-alone companies.\nIt's a breakup with an understandable rationale. For example, aerospace companies (Honeywell Aerospace will be the largest of the three new companies) are traditionally valued differently from industrial companies to reflect the long-cycle nature of their business.\nHoneywell Automation (set to be the remaining company) combines building automation and industrial automation, and its separation is part of a trend of industrial companies becoming more focused as automation becomes more software-driven by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and digitalization technologies. It's a trend followed by peers like Emerson Electric, Siemens, and Johnson Controls.\nFinally, the advanced materials business (Solstice Advanced Materials) will offer investors an opportunity to invest in a pure-play sustainable materials business.\nAs you can see from this short description, they are significantly different businesses. When separated into three more focused and agile companies with their own capital raising dynamics and sets of investors behind them, they will have an opportunity to release value for investors.\nAmerican Express remains a good value for long-term investors\nDaniel Foelber (American Express): The financial services company is knocking on the door of an all-time high for all the right reasons. American Express continues to deliver excellent results despite pressures on consumer spending by catering to affluent customers.\nAmerican Express charges relatively high fees for its top credit cards, but it makes those fees worth it by offering cardholders attractive perks -- such as high baseline cash back rates and a variety of reward redemption options.\nUnlike Visa and Mastercard, American Express is both a payment processor and a card issuer. Its revenue stream is diverse, consisting of card fees, as well as transaction fees related to card usage frequency and volume.\nIt's a near-perfect business model -- as long as American Express customers pay off their loans. In its latest quarter (second quarter of 2025), American Express reported a 2% net write-off rate. It defines net write-off as a principal loss from a consumer or small business card member, net of what American Express was able to recover (interest not included). Net write-offs are also known as net charge-offs.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, net charge-off rates on credit card banks at all commercial banks for the first quarter of 2025 were 4.44%. This means that American Express does an exceptional job of managing risk and limiting steep losses from customers not paying their loans.\nAmerican Express is similar to an insurance company that has a track record of above-average underwriting -- like those owned by Berkshire Hathaway (American Express also happens to be one of Berkshire's largest holdings). In other words, the risk American Express is taking is of high quality relative to the industry -- which makes investing in the company more appealing.\nOver the last three years, American Express stock has soared 130.3% compared to 43.2% diluted earnings per share (EPS) growth. So the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be -- with a 21.8 price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio compared to a 17.2 10-year median P\/E. However, American Express is arguably worth the premium price due to the strength of its underlying business model and clear path toward future earnings growth.\nPut some pop in your passive income stream with Coca-Cola\nScott Levine (Coca-Cola): Although shares of Coca-Cola have trended lower over the past few weeks, it was only a few months ago that shares had been their most effervescent.\nOn April 22, Coca-Cola stock bubbled up to uncharted territory when it climbed to an intraday high of $74.38 and ultimately closed at $73.90. Since then, shares have retreated from that level, falling about 6% as of this writing. Nonetheless, shares are hardly sporting a frothy valuation, and investors looking to quench their thirst for passive income would be wise to consider Coca-Cola stock along with its forward-yielding 2.9% dividend.\nThose who only know Coca-Cola for the legendary namesake soft drink may be surprised to learn that the company has consistently acquired a variety of brands over the years. From its acquisition of Minute Maid, a popular juice brand, to gaining a well-known iced tea brand with the acquisition of Honest Tea, to picking up a recognizable milk name in its acquisition of Fairlife, Coca-Cola has diversified its portfolio considerably over the decades. As lifestyle trends shift toward consumers adopting healthier habits, Coca-Cola is well-positioned to prosper from its robust portfolio of consumer beverage brands.\nIn addition to owning the title of the world's largest beverage company, Coca-Cola wears the crown of Dividend King, having consistently hiked its distribution for 63 consecutive years. While it's not a guarantee that the company will rack up another six decades of dividend hikes, it's certainly an auspicious sign that management is committed to rewarding shareholders.\nA cursory glance at Coca-Cola's valuation suggests that today's not a great time to click the buy button. Shares are trading a 21.7 times operating cash flow. Dig a little deeper, however, and investors will find that the valuation is actually a discount to the stock's five-year average cash flow multiple of 22.6. As an industry leader with a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders, Coca-Cola stock is a great option now.\nDo the experts think Honeywell International is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

The S & P 500's 2.4% gain last week and the Nasdaq 100's 3.7% ramp to a new record was a matter of investors staying out of danger by hiding behind their big brothers, the mega-cap giants that have long acted both as defense and aggression in this bull market. The S & P 500 added a bit over a trillion in market capitalization during the week, and $400 billion was kicked in by Apple alone, which went from conspicuous laggard to market redeemer after a pledge to invest an incremental $100 billion in the U.S. seemed to exempt it from stiff tariffs on India-made iPhones. Sidestepping hazards has become an expert bit of footwork learned by this market. Can the earnings and macro hold up? The acute worry prompted by last week's steep downward revisions to payroll growth since the spring was allayed by resurgent market expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, abetted by a chorus of more dovish rhetoric. This is a typical and perhaps rational response, though won't necessarily stay unchallenged. Barclays U.S. equity strategist Venu Krishna suggests the market by early August had grown a bit complacent toward the macroeconomic trajectory, before investors were jolted to attention by the weak July payroll report a week ago Friday. He suggests, sensibly if not surprisingly, that, \"Going forward, we think equities need support from both earnings and macro to continue working at these levels, which is complicated by the still-evolving tariff backdrop and challenging August seasonality.\" Meantime, a dozen S & P 500 stocks fell more than 10% last week, nearly all on poorly assessed earnings or outlooks, with Eli Lilly disgorging 18%, ON Semiconductor falling 16% and digital-ad marketplace Trade Desk collapsing 37%. The severe punishment of companies missing either official forecasts or investors' informal expectations has been a popular talking point in recent months, with Bank of America calculating that companies falling short on both revenue and earnings have seen their stocks lose more than triple the average amount seen over the past 25 years. Which speaks to the market having run far, fast and hot for four months, taking share prices far out on the thin branches just as corporate results were reported. And yet, such treacherous action is scarcely visible when looking at the S & P 500, which remains in a solid uptrend, just under 6,400, having flattened out the past two weeks well above what most would view as credible support around 6,150 – which is both the pre-Liberation Day peak from February and near the 50-day moving average. .SPX YTD mountain S & P 500, YTD Few take issue with the chart, but plenty of folks are uneasy about how it's managed to stay in fine form. Yes, the reasserted dominance of the few heavyweight stocks over the majority is the inescapable issue of the moment, again. Concentration risk Apollo strategist Torsten Slok, whose charts go viral (on a Wall Street scale), notes that Nvidia , at 8.2% of the S & P 500, is larger than any top-weighted stock since at least 1981 — and also likely the most expensive top index component since then on a price-to-earnings basis. Strategas Research ETF strategist Todd Sohn has been pointing out Nvidia's weight is not far below that of the entire healthcare sector. For sure, six stocks are a third of the S & P 500, the top ten around 40%. It's a winner-take-most index for a winner-take-most economy, in which AI is the source of most of the investor enthusiasm and AI-related capital spending is the key marginal source of GDP growth. These concentration issues shouldn't be dismissed as irrelevant or without risks, but they're not in themselves an indictment of the credibility or staying power of this market advance. And the prevailing anxiety around this arrangement among professional investors might be working to maintain a helpful reservoir of skepticism the tape can perhaps keep feeding from. The half-dozen biggest stocks are trouncing the field largely because they are the source of nearly all earnings outperformance. Granted, the equal-weighted S & P 500 over the past three years has lagged the annualized total return of the market-cap-weighted S & P 500 by seven percentage points (16.9% to 9.5%) but hey the equal-weight has returned 9.5%. The concern, of course, is that this is the equivalent of overdoing one of those now-trendy max-protein diets: It's based on a core of solid research about building healthy muscle, but too much protein can overwhelm the body's ability to metabolize it. We can't say for sure at what point this bulking regimen trips over into the high-risk zone, but we can monitor the vital signs. The Nasdaq 100 index is just about back up to 28-times next 12 months' forecast earnings, a level only exceeded in the past two decades during the manic Covid-pandemic rally. Here's a nifty side-by-side: Johnson & Johnson and Palantir Technologies are now roughly the same market value ($420 billion and $440 billion, respectively). That $420 billion in Johnson & Johnson is backed by $93 billion in 2025 revenue and an expected $26 billion in net income, not to mention a 200-year-old brand, a 3% dividend yield and one of only two triple-A-rated balance sheets left in the market. Note that both revenue and profits are projected to grow only about 4% next year. Palantir's $440 billion is perched atop just $4.1 billion in revenue this year, $1.6 billion in net income – but the company boasts one of the most profitable and fastest-growing software businesses seen in many years, if ever, and is clearly a favored partner to the current U.S. government and many companies for interpreting and shaping data, and the stock is the object of avid affection among a massive group of retail investors. Which stock one prefers is more a matter of temperament and priorities than some objective assessment. No appetite for value or defense We can similarly observe that the market is in an \"Everybody wins\" phase when it comes to the largest players in the AI buildout, on both the \"hyperscaler\" and hardware side. Investors are happily tolerating Microsoft and Meta spending most of what would otherwise be copious free cash flow on data centers supplied by the likes of Nvidia. One result: No more cash flow cushion for the spenders, and a bigger one for the top vendor. Some other long-term, slow-moving gauges are plumbing some extremes. There is virtually no appetite for traditional defensive stocks or value as a style category. The market isn't necessarily wrong here (railroads were the top sector in the equity market for much of the 19 th century; times change). But it's worth understanding what one owns when buying \"the market\" and where the set-up for long-term mean-reversion might lie. Note that it's a positive in the near term when cyclical stocks are beating defensives, as they are now. And for staples to work in a significant way, recession risk probably needs to rise quite a bit, while interest rates fall. As for any potential value resurgence, we're not quite as deep in the trough as in 1999, and much of the value relative comeback then came from expensive growth crashing rather than cheap stocks soaring. Aside from these market tectonics that might or might not shift soon, we have a tape drawing resilience from a collective belief that the economy can dodge the raindrops of sluggish job creation and hit-or-miss consumer trends through a capex boom and anticipation of easier monetary policy. Plausible for sure, but far from guaranteed.","content_hash":"957916e8658ce61876e372ac164fea9f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7832,"method_rank":0}

The company operates in two business segments: Communication Services and Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT). The Communications Services segment encompasses Viasat's fixed broadband, government, maritime and inflight communications services. The DAT segment offers defense-technology platforms for information security and cyber defense, space and mission systems, tactical networking and advanced technologies.\nStock Market Value: $3.44B ($25.62 per share)\nActivist: Carronade Capital Management LP\nOwnership: 2.60%\nAverage Cost: n\/a\nActivist Commentary: Carronade Capital is a multi-strategy investment firm that focuses on process-driven investments in catalyst-rich situations. Carronade was founded in 2019 by Dan Gropper as primarily a credit investor. But, four people on the firm's seven-person investment team, including Gropper, have spent considerable time working at Elliott Management: They have experience with shareholder activism and are not afraid to use it.\nWhat's happening\nOn July 31, Carronade sent a letter calling on Viasat to separate its Defense and Advanced Technologies (\"DAT\") business through a spin-off or initial public offering.\nBehind the scenes\nViasat operates in two businesses segments: Communications (73% of revenue and 80% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Defense and Advanced Technologies (\"DAT\") (27% of revenue and 20% of EBITDA). Communications is Viasat's legacy satellite business, with offerings of fixed broadband, government, maritime and inflight communications (IFC). DAT offers defense-technology platforms for information security and cyber defense, space and mission systems, tactical networking and other advanced technologies. This is a newer but rapidly growing business, with high to mid-teens revenue growth. Despite the company's strong strategic positioning, prior to Carronade's engagement, Viasat's share price had significantly underperformed, down 21.12%, 51.56%, and 57.98% over the past 1-,3-, and 5-year periods, respectively.\nAs Carronade describes in its letter, this is a \"materially misunderstood\" business. Carronade believes that the reason why this company is trading down is simple: Viasat has been treated by the market as a small-cap legacy satellite company that has been marked for death due to new high-profile entrants like Starlink. This narrative is two pronged: (i) that Starlink and similar entrants will make Viasat's Broadband business obsolete and (ii) that they are encroaching on Viasat's IFC market dominance. It is true that the broadband business is declining, as revenue is down over 27% year over year, but this is only a piece of the Communications business and the worst piece with the lowest margins. The Communications segment also has three other businesses: (i) Government, which is growing approximately 25% year over year; (ii) IFC, with 22% growth; and (iii) Maritime, which is growing at 11%. The second part of this narrative – the market threat in IFC – is greatly exaggerated. Viasat's IFC business is not going anywhere. The company's customers have long-term contracts (five to 10 years) and face high switching costs as they would need to replace their entire connectivity systems. Viasat presently has customers with 4,120 planes and a backlog of another 1,600 planes from just those existing customers. And this is a very nascent market with only approximately one third of airplanes globally having Wi-Fi, so there is a huge untapped market, which Viasat should get a large piece of despite competition from Starlink and other competitors. Additionally, Viasat is aware of the Broadband drag and is actively pivoting out of it to double down on the growth businesses with better margins. Exiting the broadband business over time while the other businesses continue to grow could be a plus for the company as it will no longer be viewed as a sleepy broadband communications business.\nBut that isn't even the biggest misunderstanding of Viasat's business. The DAT business has been buried under the legacy business and its accompanying negative sentiment. DAT is a hidden gem, with best-in-class EBITDA margins of 28%, double-digit revenue growth, and significant exposure to hot button next-generation defense and dual-use technologies such as the Golden Dome, next-generation encryption, drones, device-to-device (D2D) and low Earth orbit. While Carronade highlights how each of these translates into promising growth avenues, perhaps the best illustration of DAT's mis-valuation lies in its D2D platform services, which is designed to enable global connectivity directly to unmodified smartphones and other Internet of Things devices. DAT has $1.22 billion of revenue and $285 million of EBITDA. The peer comps to DAT – companies like AeroVironment, Kratos, Mercury Systems and Redwire all have lower margins and weaker growth profiles, yet trade at multiples ranging between the mid-20s to above 80-times EBITDA. Viasat currently trades at approximately six-times EBITDA.\nCarronade's proposed solution is simple but compelling: spin-off or IPO the DAT business to unlock this intrinsic value and eliminate the drag caused by the narratives orbiting the satellite business. Carronade models 20-times to 51-times (comp median) valuations for this business giving it a value of $6.3 billion to $16.2 billion, versus a present enterprise value for the entire company of approximately $8 billion. This leaves the Communications segment with $3.3 billion of revenue and $1.2 billion of EBITDA. Applying a conservative 4-times value to this business creates another $4.9 billion of value, and there is another $1 billion of value from the upfront and long-term annual payments pursuant to a recent legal settlement with Ligado Networks. According to the Carronade analysis, this gives Viasat a total valuation of anywhere from $48.93 per share to $112.49 per share or a 76% to 304% return.\nCarronade is a multi-strategy firm that focuses on investing in non-traditional, undervalued debt instruments. Viasat is highly levered, and its investment base is filled with creditors, so we imagine Carronade likely entered its position (currently approximately 2.6% of shares outstanding) in a similar fashion. The firm's analysis almost seems too good to be true, but there is not a lot of focus on small-cap companies in today's market and this lack of focus is exacerbated when you have companies like Starlink greatly winning the PR battle against companies like Viasat. This is how a company can go from $34 per share to $16 per share (prior to Carronade's engagement) over two years despite revenue increasing from $2.6 billion to $4.5 billion and EBITDA growing from $344 million to $1.4 billion. Fortunately for Viasat shareholders, Carronade's involvement should help bring the market's attention to this strong value case. While Carronade is not known for confrontational activism, that is OK, because this is a situation where no more than a nudge should be needed and Carronade's best weapon is the power of the argument. Moreover, management has already signaled that they have been considering selling some of the DAT business, suggesting that they may already recognize Carronade's value proposition and are headed in the right direction.\nKen Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments. Viasat is owned in the fund.","content_hash":"cb7d1bb35846b3da3439ec2087377ecf","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7806,"method_rank":0}

Mixed economic data, including a softer-than-expected jobs report, and renewed concerns about inflation have introduced a dose of caution among investors. Still, the broader uptrend is holding, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in positive territory for the year.\nElevate Your Investing Strategy:\nTake advantage of TipRanks Premium at 50% off! Unlock powerful investing tools, advanced data, and expert analyst insights to help you invest with confidence.\nAgainst this backdrop, Bank of America sees five key factors aligning that could set the stage for the market’s next leg higher. These include a ‘political will’ to drive short-term strength ahead of next year’s midterm US elections; the impact of the recent ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ on U.S. manufacturing; the likelihood of substantial economic stimulus in Europe, particularly from Germany; a surge in capital expenditures on Wall Street, especially among the ‘Magnificent 7’ hyperscalers; and finally, BofA’s proprietary ‘regime indicator,’ a historically accurate set of predictive signals that is starting to show signs of a recovery in the making.\nWith those drivers potentially in play, BofA’s analysts are sharpening their focus on the stocks they believe are positioned to ride the next wave. Two names in particular stand out, and we’ve turned to the TipRanks database to see what sets them apart. Let’s dive in.\nBrown & Brown(BRO)\nWe’ll start in the insurance industry, where Brown & Brown is a specialist in risk management. The company has been in business since 1939 and is based in Daytona Beach, Florida. Brown & Brown offers policies across a wide range of categories, including property & casualty, employee benefits, and personal insurance. Its specialties span dealer services in the automotive industry, enterprise-scale risk solutions, and even tribal policies tailored to the specific needs of various Indian tribes.\nFrom those modest beginnings, Brown & Brown has evolved into a major industry player. It now employs over 17,000 people across more than 500 locations and has extended its presence to nearly 20 countries. Backed by $4.8 billion in annual revenue and a market cap exceeding $30 billion, the company is firmly established as a force in the global insurance landscape.\nBrown & Brown released its 2Q25 results on July 28, posting several encouraging data points. Quarterly revenue came in at $1.3 billion, slightly ahead of estimates and up 9.1% year-over-year. Adjusted diluted EPS also impressed, climbing 10 cents from the prior year to reach $1.03, 4 cents above consensus.\nHowever, those solid headline numbers weren’t enough to satisfy the market. The stock fell as investors reacted to a weaker GAAP EPS of $0.78, down 13% from the year-ago quarter, and signs of margin compression. Organic revenue growth slowed to just 3.6%, raising questions about the quality of top-line expansion, which appeared heavily acquisition-driven. Broader industry challenges, such as softening insurance rates and mounting cost pressures, added to investor unease.\nFor Bank of America analyst Joshua Shanker, this pullback may present a compelling entry point. He argues that Brown & Brown remains fundamentally strong, even if the stock has underperformed.\n“BRO shares have fallen 26% since April 2, while the S&P 500 has appreciated 12%. This would represent one of the most significant periods of snap underperformance in BRO’s history. The stock is now trading near trough valuations relative to the insurance broker peers whereas it has typically traded at a thick premium. Our EPS forecasts run ahead of consensus, and we believe that 2Q25 results have reset the outlook to a more steady-state growth rate. With material upside to our price objective, we believe investors should buy shares of Brown & Brown,” Shanker opined.\nThat bullish stance is underscored by his new Buy rating and a $130 price target, implying a potential upside of ~42% over the next year. (To watch Shanker’s track record, click here)\nShanker’s optimism aligns with a broader, albeit more cautious, sentiment on Wall Street. Brown & Brown has earned a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 12 recent analyst reviews, which include 5 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock currently trades at $91.80, and the average price target of $111.40 suggests room for a 21% gain in the year ahead. (See BRO stock forecast)\nSurgery Partners(SGRY)\nThe next BofA pick we’ll look at, Surgery Partners, works as an adjunct in the healthcare field, providing surgical facilities and ancillary services in 200 locations in more than 30 states. The company acts as a link between providers and patients, offering expertise in general surgery, hand surgery, dermatology, oncology, plastic surgery, and anesthesia, to name just a few of the specialties available.\nThe company got its start in 2004, and today works through a network of partnerships with healthcare systems, surgical hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and physician practices. Surgery Partners has more than 4,000 affiliated physicians, and sees more than 600,000 patients annually – and has achieved an impressive patient satisfaction rate of 94%.\nSurgery Partners went public in 2015, and since then has built itself up into a $2.87 billion player in the healthcare sector. Last year, the company brought in $3.1 billion in total revenue, a 13.5% gain from the $2.7 billion generated in 2023. The increase reflects rising demand for quality healthcare services.\nLooking at the company’s most recent quarterly results, Q2 2025, Surgery Partners delivered $826.2 million in revenue, marking an 8.4% year‑over‑year increase, and slightly beating forecasts by $9.24 million. Adjusted EBITDA rose 9% to $129 million, yielding a 15.6% margin. The company posted an adjusted EPS of $0.17, exceeding analyst forecasts by $0.03.\nDespite these solid results, the stock has remained range-bound for most of the year, held back by concerns over slowing case volume growth and cautious full-year guidance. But for Bank of America analyst Joanna Gajuk, the current share price has opened a window of opportunity.\n“We rate SGRY Buy given the strong tailwinds for Ambulatory Surgery Centers (ASCs) while the stock is trading at a depressed multiple: 10x 2026E EBITDA less NCI, below the historical average of 14x and below the 14x multiple on the recent ASC platform deal (AmSurg) takeout… Being a low-cost setting (40-50% lower vs inpatient), ASCs are the beneficiaries of payors (including Medicare) pushing utilization to outpatient. The aging demographics are also driving ASC vols (utilization increases with age). Meanwhile, ASCs are a lower capital intensity business compared to acute care hospitals, yielding higher returns on invested capital,” Gajuk noted.\nHer bullish stance is backed by a $28 price target, implying a potential one-year upside of ~25%. (To watch Gajuk’s track record, click here)\nOverall, Wall Street echoes a similar sentiment. Surgery Partners holds a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 11 recent analyst reviews that break down to 8 Buys and 3 Holds. With shares currently trading at $22.41, the average price target of $30.90 suggests a potential gain of ~38% in the year ahead.

The dollar recovered from a 1.5-week low today and turned higher on reports that President Trump was seen as favoring Fed Governor Waller to be the new Fed Chair. The appointment of Waller as Fed Chair would ease market concerns about the Fed Chair being a yes man for President Trump, as Waller said back in April that the Fed's independence is \"critical to the well-functioning of the US economy.\" Higher T-note yields on Thursday also supported the dollar.\nThe dollar initially moved lower Thursday on a larger-than-expected increase in weekly US jobless claims, a dovish factor for Fed policy. Also, dovish comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly weighed on the dollar when she said it may be appropriate for the Fed to cut interest rates in the \"coming months.\"\nAlso, questions about the Fed's credibility continue to weigh on the dollar after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler resigned last Friday, which could prompt President Trump to nominate a new governor who is more dovish and could undermine Fed Chair Powell's influence.\nUS weekly initial unemployment claims rose +7,000 to 226,000, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 222,000. Weekly continuing claims rose +38,000 to a 3.75-year high of 1.974 million, higher than expectations of 1.950 million and a sign that unemployed people are taking longer to secure new employment.\nUS Q2 nonfarm productivity rose +2.4%, higher than expectations of +2.0%. Q2 unit labor costs rose +1.6%, slightly stronger than expectations of +1.5%.\nUS Jun consumer credit rose by +$7.371 billion, slightly below expectations of +$7.500 billion.\nLate Wednesday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said, \"The labor market has softened, and I would see additional slowing as unwelcome. All this means that the Fed will likely need to adjust monetary policy in the coming months.\"\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he only sees one 25 bp rate cut by the Fed this year, as there are reasons to be skeptical that the inflationary effects from tariffs will be temporary.\nIn recent tariff news, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective today. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 91% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 64% at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEUR\/USD (^EURUSD) Thursday fell by -0.31%. The euro retreated from a 1.5-week high Thursday and moved lower on weaker-than-expected news on German industrial production. Also, the dollar's strength on Thursday weighed on the euro. In addition, the euro is struggling due to concerns that President Trump's tariff policies will curb economic growth in the Eurozone.\nThe euro initially moved higher Thursday on hopes for an end to the Russian-Ukrainian war, with President Trump expected to meet with Russian President Putin in the next few days to discuss an end to the conflict. Also, Thursday's stronger-than-expected German trade news is supportive of the euro.\nGerman June industrial production fell by -1.9% m\/m, weaker than expectations of -0.5% m\/m and the largest decline in 11 months.\nGerman trade news was better than expected as German June exports rose +0.8% m\/m, stronger than expectations of +0.4% m\/m. Also, June imports rose +4.2% m\/m, stronger than expectations of +0.8% m\/m and the largest increase in 5 months.\nSwaps are pricing in a 12% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUSD\/JPY (^USDJPY) Thursday rose by +0.09%. The yen moved slightly lower against the dollar Thursday after Japan's Cabinet Office cut its Japanese 2025 GDP estimate. Also, concerns that US tariff policies will harm the Japanese economy are weighing on the yen. In addition, higher T-note yields on Thursday undercut the yen. Losses in the yen were limited after Japan's June leading index CI rose more than expected.\nThe Japan June leading index CI rose +1.3 to 106.1, stronger than expectations of 106.0\nJapan's Cabinet Office cut its Japanese 2025 GDP estimate to 0.7% from a January estimate of 1.2% and raised its CPI estimate to 2.4% from 2.0%.\nDecember gold (GCZ25) on Thursday closed up +20.30 (+0.59%), and September silver (SIU25) closed up +0.392 (+1.03%). Precious metals on Thursday settled higher, with gold posting a 2-week high and silver posting a 1.5-week high. Thursday's US weekly jobless claims report showed weakness in the US labor market, which is dovish for Fed policy and a bullish factor for precious metals. Also, dovish comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly were supportive of the demand for precious metals as a store of value when she said it may be appropriate for the Fed to cut interest rates in the \"coming months.\"\nGold buying by China's central bank is also supportive of gold prices as the PBOC bought 60,000 troy ounces of gold for its reserves in July, the ninth consecutive month it has boosted its gold purchases. Finally, Thursday's action by the BOE to cut its official bank rate by -25 bp was supportive of precious metals.\nGains in precious metals prices were limited due to the strength of the dollar. Also, an easing of geopolitical risks has curbed some safe-haven demand for precious metals on news that Presidents Trump and Putin will meet in the next few days to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.\nPrecious metals still have safe-haven support on concerns that President Trump's tariff policies will weigh on global economic growth prospects. Finally, precious metals continue to receive safe-haven support from geopolitical risks, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It said the macro funding environment remains robust, even for its portion of California’s high-speed rail project, which President Donald Trump has tried to derail by rescinding $4 billion of federal money.\nIndeed, the results were so good that they seemed to surprise even the firm’s top brass.\n“Overall, Tutor Perini’s business continues to perform extremely well and frankly even better than we anticipated at the start of this year,” CEO Gary Smalley said on a second quarter conference call Aug. 7 to discuss the firm’s results. “We are at the beginning of the life cycle for several major higher margin projects that are expected to derive substantial growth, profitability and cash flow as project execution activities continue. What you're seeing now is just a preview of what these projects should produce on a larger scale in the coming years.”\nThat momentum led the firm to increase its financial guidance for only the second time in its history — and the second time it has done so this year. The company said it was raising its earnings guidance to a range of $1.70 to $2.00 per share, up from $1.60 to $1.95 per share for the year, and anticipates profits for 2026 and 2027 to be even higher.\nWhen an analyst asked what drove Tutor Perini’s upward revision, Smalley said the company’s work on new projects was simply unfolding more smoothly and faster than it originally expected, and that it wasn’t hitting the snags it had in the past.\n“The project execution, you know, the ramp up of some of these projects, was a little quicker than we anticipated,” Smalley said. “We factored in some contingency or some expectation that things would not go as brilliantly, let's say, as they did.”\nThe firm had reason to be cautious with its estimates. For example, it posted a $171 million loss for 2023 as disputes over its past projects caused massive writedowns.\nBut now, Smalley said at 2025’s halfway point, the firm had only used about one-third of the contingencies — or wiggle room for things like cost increases and project delays — that it had baked into its projections at the beginning of the year.\n“Work in some of the units, some of the smaller work, came in, we’ll say, more timely than we anticipated, so that also helped,” Smalley said.\nNo hit from tariffs\nSmalley also made it clear to investors that Trump’s tariff policies weren’t having a negative impact on the contractor’s business to date and weren’t anticipated to do so in the future.\n“When we were talking about tariffs not having an impact, we're not just talking about up to now,” Smalley said. “We're talking about looking forward as well for each of our major projects.”\nSmalley said the firm re-evaluated its tariff risks on its major ongoing projects in the quarter — for instance, due to rising steel prices — but because it had bought out both materials and labor for those jobs in advance, it had already locked in its costs. For new jobs going forward, it plans to bake higher prices into its bids, meaning project sponsors will need to cover them.\n“Any possible exposure that we might have for tariffs, I can tell you that it was even less exposure than what we had seen last quarter,” Smalley said.\nCalifornia high-speed rail on track\nSmalley also said that Tutor Perini wasn’t facing project cancellation risk, despite the broader uncertainty over the economy, including on its $3.55 billion contract for completing 32 miles of California’s high-speed rail project.\n“In recent discussions with this customer regarding the federal government’s decision to reduce funding on the overall program, the customer confirmed that our project is funded and authorized and is not expected to be adversely impacted,” Smalley said.\nReduced competition\nThe contractor’s strategy of being one of the last firms standing in terms of bidding on multibillion-dollar megaprojects, where prolonged timelines make it challenging to accurately foresee cost increases and delays, has also been working.\nRon Tutor, Tutor Perini’s executive chairman, said the company has seen fewer bidders on major jobs, as many contractors have chosen not to take on the risk that’s inherent in these kinds of massive undertakings.\n“I’ve talked about that for the last two to three years: We have never seen more than one other bidder in the last two years, and on … two occasions, we were the only bidder,” Tutor said.\nThat competitive landscape — or lack thereof — has allowed the firm to be choosy in the jobs it does pursue, while also naming its price. Those factors have only turned more in Tutor Perini’s favor as its backlog has ballooned.\n“Our record backlog continues to enable us to be highly selective as to which opportunities we will pursue and to focus on bidding projects that have favorable contractual terms, limited competition and higher margins,” Smalley said.\nIn fact, in the company’s civil segment, which handles heavy infrastructure projects, profit margins are now approaching 15%, Smalley said, up from 8% to 10% in previous years. “We’d like to expand on that further,” Smalley said.\nBy the numbers\nFor the second quarter, Tutor Perini reported revenue of $1.37 billion, up 22% from the $1.13 billion it realized in the same period last year. Backlog grew to $21.1 billion, a company record, up 102% from a year ago.\nAnd net income came in at $20 million, up from $800,000 during Q2 2024.\nIf there were any blemishes in the company’s report, they came from Tutor Perini’s specialty segment, which focuses on electrical, mechanical, plumbing and HVAC. The unit posted a loss of $18 million in Q2, wider than the $8 million loss it posted a year ago. The firm attributed the loss to about $15 million in unfavorable adjustments due to the settlement of legacy claims in the Northeast.\nDespite that pock, analysts on the call applauded the company’s second quarter performance, while shareholders voted with their pocketbooks. The company’s share price has more than doubled since its 2025 first quarter earnings report, when the firm first signaled its strategy was getting traction. Shares leaped another 20% after the firm’s call this week.\n“Everyone's been patient for a long time to see the results that we've generated,” Smalley told analysts. “We're growing the business at a very significant clip.”","content_hash":"5beea8a973d97de226c4f6bbad937c22","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6885,"method_rank":0}

The benchmark S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) fell as much as 19% from its record high when President Donald Trump announced sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2, but the index swiftly rebounded when he paused the duties for 90 days.\nHowever, Trump just gave investors two reasons to worry about another market crash: He recently reinstated modified versions of the severe tariffs announced earlier this year, and he fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner in a way that threatens to politicize the independent agency responsible for gathering economic data.\nHere's what investors should know.\nPresident Trump recently reinstated severe tariffs that raise the average tax on U.S. imports to its highest level in decades\nTrump recently reinstated the reciprocal tariffs first announced on April 2. After a monthslong pause, during which the U.S. struck trade deals with a few countries, the new duties took effect on Aug. 7. Listed below are the tariff rates on top U.S. trading partners.\nEuropean Union: 15%\nMexico: 25%\nChina: 30%\nCanada: 35%\nJapan: 15%\nImportantly, Canadian and Mexican imports in compliance with the free-trade agreement are not subject to tariffs listed above. Also, the 30% tariff on Chinese imports excludes pre-existing duties, and the rate is subject to change depending on the outcome of ongoing trade talks, which should conclude in the coming days.\nThe Budget Lab at Yale estimates tariffs have increased the average tax on U.S. imports to 18.6%, the highest level since 1933. Economists at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase put the figure closer to 17%, but the big picture is the same: The U.S. government is taxing imports at a rate not seen in nearly a century.\nThe consequences are difficult to predict due to the lack of historical data, but economists generally expect a one-time increase in inflation and a persistent drag on gross domestic product (GDP). For instance, the Budget Lab at Yale estimates tariffs will lower GDP growth by 0.5 percentage points in the next two years, and the Tax Foundation estimates tariffs will reduce GDP by 0.8% over the next decade.\nThat could sink the stock market because economic turbulence would lead to weaker corporate earnings. Consequently, Wall Street analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the S&P 500. The January consensus called for 14% growth in 2025, but the current consensus calls for 9.6% growth. And that number may be revised even lower after the dismal nonfarm payrolls report released earlier this month.\nPresident Trump fired the BLS commissioner after the agency released concerning nonfarm payrolls numbers\nRecent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) suggests tariffs are starting to hurt the labor market. Nonfarm payrolls, which measure the number of employees across the U.S. economy excluding farm workers, increased 73,000 in July. That was a huge miss versus the consensus estimate that called for 110,000.\nEven more alarming were the downward revisions to nonfarm payrolls data from previous months, as detailed below:\nNonfarm payrolls were originally reported to have increased 144,000 in May, but that figure was revised down to 19,000.\nNonfarm payrolls were originally reported to have increased 147,000 in June, but that figure was revised down to 14,000.\nRevisions are commonplace because surveys used to estimate the number of workers in the economy continue to roll in for weeks after the initial report. But Trump, without offering evidence, asserted the latest downward revisions were a politically motivated attack. He reacted by firing BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.\nIn some ways, that decision is even more worrisome than the dismal nonfarm payrolls numbers themselves. JPMorgan analyst Michael Feroli commented, \"The risk of politicizing the data collection process should not be overlooked.\" And Barclays analyst Ajay Rajadhyaksha wrote, \"This move could lead to markets questioning data integrity, especially for releases that surprise investors.\"\nIn short, investors now have cause to wonder whether the next BLS commissioner will manipulate data to make Trump happy. After all, McEntarfer seemingly lost her job simply because the agency released data that frustrated the president, as it suggested the labor market was weakening in response to his tariffs and the uncertainty they have created.\nThe S&P 500's elevated valuation means the stock market is on shaky ground\nTo summarize, Trump has imposed the most severe tariffs the U.S. economy has seen in decades. In turn, Wall Street analysts have substantially reduced their S&P 500 earnings estimates, and further downward revisions are possible (if not likely) following the latest nonfarm payrolls report.\nMeanwhile, Trump created more uncertainty by firing the BLS commissioner while asserting without evidence the latest nonfarm payrolls numbers were phony. That begs the question: Will investors wonder if future BLS data has been manipulated? If so, the consequences for the stock market could be disastrous.\nThose events are particularly worrisome because the S&P 500 already trades at a very rich valuation of 22.2 times forward earnings. Historically, the S&P 500 has dropped 6.4% in the year following incidents where its forward price-to-earnings multiple topped 22, according to hedge fund manager Leon Cooperman.\nIn short, the stock market would be on shaky ground without tariffs or questions about data integrity, but those variables make the current situation especially precarious. So, investors should mentally prepare for a decline. That means avoiding stocks that trade at absurd valuations and building a modest cash position.\nShould you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?\nBefore you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and S&P 500 Index wasn’t one of them.

Since the company's initial public offering (IPO) in mid-1992, the stock has returned an incredible 26,390% (as of this writing). Starbucks was a pioneer in the coffee chain industry, offering a consistent java experience while creating a \"third place\" for customers, away from work and home. Despite recent challenges, the company has been wildly successful, and some investors are understandably on the lookout for the \"next\" Starbucks.\nWith that in mind, Dutch Bros(NYSE: BROS) has thrown its hat in the ring. While investors may not yet be familiar with this regional coffee chain, it boasts many of the same qualities that helped make Starbucks a household name. Dutch Bros' consistent growth, repeat customers, and fun-loving employees have helped the company become the third-largest coffee chain in the U.S. and put it on the fast track to success.\nLoyal -- and thirsty -- fans\nWhile Starbucks focused on the atmosphere of its namesake coffee shops, Dutch Bros has taken a different approach. The company's focus is on the drive-through and an elevated customer experience. High-energy \"broistas\" greet each guest with a smile and ask about their day, part of Dutch Bros' \"people-first\" culture. The company offers a wide variety of customizable cold and hot beverages, including coffee, tea, signature energy drinks, and a rotating list of seasonal specials. Dutch Bros also has a secret menu with fan-favorite drinks.\nThe company's motto helps spell out the allure: \"Dutch Bros is a fun-loving, mind-blowing company making a massive difference, one cup at a time.\" The company strives to embody its core values of quality, speed, and service in every transaction.\nThis strategy is paying off. Dutch Bros has attracted a large following of die-hard fans and repeat customers who frequent its 1,043 locations in 19 states. The Dutch Rewards program, available exclusively through the app, accounted for 72% of transactions in the second quarter, a number that has been steadily rising.\nHappy employees make for happy customers\nSince its inception, Dutch Bros embraces a customer-first approach, giving it a competitive edge over the competition. The company is recognized for its positive and fun work environment, which has a direct impact on the experience, resulting in more satisfied employees. This, in turn, leads to loyal customers, positive word of mouth, and increased sales.\nDutch Bros boasts an extremely low employee turnover rate of just 35%, far below the industry average of 50%. In fact, in 2024, the company improved its store-level employee turnover rate by 5%. By retaining qualified workers, the company also helps preserve its unique and positive culture.\nDutch Bros has a history of industry accolades. It was one of the top quick service restaurant (QSR) brands in 2024, taking up the No. 2 spot, according to Earnest Analytics. In 2022, Dutch Bros was awarded the Pacesetter Award by Restaurant Business Magazine, cited for its \"strong corporate culture, successful loyalty program, and thoughtful growth.\" The company was also ranked the No. 4 Best Employers for New Grads in 2024 by Forbes Magazine.\nIf that weren't enough, Dutch Bros was recognized by USA Today in its annual 10 Best Readers' Choice awards, voted No. 4 Best Drive-Thru Coffee and No. 5 Best Coffee Chain.\nShow me the money\nDutch Bros is noted for having among the best unit-level economics in the industry, with average unit volume (AUV) of just over $2 million. That puts Dutch Bros in elite company, ranked No. 18 among all quick service restaurants and the top-performing coffee chain in 2024, according to QSR Magazine. For context, Starbucks clocked in at No. 23 with AUV of $1.8 million.\nThe company's financial results, released just this week, help paint a compelling picture. In Q2, Dutch Bros generated revenue that grew 28% year over year to $416 million, resulting in earnings per share (EPS) that soared 66% to $0.20. The results were fueled by strong same-store sales (comps) that grew 6.1% and 7.8% for company-owned shops.\nFor context, during the same period, Starbucks reported dismal results. In the company's fiscal 2025 Q3 (ended June 29), revenue of $9.5 billion increased 4%, while EPS plunged 47%. Global sales declined 2%, driven by a 2% decline in comps.\nDutch Bros continues to take a measured approach to growth, adding 31 new locations across 13 states during the quarter, bringing the total to 1,043 across 19 states to close out Q3. Starbucks currently operates 32,000 stores in 80 countries, which helps illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity for Dutch Bros. If the company continues along its current trajectory, even if it grows to just a fraction of the size of the Starbucks empire, it will likely be a highly successful investment.\nYou get what you pay for\nDutch Bros stock has been a wild ride for investors. Within weeks after its IPO in late 2021, the stock soared as much as 108% before shedding as much as 70% of its value. However, since hitting its bottom in late 2023, the stock has gained 153% (as of this writing), and the future looks bright.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't discuss the elephant in the room -- Dutch Bros' pricey valuation. The stock currently sells for 70 times next year's earnings and 3.7 times next year's sales, so it's definitely fetching a premium. That said, Dutch Bros is outperforming the more seasoned competition and has a long runway for growth ahead, which helps to explain the high multiples.\nMake no mistake, plenty of things will have to go right for Dutch Bros to become the next Starbucks, but given its loyal customer base, happy broistas, and robust results, the company is off to an impressive start.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Dutch Bros right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Dutch Bros, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dutch Bros wasn’t one of them.

Soaring demand for the company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) allowed it to beat Wall Street's expectations, and it also raised its guidance for the full year. However, investors may now be wondering if it makes sense to buy Palantir stock following the massive gains it has clocked in the past year, especially considering the mind-boggling valuation it is trading at.\nLet's see if Palantir has enough fuel in the tank to justify its expensive valuation and deliver more gains to investors.\nPalantir's growth continues to accelerate\nPalantir reported a 48% year-over-year increase in revenue in Q2 to just over $1 billion. This was the company's first ever billion-dollar quarter in terms of revenue. It is worth noting that Palantir reported a 27% year-over-year increase in revenue in the same quarter last year, meaning that its growth accelerated impressively in the previous quarter.\nPalantir management credits its improving growth trajectory to the rapidly improving demand for AIP, both from existing and new customers. Palantir's AIP is being deployed in multiple industries ranging from healthcare to automotive to telecom to banking, among others. This platform allows customers to integrate generative AI into their operations to boost productivity, reduce redundancy, and improve operational efficiency, all of which help them achieve substantial cost savings.\nAs a result, Palantir says that it is witnessing \"new starts with higher ambition, and existing customers expand their work at a faster rate.\" On the other hand, the company's government-related revenue also jumped an impressive 49% year over year. The company's AI-focused software capabilities are in solid demand from government customers, as evident from the decade-long $10 billion contract it signed last week with the U.S. Army.\nThe terrific demand for Palantir's AI software solutions in both the commercial and federal segments is setting the company up for stronger growth in the long run by helping it build a robust revenue pipeline. After all, the company signed a record $2.3 billion worth of new contracts last quarter. Palantir's total contract value jumped a phenomenal 140% year over year, which was nearly triple the pace at which its top line expanded.\nThis outstanding jump in Palantir's contract value last quarter pushed up the company's remaining deal value (RDV) by 65% from the year-ago period to $7.1 billion. With RDV referring to the total value of Palantir's unfulfilled contracts at the end of a quarter, it can be safely said that the company is sitting on a solid backlog that should allow it to grow at an even better rate in the future.\nAdditionally, investors should note that the contract expansions that Palantir is signing with customers are having a positive impact on its margins. Its adjusted operating income margin jumped by nine percentage points from the year-ago period to 46%. It is easy to see why that's happening, as Palantir isn't having to spend more money on getting new business from existing customers.\nConsidering that the company continues to add new customers at a nice clip -- its customer count increased by 43% in the previous quarter -- there is scope for further improvement in its margins once new customer accounts start expanding the usage of Palantir's solutions.\nPalantir reported a 78% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings last quarter to $0.16 per share. The company's adjusted operating income guidance of $495 million for Q3 would translate into a 79% jump from the year-ago period, indicating it is well-placed to sustain its outstanding earnings growth rate.\nFinally, when we consider the long-term opportunity available in the AI software platforms market that Palantir is serving, the company seems capable enough to justify its expensive valuation.\nWhy investors may want to look past the valuation\nWith a price-to-earnings ratio of 700, investors will have to pay a massive premium if they want to buy into Palantir's growth story right now. Of course, the forward earnings multiple of 285 is significantly lower on account of the healthy earnings growth that the company is witnessing, but even that's quite expensive.\nHowever, with the global AI software market expected to generate a whopping $440 billion in annual revenue in 2029, Palantir seems to be positioned at the beginning of a remarkable growth curve. As the demand for its AIP grows and it wins more business from existing customers, the company should be able to keep growing its earnings at eye-popping rates.\nPalantir's growth exceeds the 28% annual growth rate the AI software market is projected to clock in the next five years, indicating that it is cornering a bigger share of the $440 billion revenue opportunity on offer. So, Palantir can become a much bigger company in the long run, which is why investors may consider looking past its valuation at its remarkable growth could be rewarded with more upside on the stock market.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

That means it offers investors a high degree of exposure to the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies, which operate at the cutting edge of high-growth areas like artificial intelligence (AI).\nThe Nasdaq-100 slipped into a bear market in April following the announcement of President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, which threatened to set off a global trade war. But the president quickly walked back the most aggressive aspects of his tariff plan to make way for negotiations with America's top trading partners, so the stock market rapidly recovered. The Nasdaq-100 even set a new all-time high in June, which marked the beginning of a new bull market.\nNow that the Nasdaq-100 has momentum on its side, should investors buy the Invesco QQQ ETF? History offers a very clear answer.\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are key, but they aren't the whole story\nThe Magnificent Seven are Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Tesla. They make up 43.6% of the value of the Invesco QQQ ETF's entire portfolio, so they are impossible to ignore.\nThe Nasdaq-100 has soared by 33% since it bottomed on April 8, but the Magnificent Seven stocks have delivered an average return of 40% over the same period, so they played a major role in pulling the index out of its recent bear market.\nTogether, those seven companies are leading almost every facet of the AI race, from hardware to software. However, a number of other AI stocks in the Nasdaq-100 have the potential to outperform the broader market, and here are five that I consider the most noteworthy:\nBroadcom\nPalantir Technologies\nAdvanced Micro Devices\nMicron Technology\nCrowdStrike Holdings\nBroadcom is a leading supplier of networking equipment for data centers, but it's also experiencing significant demand for its AI accelerators. These chips can be customized to suit the needs of the company's hyperscale customers, unlike Nvidia's industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs), which are sold as-is. Broadcom says at least three customers are aiming to deploy 1 million AI accelerators each in 2027, creating an opportunity worth up to $90 billion for the company.\nAMD and Micron are also AI hardware powerhouses. The former developed a GPU architecture called Compute DNA 4 (CDNA 4) that rivals Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, and it will ramp up chip production in the second half of this year. The company is also a top supplier of AI chips for personal computers, which could be a significant growth market in the future.\nMicron, on the other hand, supplies memory chips that are crucial in AI workloads, and its latest HBM3E technology can be found in Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs.\nPalantir is one of the hottest players in the AI software space, with its stock soaring by 520% over the past year alone. It might be overvalued right now, but the company's three software platforms are increasingly popular among private enterprises and the government. Using AI, they process high volumes of data and extract valuable insights that can be used to make crucial operational decisions.\nLastly, CrowdStrike is a leader in AI-powered cybersecurity. The company's Falcon platform is one of the only all-in-one solutions on the market, covering cloud security, identity management, end-point protection, and more. Falcon automates the threat detection and response processes using AI, resolving issues rapidly with little need for human intervention.\nHistory suggests this could be a great time to buy the Invesco ETF\nThe Invesco QQQ ETF was established in 1999, and the Nasdaq-100 has endured seven bear markets since then -- that's an average of one every three and a half years! But even after accounting for each of those sharp sell-offs, the ETF has still delivered a compound annual return of 10.2% over the last 26 years.\nEach Nasdaq-100 bear market had a different trigger; there was the dot-com bust in 2000, the global financial crisis in 2008, and the tariff turmoil this year, to name just a few. Nevertheless, the index overcame them all to consistently set new record highs, which is evidence of its incredible resilience.\nMy point is, buying the Invesco QQQ ETF now with the Nasdaq near a record high might sound daunting, but history suggests timing has very little impact on investors' ability to earn a positive return over the long run. That might be especially true today considering AI is likely to be a driver of tech-sector returns for several years to come.\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks data center spending will top $1 trillion per year by 2028, as each new generation of AI model consumes more computing power. The estimates on the software side are even larger; Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management predicts AI could create a $13 trillion opportunity in the software industry, which will drive a productivity boom worth $117 trillion among knowledge workers (like engineers, lawyers, and information-technology professionals).\nInvestors who buy the Invesco QQQ ETF will have broad exposure to those opportunities, saving them from having to pick winners and losers among a sea of individual AI stocks. Therefore, it could be a great buy right now for anyone who is willing to hold it until at least 2030, and preferably beyond.\nShould you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Invesco QQQ Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Invesco QQQ Trust wasn’t one of them.

The goal isn’t to chase rates. The goal is to create a network of freight that holds steady when everything else is in flux. This is how real businesses operate. No fluff. No hype. Just structure, consistency, and systems that outperform the chaos.\nLet’s set the record straight. The market doesn’t care about your goals. Freight rates will fall. Brokers will go silent. Fuel prices will spike without warning. That’s not doom-and-gloom—that’s the reality of trucking. The fleets that make it through these swings don’t just run loads. They run lanes. And those lanes are built with intention, data, and discipline.\nIf your week starts with scrambling on the load board, burning time and fuel trying to piece together a plan, you’re operating reactively. That chaos costs you more than money—it kills momentum. But when your routes follow a pattern, and your relationships support that pattern, you stop surviving and start scaling.\nLoad Boards Are a Crutch—Not a Business Model\nLet’s be clear—load boards have a role. They help fill holes. But they can’t build the foundation of a profitable operation. If your calendar revolves around what’s posted Monday morning, you’re handing your control and margin over to brokers who have zero incentive to help you win long term.\nBrokers know when you’re desperate. They feel it in your rate negotiations. They hear it in your voice. And they’ll use it to their advantage. But when you operate with structured lanes, everything changes. Driver schedules stabilize. Maintenance is easier to plan. Fuel costs are more predictable. And most importantly, your profit per mile stops swinging like a yo-yo.\nConsistency beats chaos. Every single time.\nThe 3R Filter – Discipline That Builds Durable Freight Networks\nThere’s a simple system used by disciplined carriers to evaluate whether a load aligns with their business: the 3R Filter. It’s not fancy. But it works.\nRepeatability – Can you run this same lane week after week?\nReliability – Does the rate stay viable in soft markets?\nRelationship Potential – Is the broker or shipper someone you can count on long-term?\nIf the answer is no to any of the above, it’s not a business-building load. It’s a distraction. High rates don’t mean sustainable rates. One-off wins don’t build systems. You have to look past the rate-per-mile and evaluate the bigger picture.\n10 Tactical Steps to Build Lanes That Don’t Break Under Pressure\n1. Define Your Operating Region\nDraw a circle—400 to 600 miles around your home base. That’s your battleground. Inside that radius, you can manage fuel better, control detention risk, and keep drivers fresh. Stop chasing freight from New York to California unless your numbers prove it out.\n2. Analyze 90 Days of Load History\nPull your records. Look at every lane. Rank them by profit per mile, total margin, and deadhead percentage. Pay close attention to where the consistent wins came from. That’s your foundation—not the random high-paying loads that never came back.\n3. Track Broker Consistency\nBrokers should be ranked, not just used. Who pays on time? Who communicates clearly? Who ghosts you after one load? Build your bench with brokers who show up every week. Cut ties with those who vanish.\n4. Route for Fuel and Rest, Not Just Freight\nLook at truck stops, fuel pricing, and legal parking across your lanes. Your most profitable lanes won’t just pay well—they’ll save money with smart stops. That’s a real margin.\n5. Set Up Backup Loads\nIf your main broker cancels, what’s your move? Don’t wing it. Have two to three backup brokers in each lane ready to go. If you don’t, you’re building your week on hope. And hope is not a plan.\n6. Create Broker Scorecards\nStart grading your brokers. Use clear metrics: rate consistency, ease of communication, payment speed, detention policies. Keep it simple. Review monthly. Cut the worst 20%, double down on the best 20%.\n7. Use Load History to Contact Shippers\nYou don’t need a sales team to go direct. Pull your lane data. See where you’ve been hauling. Find shippers in those corridors. Call. Email. Visit if you’re nearby. Position yourself as the consistent carrier who’s already in the lane.\n8. Plan Full Loops—Not Just One-Way Wins\nAn outbound lane without a return is a half-built system. Always plan your week as a loop. The best carriers have round-trip profitability, even if the backhaul pays a bit less. The key is balance—margin over miles.\n9. Secure Anchor Lanes\nOnce you find a lane that checks the 3R boxes, protect it. Overcommunicate. Be early. Solve issues without drama. Make yourself irreplaceable. That anchor lane becomes your weekly baseline. From there, everything scales.\n10. Review Weekly Performance\nEvery week, look at:\nRPM trends by lane\nDetention hours\nMissed appointments\nFuel spend by route\nDriver breakdowns or fatigue patterns\nUse that data to improve—not just adjust. If a lane starts to slide, identify why. If another starts performing better, find out what changed. Your lanes should be alive—not static.\nDon’t Hold on to Failing Freight\nLoyalty to a dying lane will sink your margins. Be ruthless with your evaluations. If any of the following happen, it’s time to pivot:\nRates drop below your breakeven\nBrokers stop responding\nDeadhead starts creeping up\nThe return lane dries out\nLet it go. Your freight network needs to serve your business, not drain it.\nBuild Resilience Into Your Routing\nThis is where growth becomes sustainable. Resilient carriers don’t scramble—they adapt. They:\nMaintain backup relationships\nMonitor regional rate trends weekly\nTrack fuel costs across states\nUse tools like DAT, FreightWaves, and fuel apps to stay ahead\nPrepared carriers don’t panic when volume drops. They shift—fast, and with control.\nFinal Word\nYou don’t scale a trucking business by chasing spot market chaos. You scale it by owning your lanes, mastering your margins, and structuring your routing like a system—not a guessing game.\nIt’s not about running 3,000 miles a week. It’s about making $2.75+ per mile on 1,800 miles that are predictable, repeatable, and profitable.\nBuild lanes that serve your business. Forge partnerships that respect your time. Run freight that keeps your drivers sharp and your numbers clean.\nThe market will always swing. Your business shouldn’t. Discipline beats hustle. Structure beats scramble.\nThat’s how small carriers grow—lane by lane, week by week, with zero room for guesswork.","content_hash":"6873dca329aec05da994c390ec098b88","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6540,"method_rank":0}

The S & P 500 on Friday rose above its July 28 record close but finished just shy of it. The Nasdaq did, however, finish at a new record closing high. It was a strong week dominated by tariff headlines and Apple's success in appeasing President Donald Trump with a big U.S. investment commitment. Club earnings were also on our radar. For the week, the S & P 500 gained 2.4%, and the Nasdaq advanced 3.9%. Apple stock led the way higher, surging more than 13% this week and turning in its third-best weekly performance in the past decade. It was our top stock, ending the week on a three-session winning streak that started Wednesday when Apple announced a $100 billion increase to the $500 billion it had already pledged to investing in the United States over the next four years. As part of that investment, Apple will fund a $2.5 billion expansion of iPhone and Apple Watch glass maker Corning . Apple is also investing in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing capacity. As a result of the commitment, Trump said that Apple will be exempt from the 100% tariff he announced Wednesday on semiconductor imports. The president said, \"If you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge.\" While a temporary electronics exemption from earlier this year keeps Apple safe from the worst of the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that went into effect Thursday, there is no telling how long that exemption will last. So, it's great that Cook managed to get back into Trump's good graces, and the stock move this week reflects that. Apple shares, however, have been struggling and were still down more than 8% year to date. With Trump off its back for now, the company must seize the opportunity to remove the other concerns about its stock by clarifying its artificial intelligence strategy and shoring up threats to its high-margin services business. AAPL YTD mountain Apple YTD Also, this week, Trump announced a 25% increase on India's tariff rate due to Russian oil purchases. It's set to go into effect on Aug. 27, which would bring the levy rate on India up to 50%. We'll have to see where that shakes out as India is where Apple manufactures the iPhones it plans to sell in the U.S. The rest of the world will get iPhones made in China, which is still talking to the U.S. about a trade truce. Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that he's looking to implement a \"small tariff\" on pharmaceuticals, but the rate will increase over time. He said that a level as high as 250% is not out of the question. That news was no picnic for drug stocks, which are already under pressure from the president to cut prescription prices. As if that weren't enough, Eli Lilly stock took another leg down as strong earnings Thursday were overshadowed by lackluster weight loss results from the company's phase three trial looking at the effects of its obesity pill, orforglipron. The trial data forced us to downgrade shares to our looking-for-a-level-to-sell 3 rating and cut our price target. Lilly shares suffered a weekly loss nearly 18%, the worst week since October 2008. The Club stock was our bottom performer for the week. Within the Club portfolio this week, we also heard from five others, including DuPont , which reported a beat and raise quarter with strong cash flow results. The stock reaction did not, in our view, reflect the strength, so we reiterated our buy-equivalent 1 rating, upped our price target, and stepped in to pick up 100 more shares. DuPont stock rose less than 1% this week. Coterra Energy released largely positive results, driven by higher-than-expected total production. However, strong as the execution by management is, Jim Cramer said, \"You can't outrun your commodity, not if both commodities you're in are bad,\" prompting us to reiterate our 3 rating and trim our price target. Coterra shares gained nearly 1.4% on the week. Eaton reported a beat-and-raise quarter. However, investors took issue with management's third-quarter outlook and 2025 profit guidance. The midpoint of full year adjusted earnings per share guidance was raised, management shaved a little off the top end. Nonetheless, we saw a lot to like beyond the third quarter and, therefore, raised our Eaton price target and upgraded shares back to a 1 rating. Eaton stock lost nearly 4.9% this week. Disney's quarter wasn't the cleanest, but we saw strength in all the right places. While sales missed, earnings beat. We also saw operating income beats in streaming, sports, and experiences. As a result, we upgraded shares back to a 1 rating and raised our price target. Disney shares lost more than 3.5% on the week. Texas Roadhouse reported mixed results. Sales outpaced expectations; however, profitability took a hit due to elevated beef prices. The restaurant chain operator delivered strong comparable sales and said the ongoing third quarter was off to a great start. With demand clearly strong but profitability coming under pressure, we opted to maintain our 2 rating. Texas Roadhouse stock lost 5.5% this week. According to FactSet, 90% of S & P 500 companies have now reported second-quarter results, and 81% of them have posted upside surprises for both sales and earnings. The data provider said, \"Both the percentage of S & P 500 companies reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of earnings surprises are above their 10-year averages.\" The report also noted that, versus the year-ago period, nine S & P 500 sectors have reported earnings growth, led by communication services, information technology, and financials, while the other two, energy and materials, have reported year-over-year declines. Dow stock Cisco Systems , our newest name, is the only portfolio company reporting earnings next week. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Kirchenbauer, senior adviser and founder of Omega Wealth Management in Arlington, Va., told Yahoo Finance.\nIf you don’t, don’t invest, Kirchenbauer said: “Peter Lynch, the famous fund manager at Fidelity Magellan, used to talk about ‘own what you know.’ If you don’t know and understand what you are investing in, stick with traditional investments.”\nUnlike stocks and bonds, these private assets are less liquid and can’t be easily sold if cash is needed, making them less suitable if you have a shorter time horizon — for example, if you will need to start taking Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs), or you roll over your 401(k) to an IRA when you change jobs.\n“You need to understand the liquidity rules, or don’t invest,” Kirchenbauer said. “For someone planning to keep their assets in the same plan for a while, even in retirement, it may make more sense.”\nShe added that if you decide to invest in private assets, you should consider keeping your allocation to a maximum of 5-10% to start.\nPrivate assets vs. target date funds\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink has taken that idea even further. Instead of a traditional 60\/40 split between stocks and bonds, the future standard retirement portfolio may look more like 50\/30\/20 — stocks, bonds, and private assets like real estate, infrastructure, and private credit, Fink wrote in his annual letter to clients in April.\nFink points out that pension funds have invested in them for decades, but 401(k)s haven't. “It’s one reason why pensions typically outperform 401(k)s by about 0.5% each year. Half a percent doesn't sound huge, but it adds up over time,” he wrote.\nPrivate assets are already legal in retirement accounts, Fink wrote, but 401(k) providers who select the investments offered in workplace plans aren't widely familiar with them.\nThat’s where the president’s directive comes in, pushing regulators to show them how it's done.\nEven so, it’s a bewildering proposition for many Americans saving for their future.\nMany workers these days are in the dark about precisely what they are investing in when they enroll in their employer-provided 401(k) plan and are defaulted into a diversified target-date fund based on their anticipated number of years to retirement.\nAt Vanguard, for instance, last year more than 8 in 10 of participants in its 401(k) accounts used target-date funds. About two-thirds of all 2024 contributions from the 5 million plan participants went into these funds — an all-time high.\nWith a target-date retirement fund, you choose the year you’d like to retire and buy a mutual fund with that year in its name (like Target 2044). The fund manager then allocates your investment between stocks and bonds, typically made up of index funds, tweaking that to a more conservative mix as the target date nears.\nMany people simply pick the year they’ll reach their full Social Security retirement age as the target-date year. For most of us, that’s 67. If you have a higher risk tolerance, you might go with a later date for a more aggressive mix, meaning a higher exposure to stocks, or an earlier one if you lean conservative.\nPlan options are coming, but experts advise caution\nFink’s BlackRock (BLK) has already jumped into the arena, recently announcing that it’s launching a target-date fund that will consist of private credit, private equity, and other investments, aiming to increase the annual return by an extra 0.5% — translating to roughly 15% more money in your 401(k) over 40 years.\nThe fund will be offered by Great Gray Trust, which offers retirement investment options and manages over $210 billion in assets. Empower, the second-largest retirement services provider in the US, has aligned with top-tier private investment fund managers and custodians, including Apollo Global Management (APO) and Goldman Sachs (GS). (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nEmpower also plans to offer private equity, credit, and real estate in some of its retirement portfolios later this year, and Voya Financial and alternative asset manager Blue Owl Capital are partnering to create private markets products for defined contribution plans.\n“Historically, private assets have been reserved for ultra-high-net-worth individuals and institutions. 401(k) access democratizes investment in alternatives,” said Cary Carbonaro, a certified financial planner and the author of the new book \"Women and Wealth.\"\nBut she stressed caution: “While they may offer higher long-term returns compared to public markets, and some real estate and infrastructure assets may offer better protection against inflation, I am still not sure they are appropriate for regular lay people.”\nPrivate assets can be “locked up for years with limited or no ability to sell early — conflicting with the need for participant flexibility,” she added.\nMeanwhile, participants may struggle to understand what they’re investing in or how performance is generated, she said. “There is no requirement to share financial information. It is essentially a black box investment.”\nOne last caveat: Private equity’s arrival in retirement accounts could potentially push costs higher for investors. That’s after fees in 401(k) plans have come down sharply in recent decades, thanks in large measure to more savers investing in lower-cost index funds.\n“Private funds often carry performance fees and other layers of costs, reducing net returns, Carbonaro said.\nMost lay people don't even know about the stocks or bonds they are investing in, and these assets are generally reserved for more sophisticated investors, she said. “It will be interesting to see if the employer or plan fiduciary will take the risk to put these as an option.”","content_hash":"0e70a9a8e08dcfb878e561720c4fd440","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6501,"method_rank":0}

As of this writing, the the S&P 500 Financials Sector index has delivered a total return of 25% across the stretch -- crushing the S&P 500 index's already-impressive gain of 20% over the period.\nWhile financial stocks have generally outperformed over the last 12 months, there are still some promising players in the sector that trade at big discounts compared to their peak valuations. If you're on the hunt for portfolio additions that can deliver strong returns, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors identified these stocks as top plays right now.\nUpstart stock: down 83%\nKeith Noonan (Upstart): On the heels of its recent post-earnings sell-off, Upstart(NASDAQ: UPST) is looking like a smart buy right now. The disruptive lender actually posted very strong results in the quarter and continues to make smart moves to shore up its long-term future, but the stock saw a big pullback following its recent business update.\nIn the second quarter, Upstart posted earnings per share of $0.05 on sales of $257 million. The performance crushed the average Wall Street analyst estimate, which had called for a per-share loss of $0.10 on sales of $225.4 million. Revenue was up roughly 101% compared to last year's second quarter, and loans originated in the quarter were up 159% year over year to 372,599. Despite some strong momentum recently, the stock is down roughly 83% from its all-time high.\nUpstart's artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform showed very strong momentum in the second quarter, and the company's investments helped power an overall profit despite a loss from operations of $4.5 million in the quarter. Even though the business posted an operating loss, the performance represented a big improvement from the $55.5 million loss from operations recorded in last year's quarter. Overall, the company notched its first quarter of profitability in years -- and there are signs of encouraging momentum despite macroeconomic uncertainty on the horizon.\nDespite the strong Q2 results, Upstart saw big sell-offs following the quarterly report due to comments from management suggesting that inflation remains a major risk factor and that competitive intensity in its core service markets is increasing. On the other hand, guidance for sales to increase roughly 66% annually this year still suggests fairly strong momentum, even if hitting that range would represent a significant deceleration from the growth seen in Q2.\nOverall, the near-term macroeconomic picture looks like a mixed bag for Upstart. While the labor market appears to be weakening, it now looks very likely that the Federal Reserve will deliver a substantial rate cut at its September meeting. The company's stock could continue to see significant volatility in conjunction with macroeconomic trends, but the business results are strong enough to support a long-term investment in the fintech player right now.\nNu stock: down 23%\nJennifer Saibil (Nu):Nu Holdings(NYSE: NU) is a digital bank based out of Brazil, but it caught the attention of Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) several years ago. It sold out of the young bank stock in the 2025 first quarter, but growth investors shouldn't let that sway them from taking a position in this high-growth stock. It didn't quite fit the standard Buffett stock mold from the beginning, but it could be a growth investor's dream stock. It's fast-growing, it's profitable, and it has tons of long-term potential.\nAbout 60% of the adult population in Brazil is already on Nu's platform, but that could be misleading in terms of its future opportunity. Roughly 85% of this cohort is active, and 60% of it uses Nu as its main bank, so more than 30% of the market in Brazil is using Nu as its bank. However, it only has about 5% of the market share of gross profit, which means there's still a wide-open opportunity to monetize this market more effectively with cross-selling and upselling. Nu is also upgrading its credit models with artificial intelligence (AI) to provide more access to credit, opening up another opportunity.\nThat's just in Brazil, where most of its business is concentrated today. It's still a tiny presence in Mexico, where it counts 11 million customers, and Colombia, where it just surpassed 3 million. In Mexico, customer count increased 70% over the past year, deposits more than doubled to $5 billion, and revenue almost doubled to $245 million. It was just approved for a banking charter in Mexico, which will allow it to offer even more services and capitalize on its opportunities.\nIt's also extremely profitable, since its all-digital model lends itself to cost efficiency. Its cost to serve has remained mostly unchanged below $1, while its average revenue per active customer continues to climb. It's usually around $5 for new customers, but it has reached $25 for longtime customers. The average for incumbent banks, which have been around for decades, is $40 per customer, giving Nu even higher aspirations.\nNu stock has been impacted by economic volatility in Brazil as well as the Buffett sale, and it's 23% off of its high. But as it continues to report high growth, expect the stock to soar over time.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Upstart right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Upstart, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Upstart wasn’t one of them.

Its vaccine shot brought in billions, positioning the biotech firm as a symbol of innovation and speed in a global crisis. But the post-Covid world hasn’t been as kind. With vaccination rates falling and Spikevax sales drying up, revenues have tumbled. The gold rush moment is clearly over.\nNow, in a bid to stay lean, Moderna is cutting roughly 10% of its workforce as part of a broader plan to reduce annual operating expenses by $1.5 billion through 2027. The company tried to dodge layoffs by tightening R&D budgets, dialing down manufacturing, and renegotiating supplier deals. But with the market shifting and respiratory vaccine sales stalling, CEO Stéphane Bancel says it’s time to realign the business with a leaner game plan.\nThe company is betting big on a pipeline loaded with promise — next-gen mRNA shots in oncology, rare diseases, and latent viruses. But with MRNA stock down more than 90% from its pandemic highs and policy headwinds brewing, is this a comeback play or a value trap? How should investors approach the biotech stock now?\nAbout Moderna Stock\nBased in Cambridge, Massachusetts and founded in 2010, Moderna began as a moonshot on mRNA tech, chasing cures for infectious diseases, rare disorders, cancer, and more. Backed by major players like AstraZeneca (AZN) and the Gates Foundation, it built a powerful platform with world-changing potential. Its market capitalization currently stands at $10.4 billion.\nWhen the pandemic hit, Moderna went from a clinical-stage underdog to a global hero with a Covid-19 vaccine that changed everything. But as the world moved on, demand faded, and so did the company’s momentum.\nAfter peaking just shy of $500 in 2021, MRNA stock has crashed 94% from that level. In 2025 alone, shares are down 37%, including a 12% dip in just the past month. A lukewarm second-quarter earnings report last week triggered a 6.6% dip in just one session.\nIn terms of valuation, MRNA stock is trading at 3.3 times sales, which is lower than its own five-year average multiple.\nModerna’s Mixed Q2 Earnings Report\nOn Aug. 1, Moderna dropped its Q2 earnings report, showing signs of tighter control amid a post-Covid reset. The company posted a loss of $2.13 per share, still in the red, but better than both Wall Street’s projections and last year’s results. Revenue came in at $142 million, down 41% year-over-year (YOY) but still ahead of estimates. The decline was due to shrinking demand for its Covid-19 vaccine, Spikevax, which made up nearly all of the $114 million in product sales.\nThe real story here isn’t just about numbers but about a pivot. With the pandemic in the rearview, Spikevax is settling into its new role as a seasonal product, and mResvia — the company’s newly launched RSV vaccine — barely moved the needle this quarter. Add to that a sharp 51% drop in collaboration and licensing revenue, and it is clear the biotech is feeling the squeeze.\nSo, Moderna is tightening its belt, and fast. Operating costs are being hacked down as part of a major restructuring. SG&A expenses fell 14%, and R&D was slashed 43% to $700 million, largely due to scaled-back respiratory programs and slower clinical activity. But perhaps the most visible shift is in the workforce. As part of the company’s cost-streamlining drive, it is trimming nearly 10% of its global staff. It’s a tough call, but a necessary one to keep the long-term mission on track.\nLooking forward, Moderna revised its full-year revenue guidance to between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, down $300 million from its earlier high-end forecast. The reason is that a delivery delay of U.K. vaccine orders has now pushed into early 2026. Most of the 2025 revenue is expected to roll in during the second half, with Q3 pulling in about 40% to 50% of that haul.\nMeanwhile, R&D guidance has also been trimmed to $3.6 billion and $3.8 billion, aligning with workforce reductions and lower clinical spend. Despite the turbulence, the company is set to close 2025 with approximately $6 billion in cash and investments — a solid cushion for navigating whatever comes next.\nAnalysts tracking the biotech company anticipate Moderna’s losses to deepen by 11% YOY to around -$9.82 per share in fiscal 2025, then narrow by 27% annually to -$7.21 per share in fiscal 2026.\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for Moderna Stock?\nAfter Moderna’s Q2 earnings release, Wall Street’s confidence took a softer tone, reflected clearly in the updated price targets. Bank of America nudged its target down to $24 from $25, holding firm on its “Underperform” rating. Analyst Tim Anderson is not sold on Moderna’s long-term growth story, pointing out that the company’s near- and mid-term outlook still leans heavily on Covid vaccine sales, which are notoriously hard to predict in this post-pandemic world.\nBank of America has been skeptical for a while. The firm reinstated coverage back in December with that same “Underperform” call, flagging doubts about the company’s other programs like RSV and CMV. Despite Moderna’s push to diversify, the brokerage firm is not yet convinced there’s enough there to support sustainable growth.\nBarclays also reined things in, trimming its price target from $40 to $31 while maintaining an “Equal Weight” rating. Analyst Gena Wang said the downward shift stems largely from Moderna pushing some U.K. vaccine revenue into early 2026. Still, Wang believes further cost-cutting should help Moderna stay on track with its goal of breaking even by 2028.\nModerna’s reinvention pitch is loud, but the Street is staying cautious. Among the 26 analysts covering MRNA stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” That’s based on three analysts recommending a “Strong Buy,” 19 advising a “Hold,” one giving a “Moderate Sell,” and the remaining three suggesting a “Strong Sell.”\nThe mean price target of $41.90 for MRNA stock suggests more than 57% upside potential from current levels. The Street-high target of $198 implies that the stock could rally as much as 644%.\nOn the date of publication, Sristi Suman Jayaswal did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Tech excitement continues to push up all major index futures ahead of Friday's bell.\n* The stock stumbles on Thursday included an outsize 14% earnings-day hit to pharma giant Eli Lilly after a disappointing drug trial and a 3% drop in Intel after Trump demanded the resignation of its CEO due to Chinese links.\n* Longer-term Fed easing expectations were buoyed after Trump said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisors Chairperson Stephen Miran to temporarily fill Adriana Kugler's vacant board seat and dovish Fed Governor Chris Waller was reported to be his top pick for the Chair next year. JPMorgan now expects a rate cut next month, and the futures market is pricing in rates as low as 3% by the end of next year, about 20 basis points lower than expected a month ago.\n* U.S. Treasury yields flatlined and the dollar nudged higher, as Thursday's long-bond auction continued a week of lukewarm debt sales and weekly jobless claims data showed few signs of the softness flagged in last week's payrolls report. Sterling was firmer after the Bank of England only narrowly voted to cut rates on Thursday, and the peso was steady after Mexico's central bank eased again too.\n* U.S. gold futures climbed to a record high on Friday after a Financial Times report said the United States had imposed tariffs on imports of one kilo and 100 ounce gold bars, a move that could impact Switzerland, the world's largest gold refining hub. Crude oil prices fell to two-month lows as the expected talks between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin raised the prospect of easing sanctions on Russia.\nToday's Market Minute:\n* U.S. President Donald Trump has wielded the threat of tariffs as an all-purpose foreign policy weapon. With a Friday deadline for Russia to agree to peace in Ukraine or have its oil customers face secondary tariffs, Trump has found a novel, but risky, use for his favorite trade tool.\n* OpenAI launched on Thursday its GPT-5 artificial intelligence model, the highly anticipated latest installment of a technology that has helped transform global business and culture.\n* Israel's political-security cabinet approved a plan early on Friday to take control of Gaza City, as the country expands its military operations despite intensifying criticism at home and abroad over the devastating almost two-year-old war.\n* Britain's ambition to rev up its economy and tap the AI revolution faces the harsh reality that the abundant, clean and reliable electricity supply this requires is unlikely to materialise any time soon. Read the latest from ROI energy columnist Ron Bousso.\n* U.S. President Donald Trump has the so-called 'BRIC' group of nations directly in his trade war crosshairs, slapping super-high tariffs on imports from Brazil and India. But this belligerence could backfire writes ROI columnist Jamie McGeever.\nChart of the day:\nThe New York Fed's latest survey of household inflation expectations saw the long-term price rise outlook creeping back up to the highest since March, with views over one, three and five years now converging toward 3% - a point above the Fed's 2% inflation target. However, the history of the survey shows consumer views frequently gravitate to these levels over the past decade even before the post-pandemic inflation surge and during periods when actual inflation was much lower.\nWeekend reads:\nTRUMP WINNING?:\nJust over six months into his second term in the White House and amid huge economic policy disruption, Trump looks to be getting what he wants without bowling over the economy, writes former International Monetary Fund chief economist Kenneth Rogoff in a review. How successful those wins prove over the longer run remains far less clear, he argues on Project Syndicate.\nDATA MANIPULATION COSTS?:\nTrump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief has raised questions about politically-biased government economic data going forward. Council on Foreign Relations fellow Benn Steil gives a glimpse of what studies show about the cost of data manipulation elsewhere in the world.\nCHINA TRADE AND EU JOBS:\nFollowing a recent European Central Bank blog on the impact of rising Chinese imports on European inflation, the ECB's latest bulletin contains a piece on how rising Chinese import competition - partly due to trade diversion from tariffed U.S. markets - might affect European labor markets. While auto and chemical sectors are already affected, it reckons the broader implications might extend to nearly one-third of euro area employment.\nOFFSETTING 'CHINA SHOCK':\nAmerica's hit from Chinese competition has only really been felt in Germany since 2020, argues Technical University of Munich Professor Dalia Marin in a VoxEU column. To avoid America's painful de-industrialisation of the 2000s, she says, Chinese market entry in Europe should be made conditional on forming joint ventures with European firms in order to retain global competitiveness.\nMUSK VS MODI?:\nElon Musk's court case against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in the Karnataka High Court targets the entire basis for tightened internet censorship in India, one of the biggest user bases of Musk's X platform. As regulators globally weigh free-speech protections against concern about harmful content, Reuters Munsif Vengattil, Arpan Chaturvedi and Aditya Kalra give a detailed account of this pivotal battle between the world's richest person and authorities of the world's most populous country.\nToday's events to watch\n* Canada July employment report (8:30 AM EDT)\n* St. Louis Federal Reserve President Alberto Musalem speaks; Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill speaks\nWant to receive the Morning Bid in your inbox every weekday morning?

We may be on the brink of another 1929 crash and another Great Depression.”\nIt’s a chilling comparison. From Black Monday on October 28, 1929, to mid-November, the Dow lost nearly half its value — and the pain didn’t stop there. By the summer of 1932, it had plunged 89% from its peak.\nEven a fraction of that kind of collapse today would be catastrophic — especially given how heavily 401(k)s and IRAs are tied to the stock market. During the market sell-off in 2022, CBS News reported that 401(k) and IRA plan participants experienced an estimated loss of around $3 trillion.\nKiyosaki pointed to an exodus from traditional assets, claiming, “DO YOU know investment legends Warren Buffet and Jim Rogers have sold most if not all of their stocks and bonds?”\nWhile Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway has been a net seller of equities for 11 straight quarters — and held a massive $344 billion in cash at the end of June — Kiyosaki didn’t cite a source for his claim that Buffett had dumped most of his holdings. Berkshire’s latest report still shows $267.9 billion in equity securities.\nRogers, on the other hand, has publicly stated, “I sold all my U.S. stocks” and warned that America’s debt-fueled economy is headed for trouble. Kiyosaki echoed that concern, writing, “America’s debt is out of control. America is the world’s biggest debtor nation in history. You can only print money to pay your bills… for so long.”\nAccording to Treasury Department data, the U.S. national debt now stands at $36.83 trillion.\nGiven this grim outlook, Kiyosaki is doubling down on his preferred safe-haven trio: “I sit tight with gold, silver, & Bitcoin,” he wrote.\nHere’s a closer look at these assets.\nPrecious metals\nKiyosaki’s endorsement of gold and silver is nothing new — he’s been advocating for precious metals for decades.\nIn October 2023, he predicted on X, “Gold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off. You will wish you had bought gold below $2,000. Next stop, gold $3,700.”\nPrices surged in 2024 and have continued to climb through 2025, recently surpassing $3,300 per ounce.\nGold has long been viewed as a safe-haven investment. It’s not tied to any one country, currency or economy. It can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money and investors tend to pile in during times of economic turmoil or geopolitical uncertainty — driving up its value.\nOne way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Thor Metals.\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\nKiyosaki said he’s “sitting tight” with Bitcoin — no surprise, given his bullish outlook on cryptocurrency.\nKiyosaki recently called Bitcoin “people’s money” and predicted that “Bitcoin [will go from] $500K to $1 million.”\nStay in the know.

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey said in May 2024 that Bitcoin could hit “at least” $1 million by 2030 — and possibly go even higher.\nFor those looking to hop on the bitcoin bandwagon, new crypto platforms have made it easier for everyday investors.\nWith Coinbase you can buy, sell and manage your cryptocurrency investments.\nCoinbase is a legacy crypto echange, started in 2012 -- around the same time as Bitcoin. The publicaly traded company supports over 250 digital assets and has more than 320 different trading partners.\nWith a robust rewards program and potential to earn a high APY, Coinbase is great for newcomers to the cryptocurrency game. For those looking for a more powerful trading partner, Coinbase Advanced offers low-fees and a simple, intuitive user experience.\nThis isn’t Kiyosaki’s first 1929 warning. Back in May — when Moody’s Ratings downgraded America’s credit rating — he warned of a Depression-style collapse and highlighted the power of one particular income-generating asset.\n“I have always recommended people become entrepreneurs, at least a side hustle and not need job security. Then invest in income-producing real estate, in a crash, which provides steady cash flow,” he wrote on X.\nReal estate has long been a favored asset for income-focused investors. While stock markets can swing wildly on headlines, high-quality properties often continue to generate stable rental income.\nIt can also be a powerful hedge against inflation. When inflation rises property values often increase as well, reflecting the higher costs of materials, labor and land. At the same time, rental income tends to go up, providing landlords with a revenue stream that adjusts with inflation.\nPerhaps that’s why Kiyosaki once disclosed he owns 15,000 houses — strictly for investment purposes.\nToday, you don’t need to be as wealthy as Kiyosaki to get started in real estate investing. Crowdfunding platforms like Arrived offer an easier way to get exposure to this income-generating asset class.\nThe process is simple: browse a curated selection of homes that have been vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, select the number of shares you’d like to purchase and then sit back as you start receiving any positive rental income distributions from your investment.\nAnother option is First National Realty Partners (FNRP), which allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.\nWith a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.\nSimply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.","content_hash":"b826fbee4e5c1414a0045b3072dfcb61","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6334,"method_rank":0}

The firm said it was forming a joint venture with utility PPL to invest in new natural gas power generation facilities to provide electricity for AI.\n“We believe this new technology [AI] can lead to a manufacturing renaissance in the US,” Gray said. “Generating electrons will spur economic activity and employment growth right here in Pennsylvania.”\nRecently Trump has showered the industry with one giant favor after another.\nTrump on July 4 signed his Big Beautiful Budget Bill into law. The government kept carried interest the same helping to preserve private equity wealth. What’s more the bill increased the deduction on interest payments that can be used by all companies but disproportionately benefits private equity.\nTrump on August 7 by executive order announced guidance for the Labor Department and SEC that would make it much easier for private equity firms to raise money from defined benefit plans (401-Ks) for the first time.\n“Despite multiple suggestions from various sources in the months and weeks leading up to the passage [of the Bill] hinting at possible changes to the taxation of carried interest, the [Bill] does not contain any provisions changing the current law,” law firm Ballard Spahr said. “This is welcomed news to fund sponsors.”\n“I think private equity firms are incredibly relieved,” a DC source close to the situation said.\nDuring the budget negotiations, Blackstone was working on its AI investment while Congress was hammering out details simultaneously, the DC source said.\n“I don’t think it was a deliberate quid pro-quo,” the DC source said but it made Trump amenable to changing his mind.\n“The only special interest guiding President Trump’s decision-making is the best interest of the American people,” White House Spokesman Kush Desai told JOBs. “Industry titans ranging from NVIDIA to Apple to Merck have made trillions in historic investment commitments because of their confidence in President Trump and his economic agenda – including energy abundance.”\nBlackstone declined comment.\nPrivate equity firms pay a 23.8% capital gains tax rate on profits earned when they exit businesses through a sale or an IPO. Typically, they make a 20% cut, or carried interest, from fund profits. That’s rather than the top rate for ordinary income of 40.8%.\nAnd those aren’t the only source of private equity’s profits. These firms charge enormous fees to investors and often charge the thousands of companies they own as a kind of salary more than covering their costs, so profits should arguably be treated as ordinary income. That’s the carried interest loophole.\nIf private equity paid the top 40.8% tax rate on profits instead, the U.S. would raise $13 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n“I think you could have easily seen ending carried interest as a way to help pay for reducing taxes on tips,” the DC source said, as the reduction helps the working class while eliminating carried interest essentially impacts billionaires.\nThe private equity industry’s American Investment Council lobbying group says ending carried interest would hurt long-term investment that creates jobs and that private equity builds businesses in communities across America.\nPrivate equity firms globally had $1.2 trillion to spend as of the end of 2024, according to Bain & Co., and own US businesses employing nearly 10% of the non-government workforce.\nMore and more has come out over the past decade about the harm private equity does to businesses, their workers, customers and communities where they operate. Several recent books have chronicled the impact like Gretchen Morgenson’s These Are the Plunderers and Megan Greenwell’s Bad Company. I wrote a book in 2009 called the Buyout of America warning about their destructive practices when they were just becoming the behemoths they are today. Because they buy companies by having the companies they acquire take on big loans, private equity firms have a reputation for cutting costs at their companies by laying off more workers than competitors, raising prices and reducing customer service.\nDemocrats including President Obama and President Biden for years have called for the end of carried interest and done little so Trump is not setting a precedent.\nTrump during his first term did limit the carried interest tax break for when firms held companies only for three years or longer.\nPrivate equity firms have been jumping on the AI bandwagon for months so a deal in which private equity firms offered investment in AI data centers to keep carried interest the same would not have been much of a sacrifice, a skeptic said.\n“I think they are rebranding something they were already doing,” Jim Baker, executive director of the Private Equity Stakeholder advocacy group said.\nThe Blackstone Group in 2024 paid $16.1 billion for AirTrunk, a data center operator. The firm in January also agreed to buy the Potomac Energy Center gas plant in Virginia specifically to power data centers.\n“As a country, we face the prospect of having to double our power grid’s capacity over the next 12 to 13 years to keep up,” Blackstone said in an Oct. 31, 2024 report.\nKKR and Energy Capital Partners in October too announced a $50 billion strategic partnership to accelerate the development of data center and power generation for the expansion of artificial intelligence.","content_hash":"4f718d185689b280810c89b6e12aabc7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6296,"method_rank":0}

This isn't just a vacation, they say. The goal, in part, is to make tons of money, Aaron Luce, the leader of the weeklong retreat for day traders, tells the camera.\n\"This is a beautiful pool spot. We're all going to be chilling for the week when we make loads of money trading,\" Luce says in a YouTube video documenting the experience, which includes a montage of traders looking at candlestick charts and, intermittently, taking breaks and cannonballing into the pool.\nThis kind of retreat is a relatively new phenomenon, offered to traders looking for an edge amid the explosion of interest in the stock market since the pandemic.\nIn recent years, a cottage industry has taken root amid the hype for stock trading. Social media is rife with businesses offering courses, getaways, one-on-one coaching, and other services that claim to improve traders' performance and get them in the right mindset to turn a profit.\nAnd demand, evidently, is booming — in large part due to traders who are swinging to go full-time, desperate to improve, or, in some cases, are simply bored, sources in the space told Business Insider.\nThe industry offering these kinds of services to day traders swelled to around $1.68 billion in 2024, and is on track to grow 11% each year to hit $3.92 billion in 2033, according to one estimate from Business Research Insights. A separate analysis from Dataintelo Consulting estimated that the market was valued at around $2.5 billion in 2023, and is on track to more than double to $5.8 billion by 2032.\nGoogle search interest in \"Day trading courses\" is up 10% over the past year, according to data from the Google Trends analytics tool Glimpse. Searches for \"Trading retreat\" and \"Trading coach\" are up 26% and 69% over the past year, respectively, while interest for \"Trading therapist\" has skyrocketed 263%.\nOn Coursera, enrollment in online trading courses soared 213% in the five years leading up to 2024, according to data the online course provider shared with Business Insider.\nThe online trading platform Webull also says it's seen the number of users on its learning platform grow 37% over the last 3 years.\nInternational Day Trading Academy, a trading school that offers courses and an eight-day trading retreat in Bali, says interest in the retreat has exploded three or fourfold in the past year, according to Kelly Lowry, the general manager.\nAndrew Menaker, a psychologist and a trading coach who frequently works with retail traders, says he's also noticed a big push among the retail crowd to get in the right mindset for trading.\nThe number of people who have inquired about Menaker's coaching services has about doubled in the past year, he said, adding that the waitlist to nab an appointment with him can range from several weeks to several months.\nMenaker says some of his clients, who are willing to do just about anything to gain an edge, have said they spent upward of $10,000 on materials like indicators, charting packages, and online courses. Others have said they've spent money on things like cold plunges, heart biofeedback devices, brain wave devices, and even psychedelics.\nMenaker is skeptical of some of the businesses selling to day traders. The space has become flooded with hype and influencer marketing, he says, especially targeting new traders who are just learning the ropes.\n\"It's really a buyer-beware environment,\" he said.\nA trader's elusive dream\nMaking money day trading is hard.\nOne 2020 study found that 97% of traders who persisted for more than 300 days ended up losing money, after accounting for fees. Just 1% were able to make a profit, and it was often minuscule.\nStill, many are willing to keep trying.\nCameron Buchanan, the cofounder of International Day Trading Academy, told Business Insider he believes the heightened volatility is what's behind the boom in traders seeking these kinds of services.\nBig swings in the market are often ripe with opportunity to win (and lose) big, but navigating the intraday moves is not easy even for professional traders.\nMore people are also lured by the prospect of becoming full-time traders, a once-niche ambition that now offers the possibility of financial freedom and the ability to work from anywhere with an internet connection.\n\"People are sharing that life's stressful,\" Lowry said of some of the academy's clients. \"People come out of retreats and say, 'I've made a decision that I'm going to do this now.'\"\nDr. Reid Daitzman, a Connecticut-based psychologist who frequently works with day traders, says he's seen a 50% increase in traders wanting to work with him over the past year. He believes that a good chunk of his clients are deeply involved in the stock market and seek to improve their trading, partly because they've already lost a large sum of money, but also because many are bored.\n\"A lot of people just trade because they have too much time on their hands, literally, and they have nothing to do,\" he said, adding that some of his clients were recovering from substance addictions and picked up day trading in sobriety.\nMenaker, who consulted with traders on Wall Street prior to opening his own practice, believes the main way traders improve is by understanding themselves better. His work hinges on the idea that traders need to know their \"inner market\" — a nexus of hopes, dreams, fears, and memories that explain how traders respond to risk and opportunity.\nWhile he sees some value in trading education and some evidence-based tools, like HRV biofeedback, he believes most gadgets out there won't make a difference unless traders do the work to understand their own minds.\n\"People will never really get what they need, which is, 'How do I respond when I'm under pressure and how can I change that to act more in my own best interest?' That's really what the courses should be emphasizing more, in my opinion,\" he said.","content_hash":"cac19083f38fe707e09b100805919ffb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6296,"method_rank":0}

","published_at":"2025-08-09T10:30:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"The passage of new stablecoin legislation (the Genius Act) this summer has potentially opened the floodgates for an entirely new set of players -- including banks, retailers, fintech companies, and Silicon Valley tech giants -- to get into the stablecoin mix.\nAlthough it's unlikely these new entrants will be able to make much of a dent this year, a lot could change next year. Here's what to look for and what names to watch in 2026.\nThe five most popular stablecoins\nAccording to the latest Motley Fool stablecoin research, just a handful of stablecoins account for nearly 95% of the market cap of the stablecoin industry. The two clear leaders, of course, are Tether(CRYPTO: USDT) and USDC(CRYPTO: USDC). Tether has a market cap of about $164 billion, while USDC has a market cap of roughly $65 billion (as of Aug. 6). Nobody else even comes close.\nAfter Tether and USDC come three smaller stablecoin issuers. Ethena USDe(CRYPTO: USDE) has a market cap of $9.6 billion (CRYPTO: DAI), Dai has a market cap of $5.4 billion, and World Liberty Financial USD(CRYPTO: USD1) has a market cap of $2.2 billion.\nBoth Ethena USDe and Dai are used as part of sophisticated decentralized finance (DeFi) strategies, and probably have little appeal for the typical buy-and-hold investor. However, if you are familiar with strategies such as yield farming, they may be of potential interest.\nThe really interesting name here is World Liberty Financial USD, which is the official stablecoin of World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's crypto venture. The stablecoin launched earlier this year, and already ranks as one of the top five stablecoins in the world.\nA possible change to the top five?\nIf there is a shakeup in the stablecoin rankings next year, it is likely to include Ethena USDe, Dai, and World Liberty Financial USD. The two top spots of Tether and USDC are unlikely to change. Perhaps USDC will gain some market share at the expense of Tether, but it's hard to see any major changes here.\nHowever, there's reason to think that Ethena USDe and Dai will slip down the rankings. That's primarily due to one key reason: They may not comply with the Genius Act. In other words, they may no longer meet U.S. regulatory requirements. According to the Genius Act legislation, all stablecoin issuers must maintain a 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar at all times, and back their stablecoins with either cash or cash equivalents.\nThe main reason Ethena USDe and Dai have been so successful in the past is because they have used a soft peg to the dollar. Instead of backing everything with cash or equivalents like U.S. Treasuries, they also use a mix of cryptocurrencies and blockchain smart contracts. So the new stablecoin legislation may entail a substantial rethink of their operations if they plan to do business in the U.S.\nAnother stablecoin that might slip down the rankings is World Liberty Financial USD. From my perspective, this stablecoin is primarily used to promote the business interests of World Liberty Financial and various Trump-backed crypto ventures. It has very little appeal for the average investor. Of course, if you were an investor in the Official Trump meme coin, then I can understand the potential allure of owning a Trump-affiliated stablecoin. But it's not for me.\nWho's moving up the rankings?\nSo, if a few top stablecoins are likely dropping down the rankings next year, which stablecoins are on the ascent? Two that stand out for me are PayPal USD(CRYPTO: PYUSD), the official stablecoin of PayPal, and Ripple USD(CRYPTO: RLUSD), the official stablecoin of Ripple and its crypto token XRP(CRYPTO: XRP).\nBoth currently rank among the top 10 stablecoins in terms of market cap, according to stablecoin research from The Motley Fool. Both have strong brand-name appeal for crypto investors. Both have demonstrated utility. And, best of all, both are from U.S. stablecoin issuers (both PayPal and Ripple are based in California).\nI really can't see any foreign stablecoins rapidly making their way up the list next year. It may sound odd at first, but foreign entities can and do issue dollar-pegged stablecoins. The sixth-largest stablecoin in the world, First Digital USD(CRYPTO: FDUSD) is actually from a Hong Kong issuer.\nPotential wild card factors\nWhere things get really interesting is when you consider the types of companies that might be entering the stablecoin fray during the next 12 months. Both Amazon and Walmart are reported to be pursuing stablecoins of their own. Tech giant Meta Platforms also may launch a stablecoin. Apple might as well.\nThese all rank among the biggest companies in the world, and it's easy to see how they could make an immediate impact. Imagine, for example, if Amazon told its customers, \"Hey, we'll offer you a 3% price discount if you use our stablecoin instead of your credit card.\" Would you take them up on that offer? I would.\nAnd that's what leads me to think that the list of the top stablecoin issuers might look very different next year. The potential use cases for stablecoins are just getting started.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tether right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Tether, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Tether wasn’t one of them.

That was up 1,000 basis points from a year ago, he said, and was the highest level in RXO history.\nNot surprisingly, when phone lines were open to questions from analysts, one of the first was about the ongoing trend of LTL being a growing share of the RXO business.\nWilkerson said the change grows out of “the relationships we have on the truckload side. These are customers who have been with us a really long time, and they’re large customers, and they come to us and they say, LTL is a small piece of our overall transportation spend. I’m working with a few of the national players, but I’m having to go into different platforms, and I’m having to look for claims, lost shipments, damages, all of those things.”\nFamiliarity with RXO platform a key plus\nBut Wilkerson said since these customers are familiar with RXO and in particular its online platform RXO Connect, they see that as a logical step to move some of their LTL business–which might be a small percent of their overall freight spend–onto that platform.\n“They think if we can put everything on RXO Connect and now we can start capitalizing on some of the capacity from the regional players as well, this can be something that gives us better visibility,” he said.\nWilkerson also drove home the message that the latest numbers are not an aberration. “LTL is going to be part of our growth story for a long time,” he said. “We’re just getting started.\nHe reviewed the company’s data. LTL volume recently had been just about 10% of overall brokerage volume. It’s now more than 30%. “I want that volume to get up over 50%,” he said.\nWhat he described as the inherent stability of LTL relative to truckload “adds to margins.” Gross profit per load, according to Wilkerson, “doesn’t have the volatility that truckload does. So it’s good stable EBITDA for us as a book of business.”\nWilkerson brought in an unusual benchmark for the LTL business: the price of a candy bar. Snickers, in particular.\nThe Snickers analogy\nAn analyst noted that despite the excitement about LTL, its gross profit per load has moved down slightly in recent months, according to a table in RXO’s presentation. The size of the gross profit per load was not disclosed, but the graphic on its movement showed LTL brokerage volume at RXO soaring and gross profit moving down slightly in the last two quarters.\n“I don’t think you can walk outside of your office in New York and buy a Snickers bar for how little gross profit per load is down whenever you look at it sequentially,” Wilkerson said.\n(The author of this article, not having bought a Snickers bar in New York recently despite residing a train ride away from Manhattan, is unaware of how much it costs. But you can buy a box of 40 of them on Amazon for $51.90 before any shipping or taxes. You can also do the math).\nBut that is a positive, Wilkerson said. “That’s the beauty of the LTL business,” he said. The RXO chart showing little change in the gross profit per load shows that “it is very, very stable on what it does.”\nSome of the RXO LTL business that it has recently onboarded, Wilkerson said, has been for relatively short length of haul distances. “So that means your revenue per load comes down, and therefore the gross profit per load is a little bit lower on those, but it’s still a good margin percentage,” he said. “It’s highly automated and accretive.”\nAmong other key points made on the call:\n–With the completion of merging the technologies of both RXO and the legacy Coyote Logistics brokerage–acquired by RXO in the third quarter of last year–efficiencies are starting to develop in many areas. Weisfeld said the company’s “buy rate”–what it pays to secure capacity–has improved by about 30 to 50 basis points “in a period where rates were inflationary. So that yield is a significant cost avoidance.”\n–Truckload brokerage volume declined 12% year on year, Wilkerson said. But he said truckload gross margin was 14.4% in the quarter, which was above the midpoint of the company’s projections. Gross profit per load in truckload was up 7% sequentially, which Wilkerson said was the strongest sequential increase at RXO in three years. It is expected to rise in the third quarter as well. Technology enhancements and the productivity gains that go along with that are the primary drivers of that improvement, he added.\nWeisfeld said a slowdown in automotive activity accounted for about 25% of the decline in truckload brokerage volume. “RXO is uniquely exposed to the current automotive headwinds,” he said.\n–The split between contract and spot business at RXO was 73% for contract and 27% for spot. “We continue to operate in a prolonged soft freight environment with minimal spot opportunities,” Weisfeld said.","content_hash":"e3769609003af8eb9cb528dcdcd28eae","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6218,"method_rank":0}

Long-term Treasury yields and the interest rate on inflation-protected bonds rose slightly in the hours after Miran's nomination was announced. Expectations of a quarter-point cut at the Fed's September and December meetings changed little.\nTo Miran, the current set-up at the Fed has merely excused what he regards as poor performance.\n\"Accountability has been absent...Poor policy decisions do not necessarily result in consequences for Fed leadership,\" Miran wrote with co-author Dan Katz, currently the chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, citing episodes including the recent outbreak of inflation, the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, and the asset purchases first conducted more than a decade ago under former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke. A response to a deep global financial crisis and the fact that the economy was ailing despite interest rates cut to near zero, Miran said the bond buying, meant to hold down long-term interest rates and now a staple tool among global central banks for certain crisis conditions, was wrong because it \"distorted the allocation of credit.\"\nA SINGLE VOICE\nTrump nominated Miran on Thursday to fill a seat vacated unexpectedly by Adriana Kugler, who leaves the Fed on Friday to return to a teaching post at Georgetown University.\nThe most fundamental changes Miran proposed would take an act of Congress, and are considered unlikely. The current system, solidified in the 1930s, was meant to limit White House influence over interest rates, and some key Republicans have spoken up for that principle in the face of Trump's attacks on current Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\nEven for internal budgeting or staffing reforms, Miran for the moment would be just a single voice on a seven-member board and, for interest rate decisions, a single voice on a 12-vote policy committee that includes five voting members from among the Reserve Bank presidents.\nBut with the potential to be appointed to a full 14-year term next year, or even be elevated to the chair, Miran, if confirmed by the Senate, also becomes the most direct line into the Fed for the current Trump administration, which has been pressing for steep rate cuts and pressuring Powell to resign before his term as the top policymaker ends in May.\nHis views on presidential authority over the Fed could therefore take on new importance, particularly if others among the current board members, including three Biden-era appointees, resign and give Trump more openings to fill. Powell's seat would be a fourth, unless he opts to remain on the board until 2028 after his term as chair ends in May.\nIf the aim is to acquire four seats on the board and put reforms into place \"it is skiing further down that slope\" of the Fed losing its independence from the executive branch, said Ellen Meade, a former top adviser to the Fed's board and now a research professor at Duke University. \"They want a mouthpiece. They want to stir things up. And that is concerning.\"\nMiran's report touches on issues familiar in conservative critiques of the central bank, and in some cases are being addressed already by the Fed itself.\nA new framework for managing inflation adopted in 2020, criticized by Miran for its \"hubris,\" quickly became passe when inflation rose during the pandemic and is likely to be discarded in an upcoming strategy revision.\nFed Governor Christopher Waller, also in the running as a possible next chair, has been internally critical of Reserve Bank presidents straying into political and social commentary, and worked with Powell on plans to curb staffing, which is due to fall 10%.\nBut all of that stops short of what Miran envisions, including stripping the Fed of its autonomous budget authority and making that part of the congressional appropriations process.\nAnd while lamenting \"highly political personnel\" moving freely between the White House and the Fed's Eccles Building in a journey he is now poised to take, Miran wrote there was no point pretending there were no politics at the Fed. \"Political motivations will always exist,\" he said. The key is \"to provide mechanisms to block them from unduly affecting policy.\"\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Andrea Ricci)","content_hash":"53381eb9b6b69bc889c2b666324d2cd3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6163,"method_rank":0}

CEO from taking some bold steps to ensure sustainable growth on a going-forward basis.\n“As we have consistently said, we are not trying to manage our business quarter-to-quarter. We had a solid first half of the year with our brands fueling strong gross profit and cash flow. The current environment in the second half is concerning, and we see that clearly reflected in retail order books,” Crocs CEO Andrews Rees said. “We strongly believe this is a time to make bold decisions for the future to sustain and advance our durable cash flow model. As a result, we have chosen to amplify certain measures in the second half of the year to protect brand health and profitability.”\nRees told investors in a conference call on Thursday after the company posted second quarter results that a portion of the consumer base is no longer going to stores, and that has impacted the shoe firm’s wholesale business. Not only are order books down for the start of the second half, but the lower-end consumer is also making fewer trips to the firm’s outlet stores, he said. The decline in orders has the company, in part, expecting a 9 percent to 11 percent decrease in third quarter revenue. Rees emphasized that the projection “embeds conservative assumptions around returns of cancelations.” He also said the company is losing some shelf space to athletic brands, but is also working on picking up shelf space in the summer with sandals.\nDespite that early trend, he said there’s also been strong trajectory in the sandal business, which is expected to grow next year, helped by new product innovation on clogs slated for the fourth quarter. And the firm is growing its personalization business, “both in Jibbitz and expanding that beyond Jibbitz into a broader personalization offer,” Rees said.\nCrocs last week opened its new Icon store at 543 Broadway in the SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan. The concept, which allows for hosting shopping events, also incorporates two areas for personalization options.\nFor the Crocs brand, he said the company, in addition to adjusting its forward receipts, has pulled back on promotional activity across the direct channels since May.\n“While this has and will continue to impact our top line, we see this as an opportunity to drive margin dollars over time, support continued cash flow generation and tightened brand control,” Rees said.\nFor the Hey Dude brand, the company accelerated its actions in the channel to support a clean and refreshed marketplace. “This has resulted in us choosing to take back additional aged inventory and ensure more of our partners are reset with our current product lines,” he said.\nThose actions will create further headwinds to sales volume over the next several quarters. Rees said the company has taken additional measures that has resulted in $50 million of cost savings as it continues to identify further cost-saving opportunities. The company is also planning its business conservatively by “proactively pulling back on receipts across both brands for the second half, primarily in the U.S. without losing sight of the bigger picture,” he said.\nRees said the company has also accelerated its international business, which has grown from 38 percent of Crocs brand sales in 2022 to 52 percent in the second quarter ended June 30. Other initiatives include diversification in its clog offerings, the development of a strong sandals business and the growth of its personalization category, one that includes its Jibbitz charms.\n“Collectively, this diversification should fuel durable long-term growth for years to come,” Rees said.\nRees also said the company remains “laser-focused on its digital-led social-first marketing playbook as this is a key ingredient in sustaining brand heat.” In addition to bringing back franchise favorites, he said the company continues to lean into social commerce as consumers are starting and ending their shopping journeys on social media platforms.\n“During the quarter, Crocs remained the No. 1 footwear brand on TikTok shop in the U.S.,” Rees said, adding that a TikTok U.K. platform was recently launched, “where results have been strong out of the gate.”\nLooking ahead, Rees said the plan is to “continue to expand social commerce and live streaming platforms globally, and we expect this to drive new growth opportunities.”\nAs for tariffs and its impact, Rees said the company can “over the medium term mitigate” the impact of tariffs. That will come from cost savings in the supply chain, negotiations with factories and some price adjustments, he said.\nFor the second quarter the net loss was $492.3 million, or $8.82 a diluted share, against net income of $228.9 million, or $3.77, in the same year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 3.4 percent to $1.15 billion from $1.11 billion. Inventories were higher at $405 million, or up 7.4 percent, versus $377 million last year. That increase reflects in part higher tariff costs.\nStill a drag on operations is the Hey Dude brand, which continues to show signs of struggle. Rees said over the past 12 months the company has been focused on speaking to a new female consumer, while not losing sight of its core customers. The company is also working on stabilizing the North American market as it lays the groundwork for international growth. “We believe the Hey dude potential and its community are much greater than the size of the business today, and we’re confident that the critical steps we are taking will fuel the potential in the future,” Rees said.\nNeedham analyst Tom Nikic said on Thursday that while there was second quarter improvement for the Hey Dude brand, he isn’t so sure the brand will be profitable in either the second half or in 2026. That’s due in part to tariffs and an accelerated cleanup of the wholesale channel, while a pullback in performance marketing could hurt direct-to-consumer revenues, the analyst said.\nCrocs said in December 2021 that it was acquiring the privately owned Hey Dude footwear brand, which had a deal value of $2.5 billion. The transaction was completed in February 2022.","content_hash":"06b8ae0ba71b2804b9abd7d1ccdd7767","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6143,"method_rank":0}

First documented during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the term had a renaissance in the 2000s when Leonard Lauder, former chairman of makeup brand Estée Lauder, noticed a spike in sales after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\"The lipstick effect means basically, buying yourself small treats when you're under financial pressure,\" John Stevenson, retail analyst at Peel Hunt, told CNBC Tuesday.\n\"You can't afford a new dress or outfit, but you can always get a new lipstick. You can't afford to get a new sofa, but you can get a throw or some cushions. You can't redecorate the house, but you can get a new tablecloth,\" he said, noting this was why the homewares retail category is \"much more resilient than people imagine.\"\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, and a re-evaluation of personal wellbeing and what makes for an enriching and memorable life, has spurred the trend of treatonomics with consumers willing to make everyday sacrifices in order to have \"experiences,\" particularly one-off events such as spending $200 or more for a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert or the Oasis reunion tour.\n\"Treatonomics is almost another step further [than the lipstick effect] where you are cutting back on on everyday living costs, you're cutting back on basics, maybe you're buying more own brands in the supermarket, but by the same token, you'll go and do an Oasis concert for the weekend and spend £500-£1000 (up to $1330),\" Stevenson said.\nWhat is driving 'Treatonomics'?\nEconomists agree that the treatonomics trend has been able to flourish in an era of economic uncertainty and shaky consumer confidence.\n\"This rise of 'Treatonomics' — also called 'Little Treat Culture' by Gen Z on TikTok — is less about 'guilty pleasures' and instead about injecting moments of guilt-free joy into life,\" Meredith Smith, senior director at retail analysis firm Kantar told CNBC Tuesday.\n\"It's like the 'Lipstick Effect' on steroids, because consumers have this heightened sense of uncertainty coupled with more options and access than ever before to turn life's everyday decisions into an opportunity for a treat. As a result, people are romanticising their water intake, how they dress and decorate their homes, buying themselves treats as a 'mental health' boost and more – all to inject joy into fraught times.\"\nSmith said life's traditional milestones, such as marriage, home ownership, workplace achievement and retirement, looked different now for \"nearly every living generation\" and were being reinvented or disappearing, \"out of desire or because they're no longer attainable.\"\nThat has prompted a shift from being able to celebrate 'milestones' to celebrating more 'inch-stones,' resulting in this rapid rise of treatonomics.\n\"For example — for those who can't afford a home before 40, treating has been a welcome respite and a way to express themselves in their environment when a milestone passes them by,\" Smith said.\n\"For those without a partner or children, instead of celebrating weddings and baby showers, they are throwing their energy into breakup parties, dog birthdays, high-effort wellbeing-driven treating routines and more. We've seen a rise in 'Resignation Parties' in China, 'Divorce Parties' in the U.S. and Europe, and people treating themselves to cakes or even diamonds after a breakup or when they don't get a promotion at work,\" he noted.\nOn a similar note, Millennials and Gen Z have turned to 'Kidulting' – enjoying adult versions of joys from childhood -- which has \"catapulted LEGO's adult offering, seeing some spend up to $1,000 on kits,\" Smith added.\nConsumer confidence underlies the mood\nIn the U.K., GfK's Consumer Confidence Index measures a range of consumer attitudes, including forward expectations of the general economic situation and households' financial positions, and views on making major household purchases. It fell to -19 in July 2025, down by one point from June.\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., consumer confidence saw a slight increase in July. Overall, however, consumer confidence levels remain subdued \"below last year's heady levels,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of Global Indicators at The Conference Board, which produces the consumer confidence data, noted in a statement last week.\nThat lingering pessimism feeds into the treatonomics trend, economists say, meaning that more affordable and perhaps more gratifying purchases and experiences, will remain attractive.\nKantar's Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, a measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding economic policy at a global level, \"has declared the current era as one of 'Great Uncertainty', relative to the last 40 years. Life feels uncertain, with no light at the end of the tunnel – yet,\" Smith said.\nThe volatility and uncertainty we are experiencing are not likely to dissipate for the next five to eight years, Kantar predicts.\n\"This gives us a strong indication that treatonomics will persist for at least another three to five years – though we can expect to see trends in 'Little Treat Culture' to move faster and become more fragmented by geography and cultural niches. This is a challenge for brands, who will need to be agile and attuned to how these micro-trends are developing.\"","content_hash":"7e74e84a1e870aed8cc43fe6b2f791aa","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6140,"method_rank":0}

Unlike traditional ink-based printing, thermal printers use heat to create images on specially treated label surfaces.\nDirect thermal labels react to heat from the printer's thermal head, turning black in the heated areas to form text or barcodes.\nThis method does not require ink, toner or ribbons, making it highly cost-effective for short-term applications such as shipping labels or receipts. However, direct thermal labels are sensitive to heat and light, which can cause them to fade over time.\nThermal transfer labels, by contrast, use a heated ribbon to transfer ink onto the label surface, resulting in a more durable image. These labels are ideal for long-term use, especially in outdoor or industrial settings where labels must withstand exposure to chemicals, moisture, or extreme temperatures.\nThermal transfer printing offers a broader range of materials, including polyester and polypropylene, which are particularly suited to asset tagging or high-durability signage.\nUnderstanding the difference between direct thermal and thermal transfer labels is key to choosing the right solution for a particular application. Each has distinct advantages, depending on the required lifespan, environmental exposure, and budget.\nKey advantages of using thermal labels\nThe primary appeal of thermal labels lies in their simplicity and reliability. With fewer moving parts and no ink cartridges to replace, thermal printers require less maintenance than conventional alternatives.\nThis results in lower operating costs and reduced downtime—critical factors for businesses with high-volume labelling needs.\nThermal labels also provide crisp, high-resolution printing, which is essential for barcode clarity. Poorly printed barcodes can lead to scanning errors and costly delays in the supply chain. With thermal printing, the sharpness and consistency of the label image ensures accurate scanning and seamless integration into inventory systems.\nAnother significant benefit is speed. Thermal printers are designed for rapid, on-demand label creation, making them suitable for dynamic work environments where efficiency matters.\nWhether printing thousands of shipping labels in an e-commerce warehouse or individual patient wristbands in a hospital, thermal labels meet the need for fast turnaround without compromising quality.\nSustainability is an emerging factor in labelling decisions, and thermal labels can support environmentally conscious operations. Direct thermal printing reduces waste by eliminating the need for ink and ribbons, while many thermal label materials are now recyclable or produced from responsibly sourced paper.\nSome suppliers also offer BPA-free options, catering to growing consumer and regulatory concerns.\nCommon uses and applications across industries\nThermal labels have found widespread adoption across multiple sectors due to their versatility and performance. In retail, they are frequently used for shelf-edge labels, pricing, and product identification.\nTheir compatibility with barcode scanning systems helps streamline inventory control and point-of-sale transactions.\nIn logistics and transportation, thermal shipping labels are indispensable. Direct thermal labels are often used for parcels and courier packages, while thermal transfer labels are preferred for long-haul freight and pallet tagging due to their enhanced durability.\nHealthcare is another area where thermal labels play a vital role. Hospitals and laboratories use them for patient wristbands, specimen tracking, and medication labelling. The clear print quality and resistance to smudging or fading help reduce errors and ensure safety.\nManufacturing and warehousing operations benefit from thermal transfer labels that can withstand exposure to dust, chemicals, and abrasions. These labels are often used for asset tracking, bin labelling, and compliance marking. Given their resilience, they are ideal for harsh environments where paper-based alternatives would quickly degrade.\nEven in office settings, thermal labels offer practical solutions for file organisation, mailing, and archiving. Their ease of use, especially with compact desktop printers, has made them popular in both home and professional environments.\nThe takeaway\nFrom boosting productivity to ensuring reliable data capture, thermal labels provide an enduring solution for labelling across a wide range of industries.\nAs technology continues to evolve, the core advantages of thermal labels—speed, clarity, and cost-efficiency—remain highly relevant.\nFor businesses seeking to optimise operations and reduce overheads, investing in the right thermal label system can deliver significant long-term benefits.\n\"Why more businesses are switching to thermal labels\" was originally created and published by Packaging Gateway, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

President Donald Trump's chaotic attempts at implementing these sweeping new import taxes have yanked the market's attention around repeatedly this year.\nCrypto holders, long accustomed to wild price swings but now under new pressure, suddenly find themselves forced to confront trade policy in ways that they never had to before. Are these tariffs killing the crypto bull market, or merely adding even more raucous noise to an already rowdy asset class?\nTrump's tariff turbulence taunts the tenacious\nThe first salvo of the tariff saga landed on April 2 when the White House signaled \"Liberation Day\" duties on 70 of the U.S.'s major trading partners; Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) slipped roughly 3.1% while the S&P 500 lost 1.8% that day.\nThe sell-off looked dramatic on crypto charts, yet by April 4 Bitcoin was already clawing back ground, underscoring how quickly traders dismiss policy headlines. Now, it's up by 21% during the past six months.\nSo, for long-term-oriented crypto investors who simply ignored the news and held steady, the impact was minimal, and those who took advantage and bought the dip ended up slightly better off than those who remained on the sidelines waiting for the uncertainty to pass.\nStill, the threat of more tariffs being imposed, as well as the potential positive catalysts of trade deals being signed, slammed sentiment in the markets, including crypto, from bullish to bearish and back again, hampering investors and businesses attempting to develop long-term plans.\nFast-forward to this week, when another tariff wave is set to hit on Aug. 7, lifting the average U.S. import tax rate to 18.3%, the highest since the 1930s. Bitcoin briefly fell to $114,000 before rebounding, with Ethereum(CRYPTO: ETH) mirroring that pattern. The net result thus looks to be basically the same as before, with a lot more volatility, minimal ability to chart a sensible course forward, but no structural break in the uptrend.\nThat dynamic may be fragile if the uncertainty continues, however.\nU.S. Bitcoin miners import most of their mining hardware from China, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. A tariff as high as 36% on those machines (as part of the tariffs on those countries) would raise the capital expenditure needs of miners, thereby lengthening the time it takes for miners to recoup their investment. But if miners have less supply to offload to the market because they're stingy with investments, that would probably force the price of Bitcoin higher at a faster pace, not lower.\nAt the same time, crypto exchanges have zero tariff exposure, and protocol economics are untouched. In short, this seems to be a case where headline-related risks are greater than real balance sheet risks.\nSentiment spillover is by far the biggest problem here\nWhere tariffs bite hardest is investors' psychology.\nPersistent policy uncertainty could shave away real investment by 2026, with Trump's trade salvos as a top culprit. In short, businesses, similarly to Bitcoin miners, will be loath to invest until they can develop a coherent view of the near future, and that also means they will be hesitant to take risks. And when risk appetite retreats, crypto usually feels the draft.\nIn the 48 hours after the latest tariff schedule was reported, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw nearly $1 billion in outflows, their worst two-day stretch since launch. Of course, those outflows will likely be outmatched by even larger inflows once the immediate shock of an impromptu policy change fades. After all, so far, there is not any firm evidence that Trump's tariffs are actually affecting cryptocurrencies in any material way, as crypto tokens can move freely across international borders and aren't covered by the administration's trade policies anyway.\nTherefore, the tariffs do not change crypto's core math, at least not right now as they are currently envisioned and implemented.\nBitcoin's next halving is expected in April 2028, and it will again cut new supply in half. Ethereum's technology platform won't stop becoming more sophisticated in creating and administering smart contracts, nor will tariffs affect its status as the home of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the blockchain. Put differently, all of those fundamental properties have nothing to do with steel quotas or French wine duties.\nFor investors, that means treating tariff-driven dips in crypto the same way one treats any macro wobble. They're opportunities to build up your positions intended for multiyear holding horizons.\nAssuming tariffs stay elevated, capital may remain skittish, and prices may grind sideways or even lower. Widespread panic is always a possibility if there's a major change that is seen as detrimental.\nNonetheless, history favors disciplined buyers when fear overrides fundamentals, and now is the time to stay especially cool-headed.\nShould you buy stock in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

The company goes on to say, \"Organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms before turning to buy ours.\"\nOn its earnings calls, management regularly tells stories of failures in the government to develop proprietary software, leading to agencies embracing Palantir. Its platform has become a favorite in the Trump administration, used by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and other agencies.\nAs its stock soared, that statement at the top has become more of a curiosity. Palantir was the best-performing stock on the S&P 500 last year and is the top performer so far this year as well. Typically, success attracts competition, and while it does face some, it seems to be less of a factor than it should be. Let's look at two potential reasons.\nA desire to avoid controversy\nThese days, Palantir is known for its soaring stock price, but the company also has a long history of courting controversy because it has enabled government surveillance that earned it criticism in some corners.\nFor example, earlier this year, 13 former employees signed a letter condemning the company for contracting with ICE in order to provide \"near real-time visibility\" into how migrants move across the country.\nOther criticism has focused on privacy concerns, including what some cite as its creation of a sort of digital ID on Americans. The Trump administration chose it to help federal agencies share information by putting a host of personal data on its platform. Ahead of the company's initial public offering in 2020, Amnesty International said Palantir was failing in its responsibility to protect human rights.\nBig tech companies like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon already compete with it in some capacity and have the wherewithal to develop similar analytics platforms. But a desire to avoid the controversy that has swirled around Palantir may be restraining them so far.\nAll three of those big tech companies have huge consumer-facing businesses and would be loath to jeopardize those for a much smaller prize. Amazon, for example, was forced to discontinue some features of its Rekognition facial recognition technology and banned police use of the technology. Alphabet's Google is also no stranger to controversy around data privacy, given its extensive ad targeting and data sharing.\nWith these companies already facing antitrust threats, avoiding controversy around data privacy and surveillance is probably a smart move.\nPalantir is still (relatively) small\nCompanies often attract competition as they grow, but Palantir's market cap, which is now above $400 billion, belies the actual size of the business.\nIt just reported its first quarter of $1 billion in revenue and is now targeting slightly more than $4 billion. That's a sizable business, but it's not enough to attract competition from the likes of Alphabet, Microsoft, or Amazon, which are on track to generate roughly $1.5 trillion in combined revenue this year.\nAnd since the company primarily competes with the internal software development efforts of its customers rather than other established software companies, that also works to its advantage: It's not taking market share from a competitor that will respond to the threat.\nIts biggest test is coming\nPalantir just reported another blockbuster quarter with revenue up 48% and an operating margin of 27% as measured by generally accepted accounting principles. And its guidance calls for that momentum to continue.\nThose kinds of results attract attention, and as Palantir grows, it's likely to receive more competition from larger tech companies. It may have to reach $5 billion or even $10 billion a quarter in revenue, but it will eventually hit a tipping point.\nThat's when we may discover if its technology is superior enough to withstand any challenges from big tech. Management seems to believe that's the case, but so far, Palantir has benefited from a relatively open playing field.\nDo the experts think Palantir Technologies is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

He noted that when rates even got close to 6%, as they did last fall, “it spiked a lot of buying frenzy and then once rates went closer to seven, the buying stopped.”\nThe problem is that a lot of the buyers are sellers and the rate differential from 3% or 4% to 7% “is causing sellers to hang onto their precious interest rate like Gollum in ‘Lord of the Rings,'” he said. That clogs up the market.\nConsider Tiny Houses\nAnother possible angle for those seeking affordability is tiny homes. “Tiny houses can be so much less expensive that it helps with young people purchasing because there’s less land needed and the cost of the structure is more affordable,” Lichtenstein said. “That could get the market moving.”\nWhile some states and cities have good zoning for these small homes, others are still dragging their heels, and it may take legislation pushes to facilitate that change.\nBoomer Downsizing\nAs baby boomers continue to downsize in their elder years or even move into assisted living, Lichtenstein believes that will start to free up homes. However, that could still take another six to seven years, as many boomers are still in their early 60s.\nSubsidies and Tax Credits\nMost of the changes mentioned above will be slow to have an impact. While government subsidies and tax credits may not change the overall affordability of homes generally, they do help close the gap for middle-class buyers, according to Paul Epperley, president at Greater Fort Worth Association of Realtors.\nDown payment assistance and first-time homebuyer tax credits are especially helpful, he explained, since down payments are typically the most considerable financial burden or hurdle for those who are renting. “A grant to help cover a percentage of the down payment can get more people into their first home and first-time homebuyer tax credits also provide financial relief after the purchase.”\nAn ‘OBBB’ Tax Credit\nEpperley pointed out that one of the most immediate impacts of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) is the restoration and extension of the mortgage insurance premium deduction, “a major benefit for first-time and low-down-payment homebuyers.”\nMany buyers can only put down less than 20%, triggering private mortgage insurance (PMI), which can cost between $1,500 and $3,000 annually, Epperley explained. “By making these costs tax-deductible, the financial burden of homeownership is reduced and saves buyers potentially $2,000 or more each year.”\nA Trifecta of Change\nAccording to Jacob Naig, a licensed real estate agent, investor, contractor and owner of WeBuyHousesinDesMoines, the market needs “a three front correction: reform of zoning, the search for construction efficiencies and interest rate stabilization.” He said there is no “silver bullet” to move affordability without moving the others.\nDepending on the state or locality, policy changes allowing for smaller lot sizes, duplexes and accessory dwelling units by right, could “immediately expand infill options without the need for new streets or schools,” Naig said.\nIncentives for Builders and Developers\nAnother way to improve the market would be to offer incentives for builders and developers by expediting approval, decreasing or postponing impact fees and providing for tax incentives for the construction of homes below $300,000, Naig said.\nNaig suggested that developers feel prohibited from building affordable homes due to a variety of high prices, including land prices, fees, code-compliance costs and labor shortages, which are all pushing break-even pricing above what middle-income buyers can afford. “Builders respond to economics. Shift the economics,” he said.\nProperty Tax Reforms\nWhile every state has different approaches to property taxes, in some states, those taxes are exorbitant, according to Epperley. In Texas, for example, he said, “property taxes are one of the most significant pain points and appraisal values can jump year over year.” Property tax reform that caps or reduces property tax growth in states with high taxes could make a big dent for homeowners.\nWage Increases\nA last way to make housing more affordable has little to do with the housing market at all, Naig suggested — that would be “to see consistent and meaningful wage increases above inflation.”\nHowever, he’s clear that won’t happen without significant policy changes around minimum wage, benefits and labor incentives for housing.\nOverall, it will take a variety of small changes, at the state and federal level, before some middle-class Americans can really call homebuying affordable again, and even then there’s no guarantee.","content_hash":"87ddbb130605d4eb57798838e497924d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5837,"method_rank":0}

My carrier, AT&T, charges a flat, daily rate of $12 per day for international cell use, similar to other providers. I incurred that daily charge each day I opted to use the international cell network instead of Wi-Fi to look up directions or restaurant hours.\nWhile many carriers typically charge a per-day fee or a \"hefty surcharge,\" some T-Mobile plans cover international roaming, said Tim Leffel, author of \"The World's Cheapest Destinations\" and \"A Better Life for Half the Price.\"\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHow will the end of the SAVE plan impact you?\nThis is the 'No. 1 reason' to buy the early boarding upgrade\nHow to avoid the 45.5% 'SALT torpedo'\nAs such, switching to T-Mobile as your cell provider may make financial sense for those who travel abroad often — especially those who don't rely on their phones for more than the occasional text or data usage during trips, he said.\n\"If this is your plan, awesome,\" Leffel said. \"You're ready to travel the world without missing a beat.\"\nThere are limitations, though.\nNot all T-Mobile plans cover international roaming charges. One longtime T-Mobile customer reportedly racked up $143,000 of charges during a 2023 trip to Switzerland because of international data roaming. (The company later reportedly withdrew those costs.)\nWhile its international plans generally include unlimited texts and an allotment of high-speed data when overseas, phone calls may come with an additional price tag. (One workaround: All calls made over Wi-Fi to the U.S., Mexico and Canada are free, according to T-Mobile's site.)\nT-Mobile plans also don't work in every country, so customers should be wary to avoid extra fees in such places, experts said.\nAdditionally, such plans may not be well-suited for digital nomads (they're not intended for extended use abroad, according to T-Mobile), or for heavy data users, Leffel said.\nCheck what your cell plan already offers, and compare costs and services before making any changes, Breyault said.\nUse an eSIM\nPeople who intend to use a lot of data away from Wi-Fi networks may be better off buying a SIM card, Breyault said.\nReplacing your phone's current SIM with an international one essentially turns your device into a local phone, according to the Federal Communications Commission.\nMany people can use a digital eSIM service today instead of replacing their phone's physical SIM card, experts said.\nIt's generally a cheaper option compared to many carriers' international phone packages, experts said. Pre-paid SIMs let travelers more easily manage their budgets, they said.\n\"Now you can just download an app and buy as much data as you need, generally $1 or less per day for usage spread out over a week or a month,\" Leffel said. \"If you run out of data, you just buy more instantly.\"\nHe recommends sticking with more established providers like Saily, GigSky or Airalo to be safe. They generally work anywhere in the world, he said.\nMany people opt for data-only SIM plans and save any calls or texts for Wi-Fi, he said.\nOne caveat: Travelers may need to \"unlock\" their phone for an eSIM to work, Breyault said. This would ensure the phone isn't locked to a particular carrier. In such cases, customers should reach out to their provider before traveling to ask if they can unlock the phone, he said.\nAlso, be aware that your phone number may temporarily switch to a local number when using a new SIM, experts said.\nUse Wi-Fi when possible\nOK, yes, this may sound obvious.\nBut there's no denying that leveraging free Wi-Fi — perhaps at a hotel, restaurant or otherwise — can save you money.\nYou can use Wi-Fi even when your phone is on Airplane mode, which ensures you won't get dinged with international roaming charges.\nExperts have some hacks to help limit your need for cellular data when away from Wi-Fi.\nAmong the top tips: Download an offline map on Google Maps before traveling. This will allow you to navigate an area via GPS even without internet. There are some drawbacks: It may be difficult to find details like the nearest museum or restaurant and their respective hours on the fly without internet, for example.\nDownload any helpful article PDFs or guidebooks ahead of time to limit your need for the internet while on the go, Leffel said.\nConnecting to public Wi-Fi networks may pose a digital security threat, so avoid conducting sensitive transactions like banking over Wi-Fi, Breyault said. In such cases, consider sticking with a cellular network, which is more secure, he said.\nI returned from another trip last week, to Namibia and Botswana, during which I adopted a strict policy of putting my phone on Airplane mode and, if necessary, occasionally using public Wi-Fi.\nMy extra cell fees? $0.","content_hash":"a24cfb29902359f7d44da27d13dbf6b7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5769,"method_rank":0}

The company just reported strong fiscal third quarter results and is still on track to meet its ambitious fiscal 2029 goal of $22 billion in combined automotive and IoT revenue. If the company’s current trajectory continues, it could be one of the best growth plays in the semiconductor industry. QCOM stock is down 3.8% year-to-date, compared to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index’s ($NASX) gain of 10.9%. Let’s find out if QCOM stock is a buy now on the dip.\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon Processors Are Leading the Charge\nIn its fiscal 2025 third quarter, the company reported adjusted revenue of $10.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 increased by 19% YoY, placing the company near the top of its guidance range. Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT), the company’s core chipset business, generated $9 billion in revenue, up 11% YoY, with Automotive (up 21%) and IoT (up 24%) showing particularly strong growth. Qualcomm’s licensing segment, Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL), generated $1.3 billion in revenue.\nQualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis continues to win contracts in the automotive industry, with 12 new designs introduced this quarter and 50 vehicle launches planned for fiscal 2025. Qualcomm and Xiaomi (XIACY) have signed a multi-year agreement to collaborate on smartphones. Xiaomi’s Snapdragon 8-series processors will power multiple generations of flagship devices in China and around the world, with shipment volumes increasing year after year. The Snapdragon 8 Elite continues to set the standard for mobile innovation, particularly in enabling the transition to AI-powered smartphones. Qualcomm reports that 124 AI smartphone designs have been shipped or announced, and AI adoption is accelerating.\nQualcomm’s push into PCs is only a year old, but it is already gaining traction. The Snapdragon X Series powers devices from Acer, Lenovo, Microsoft (MSFT), Dell (DELL), and Samsung, with over 100 designs planned for commercialization by 2026. Management also stated during the Q3 earnings call that the Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 platform continues to dominate AI-powered smart glasses. Qualcomm now supports 19 partner designs, including Meta’s (META) AI smart glasses, which have outperformed sales expectations, as well as the new Meta Oakley and expanded Ray-Ban lines.\nIn Q3, Qualcomm returned $2.8 billion in share repurchases and $967 million in dividends, aligning with its policy of returning 100% of free cash flow. CEO Cristiano Amon forecasts fiscal 2025 to be its second straight year of over 15% year-over-year growth in total QCT non-Apple revenues. Total revenue could increase by 12% with a 16% increase in earnings, in line with consensus estimates. Currently, QCOM stock trades at 12 times forward earnings, lower than its five-year historical average of 21x, making it a reasonable AI-led semiconductor stock to buy now.\nNew Growth Opportunities\nQualcomm is expanding into data centers with NPU-based AI inference accelerator cards and custom SoCs based on its Oryon CPU. Qualcomm’s planned acquisition of Alphawave IP Group, a leader in high-speed connectivity for data centers, AI, and networking, will strengthen the company's data center strategy. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.\nFurthermore, the company is in advanced discussions with a major hyperscaler, with potential revenue beginning in fiscal 2028. Qualcomm also signed a memorandum of understanding with HUMAIN to build advanced AI data centers in Saudi Arabia and beyond.\nQualcomm also sees personal AI devices like smart glasses, wearables, and earbuds as a separate growth category from smartphones. With strengths in connectivity, low-power AI processing, and sensors, the company anticipates becoming the preferred supplier in this space. In Physical AI, Qualcomm is focusing on robotics, automation, and humanoid robots with its automotive-grade silicon, sensing, and AI capabilities. The company estimates that this could be a $1 trillion total addressable market opportunity over the next decade. Financially, the company is in a strong position to invest in its growth strategies. At the end of the third quarter, it had $12.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities.\nWhat Do Analysts Say About QCOM Stock?\nOverall, Wall Street rates QCOM stock a “Moderate Buy.” Out of the 32 analysts that cover the stock, 15 rate it a “Strong Buy,” one suggests a “Moderate Buy,” 15 rate it a “Hold,” and one rates it a “Strong Sell.”\nIts average target price of $178.65 suggests an upside potential of 21% from current levels. Its high target price of $225 implies a potential upside of 53% in the next 12 months.\nThe Key Takeaway\nQualcomm is executing on all fronts. It is strengthening its mobile dominance, expanding into PCs, leading in XR, accelerating automotive and IoT growth, and creating a new revenue stream in data centers. Its aggressive push into AI-enabled devices and infrastructure positions it for long-term double-digit growth, and a strong capital return program continues to reward shareholders, making it an excellent semiconductor stock to grab now.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

More than 100 of those investments were made in China, including deals with once-obscure startups such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. — today China’s largest chipmaker — where he served on the board for a decade and a half.\nIn recent years, as US-China tensions escalated, Washington increasingly restricted Beijing’s access to advanced technology and placed tighter limits on the ability of US companies to do business there. And Tan’s efforts to distance himself from Chinese investments accelerated with his appointment at Intel Corp. (INTC) in March, when he agreed to divest his holdings there, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.\nThat hasn’t stopped US lawmakers — and, now, Donald Trump — from holding Tan’s past Chinese affiliations against him. The US president called the executive “highly conflicted” in a social media post and urged him to resign.\nIntel has said Tan and the board are “deeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests.” Late on Thursday, Tan said he’s got the full backing of the company’s board, responding for the first time to Trump. “We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts,” he said in a letter to staff posted on Intel’s website.\nHere’s what we know about Tan’s business dealings in China.\nWalden\nHe started work at a venture capital firm in the 1980s called Walden Ventures, where he helped create a spinoff named Walden International that focused on overseas opportunities.\nTan, a Mandarin speaker born in Malaysia, helped the company make investments all over East Asia, including China. He pushed some of Walden’s funds into the then-unfashionable area of chip investing. Most venture capitalists had moved away from the industry, figuring that it was impossible to challenge giants such as Intel with startup money. But Tan played those odds.\nToday, the executive is still chairman of Walden International. And he’s the founding managing partner at Walden Catalyst Ventures, which focuses on investments in the US, Europe and Israel. He also serves in that role at another venture fund, Celesta Global Capital.\nTan and Walden have faced scrutiny for China-related investments before. In 2023, the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party sent Walden a letter expressing concerns and seeking more information on the types of companies and amount of investments made there.\nSMIC\nHeadquartered in Shanghai, SMIC (0981.HK) was founded in 2000 as an early attempt to bring advanced chip-making to China.\nWalden International was one of the big investors when the startup raised $630 million from a group of venture firms in 2003. Tan was a director on SMIC’s board until 2018.\nThe Chinese company, whose customers at one time included Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), is attempting to break into the outsourced chip production business dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM, 2330.TW).\nIn 2020, that effort took a serious blow when the US Commerce Department put SMIC on the so-called entity list, citing ties with the Chinese military. That means businesses need licenses to supply the Chinese company with technology. The move effectively cut it off from crucial US vendors. Today, it’s a key partner to major Chinese sector players including Huawei Technologies Co.\nCadence\nTan stepped out of the venture world and joined the chip industry full-time when he became interim head of San Jose, California-based Cadence Design Systems Inc. in 2008. The executive, who had previously served on the board, went on to take the permanent CEO job the next year. He stayed in the role until 2021, when he transitioned to executive chairman, and is widely credited with restoring the company’s fortunes.\nIn late July of this year, the Department of Justice announced a plea deal that cost Cadence more than $100 million in fines. Employees at Cadence’s China unit allegedly hid the name of a customer — the National University of Defense Technology — from internal compliance in order to keep supplying it. That organization had been put on the Department of Commerce’s blacklist in 2015. The Chinese university was one of a group of supercomputer operators there that had conducted simulations of nuclear explosions, the DOJ said.\nCadence got a 20% reduction of the statutory maximum fine because of its partial cooperation with the investigation, according to the DOJ’s statement, which didn’t mention Tan.\nStill, his connection to the company was cited this week by US Senator Tom Cotton, who wrote to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary questioning whether what happened at Cadence under Tan’s tenure makes him fit for his current job.\nCurrent Status\nTan spent time on the boards of other Chinese companies, such as Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment Inc. But he doesn’t, according to Bloomberg data, currently serve on a board of any company based in that country.\nThough Walden International has invested in more than 100 Chinese companies over the years, that involvement has been scaled back, according to PitchBook. Walden International, Walden Catalyst Ventures and Celesta now just have stakes in a handful of companies based in China, including Hong Kong, the site shows.\n—With assistance from Jessica Sui, Debby Wu and Vlad Savov.\n(Updates with response from Tan in the fifth paragraph.)","content_hash":"67dfc8621c086b1e44cb73fbe1008ba3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5729,"method_rank":0}

However, the world sugar and cotton futures offer more value than the other softs, as prices are nowhere near historical highs. As the soft commodities are now in the second half of 2025, underperformance compared to the other commodity sectors continues, following a period in which softs led the asset class in 2023 and 2024. Commodity cyclicality is a powerful force. If sugar and cotton prices continue to reach lower lows, they could be excellent candidates for recovery, as low prices cause production and inventories to decline, leading to increased consumption and significant price bottoms.\nAt over 67 cents per pound in early August, cotton prices have risen marginally. However, we may have to wait until 2026 before cotton can break higher from its current bearish trend.\nA bearish trend since 2022\nCotton futures reached a multi-year $1.5595 per pound high in May 2022 when they ran out of upside steam.\nThe monthly continuous ICE cotton futures chart illustrates the bearish trend of lower highs and lower lows, reaching a low of 60.80 cents per pound in April 2025. At around 67 cents in August 2025, the fluffy fiber futures remain not far above the most recent low and in a bearish trend.\nSideways trading and consolidation in 2025\nActive month December ICE cotton futures have traded in a sideways range with a bearish bias in 2025.\nThe daily year-to-date December cotton futures chart highlights the 64.24 to 70.93 2025 trading range. While cotton has remained in a bearish trend since 2022, the agricultural commodity’s price has gone nowhere fast in 2025.\nCotton fundamentals\nIn its July World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates Report, the USDA told the cotton market the following:\nThe USDA increased its forecast for ending cotton inventories for 2025\/2026, while it left the upland price projection unchanged at 62 cents per pound. The report was bearish, suggesting that global cotton production was sufficient to meet the worldwide demand. Meanwhile, U.S. tariffs could alter cotton’s fundamentals as the trade barriers can distort prices. However, in early August 2025, cotton remains in a multi-year bearish trend with prices near the low end of the trading range.\nLevels to watch in the cotton futures market\nThe weekly cotton chart highlights the critical technical levels for the coming months and into 2026.\nThe weekly continuous contract chart shows that technical support is at the low of 60.80 from the week of March 31, 2025, with technical resistance at the high of 74.55 cents per pound from the week of September 23, 2024. While cotton remains within the current range, selling rallies above 70 cents and buying weakness towards the 60 cents level could be the optimal trading strategy.\nLook to buy for 2026 if cotton makes lower lows over the coming months- Commodity cyclicality\nAny price weakness that takes cotton to or below 60 cents per pound could be a great opportunity to load up on the fiber for spring 2026. Bullish cotton trends tend to reach annual highs in spring and early summer. The 2011 high of $2.1970 per pound occurred in May. Cotton reached annual highs above the 90 cents level in March 2014 and June 2018 and rallied to a high of $1.5595 in May 2022. Cotton’s seasonal highs tend to occur during the uncertainty of the annual crop years during the spring planting season.\nAt 60 cents or below, cotton offers value for the coming spring, as the cure for low cotton prices is those low prices themselves. At depressed levels, production tends to decline, inventories drop, and consumption increases, leading to price bottoms and subsequent price recoveries. After three years of bearish price action, with prices near the 60 cents level, the odds of a recovery developing next spring are high. Buying cotton futures for spring or summer 2026 delivery may be optimal, as the price limits downside potential and the level offers significant value.\nThere are no cotton ETF or ETN products, so the futures are the only option for investment or a trading position. Each ICE cotton futures contract contains 50,000 pounds of the fluffy fiber. At 67 cents per pound, the contract value is $33,500. The current original margin requirement of $1,771 per contract means that a market participant can control $33,000 worth of cotton futures with a 5.3% down payment. If equity falls below $1,610 per contract, the exchange requires maintenance margin payments.\nCommodity cyclicality could favor cotton in 2026 as the price has declined to a level that limits downside risk. Rallies over the past years show that the upside potential could be far higher than the current price level. From a risk-reward perspective, building a long position in cotton on a scale-down basis from the 65 cents per pound level could make sense for 2026.\nThe forward cotton curve shows that cotton for March and May 2026 delivery is trading at 68.36 and 69.63 cents, respectively. At lower levels, these contracts could offer value with limited risk for the coming year.\nOn the date of publication, Andrew Hecht did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Three years ago, it was trading at over $130 per share, but now it trades at less than three bucks a share, roughly 50 percent off its 52-week high. GameStop, meanwhile, trades roughly where it was a year ago but is off by over 30 percent from its most recent peak in mid-May.\nWhile yesterday’s meme stocks are likely to rekindle some interest periodically, they have been replaced by names like Opendoor, Krispy Kreme, GoPro, and Kohl’s, all of which have ridden the tsunami that can happen when social media and active traders mix.\nDavid Trainer, founder and president at New Constructs, a Nashville-based independent investment research firm, has said for years that meme stocks are all about a trader’s willingness to focus on hype and hope and ignore numbers.\nHe believes the numbers win out in the end, but he acknowledges that plenty of stocks overcome bad news to be back in the market’s good graces even while they are on a fiscal path to oblivion.\nA meme stock with surprise earnings is a hot ticket\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) —which has been in the realm of meme stocks since it became a darling of the pandemic—got just that kind of boost on August 7, when it reported a profit for its fiscal fourth quarter, boosting shares by about 10% while the market ignored a warning that sales of exercise machines and digital subscriptions are set to decline, requiring some layoffs and a relocation of operations to cut costs.\nThe fitness-equipment maker registered a $21.6 million profit (5 cents a share), compared to a loss of $31.9 million a year earlier. According to a FactSet survey, analysts on average were expecting a loss of 7 cents a share, slightly better than a year ago.\nBut before the positive earnings surprise, Trainer was already calling for Peloton to suffer the ultimate meme stock fate, featuring the stock on the August 4 edition of “The Danger Zone” on the Money Life with Chuck Jaffe podcast.\nNew Constructs brings together discounted cash-flow analysis and forensic accounting to evaluate securities on a scale of “most attractive” to “most dangerous.”\nThe firm’s stock-picking has been rated by SumZero at or near the top of multiple investment categories, most notably leading consistently in consumer discretionary stocks; SumZero is a buy-side community in which more than 15,000 professional portfolio managers compete for rankings.\nPeloton: 'Dangerous' from its birth as an IPO\nNew Constructs first featured Peloton in the Danger Zone prior to its IPO in September 2019; since then, the firm reports that its shares have fallen 72% while the Standard & Poor’s 500 is up roughly 115%.\nBut what put Peloton back in the Danger Zone recently is that meme-stock investors are tuning out the company's long-term results and looking at its recent performance. Shares are up more than 100% from last August, largely due to shrinking losses.\nNew Constructs reported that, “this turnaround story is already baked into the stock valuation, and at current prices, downside risk remains large,” driven by declining sales, high cash burn, the sale of assets, shareholder dilution, and “a stock valuation that implies drastic margin improvement and rapid revenue growth.”\nTrainer, in his Danger Zone appearance on the August 4 edition of Money Life, said Peloton is “making a little meme stock run here … and we just want to remind people that it's still a bad stock.”\n“Peloton still has negative margins, negative economic book value, and it's trading as if its profits are going to dramatically increase and its revenues are going to grow 800%,” Trainer said. “So like whatever turnaround you think there might be here, you know, we think it's all priced in.”\nTrainer said Peloton’s “business model is not a good business model,” noting that the bounce-back is a misdirect or a head fake and that Peloton is “just left with something that's going to probably die pretty slowly.”\nHe acknowledged that the stock could still have another meme stock run, possibly a dead-cat bounce and can survive for a while until he thinks the inevitable happens.\nHe pegged the economic book value on PTON at a negative $6.60 per share, adding that it’s first-mover advantage in the home exercise space is gone, and that he would value the company “conservatively” at less than a dollar per share. Said Trainer: “This one could really go bankrupt.”","content_hash":"f91adba5997aa7da4291f49f183c297b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5640,"method_rank":0}

Dividend stocks serve that purpose. Some of them not only provide a high yield, but also consistently pay and increase their dividends, making them a great addition to any portfolio.\nHere are two dividend stocks with a high yield, a track record of consistent dividend payments, and a dependable business model that generates steady cash flow.\nWith a market cap of $67.6 billion, Enterprise Products Partners (EPD) is widely regarded as one of the most dependable and appealing income-generating stocks in the energy sector. It manages one of the largest and most diverse portfolios of midstream energy infrastructure assets in North America. EPD’s midstream operations include crude oil (CLU25), natural gas (NGU25), and petrochemicals.\nIt combines the stability of essential infrastructure with the advantages of a master limited partnership (MLP) structure, resulting in strong cash flow generation and a long track record of capital returns to shareholders.\nEPD shares have dipped 0.2% year-to-date, compared to the broader market gain.\nThe beauty of EPD’s business model is its fee-based structure, which enables it to generate consistent and predictable cash flows regardless of commodity prices. This reduces the company's exposure to price volatility and increases its resilience during market downturns. The company generates significant distributable cash flow (DCF), which supports its current dividend payout ratio of 74.4%, leaving plenty of room to reinvest in growth without compromising investor returns.\nIn the second quarter, DCF of $1.9 billion increased 7% year-over-year. Net income increased by 3%, reaching $0.66 per share. EPD also announced a 3.8% quarterly dividend increase, to $0.545 per share. The company generated adjusted free cash flow of $812 million, which allowed it to continue paying dividends.\nWith a 7% yield, higher than the energy sector average of 4.2%, a conservative balance sheet, and a strategic position in the U.S. energy sector, EPD provides a unique combination of income and resilience in an uncertain macro environment. Additionally, with 28 consecutive years of distribution growth, a payout well-covered by stable cash flows, and a best-in-class midstream asset base, EPD is arguably one of the best dividend stocks.\nOverall, Wall Street rates EPD stock a “Moderate Buy.” Out of the 16 analysts who cover EPD, nine recommend a “Strong Buy,” one rates it a “Moderate Buy,” and six recommend a “Hold.” The average analyst price target of $36.40 represents a potential 16% increase from current levels. Its high target price of $40 suggests the stock could climb by another 29% over the next 12 months.\nDividend Stock #2: Altria\nDividend Yield: 6.5%\nValued at $105 billion, Altria (MO) is a manufacturer and seller of tobacco, nicotine, and smokeless products. Besides tobacco, Altria also has investments in alcohol and cannabis to diversify its revenue streams. Altria’s business model is centered around addictive and recession-proof products, which generate steady cash flow. Despite declining cigarette volumes amid health concerns and heightened regulatory pressure, the company has managed to sustain its dividend and even grow it.\nAltria stock has surged 21.3% year-to-date, compared to the broader market gain of 7.6%.\nAltria’s reputation as a Dividend King (companies that increase dividends consecutively for 50 years) is built on decades of reliable payouts and hikes. The company has raised its dividend 59 times in the past 55 years, an enviable record. Altria hiked its quarterly dividend by 4.1% last year to $1.02 per share, marking the 59th increase. This consistency stems from the company’s predictable cash flow, which in turn is driven by the remarkably inelastic demand for cigarettes, its core product. Despite a long-term decline in smoking rates, Altria has managed to offset volume losses through price hikes, cost control, and strong brand loyalty. Even as cigarette volumes decline, the pricing power of Marlboro and other premium brands enables Altria to maintain healthy margins.\nCurrently, its dividend yield sits around 6.5%, which is higher than the consumer staples sector average of 1.9%. Altria’s capital allocation strategy is heavily geared toward returning capital to shareholders. While the forward dividend payout ratio is high at 73%, it also reflects management’s confidence in the stability of its earnings. This payout level is sustainable as long as adjusted earnings remain stable or grow modestly. In the most recent second quarter, adjusted earnings increased by 8.3% to $1.44 per share. The company paid $1.7 billion in dividends and repurchased shares worth $274 million in share repurchases in Q2. Analysts expect earnings to increase by 6.1% for the full year, followed by another 2.5% in 2026.\nOverall, on Wall Street, Altria stock is a “Hold.” Of the 14 analysts who cover MO, four rate it a “Strong Buy,” eight rate it a “Hold,” one rates it a “Moderate Sell,” and one recommends a “Strong Sell.”\nAltria stock has surpassed its average price target of $58.82.

It has been known as the College of St. John the Baptist, St. John's College, and St. John's University, New York, before relocating to its current campus in Queens, which is now simply referred to as St. John's University.\nIt was abandoned by the university after classes ceased in 1972 and had been deteriorating for decades. The Roman Catholic church next door, St. John the Baptist, used it for various purposes over the years, including as a nunnery and a boarding school.\n\"I think it looked like a great place to shoot a horror movie. Paint was chipping off the walls. Holes everywhere. Debris all over the floor, birds flying through it. It was clearly a severely neglected asset,\" Linde tells CNBC Make It.\n\"Combine that with the beautiful bones of this building, amazing high ceilings, amazing arch windows, it wasn't difficult to see the vision that you could take this building and turn it into something beautiful.\"\nFollowing the initial walkthrough, the business partners agreed that the existing floor plans were suitable for converting the property into a luxury apartment building. After some negotiations, Linde was able to secure a 99-year ground lease from St. John the Baptist, which grants his company the right to construct and operate for the entire duration of the lease.\n\"At the end of the 99 years, unless the church agrees to let us extend it and sign another lease, the lease hold will return to the Catholic Church,\" Linde says.\nThe partners say that, for the church, it was vital that the old college be preserved, but also converted for better use.\n\"It was very important for the church to keep the original elements of this structure, but find a way to convert it to a better use that will create some sort of income for the church,\" Kore says. \"They just wanted someone to come in and create a business plan that made sense for them to convert it and still be a really good part of the fabric of this neighborhood and that's what we essentially did.\"\nWhen Linde and Kore got on board with the project, they had to pay $3.7 million to take over the lease. In addition, they had to split the lots where the old college and St. John the Baptist sit so the church could maintain their tax exemption and the building could be taxed like any other property.\nFor funding, they secured a construction loan of $72,125,000 and had an additional $31,502,859 from private equity for a total of $103,627,859, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Property taxes for the building are around $700,000 a year.\nRenovations began in 2020. That process included adding a new wing and connecting the older wings to it, as well as building an underground parking garage. The old college was converted into a 205-apartment building, with 147 one-bedroom units, 48 studios, and 10 two-bedroom units, all designed by the architecture firm Woods Bagot. The partners named the building The Hartby, as an homage to the cross streets Hart Street and Willoughby Avenue.\nOf the 205 units, 62 are designated for affordable housing, meaning the rents will range from $2,495 to $3,939 per month and are accessible via the NYC Housing Connect lottery. The rent for the remaining apartments ranges between $3,130 and $6,950 per month.\nThe Hartby has some of the old college's original details like exposed brick and a window that was originally part of the school's chapel. Linde and Kore also created a courtyard and what they call a winter garden that connects the apartment building to the historic church.\nOther amenities include a lounge, gym, yoga room and business center.\nThe Hartby started leasing in April of this year, and the building is currently at around 50% occupancy and 70% leased. Linde and Kore estimate the building will be fully leased by September.\nLinde and Kore say The Hartby has been embraced by the people in the neighborhood, who specifically appreciate their choice to honor the original design of the old college. The church, they say, was also in complete shock when they saw the completed project.\n\"I think they were a little bit in awe when they came in here because they've seen it in disrepair for so many years,\" Kore says. \"They really felt like we did what we said we were going to do, which is to preserve as much of it as possible so it will never be forgotten. I think it's one of those landmarks that will hopefully be part of Brooklyn forever.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Also in the mix, however, are several members of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\nIn late July, Ark added to an existing position in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) -- scooping up 181,640 shares in the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF.\nLet's explore how Alphabet is investing in AI to transform its business. From there, I'll break down some financial and valuation trends to help illustrate why Alphabet stock looks like a no-brainer right now.\nAlphabet's business is in great shape\nAlphabet recently reported operating results for its second quarter, which ended June 30.\nThe company's largest source of revenue -- advertising -- generated $71.3 billion in revenue, growing by 10% year over year. Advertising growth from Google Search and YouTube was even more robust, coming in at 12% and 13%, respectively.\nOver the last few years, skeptics on Wall Street have been parroting a bearish narrative that the rise of ChatGPT and other competing large language models (LLMs) will diminish Google's dominance in search. Accelerating growth between Google Search and YouTube suggests that advertisers still see a high return on investment (ROI) from these platforms, despite some shifts in how people are consuming content on the internet.\nWhere investors may be getting nitpicky is around Alphabet's profit margin profile. The advertising segment sits under a larger category of Alphabet's business, called Google Services. During the second quarter, Google Services grew its revenue 12% year over year to $82.5 billion. However, the operating margin for the Services business remained flat year over year -- coming in at 40%.\nWhen expenses grow in line with revenue, profit margins become capped. On the surface, this may look like Alphabet is not running an efficient business despite an accelerating top line. I wouldn't rush to such a conclusion, though.\nOn top of that, Alphabet's multibillion-dollar investments in AI data centers are often underappreciated -- and yet it's this infrastructure that attracted OpenAI, a perceived rival, as one of Google Cloud's new major partners.\nLastly, Alphabet is also quietly building its own quantum computing operation through the development of its own custom chipsets, called Willow. Although monetizing quantum computing applications is still likely many years away, I find it encouraging that Alphabet is allocating capital across several pockets of the AI realm in an effort to build a diversified ecosystem that strengthens core businesses while opening the door to new opportunities as well.\nIs Alphabet stock a buy right now?\nThe chart below benchmarks Alphabet against many of its big tech peers on a price-to-earnings (P\/E) basis. Ultimately, I think Alphabet stock is being punished by investors because the company isn't posting growth as robust as some of its peers.\nIn my eyes, the fact that the company continues to grow revenue from its core businesses while striking lucrative deals with rivals and maintaining its profit margin profile in the face of aggressive investments shows a high degree of resiliency from Alphabet. Given the disparity in valuation multiples illustrated above, I think that the bearish narrative appears to be fully baked into Alphabet stock at this point.\nTo me, Alphabet is positioned for significant valuation expansion in the coming years as its infrastructure investments continue to bear fruit. I think Wood identified a rare opportunity among major AI players by identifying such a cheap stock floating around in a sea of frothy valuations. I see Alphabet stock as a no-brainer buying opportunity at its current price point for long-term investors.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

The coin was born to move money for the banking system, and today, a few of its backers dream of something even bigger, like unseating Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) to become crypto's top dog. That prospect feels tantalizing in a 12-month period when XRP has grown by 487% while Bitcoin \"merely\" doubled.\nBut does the math, not to mention the market structure, leave any room for this flipping to happen?\nHow steep is the hill for XRP?\nAs of Aug. 5, Bitcoin's market cap sits near $2.2 trillion, making XRP's $177 billion look tiny in comparison.\nFor XRP to flip Bitcoin, it would need to rise roughly 13x with Bitcoin standing still, which is very unlikely for crypto's biggest coin to do over any significant period of time. Even if Bitcoin's price were to fall 50%, XRP would still need a jump of between 6x and 7x, which is beyond the edge of what's believable.\nPut another way, XRP would have to ingest about $2 trillion of net new capital while Bitcoin accrued zero in terms of new inflows.\nFor context, every spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. combined has attracted $19.2 billion in inflows so far in 2025. Pulling in vastly more than that, even over several years, would require institutional adoption of XRP on a scale that no crypto project has yet achieved or even approached.\nThe supply side is tricky too. Unlike Bitcoin's hard-capped limit of 21 million coins, of which perhaps 20% are already lost forever, tightening the float even further, XRP's floating supply can and does expand gradually from the slow release of escrow-locked tokens controlled by Ripple.\nThose unlocks are predictable and transparent, yet they still dilute investors unless demand rises faster. So, the bar to one-upping Bitcoin is even higher than it first appears.\nThe perfect storm scenario that could lead to a flipping\nThere is, however, a very narrow and highly improbable scenario where XRP could catch up and surpass Bitcoin.\nAssume that Ripple, the company that issues XRP, executes its technology development roadmap for the chain perfectly, and succeeds in getting institutional investors and financial institutions onboard in droves. That means the chain would be the go-to location for tokenized asset management, including private credit and stablecoin storage, not to mention trade settlement and on-demand liquidity for investment banks handling securities. The chain has made some headway in all of those activities so far, but for this scenario, it needs to win every single one, and likely completely.\nNow imagine Bitcoin hitting rough seas at the same time. A combination of cybersecurity, environmental, technological, political, and social factors would need to coincide to bring it down.\nProof-of-work mining already draws some regulatory heat; Norway is weighing a temporary ban on new power-hungry Bitcoin mines. If the E.U. or another major bloc enacts similar restrictions, large asset managers might reconsider their Bitcoin allocations for environmental reasons. The same would be true if new capital gains laws pertaining specifically to crypto were passed worldwide.\nFurthermore, if Bitcoin fails to become secure against quantum computing-derived threats, investors may seek safer and greener pastures where they can be more confident that their funds will be safe.\nSuddenly, fresh money that once defaulted to Bitcoin could flow toward a greener, compliance-friendly alternative, like XRP. XRP's built-in payments rail would keep transaction fees low, reinforcing utility as volumes rise. In other words, if Bitcoin encounters its absolute worst-case scenario, and XRP experiences its wildest dreams coming true, XRP would have a (still not great) shot at flipping it.\nBut every link in that chain has to hold.\nBitcoin's scarcity narrative remains powerful, ETF ownership is sticky, and the network effect of being the reserve asset for crypto grows with each halving. To bet on XRP flipping Bitcoin, you must also bet that all of Bitcoin's advantages will erode faster than XRP's adoption exploding. It isn't likely.\nYou can still buy the underdog and do well here\nWaiting for XRP to outrun Bitcoin is not wise.\nThe upside of betting on that outcome is enormous, but conditional on a string of low-probability events and major shifts, or even outright reversals, in current trends. A more balanced view is to treat XRP as a specialized play on cross-border payments and real-world asset tokenization.\nIf those themes continue gaining momentum, and they probably will, XRP can continue to appreciate handsomely even while remaining a fraction of Bitcoin's heft.\nShould you buy stock in XRP right now?\nBefore you buy stock in XRP, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and XRP wasn’t one of them.

Although it owns distribution rights to Modelo, the best-selling beer in the U.S., concerns over tariffs and declining demand for alcohol from Gen Z have led investors to doubt the stock. Over the last five years, its returns have been flat, even when including the dividend.\nHowever, that decline has also made its valuation more attractive, and a high-profile investment group has recently upped its stake in Constellation. Given that catalyst, is it likely to outperform the market over the next year, or should investors continue to avoid the alcohol stock?\nThe state of Constellation Brands\nConstellation stock looks like a desirable holding on the surface. The company owns or holds the distribution rights to many highly recognized brands, especially in the beer market. Beer makes up approximately 80% of the company's revenue, and it distributes Corona, Pacifico, and Modelo. Other brands owned by the company include Robert Mondavi wines and Casa Noble tequila.\nThat may have played a part in the increased investor interest from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. Despite being a net seller of stocks in the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire increased its stake by 114%.\nBuffett's team may have found opportunity among its challenges, and indeed, Constellation faces significant headwinds. Its most popular beers come from Mexico, and the threat of tariffs could reduce sales and possibly cost Modelo its market leadership.\nEven more concerning are competition and consumption patterns. Alcohol companies have more competition than ever from independent breweries and distillers. Plus, alcohol consumption among Gen Z significantly lags its older counterparts, likely because of the increased prevalence of cannabis-based products. Such obstacles have likely led some investors to lose confidence in this stock.\nConstellation's financials\nInvestors may be justified in feeling pessimistic, as net sales fell 6% yearly in Q1 of fiscal 2026 (ended May 31) to $2.5 billion. That same metric increased by slightly more than 2% annually in fiscal 2025 amid declining wine and spirits sales.\nDue primarily to impairments in goodwill, intangibles, and assets held for sale, Constellation lost $375 million in fiscal Q1, down from a $392 million profit in the year-ago quarter.\nUpcoming quarters point to continued struggles as it forecasts enterprise organic net-sales growth between -2% and 1% for fiscal 2026, but that includes the numbers from Svedka, a vodka brand Constellation recently sold.\nWith such sluggish sales, total return levels for Constellation have lagged the S&P 500 by a wide margin. Over the last year alone, the total return is down by more than 25%.\nStill, a closer look at the financials reveals the likely reason Berkshire has become increasingly interested in Constellation Brands. The goodwill and intangibles impairments temporarily left it without a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio. However, the forward P\/E ratio of 13 shows this to be a low-cost stock.\nWhat's more, Constellation pays $4.08 per share in annual dividends. Its dividend yield of 2.4% is far above the five-year average yield of 1.5% and the S&P 500 average of 1.2%. The payout has also risen for nine consecutive years, making it likely that the annual dividend hikes will continue. That growing payout gives investors an added incentive to hold Constellation stock.\nConstellation Brands in one year\nUnder current conditions, Constellation Brands is highly likely to deliver market-beating returns over the next year.\nAdmittedly, the stock is cheap for a reason in one sense, given how tariff worries and the lower interest in drinking from Gen Z weighed on net-sales growth.\nNonetheless, a closer look at the stock shows the likely reason that Buffett's team at Berkshire continues to buy. Its rising dividend offers a yield that is well above average compared to the S&P 500 and its past returns. Moreover, the forward P\/E ratio, which doesn't include the asset impairments from the trailing 12 months, is 13, a level that likely factors in the company's challenges.\nThus, investors should profit from an above-average dividend yield, a probable payout hike, and a high likelihood that the stock price will begin to recover as more investors follow Berkshire's lead.\nShould you buy stock in Constellation Brands right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Constellation Brands, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Constellation Brands wasn’t one of them.

With a return of more than 30%, they are one of the top performers in JPMorgan's emerging markets bond index, which across the asset class has returned slightly more than 7%.\nCitigroup recently upgraded its assessment on Bolivian bonds to \"neutral\" from \"underweight.\"\nHaving started the year below 60 cents, Bolivian government bonds have scaled multi-year highs in recent days and are trading in the mid-70 cent range - well above the 70 cent threshold below which debt is seen as being in distress.\nA change in government \"is likely to be quite positive for the economy, which has been on an unsustainable fiscal and current account position for so many years,\" said Carlos de Sousa, emerging markets debt strategist at Vontobel Asset Management.\n\"A restructuring could be avoided, particularly if the country gets an IMF program soon after,\" de Sousa said, adding that turning to the International Monetary Fund for support would be a political choice while Bolivia's overall debt metrics were \"sufficiently bad\" to justify a debt reworking.\nBolivia's political landscape is dominated by a power struggle that has fractured the incumbent left-leaning Movement to Socialism (MAS) party. Polls show it winning about 12% of the vote in the first round of the election on August 17.\nEvo Morales, who ruled the country from 2006 to 2019 under the MAS banner, has been barred from running for another term as president.\nBetting websites peg the chances of a win for center-right businessman Samuel Doria Medina, the National Unity party's presidential candidate, at more than 50%. Favored by markets, he has pledged to restore central bank autonomy, tackle a dollar shortage and take on corruption.\nTo avoid a runoff, which has been scheduled for October 19, a candidate must secure more than 40% of the vote as well as have a lead of at least 10 percentage points.\nIMF LOAN PROGRAM\nThe election is taking place at a critical time for Bolivia's $50 billion economy.\nCentral bank-financed fiscal deficits have become a major flash point, revenues from gas exports - a big source of hard currency for the government - have dwindled and the central bank has been forced to spend precious reserves defending the boliviano currency's peg to the dollar. The gap between parallel and official exchange rates has blown out to 80%, the IMF says.\nDespite the recent spurt of optimism, investors remain worried that political infighting and falling gas export revenues could jeopardize the country's ability to service upcoming debt payments - large chunks of which are due in the first quarters of the next three years.\nBolivia's external debt amounted to about $13.3 billion by the end of 2024, of which $1.8 billion is in hard-currency bonds and the remainder in multilateral and bilateral loans, according to its central bank.\nForeign exchange reserves were at a record low of about $165 million in April, central bank data shows. JPMorgan calculates that the country's liquid reserves are only $100 million. The IMF puts reserves at two months worth of imports - well below the minimum threshold of the equivalent of three months.\nEarlier this year, the three major credit rating agencies downgraded Bolivia's rating deeper into junk. S&P Global said the economic circumstances could impair the government's ability to service debt over the next six to 12 months.\nSome relief may come from loans worth more than $1 billion from official lenders like the World Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency that have been secured but not drawn down amid government infighting, and which analysts expect could be unlocked by a new government in La Paz. Monetizing Bolivia's vast lithium deposits could also bring in financing.\nBut the real silver lining - at least for investors - would be an IMF loan program.\nIt would, however, require painful reforms. The IMF said in May that the Bolivian government should ditch the dollar peg, lift capital controls and phase out fuel subsidies, among a raft of other policy changes. It estimates Bolivia's economy will grow 1.1% in 2025 and 0.9% next year - less than half the 2.2% growth expected across broader Latin America this year and the 2.4% forecast for the region in 2026.\nWith a balance of payments crunch looming, analysts say, the next government might not have much choice.\n\"All these liberalizing reforms will eventually allow the economy to flourish, but there's going to be some short-term pain as you shut down money-losing businesses, cut fuel subsidies, and unshackle the economy,\" said Ajata Mediratta, partner at Greylock Capital Management.\n\"Very few countries can do that in an election year.\"\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru and Rodrigo Campos in New York; editing by Karin Strohecker, Christian Plumb and Paul Simao)","content_hash":"e7cad6ae85b73c21d65dd2b32f590c09","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5376,"method_rank":0}

But the right strategy can help you wipe out debt in just six months. Here are eight steps Sethi suggested in a recent YouTube video.\nTo get anywhere, you must recognize your debt is there and not keep brushing it off as “manageable.”\nSethi said to start by listing all your debts with their current balances, interest rates and minimum payment amounts, which may be painful to see. He also recommended using AnnualCreditReport.com to get your credit report so you avoid overlooking any accounts.\nYou can now figure out whether the debt snowball or debt avalanche method is the right attack method. Sethi said either is fine and prioritized commitment.\nThe debt snowball approach, which Dave Ramsey prefers, focuses on eliminating your debts from the smallest to the largest amounts, which is motivating. The debt avalanche strategy targets debts from the highest to the lowest interest rates to boost your overall savings. You can use an online debt payoff calculator to compare the timelines and interest paid.\nAlso, consider negotiating your rates with creditors. Sethi suggested explaining your focus on debt payoff, emphasizing your time as a customer and mentioning that competitors have better offerings.\nHe added, “It doesn’t work every time, but when it does, you can often save thousands of dollars in interest alone.”\nTake the ‘Lazy Genius’ Approach\nSethi said that willpower isn’t something to count on to successfully pay off debt. Instead, use automatic payments to guarantee that funds regularly go toward your balances.\nFirst, make sure you’re automatically paying the minimum on everything to avoid late or missed payments. Next, set up a larger payment each month for your current target debt.\nSethi suggested scheduling these payments soon after you get paid so that you don’t splurge on something else.\nFree Up Cash Without Excessive Sacrifice\nAccording to Sethi, getting rid of debt fast doesn’t have to mean extreme sacrifice, like cutting out everything you love or eating disappointing meals.\nHe recommended focusing on cutting expenses in three specific areas and putting the savings toward debts. These include getting rid of unnecessary subscriptions, finding cheaper insurance and avoiding impulse purchases.\nHe added, “In my experience talking to tons of people, I found that most people can free up at least $500 a month by methodically going through those steps.”\nUnlock the Cheat Code to Faster Progress\nAn important cheat code for faster progress is to boost your earnings while you reduce expenses. The extra money you make could help you become debt-free years sooner.\nSethi mentioned many options, so consider what might be right for you. An obvious step is getting a raise at your current job, but a second income source is also smart. You might offer freelance services, take on local side gigs or monetize hobbies. Sethi also recommended selling unwanted household items.\nThe income boost will vary, but any amount will help as long as you actually use the money for debts.\nGamify Paying Off Debt\nIf you’re someone who needs excitement to stay motivated, you’ll need to combat the boredom that comes with debt payoff. Reminding yourself to regularly look at your progress is key.\n“A weekly check-in, not just monthly, keeps you engaged and helps you catch unnecessary expenses before they drain your spending,” explained Sethi.\nFor example, you might find you’re unnecessarily paying for a $60 gym membership and a $15 streaming service. Cutting those costs would save you $75 per month or $450 in six months.\nSethi outlined a simple weekly routine that involves using an app or spreadsheet where you track your debt payoff progress, looking for any hidden expenses in your statements to eliminate and then celebrating your progress.\nWatch Out for Debt Traps\nWhile handling your debt, watch for traps that can keep you stuck or even leave you in a worse place.\nSethi warned about moving debt using balance transfers, which often lure you with attractive promotional rates that eventually go up. Other traps include not changing your spending habits and making minimum payments, which leaves you in debt longer with more interest charged.\nPlus, watch out for debt consolidation scams, which Sethi said can leave you with a longer repayment timeline and large fees. According to the Federal Trade Commission, debt relief scams often involve questionable promises and little actual help.\nAvoid Going Back\nAfter your debt is gone, plan to never get back in the situation. Sethi gave three tips that can help.\nFirst, consider forgetting credit cards and trying cash envelopes, which will each have a label for your expense and the budgeted cash amount inside. Once you spend the allocated money, you can’t spend any more.\nIf you feel disciplined enough to keep using cards, avoid carrying a balance from month to month. This will require carefully monitoring your spending, including not buying things just to maximize rewards.\nFinally, Sethi encouraged having an emergency fund of three to six months of your fixed expenses. Since many people go into debt for emergencies, this cash will help protect you.","content_hash":"da839c7bee671bb7be67591b3fc5b425","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5291,"method_rank":0}

UK-based BP, which has its U.S. headquarters in Houston, Texas, has said it plans to eliminate 6,200 positions this year, and also expects to end work agreements with more than 4,000 contractors by year-end. The company said it already has slashed 3,200 contractor roles since January, and this week said it would “continue to rigorously review the remaining contractor activity across our businesses and functions.” The company earlier this year said it expected to lay off as many as 4,700 workers this year. The company's Houston operations employ about 4,000 people, the highest number in any of its worldwide locations. BP said its corporate layoffs amount to about 15% of its global workforce, as the company seeks to reduce costs by about $2 billion by the end of 2025. The company earlier this year said it would cut 5% of its global workforce as part of a restructuring effort. Officials have said BP employs about 100,000 workers in various roles worldwide. Kate Thomson, the company's CFO, confirmed the job cuts during the company's second-quarter earnings call. Thomson said most of those layoffs will occur in the fourth quarter of this year. The company has said the reductions in workforce are not due to financial problems, but rather focused on increasing returns for investors and returning to its roots in oil and gas exploration. BP recently discovered new oil and gas fields off the coast of Brazil, which officials said should increase the company's fossil fuel production. The discoveries have been called the company's biggest in at least 25 years. Thomson said that so far this year BP has achieved $1.7 billion in cost reductions, including $400 million from corporate overhead. The executive said \"performance culture\" changes across the company have contributed to the savings. BP executives have said the company's goal is to cut structural costs by as much as $5 billion by year-end 2027.\n'Resource Allocation'\n“You just never plan on this amount of success, so we need to think about resource allocation,” said Murray Auchincloss, CEO of BP. The company recently said it is targeting $4 billion to $5 billion in cost reductions against its 2023 baseline. Officials said BP already has achieved $1.7 billion in cuts, along with selling off $3 billion of its assets. BP is not abandoning renewable energy. BP and JERA, Japan’s largest power generation company, earlier this week announced the completion of JERA Nex bp, a joint venture (JV) that combines each companies’ offshore wind assets to form a new equally-owned renewable joint venture. The companies said the new joint venture has a net potential generating capacity of 13 GW, which would establish it as one of the largest offshore wind developers, owners and operators globally. BP in February of this year said it would provide more capital to its oil and gas business, and reduce its renewables business to less than 5% of the company’s capital expenditures. The company last month said it would sell BP Wind Energy, its U.S. onshore wind business, to LS Power, an energy infrastructure developer. William Lin, the company's executive vice president for Gas & Low Carbon Energy, said the new JV with JERA \"allows BP to optimize and decapitalize our low carbon energy portfolio as we continue to maintain optionality for electron flows and more material value realization through this decade and the next.\" The JERA Nex bp JV includes projects either being developed or in operation across nine countries. The portfolio includes 1 GW of operating generation capacity, 7.5 GW of projects in development, and another 4.5 GW of secured leases. The companies in December of last year said they would together provide $5.8 billion in capital for the JV through the end of 2030. “JERA Nex bp begins life with a strong operating portfolio and an extensive development pipeline. We bring together two highly capable teams with the experience, relationships, purchasing power and unique global access of two of the East and West’s pre-eminent energy companies. This gives us the expertise and experience to find new ways to create value from offshore wind and become one of the world’s leading companies in the sector,” said Nathalie Oosterlinck, CEO of JERA Nex bp. JERA and BP have been building offshore wind projects since 2019. BP is currently developing projects off the UK coast in the Irish Sea, along with installations in Germany’s North Sea. It also has secured leases off Scotland and the U.S. East Coast. JERA acquired Belgium-headquartered offshore wind group Parkwind in 2023. It subsequently launched the JERA Nex renewables group, which owns and operates wind farms in Belgium, Germany, Japan, and Taiwan, and also has a development portfolio of projects in areas that include Japan, Ireland, and Australia. The two companies also operate JERA Nex bp Japan, which is focused on developing and operating projects in that country. —Darrell Proctor is a senior editor for POWER.","content_hash":"748c90ef94568d02903d40185b7d2416","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5194,"method_rank":0}

Although he will step down as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO, Buffett will continue to serve as chairman of the board. I suspect he'll talk with incoming CEO Greg Abel regularly.\nWhile Buffett has been a net seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters, he's not entirely on the sidelines on that front either. The \"Oracle of Omaha\" might not be buying many stocks these days, but he's still buying a few. I think some of the legendary investor's previous picks look quite attractive. Here are three no-brainer Buffett stocks to buy right now.\n1. Amazon\nEvery pullback in Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) share price in the past presented a great buying opportunity. I have no reason to doubt that the latest one will be any different.\nSure, some Wall Street analysts are concerned that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a laggard in the artificial intelligence (AI) race after the cloud unit underperformed compared with its rivals. But AWS remains the leader in the cloud services market. Importantly, it's also growing robustly, with sales jumping 17.5% year over year in the second quarter of 2025.\nSome investors could also be worried about how tariffs could hurt Amazon's e-commerce business. CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged in the Q2 earnings call that there's uncertainty related to tariffs. However, he said that the company hasn't seen demand declining or prices increase by a significant level so far. Jassy believes that customers will continue to shop on Amazon's platform because they're able to find the products they want at lower prices.\nI fully expect AWS will continue to claim the highest market share in the cloud market and enjoy a strong AI tailwind. I predict that Amazon will successfully navigate the challenges created by the Trump administration's trade policies. And I look for the company to keep finding new ways to grow.\n2. Domino's Pizza\nDomino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) is one of the handful of stocks that Buffett, or one of his investment managers, has bought in recent quarters. Berkshire Hathaway now owns 7.7% of the pizza giant.\nWhy is Domino's Pizza a great pick for other investors right now? I think the stock could prove to be highly resilient if the economy weakens. With inflation rising and a lackluster recent jobs report, the odds of an economic pullback appear to be increasing.\nWhen times are tough, many consumers curtail spending on going out to eat. However, ordering pizza is a relatively cheap substitute. Domino's frequent deals could entice even cost-conscious consumers to splurge a little in a way that doesn't bust their budgets.\nAlso, tariffs shouldn't be a huge issue for Domino's Pizza. The company relies on domestic suppliers for its ingredients. Even if some of those ingredient prices rise, I think customers will still find Domino's an attractive option that's less expensive than most alternatives.\n3. Mitsubishi\nBuffett thinks so highly of Mitsubishi(OTC: MSBHF) that he has included the Japanese stock on the list that he expects Berkshire to own \"indefinitely.\" He also likes the company's business model, which he has likendd to Berkshire's own business.\nWith Berkshire's shares trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 22.7, Buffett hasn't authorized any stock buybacks this year. But Mitsubishi looks like a bargain with a forward earnings multiple of 14. I view this stock as kind of a cheaper version of Berkshire with a Japanese accent.\nMitsubishi's attractive valuation isn't the result of a steep decline, by the way. The stock has soared more than 20% year to date.\nInvesting in Mitsubishi is almost like investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) because of the diversification it offers -- again, similar to Berkshire. The conglomerate owns 1,205 companies that operate in a wide range of industries, including energy, food, materials, and more.\nDo the experts think Amazon is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

Let’s find out if it is a good time to grab Meta stock.\nMeta Reported a Blockbuster Quarter\nWith 3.4 billion people using one of its apps on a daily basis, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, Meta continues to shape the digital and AI revolution. The company delivered a record-breaking quarter, thanks to increased engagement across its platforms, increased ad revenue, transformative AI features, and the early monetization of its next-generation products. Meta’s total revenue climbed 22% year-over-year to $47.5 billion. Diluted earnings increased 38% to $7.14 per share.\nThe Family of Apps (FoA) segment, which includes all social media platforms, is thriving, with revenue up 21.8% year-over-year to $47.1 billion. Meta AI, the company’s AI assistant, now powers interactions on Facebook, Instagram, and, most importantly, WhatsApp, where it is most frequently used. Management emphasized that Meta AI is quickly integrating itself into the daily habits of users all over the world, from image generation and homework help to content discovery and even post-analysis. While Threads is still relatively new and has a low ad supply, Meta is beginning to monetize it.\nAdvertising revenue for FoA increased by 21% to $46.6 billion. Online commerce was the largest driver of ad growth. The company’s Advantage+ suite of AI tools is popular among advertisers. Notably, Meta’s generative video tools, such as Image Animation and Video Expansion, are used by nearly 2 million advertisers, and its text generation capabilities are also seeing solid engagement.\nThe Reality Labs (RL) segment, which includes augmented and virtual reality, saw a 4.8% increase in revenue to $370 million. This growth was fueled by the adoption of AI glasses and the release of new products such as the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition. Losses widened slightly, with an operating loss of $4.5 billion. Meta continues to invest heavily in this segment, believing that immersive computing, including XR and wearable AI, will be an essential component of the future AI-human interface.\nAggressive Capital Allocation to Build Long-Term Moat\nMeta ended the quarter with $47.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and $28.8 billion in debt. It also generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow, distributed $1.3 billion in dividends, and repurchased $9.8 billion in shares. Meta is investing heavily in its future. The company expects capital expenditures of $66 billion to $72 billion in 2025, with a similar sharp increase in 2026. Management stated that this capital is being primarily invested in AI infrastructure, such as compute capacity and data center expansion.\nThese investments are not just to keep up with AI competitors. They are focused on establishing long-term competitive advantages in AI model development, platform intelligence, and operational scale. Analysts expect Meta’s earnings to rise by 16.5% in 2025, followed by another 6.7% in 2026. Meta is slightly overvalued, trading at 27 times forward-estimated 2025 earnings.\nWhat Does Wall Street Say About Meta Stock?\nOverall, the consensus for META stock is an overall “Strong Buy.” Among the 54 analysts covering the company, 45 give it a “Strong Buy” rating, three recommend a “Moderate Buy,” five suggest holding, and one rates it a “Strong Sell.” The average price target of $855.44 indicates potential 11% upside from current levels. Meanwhile, the high price target of $1,086 implies the stock could surge by as much as 41% over the next year.\nThe Bottom Line on META Stock\nMeta is more than just a social media platform, with new revenue engines such as Threads, business messaging, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses gaining traction, as well as a strong commitment to AI infrastructure. Investors seeking a long-term, AI-powered growth story with strong monetization, deep engagement, and a bold AI vision may find Meta to be one of the most appealing tech stocks in the market right now. However, given that META is trading at a premium, risk-averse investors may want to accumulate shares in the $680 to $690 range to invest with a margin of safety.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The move from the White House has the potential to be a game changer for the adoption of digital assets. It could help turn them into mainstays of the U.S. financial market by expanding access and encouraging longer-term investing in crypto. Bitcoin , which has been riding a big wave of institutional acceptance and adoption since last year's debut of U.S. bitcoin ETFs , could one day become more established within financial services. It probably won't happen soon based on the White House's greenlight alone. It's even more unlikely investors will be directing BONK , Pudgy Penguins or other meme coins to their retirement accounts. \"On the surface, it's exciting to see digital assets getting presidential-level attention,\" said Doug Boneparth, certified financial planner and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. \"It signals continued legitimization of the space and shows how far we've come since bitcoin was just an internet curiosity. But the reality is a lot more nuanced.\" Employer adoption is key First of all, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (better known as ERISA), major changes to investment menus require thoughtful guidance and buy-in from plan sponsors – especially if they involve volatile and still-maturing asset classes like crypto, Boneparth noted. For example, Fidelity in 2022 became the first retirement plan provider to give savers the option of putting bitcoin in their 401(k)s. However, employers must be willing to adopt the offering in the first place. That \"came down to employers' risk tolerance and fiduciary responsibility. That's not changing overnight with an [executive order],\" Boneparth said. Employers' fiduciary duty requires them to comply with ERISA and to run the plan in the best interest of the participants and beneficiaries. Further, too many investment options can be a barrier to participation, said Preston Cherry, CFP and founder of Concurrent Financial Planning. While increased access to crypto may be a plus, \"people become overwhelmed with the investment menu options\" which leads to a \"lack of participation,\" he said. Even when there is education available on these investment options, employees have to elect to receive it — and those participation rates are typically low, Cherry added. Combine those considerations with high-risk assets, and employers' fiduciary responsibility has to kick in. \"What happens with all the other altcoins?\" Cherry said, separating out bitcoin, ether and the Solana token. \"There should be oversight on that from the investment committee or plan sponsor overseeing what digital currencies actually get accepted and should for sure be educating on it.\" \"There's potential upside in digital currencies, but a lot of folks can't understand 30%, 40%, 50% drawdowns – and it could be destructive,\" he added. \"I'm not saying don't invest in crypto, but be crypto cautious.\" It depends on recordkeepers and 401(k) plan providers The retirement market had $43 trillion in assets in the first quarter, almost $9 trillion of which was held in 401(k) plans, according to the Investment Company Institute. The crypto market cap is nearly $4 trillion today. The executive order is the latest in a series of efforts under the Trump administration to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\" In July, he signed stablecoin legislation known as the GENIUS Act into the first official U.S. crypto law . The Securities and Exchange Commission recently debuted \" Project Crypto ,\" an initiative to modernize securities regulations to allow for crypto-based trading. \"The plan providers, the third-party providers, the recordkeepers, are going to decide the end result here, if they want to put crypto in or not,\" said Tyrone Ross, CEO of registered investment advisor 401 Financial. \"This is part of this administration's goal to make crypto the epicenter of the world and to have it grow here,\" he added. \"They're all-in, but the Fidelities of the world, the Schwabs, the MassMutuals, the Vanguards of the world – I don't know if they're just going to go, 'OK, we're going to do it.'\" Boneparth echoed that the order is more \"more symbolic than structural right now.\" However, this shouldn't diminish the significance of Washington's blessing of the crypto industry. Further, an education opportunity has just opened up in the retirement sector. \"As someone who believes in the long-term role of bitcoin in a diversified portfolio, I'm hopeful,\" Boneparth said. \"But as a fiduciary, I know our job is to help clients weigh the opportunity and the risk.\" \"If we do this right, the door opens a little wider to the future of retirement investing,\" he said. \"If we don't? Well then, who knows what meme coin we're going to see on a retirement plan statement.\"","content_hash":"98537fa3018d2f2688d4ba05d42c09a4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4925,"method_rank":0}

Here are two that could be worth a closer look for long-term investors right now.\nNo signs of weak consumer spending here\nTanger Factory Outlet Centers(NYSE: SKT) is the only pure-play outlet mall REIT in the market, with a portfolio of about 40 outlet properties, primarily located along coastal and tourist-heavy areas.\nIn the second quarter, Tanger reported stellar 9.4% year-over-year growth in funds from operations (FFO), and all of the major portfolio metrics looked strong. Tanger's portfolio occupancy was 96.6% at the end of the second quarter, an 80-basis-point sequential increase. And if you were worried about the health of the American consumer, it isn't apparent in Tanger's numbers -- the average tenant had $465 per square foot in sales over the past 12 months, $27 more than a year ago.\nImpressively, Tanger's spreads on new and renewal leases was 12% during the second quarter, meaning that when a tenant renews their lease or a new tenant moves in, Tanger is making 12% more than it was previously.\nIn all, this was a fantastic quarter and Tanger raised its full-year FFO guidance on the strength of its results. But even now, Tanger trades for about 14 times FFO and has a 3.7% dividend yield that is nicely covered by its cash flow.\nA rock-solid monthly dividend stock\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) has a portfolio of more than 15,000 single-tenant properties, most of which are retail in nature. But it's a different type of retail than Tanger owns. Realty Income chooses tenants that sell non-discretionary products, are service-based, or that are deeply discount-oriented. Their tenants sign long-term lease agreements that require them to cover taxes, insurance, and maintenance -- all Realty Income has to do is get a quality tenant in place and enjoy years of growing income.\nRealty Income's results were solid all around. But perhaps the biggest surprise is that Realty Income is still finding plenty of attractive ways to put money to work, despite the unfavorable interest environment. In the second quarter alone, Realty Income invested $1.2 billion in properties at an average initial yield of 7.2%, and meanwhile it issued about $1.3 billion in new debt at an average interest rate of about 3.6%.\nIn fact, Realty Income raised its full-year investment guidance to $5 billion (previously $4 billion) and increased its full-year FFO guidance midpoint. Shares now trade for just 13.4 times expected FFO, and Realty Income pays a 5.7% dividend yield in monthly installments.\nWhy they're worth a look now\nBoth of these REITs are firing on all cylinders, with solid occupancy, leasing activity, and tenant performance. And both are trading for surprisingly low valuations.\nOne big reason is that we're still in a relatively high interest rate environment, and this is a negative catalyst for REITs. Higher interest rates mean that it costs more to raise growth capital, and they also put pressure on commercial real estate values. But as rates (hopefully) trend lower over the next couple of years, it could produce a positive tailwind for these two excellent businesses. I own both in my portfolio (Realty Income is one of my largest investments), and both look extremely attractive from a long-term perspective right now.\nDo the experts think Tanger is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

Some mild short covering emerged in sugar futures Thursday after the Brazilian real (^USDBRL) rallied to a 4-week high, discouraging export sales from Brazil's sugar producers.\nOn Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. Last Thursday, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y\/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported today that cumulative monsoon rain in India is at 500.8 mm, or 4% above normal as of August 4. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices have retreated over the past four months, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low last month and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025\/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025\/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y\/y.\nSigns that the recent slide in sugar prices to 4-year lows has sparked a pickup in demand are positive for sugar prices. China's June sugar imports soared by 1,435% to 420,000 MT. Also, Coca-Cola agreed to use cane sugar in Coke beverages sold in the US instead of high-fructose corn syrup, which could boost US sugar consumption by +4.4% to 11.5 MMT from 11 MMT currently, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nSugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025\/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y\/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024\/25 sugar production rose +14% y\/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024\/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023\/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024\/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y\/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025\/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y\/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025\/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y\/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y\/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would rise +25% y\/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025\/26 sugar production will climb +2% y\/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Hosted by the veteran Wall Street investor Chris Versace, the weekly podcasts are available early to members of TheStreetPro investing club.\nShall I compare thee to a summer's day? Well, in that case, you'd better hurry up\nSummer is starting to wind down, and some investors might be feeling a little uncertain right about now.\nBut this has historically been a less-than-stellar time for the stock market, and Jay Woods, chief global strategist with Freedom Capital Markets, said that August and September are two of the market's worst performing months.\n\"You go back the last 15 years to 2011, August and September have been down more than they've been up,\" he said. \"September, in fact, is a losing month over that time. So, we're seeing this seasonal pattern of weakness.\"\n\"Weird things happen in August,\" Woods added. \"I don't know why.\"\nStrategist notes Microsoft earnings\nWoods shared his insights with Chris Versace, columnist and lead manager of TheStreet Pro portfolio during the Aug. 6 edition of TheStreet's Stock & Markets Podcast, as he discussed what stocks and sectors investors should buy and avoid in the month that has been called summer's last stand.\nStock have had big run since bottoming in April, Versace noted.\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index has risen 32.2% from the low. The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 45% in the same time period.\n\"We're about two thirds of the way through the earnings season,\" Versace added. \"Earnings have been, by and large, better than expected. But we're entering that time of the year known to many as August. Seasonally slow. Not the strongest time of the year.\"\nWoods believes the market is in a “garden variety pullback” that happens in August and September.\n“So, as a technician that follows price action, the seasonal factors are lining up, too,\" Woods said. \"I think you want to get ready to buy some of these dips, especially in the strongest names. So you stay, you go to the beach for a little while. You come back, and see where the opportunities are.\"\nTechnology and financials are doing okay now, Woods said, \"and that's going to take this market higher.\"\nWoods said that he is watching software giant Microsoft (MSFT) , which he noted had stellar earnings, but then peaked at $555 on July 31 and has since reversed.\n\"Microsoft did exactly what Nvidia (NVDA) did,\" he said, referring to the AI chipmaker. \"It hasn't had a sideways action in quite some time. So, we're in a digestive phase right now in this market. And it's not just Microsoft. Look at Meta (META) , look at a lot of these names that had tremendous runs.\"\nWatching out for troubled sectors\nWoods also discussed areas to avoid, including pharmaceuticals and materials.\nPresident Donald Trump has escalated his demands that pharma companies lower U.S. drug prices in line with what other countries pay.\n\"Pharma is getting hit,\" he said. \"The drug makers don't know what to do here because what he wants to do is get comparable pricing in the U.S. To our European counterparts, you and I, this is fantastic. But to the drug makers, to the shareholders of these stocks, this is going to hurt their margins dramatically.\"\nWoods also warned about staples, including companies like Procter & Gamble (PG) , Clorox (CLX) , and Kimberly-Clark (KMB) .\n\"Overall, we're talking about those household, everyday items that we need,\" he said. \"It's going to be tough because their margins are going to get hit, and it's going to come back to us. And then the consumer is going to get a little more selective.\"\nWoods said the only winners in this case are \"cheap retail stocks\" like Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) .\nStocks in the materials sector \"are a little wonky,\" he said, as some mining-related companies have done well, such as gold producer Newmont Corp. (NEM) , but companies like Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and Dow (DOW) have struggled.\n\"They warned, and they warned again after lowering the bar a quarter ago,\" Woods said. \"So these stocks are in the penalty box for now. And you're not going to get a nice bang for your buck at these levels. It's going to take a little while for them to turn around.\"\nHe said that the market is in a period of uncertainty after a tremendous run.\n\"What do we do after we have a tremendous run?\" he asked. \"We digest those gains. We consolidate. I do not think we're on the verge of a bear market or recession, but there are some data points that have my antenna up. And if the data changes, if price changes, then I'll change my tune.\"\nWoods said that he is okay with a little pullback right now, and \"I think we're going to be set up to have a strong fourth quarter and finish 2025 at or near all time highs.\"","content_hash":"6e545a4f0397d98787ac38c96984b00e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4737,"method_rank":0}

She spoke from personal experience, she added: Robbins would lose herself in her iPhone for extended periods of time, and then look up to see her kids buried in their own devices.\n\"I used to be the kind of person who always had [my phone] in my hand,\" said Robbins, 58. \"I felt like I just completely lost control of the situation.\"\nKids typically have a different relationship with phones than adults do: They have a higher tendency to overuse social media and watch videos for hours on end, according to Michael Robb, head of research at Common Sense Media. This can cause problems with their sleep, physical and mental health, and shorten their attention spans — all making them less likely to develop into happy, successful adults, Yale University psychologist Laurie Santos told CNBC Make It in October 2023.\nAt first, Robbins would demand that her kids to put their phones away or scold them for being plugged in all the time, she said. Then, she realized her kids were mirroring her behavior, she said — seeking connection through social media, and texting friends to make up for the lack of in-person interaction.\n\"Where you put your attention determines the quality of your life, and when you give your attention away to everything, it often feels like nothing is getting your attention,\" said Robbins. \"So phone-life balance is a very important thing.\"\nDON'T MISS: How to build a standout personal brand—online, in person and at work\nThirty-one percent of U.S. adults struggle with mindlessly reaching for their phones throughout the day, according to a 2024 Morning Consult survey. Changing your habit means making a conscious effort — first to put your phone down when you've just picked it up, and then to avoid picking it up at all, Robbins said.\nYou can start trying to catch yourself \"immediately,\" she noted.\n\"I want you to look in the mirror. Do you sleep with your phone? Do you constantly have it? Are you the kind of person that goes out to dinner with friends or work colleagues and you've got the phone out or on the table?\" said Robbins. \"You cannot yell at your kids or expect your kids to police themselves [and] have balance if you're not modeling it.\"\nSpecifically, Robbins stopped keeping her phone on her person after work, while walking around the house and while sleeping, she said. The physical distance helped her curb the urge to check one last email or send a text that could probably wait until later. When she saw her kids on their phones, she asked about what they were doing instead of being \"controlling\" or \"judging,\" she said.\nMaybe they were texting their friends, for example — theoretically a better use of technology than mindlessly scrolling through social media, which can damage your brain's \"executive function,\" psychologist Gloria Mark said in April.\n\"When we're overwhelmed with processing so much information, our cognitive resources drain. When they drain, our mind gets fatigued,\" said Mark. \"There's a part of the mind that's called executive function, and that has the job of keeping us on track. It helps us with decision making, filtering out distractions and sticking to goals. When the mind gets fatigued, executive function just can't do its job.\"\nUnderstanding why your kids use their phones the way they do can help you build stronger connections with them, noted Robbins.\n\"We get judgy because we miss that connection of being present with each other, and then we blame it on the phone instead,\" she said. \"But when I started to ... get curious about it, it [shifted] the dynamic.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Those changes will require advisors and their clients to take a fresh look at their strategies, according to Jere Doyle, an estate planning strategist with BNY Wealth, and Holly Swan, the head of wealth solutions in the global client strategy unit of asset management firm Allspring Global Investments.\n\"QBI and 199A aren't really the big news that people had hoped they would be,\" she said, noting that \"no one was anticipating\" the Senate's changes to the guidelines for qualified small business stock. \"The rules have always been great, but they haven't really kept up with the times. And I think the new rules are pretty amazing.\"\nWith a few caveats around tax code criteria and expected IRS rulemaking, businesses of all sizes may use words like \"amazing\" to describe the law's approach to expenditures for research and development and other corporate investments.\nIn particular, the alterations in Sections 168 and 179 of the code amount to \"an incentive for people to buy stuff\" in ways that \"will boost sales\" of heavy machinery, Doyle noted. By raising the possible annual equipment expense deduction to $2.5 million (subject to phaseouts based on income) and enabling the businesses to depreciate capital investments based on their full cost up front rather than in the \"straight line\" method, those provisions of the law alone could push up the value of many businesses.\n\"The message is, people can write stuff off sooner, deduct it sooner,\" Doyle said. \"That lowers their taxable income and increases the amount you take home.\"\nJust as those rules seek to promote economic activity, the legislation bulks up the capital-gains exclusions available for qualified small business stock under Section 1202 as a means of spurring investment, Swan noted.\nThe legislation beefed up the criteria for eligibility to businesses valued at as much as $75 million with inflationary adjustments from only $50 million, while ratcheting up the available exclusion to $15 million from $10 million, Swan noted. In addition, those exclusions will kick in at 50% of the gain three years after the investment and 75% after four years, on top of the previous 100% level available after five.\n\"It's really an acknowledgement of the fact that some of these small businesses do sell faster than expected,\" Swan said. \"It's a really big incentive to invest in American small businesses that a lot of people didn't see coming. … So hopefully that will be extremely stimulative for small businesses.\"\nThose provisions offer \"a little bit more leeway\" in that the \"company can be a little bit bigger to qualify,\" Doyle noted. While the fact that the company must be a C-corporation rather than a limited liability company to get the exclusion still poses some complications for startups, the new treatment of qualified small business stock will be a \"huge\" boon, he added.\nThat provision didn't receive as much attention as, say, the tense negotiations on the deduction for state and local taxes. But Swan has received several calls from advisors about it, she said.\n\"I had viewed it as a non-issue,\" Swan said. \"I just think we're all going to bring in our own snacks, but I was shocked by how many people called me.\"\nRegardless, the combination of the extension of the qualified business income deduction and the Senate's removal of a part of the House version of the bill that would have \"done a big scale-back\" of a so-called pass-through entity tax workaround for state and local taxes will likely prove advantageous to business owners in New York, California and Illinois, Swan said.\n\"People with pass-through entities who live in those high-tax states can still benefit,\" she said. \"I end up getting a lot more questions about PTET than I do about QBI.\"\nWhile they may be applicable to many non-business owners as well, other provisions of the law that expanded the opportunity zone credit and exemptions from the estate tax could affect many entrepreneurs and their families, Doyle noted.\n\"We encouraged people to do things before the end of the year because that exemption was supposed to sunset,\" he said. \"They've got certainty around what the exemption is going to be.\"","content_hash":"7e55162bac1669e7295b7e6ea09ce192","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4515,"method_rank":0}

But he also said that producing iPhones in the US remains \"unrealistic given the cost structure vs. Asia\/India and remains a fairy-tale concept. ... Apple will invest in Macs, AI, and a host of other tangential initiatives, but NOT core flagship iPhones being built in the U.S.\"\nBank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan and his team boosted their price target for Apple by 10 bucks to $250 while reiterating their buy rating.\n\"Given the recent development of Apple's increased investment in the US, it seems increasingly likely that several Apple products will be exempt from tariffs,\" the firm said.\nApple has the potential to gain smartphone market share in the U.S. \"if competitors are exposed to tariffs while iPhones were to remain exempt,\" he said.\nWhile the the specifics are still unclear, B of A said, Apple seems likely to be exempt from at least the announced 100% tariff on semiconductors if not totally exempt.\n\"If exempt, we believe estimates would be revised higher as Apple guided a $1.1 billion impact from tariffs for their [fiscal fourth quarter] after incurring $800 million in tariff-related costs in\" fiscal Q3, the investment firm said.","content_hash":"dcd264c92a3405dddca167c2f8ed6d99","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4445,"method_rank":0}

One morning, in a last-minute meeting, her boss started personally insulting Tripathi in front of her manager. She'd watched her coworkers experience similar bullying in the past — and decided to quit the job, where she earned a mid-five figure salary, on the spot, she says.\n\"Having a job everyone thinks sounds cool … [then] feeling like you can't reach any goals day-to-day is not easy,\" Tripathi, 32, says. \"You feel like a lie.\"\nThe second act of Tripathi's career is more authentic, fulfilling and twice as lucrative, she says. With a friend, she started writing and acting for a YouTube series, and over time, became a successful content creator, she says.\nTripathi started her most popular project, Brooklyn Coffee Shop, in June 2023. In the short videos posted to TikTok and Instagram, she plays a dry, uninterested barista who interacts with and often rejects a cast of stereotypical Brooklyn customers — a Pilates instructor, a guy who loves crypto — who try to order drinks like an unsweetened collagen lattes with unpasteurized goat's milk.\nSome episodes of the series are viewed over 3 million times.\nThe success of the series has helped land Tripathi personal social media brand deals, she says. She now earns more than twice what she used to earn as a fashion marketer, enough to quit her part-time jobs and focus on social media full-time in December 2024, she says.\nThe series is also starting to take on its own brand deals, she adds.\nThe risks and rewards of content creation\nTripathi had to take risks to get this far, she says. She had no experience writing comedies or acting before she left her fashion marketing job. She took on a roommate in her one-bedroom New York apartment to save money and worked part-time marketing jobs to cover the bills while she built a social media following in her spare time, she says.\n\"I had a very strong North Star, which was I needed another paycheck,\" she says. \"My mom would call me and remind me I wouldn't have health-insurance [once I turned 26] … I think there's a fear in the core of all Americans that if we don't perform, if we don't make money, we can't go to the doctor.\"\nJuggling multiple jobs while trying to succeed in an uncertain career path was mentally exhausting — but coming up with Brooklyn Coffee Shop felt natural, Tripathi says. In 2023, she spent 30 minutes discussing alternative dairy products, like water buffalo milk, with a friend and barista in a café.\nShe went home, set up her iPhone on a tripod and filmed herself acting out the conversation — playing both the barista and customer — in front of a makeshift greenscreen in her apartment, she says. That first installment of the series got over 1 million views, she says.\nThe production of the series looks much different now. Tripathi splits the production workload with her boyfriend, Sagi Shahar, who helps with sound design, and her friends like Nitay Dagan and Eyal Cohen, the series' director and cinematographer, respectively. Another friend adds in special effects, like kiosk screens that prompt fictional customers to tip over 200%.\nComedians like Kyle Gordon, Grace Reiter and Gianmarco Soresi now guest star as customers, too.\n\"We can only do [what we do] because everybody is so technically savvy,\" Tripathi says. \"Working with the guests [and crew] has been probably the single most rewarding thing about my entire career so far.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Those may charge an annual percentage rate, or interest, of up to 36%, according to NerdWallet.\nSome plans also charge fees for late or rescheduled payments, which can cost up to $15 or even 25% of the purchase value, according to NerdWallet.\nCredit cards can be pricier than buy now, pay later, experts say, but they have other advantages.\nLike some buy now, pay later plans, credit cards charge late fees and interest on unpaid balances. While some cards offer new cardholders brief interest-free offers on purchases, the average credit card interest rate is just over 20%, according to Bankrate.\nBut most cards typically offer purchase protections that you might not get from a buy now, pay later plan, said McBride.\n\"Paying with a credit card can make it easier to get your money back if the concert gets canceled,\" he said.\nSome cards offer rewards such as cash back, points or miles on purchases. About 65% of those who plan to attend a concert or festival this year said they will use credit card rewards to help pay for their costs, according to LendingTree's report.","content_hash":"5afb27a1d22c2278e5abbbb424de505c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4321,"method_rank":0}

The three major averages all climbed higher this week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 's 3.9% gain leading the way. The S & P 500 rose 2.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.4% in the same period. Investors seemed to shake off trade war worries , despite President Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs coming into effect on Thursday. CNBC Pro used its stock screener tool to identify the most overbought and oversold stocks on Wall Street as measured by their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks with a 14-day RSI above 70 are considered overbought, meaning that a pullback could be on the horizon. Conversely, a reading below 30 indicates that a stock is oversold and may be soon due for a potential rebound. The table below shows stocks with an RSI above 70 that have also risen at least 5% week to date, as of Friday morning. With an RSI of 72, one standout name on the list was Apple. The iPhone maker led this week's rally higher, gaining 13.3% on the week — its biggest weekly gain in more than five years — after announcing it will increase its U.S. investment by $100 billion . This comes after Apple already made a $500 billion commitment in February, taking its total combined investment to $600 billion. Apple's pledge to increase its domestic production has seemingly made it exempt from Trump's plans to impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips . On Wednesday, the president said that companies that are \"building in the United States\" would be spared from the new duties. \"We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon. \"But the good news for companies like Apple is if you're building in the United States or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge.\" This announcement was made after Apple's third-quarter earnings and revenue, released July 31, once again topped Wall Street's expectations . Overall revenue grew 10%, marking the company's largest quarterly revenue growth since December 2021. Alphabet, up 6.5% this week and with an RSI of 75, was another name on the most overbought list. In late July, the company reported a second-quarter earnings and revenue beat , with its overall revenue rising 14% year over year. Alphabet also said it would increase its 2025 capital investments by $10 billion due to \"strong and growing demand for our Cloud products and services.\" On the other hand, this week's most oversold names include Airbnb. The table below shows stocks with an RSI below that have also slipped at least 5% week to date, as of Friday morning. Coming in with an RSI of 29, Airbnb fell 5.3% this week. While the company's second-quarter results came in above expectations , Airbnb is forecasting a weaker second half of the year. In its third quarter, Airbnb guided for revenue to come in the range of between $4.02 billion to $4.10 billion, or a midpoint of $4.06 billion. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting $4.05 billion for the current quarter. Similarly, investors are bearish around The Trade Desk . The ad-tech company cratered 37% this week and now has an RSI of 25. Shares of The Trade Desk plunged 39% on Friday , notching its worst day ever. While the company posted a second-quarter earnings and revenue beat Thursday afternoon, investors grew concerned about rising competition from Amazon in the online ad market and the departure of CFO Laura Schenkein. During an earnings call, CEO Jeff Green also hinted at inflationary pressures stemming from Trump's tariffs. On Friday, a slew of analysts from shops such as Citi, Wedbush Securities, Bank of America and MoffettNathanson downgraded the stock. \"We downgrade TTD to Neutral from Buy as growth is coming in below our expectations and we have less visibility in the near-term growth algorithm,\" wrote Citi analyst Ygal Arounian. \"We still don't believe Amazon is the main factor here, but results will inevitably raise more investor questions around the competitive environment and will remain an overhang.\"","content_hash":"eaaee32fed69a8c63391c1ce27565873","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4289,"method_rank":0}

Most Fed officials have been more cautious about lower rates, given the potential they see that the Trump administration's tariffs could disrupt progress on getting inflation down to the Fed's 2% goal. In recent days, however, several Fed policymakers appear to have moved closer to supporting cuts.\n\"Taking action at last week's meeting would have proactively hedged against the risk of a further erosion in labor market conditions and a further weakening in economic activity,\" Bowman said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association.\nBowman's remarks leaned even more heavily into her concerns about a labor market downturn than reflected in her post-meeting explanation of her policy vote.\nThe Labor Department's monthly employment report last Friday showed the unemployment rate rose to 4.2% -- \"close to rounding up to 4.3%\" was how Bowman described it Saturday. The report also included revisions to previously published data, showing that job gains slowed sharply over the last three months to a monthly average of 35,000. \"This is well below the moderate pace seen earlier in the year, likely due to a significant softening in labor demand,\" Bowman said. \"My Summary of Economic Projections includes three cuts for this year, which has been consistent with my forecast since last December, and the latest labor market data reinforce my view.\"\nThe Fed has three remaining policy meetings scheduled for this year, in September, October and December. Economists typically point to 100,000 monthly job gains as being consistent with a steady-state labor market, though with big reductions in immigration since President Donald Trump began his second term in January that number is likely lower.\nBowman's full-throated support for rate cuts comes as Trump continues to pressure the Fed for easier policy, as he has all year. A search for a successor to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May, is underway with several candidates, including Bowman's fellow dissenter Christopher Waller, under consideration.\nBowman said on Saturday that she had begun arguing for a July rate cut at the Fed's June meeting. Trump has said the latest job figures were \"rigged\" and fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics shortly after the report was published.\nBowman repeated her longstanding view that large revisions make her cautious about taking too much of a signal from job-market reports, but on Saturday she said she sees \"the latest news on economic growth, the labor market, and inflation as consistent with greater risks to the employment side of our dual mandate.\"\nShe said recent inflation data has also boosted her confidence that the Trump administration's tariffs will not lead to persistent inflation.\nExcluding increases in goods prices related to tariffs, underlying inflation is \"much closer\" to the Fed's 2% target than the official reading of 2.8% in June, based on the 12-month change in the core personal consumption expenditures price index.\nTrump administration policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, will likely offset any economic drag or price impact from the import levies, Bowman said. With housing demand likely at its weakest since the financial crisis and the labor market no longer pushing up on inflation, \"upside risks to price stability have diminished,\" she said. Easing policy gradually from its current moderately restrictive stance would \"reduce the chance that the Committee will need to implement a larger policy correction should the labor market deteriorate further.\"","content_hash":"424e4d4241e44684ed527f8eb4e0bb7b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4029,"method_rank":0}

The company also said that its gross margin declined in the period primarily due to increased promotional activity, inventory adjustments primarily associated with the transition of the European market to a distributor, a higher mix of business from international distributors and a lower mix from retail stores, and increased per unit freight and duty costs in its direct business.\nEarnings for Q2 were in line with Allbirds’ expectations. For the second quarter, the company was expecting net revenue of between $36 million and $41 million. For analysts, they were expecting earnings in Q2 to be between $36 million and $40.8 million, according to Yahoo Finance.\nJoe Vernachio, chief executive officer of Allbirds, said in a statement that “strong execution” during the first half of the year has set the company up for what’s ahead this fall.\n“We are thrilled to be at the threshold of our product, marketing and customer experience initiatives coming together as we continue on our path to reigniting the Allbirds brand,” Vernachio said. “In the weeks and months ahead, we’ll be delivering a continuous flow of modern lifestyle footwear that is distinctively Allbirds — modern design, unique materials and unmatched comfort.

But he says these 2 'easy-money' assets will bring in ‘great wealth’. How to get in now\nEverything he thought he would have time to plan for caught up with him, and now, he’s worried he’ill never be able to retire.\nAt 50 years old, he doesn’t have a lot of time left to save. His total retirement nest egg is $60,000.\nWhen he had to quit his job to take care of his parents, it took a huge bite out of his savings. He left the job before he was fully vested, so he lost some of the employer contributions to his 401(k). He also made withdrawals from his 401(k), which came with penalties.\nLuckily, he owns his home and is ready to downsize, in order to lessen the burden of keeping up both an aging house and a big yard. Since the house needs some work, he thinks he would net about $400,000 if he sold it.\nJosh has now returned to the workforce, with a new job that brings in $40,000 a year. He wants to figure out how to maximize his savings and rebuild his retirement plan.\nDo I have to delay retirement?\nIt’s becoming more commonplace that Americans choose to delay retirement because they are in a situation like Josh’s.\nAccording to a recent survey by F&G Annuities & Life of 2,000 Americans over 50, 23% have already chosen to delay retirement — a jump from 14% in 2024. Reasons people gave for this decision included worries about having enough retirement savings, worries about inflation and fears of a stock market downturn.\nThe survey also found that 70% of respondents were considering or were delaying when they would leave the workforce.\nAnother survey by Northwestern Mutual found that 51% of respondents said it’s somewhat or very likely that their retirement savings could run out. When 4,500 Americans over 18 were asked how much they thought they needed to save to retire, the “magic number” was $1.26 million. But for those who have begun saving, 25% say they have a year or less of their annual salary in savings.\nHow much does the average American actually have saved? The most recent data, from the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, found the median retirement savings of Americans to be $87,000. A far cry from $1.26 million, but close to where Josh currently finds himself. Still, his savings are low for his age. According to the Northwestern survey, 52% of gen-Xers say they have three times their current annual income or less saved.","content_hash":"e3b709ff4ff0b7e6ec8825bcf74e3189","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3071,"method_rank":0}

DEO’s trailing and forward P\/E were 25.30 and 11.63 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nDiageo's turnaround story is increasingly compelling as the company transitions from vague ambition to sharply defined problem-solving under new leadership. Once dogged by low free cash flow, bloated capital expenditure, and distorted incentives that prioritized margin percentages over profitable growth, Diageo’s FY2025 results revealed a management team finally confronting root causes.\nWhile reported net sales were flat and adjusted EPS declined by 8.6%, free cash flow improved to $2.7 billion, supported by tighter working capital controls. The cultural shift—led by CFO Nik Jhangiani—is central, replacing rigid KPIs with commercial pragmatism and a focus on dollar profit pools rather than percentage margins. This operational reset is translating into concrete financial discipline: capex will fall from 7.7% of sales to a more sustainable mid-single-digit level, adding $200–300 million to FCF. Likewise, investment in maturing stock—a major drag—has begun to normalize, positioning Diageo for a multi-year earnings tailwind as aged inventory is monetized. Meanwhile, cost efficiencies through the “Accelerate” program and data-driven A&P allocation signal smarter—not leaner—brand investment.\nStrategy-wise, management is evolving beyond pure premiumization, reinvesting in Guinness with a 30% capacity expansion and broadening reach in tequila and RTDs. Risks remain: poor performance in Asia-Pacific, a dip in U.S. market share in 2H FY25, and broader macro headwinds. Yet, with a credible ~$3 billion FCF target for FY26, Diageo’s 15x P\/E valuation appears fair, balancing execution risk against turnaround potential. For the first time in years, Diageo is asking the right questions—and laying the groundwork for a financially sound, culturally aware recovery.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Diageo plc by Jimmy Investor in March 2025, which highlighted the company's premium pricing power, strong margins, and global diversification. The company's stock price has depreciated approximately by 2.1% since our coverage as the thesis didn't play out. The thesis still stands as core brand strength remains intact.

With growing participation in national security space programs and a surge in small satellite demand, Rocket Lab is positioned as a key contender in the commercial space race, securing contracts from NASA, DARPA, and the U.S. Space Force.\nFinancially, the company reported a 65% revenue increase over the last four quarters, underscoring strong top-line momentum. However, persistent negative earnings and free cash flow remain concerns, with a recent quarterly loss of $60.6 million, long-term debt of $404 million, and free cash flow of -$177 million. These figures highlight ongoing cash burn as Rocket Lab scales operations and executes on a heavy launch schedule.\nWhile RKLB has strong growth prospects and a diversified revenue base, the stock remains speculative until profitability improves. A sustained trend toward positive earnings over the coming quarters could present an attractive entry point, but near-term volatility and execution risk remain key considerations for investors.\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on Rocket Lab Corporation (RKLB) by Steve Wagner in May 2025, which highlighted revenue growth, defense contracts, and the upcoming Neutron rocket as key drivers. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 67% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out with strong backlog and successful launches. The thesis still stands as RKLB’s defense positioning remains intact. Denis Gorbunov shares a similar view but emphasizes financial challenges tied to profitability.\nRocket Lab Corporation is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 31 hedge fund portfolios held RKLB at the end of the first quarter which was 37 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of RKLB as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\nAs brutally high temperatures bake the nation this summer, cooling is becoming increasingly critical across commercial real estate property portfolios. Landlords are balancing soaring demand with rising costs, putting energy efficiency front and center.\nThe trouble is that most large building systems essentially run blind. Temperatures are set centrally, so they don't know if certain parts of the building are running too hot or too cold. That's why so many office workers sit at their desks wearing sweaters in the summer and then feel overheated in the winter.\nNow, new technology is taking on the challenge. Runwise, a New York-based technology company, invented its own hardware\/software platform to eliminate overheating in large buildings. It recently expanded that to cooling.\n\"We're trying to hit these climate goals, yet right in our literal building we're throwing money away every time you run a boiler when it doesn't need to run, you're wasting money and you're producing carbon emissions unnecessarily that really make nobody comfortable,\" said Jeff Carleton, co-founder and CEO of Runwise.\nThe company combines future weather algorithms with a wireless temperature sensor network that speaks to a Runwise central control system. That control analyzes the data and then operates the system more efficiently.\nFor example, a 100,000-square-foot building may have just one boiler, but it needs multiple temperature inputs. Runwise would put in 20 to 25 sensors, which take an average based on the user setting and future weather, and then figure out how often to run the boiler.\nThe tech is now installed in more than 10,000 buildings across 10 states, with roughly 1,000 customers, including major real estate owner-operators such as Related, Equity Residential, FirstService Residential, MTA, Port Authority, National Grid, Rudin, LeFrak, UDR, Douglas Elliman and Akam. Runwise claims to have collectively saved more than $100 million in energy costs to date.\nThe startup recently announced a $55 million Series B funding round led by Menlo Ventures, bringing its total funding to $79 million. Other backers include Nuveen Real Estate, Munich Re Ventures, MassMutual Ventures, Multiplier Capital, Soma Capital and Fifth Wall.\nCarleton said Runwise will use the additional funding to grow the business nationwide and, of course, to incorporate artificial intelligence into its systems.\n\"It's only going to become more and more ingrained in what we build, as we collect data from more and more buildings and build more advanced models on how to run them more efficiently,\" he said. \"We plan to use AI to continuously make our algorithms more efficient.\"","content_hash":"fc8d81911442fefdf0a4cebfb621c4c0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3036,"method_rank":0}

The tech-heavy Nasdaq advanced almost 0.4%, notching a record closing high for the first time this month.\nFortinet (FTNT) shares fell the furthest of any stock in the S&P 500, plummeting 22% in the wake of the cybersecurity company's earnings release.

The company highlighted strong growth in its medical segment, driven by gains in its medication management solutions and pharmaceutical systems. BD also saw sales growth in its interventional segment, reflecting a strong performance from its urology and critical care units, as well as its surgery and peripheral intervention businesses.","content_hash":"8df289137b8ca83682915bb4fa42a50c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3030,"method_rank":0}

IOT’s forward P\/E was 88.50 according to Yahoo Finance.\nSamsara (IOT) is a leading player in the Industrial IoT space, offering a Connected Operations Cloud platform that digitizes physical operations across fleet management, asset tracking, and industrial IoT. The company’s flagship fleet segment, anchored by a $1.54B ARR growing 31% YoY, is seeing strong enterprise traction with 154 new $100K+ ARR customers in Q1. Its industrial IoT and asset tracking segments are also gaining momentum, with major customers realizing multimillion-dollar savings from operational efficiencies. Samsara’s competitive edge stems from deep integration, strong switching costs, and AI-powered capabilities, including real-time diagnostics, predictive analytics, and advanced telematics.\nIts economic moat is narrow but strengthening, with switching costs and network effects forming key defenses. The company maintains a strong balance sheet, with $698M in cash and minimal debt, and has improved its operating and FCF margins significantly over the past year. While the company trades at a premium Forward P\/E of 90x and PEG of 3.6, this reflects its early-stage profitability and ~30% YoY revenue growth. Still, leading indicators like billings and RPO have decelerated, and revenue growth has moderated from previous quarters.\nSamsara has a projected TAM of $200B by 2026, with significant upside from AI-led innovation, international expansion (11% of revenue), and vertical integration with OEMs like Stellantis and Rivian. Despite some caution flags in leading indicators, Samsara’s valuation has pulled back to 12.55x forward EV\/Sales, below historical averages. With improving unit economics, strong customer retention, and expanding product breadth, Samsara remains a high-growth story with long-term upside and a modest current portfolio weight of 4.1%.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Samsara Inc. by Compounding Your Wealth in March 2025, which highlighted strong ARR growth, AI integration, and international expansion.

Subscribe to our free daily Nrn newsletter.\nAs Krispy Kreme reported double-digit revenue declines for the second quarter following the discontinuation of the McDonald’s partnership last month, the Charlotte, N.C.-based doughnut chain’s stock plummeted by 7%.\nIn the face of ongoing profitability challenges, Krispy Kreme CEO Josh Charlesworth outlined a four-part turnaround plan in Tuesday’s second-quarter earnings call. The plan included steps to refreanchise (particularly in international markets), focus on asset-light development, cut costs, and pursue long-term profitability.\nPart of this plan involves becoming a nimbler, franchising-forward company. For example, following the completion of the sale of Insomnia Cookies, Krispy Kreme also plans to reduce its ownership stake in the joint venture partnership with WKS Restaurants: one of Krispy Kreme’s largest franchisees in the U.S. With the proceeds from those deals, the company will be able to further pay down its growing debt.\n“Looking ahead, we have implemented a comprehensive turnaround plan aimed at unlocking our two biggest opportunities: profitable U.S. expansion and capital-light international franchise growth,” Krispy Kreme CEO Josh Charlesworth said in a statement. “This plan is designed to reduce leverage and deliver sustainable, profitable growth through refranchising, improving returns on capital, expanding margins, and driving sustainable, profitable U.S. growth.”\nOn the international expansion front, the company is refranchising and expects future growth in markets including South Korea and the Middle East to expand primarily through franchising and DFD (Delivered Fresh Daily) channels like convenience, grocery, and even additional quick-service partnerships. For example, in the United Arab Emirates, one franchisee has begun selling Krispy Kreme products at 50 KFC locations.\nIn the United States, Krispy Kreme appears to be reversing course on its prior focus on DFDs over hot light shops. The company is opening the first hot light theater shop in Minnesota and is in the process of closing approximately 1,500 underperforming DFDs (these will eventually be replaced with 1,100 higher-performing channels).\nThe marketing arm of Krispy Kreme is also getting back to basics, as the company redirects attention to its Original Glazed doughnut. Previously, Krispy Kreme had been mostly focusing on seasonal and promotional LTO doughnut collections.\n“In the U.S., our marketing focus has shifted to our original glazed donut: our most affordable, most profitable and most iconic product, typically sold by the dozen,” Charlesworth said. “We launched an all-new multimedia marketing campaign centered on the joy of experiencing a hot, fresh, Original Glazed which kicked off our National Doughnut Day in June. Early results are encouraging, with the campaign driving incremental sales and renewed excitement around our signature core offering.”","content_hash":"0401ac0efd467b717f267dbd2e662e7e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2977,"method_rank":0}

By the end of 1945, the death toll from acute radiation exposure had reached about 70,000.\nNagasaki's destruction came three days after a U.S. uranium-235 bomb destroyed Hiroshima. Japan surrendered on August 15, ending World War Two.\nAfter a moment of silence at 11:02 a.m., marking the time of the blast, Mayor Shiro Suzuki called on leaders to return to the principles of the U.N. Charter and show a concrete path toward abolishing nuclear weapons, warning that delay was \"no longer permissible\".\n\"This is a crisis of human survival that is closing in on each and every one of us,\" Suzuki told the crowd, estimated by Japanese media at 2,700.\nHe quoted the testimony of a survivor to illustrate the reality of a nuclear attack: \"Around me were people whose eyeballs had popped out... Bodies were strewn about like stones.\"\n\"Is it not this 'global citizen' perspective that will serve as the driving force behind stitching back together our fragmented world?\" Suzuki asked, calling for a solution based on mutual understanding and solidarity.\nThe U.S. military is believed to have chosen Nagasaki as a target due to its significance as a major industrial and port city. The city's geographical features, including its hilly terrain, were also thought to concentrate the blast.\nRepresentatives from 95 countries and territories, including nuclear superpower the United States, and Israel - which neither confirms nor denies having nuclear weapons - attended the annual ceremony at the Nagasaki Peace Memorial Park for the milestone year.\nRussia, which possesses the world's largest nuclear stockpile, was also represented.\nDaiji Kawanaka, a 14-year-old tourist from Osaka, echoed the mayor's sentiments.\n\"I truly believe a tragedy like this must never be repeated,\" he told Reuters, saying the anniversary prompts conversations about peace even among his young peers. \"We can only pledge to take the initiative ourselves in making a step toward peace.\"\nJapan's leading organisation of A-bomb survivors, Nihon Hidankyo, won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for campaigning for a world without nuclear weapons.\nSurvivors, known as \"hibakusha\", continue to suffer the effects from radiation and social discrimination. With their numbers falling below 100,000 for the first time this year, their stories fuel ongoing efforts to advocate for a nuclear-free world.\nJapan, the only country to have suffered nuclear attacks, has stated its commitment to nuclear disarmament but is not a signatory or observer of the U.N. treaty to ban nuclear weapons.","content_hash":"c85d2d65033e2e40135799e7e79742ba","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2974,"method_rank":0}

PLNT’s trailing and forward P\/E were 50.29 and 36.50, respectively, according to Yahoo Finance.\nPlanet Fitness (PLNT) appears to be entering Q3 2025 with renewed momentum following a solid Q1 membership gain of ~900,000 and seasonally normal Q2 trends. Multiple alternative data sources suggest accelerating consumer engagement heading into the core summer gym season. Mobile app usage is up year-over-year on both Android (+4.8%) and iOS (+5.9%), reversing softness from earlier in the year. Google Search interest and TikTok viewership related to Planet Fitness also surged in June and July, up over 9% and 44% YoY, respectively, while web traffic climbed 9.9% YoY after a prolonged decline.\nThis uptick aligns with several tailwinds: the company’s recent revamp of its higher-margin Black Card membership—featuring new perks and a family add-on—may be improving member retention and encouraging upgrades. Broader online fitness trends are also supportive, with gym and workout-related content seeing viral traction, historically a precursor to membership gains. Gen Z, the fastest-growing member demographic, is showing strong engagement through initiatives like the High School Summer Pass and is further amplifying brand visibility through word-of-mouth and content sharing on TikTok.\nThese trends have both volume and pricing implications, especially since new Classic Card sign-ups are priced at $15\/month, up from $10. Management has guided for 10% revenue growth in FY25, but current engagement signals suggest potential for upward revisions to the 11–12% range.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on UPST. Upstart Holdings, Inc.'s share was trading at $67.14 as of August 6th.\nUpstart Holdings (UPST) appears to be amid a meaningful turnaround, as evidenced by rising digital engagement and consumer interest. According to TickerTrends’ social and digital tracking tools, consumer interest in Upstart has surged +46.9% YoY, with a notable +12.9% uptick in just the past month, marking 37 consecutive weeks of growth. This resurgence coincides with improving sentiment around Upstart’s core proposition—using AI-driven models to assess creditworthiness beyond traditional FICO scores.\nAfter a challenging 2023, when higher interest rates and tighter bank lending conditions hindered loan origination, Upstart is now benefiting from a shifting macro backdrop. Consumer demand for credit remains strong, while traditional banks have grown more conservative. As a result, many borrowers are migrating toward alternative platforms like Upstart that offer streamlined, digital approval experiences.\nThis is especially relevant as credit card APRs stay elevated, prompting consumers to explore personal loans for debt consolidation or managing higher living costs. Upstart’s underwriting model, which purports to approve more borrowers with lower default rates than legacy systems, has become increasingly attractive in this environment of cautious capital deployment. While the company has not yet revised its guidance, such strong digital demand often precedes improving financial metrics.\nWith signals pointing to a likely rebound in loan originations and marketplace revenues in the latter half of 2025, the upcoming earnings call will be critical. If Upstart can translate digital interest into economic throughput, investors could be looking at a reacceleration narrative with potentially material upside.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Upstart Holdings, Inc. by Unconventional Value in March 2025, which highlighted the company’s AI-driven credit models, data advantage, and structural improvements.

Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) all reported second-quarter earnings, and while they were mostly positive in different ways, artificial intelligence (AI) continued to be a strong trend. That's great news for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) investors. Let's see what's happening and why investors should get excited about what Nvidia will have to say when it reports quarterly earnings later this month.\nWinning with AI\nAI has become an enormous growth driver for tech companies, and really all kinds of companies. It unlocks productivity and aids in creativity in ways that make it essential if a company doesn't want to be left behind.\nAmazon said that its AI business through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division continues to grow at triple digits year over year, \"with more demand than we have supplied for at the moment.\" It's launching all sorts of new features as demand grows and changes, and releasing powerful new tools aimed at developers creating large language models and in need of the highest-power AI chips. It also boasted that it rolled out new EC2 instances, a type of virtual server on the AWS cloud supported by new Nvidia Blackwell \"super chips,\" the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) on AWS.\nAmazon spent $31.4 billion on capital expenditures, which it says is a reasonable estimate for the back half of the year. Although that could be in many parts of the business, it said the AI business is where most of it is going. That means it could be spending even more than the original $100 billion it said it would spend in 2025.\nMicrosoft boasted that its Azure cloud business is grabbing market share, up 34% year over year in the 2024 fiscal fourth quarter (ended June 30), and that it now has 400 data centers, the most of any other cloud business. Management highlighted that while there's industry talk about the first gigawatt or multi-gigawatt data centers, it launched two gigawatts of power in its data centers over the past 12 months, and it's scaling faster than the competition.\nAt Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed many exciting developments in AI, including the launch of Meta Superintelligence Labs, which combines all of the company's AI efforts, and progress on upgrades to its Llama LLMs. In April, Nvidia announced its own involvement in the new Llama developments. Zuckerberg said Meta is working on the next generation of products \"that will push the frontier in the next\nyear or so.\" Meta has made headlines over the last few weeks as it crafts a team of AI specialists it's been pulling from rival companies.","content_hash":"41ebb9ba76c935249224918e0ba3f518","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2948,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on ETSY. Etsy, Inc.'s share was trading at $56.20 as of August 6th. ETSY’s trailing and forward P\/E were 45.32 and 16.18, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nEtsy appears to be turning a corner after several quarters of weak Gross Merchandise Sales (GMS) performance, with early indicators pointing to stabilization and potential growth. TickerTrends’ forecast for Q2 2025 GMS stands at $2.76 billion, matching Etsy’s own guidance and implying a –5.8% year-over-year decline—an improvement from Q1’s –6.5%. While still a modest decline, the week-over-week upward revisions in forecasts and positive trends in high-frequency alternative data suggest the bottoming of GMS may be underway.\nGoogle search interest in Etsy and Depop has turned positive year-over-year, app usage has seasonally outperformed since April, and global website traffic, though still down, has improved by roughly 200 basis points. This data supports the case for better-than-feared Q3 guidance, with a potential $2.80B GMS guide equating to ~$652 million in revenue—above Wall Street’s current estimate of $641 million.\nEtsy’s take rate guidance of 23.3% implies ~$643 million in Q2 revenue, in line with street expectations. With discretionary consumer exposure pressuring the stock in recent months, real-time digital activity trends may now be reversing that narrative. If Etsy delivers stable Q2 revenue and offers strong Q3 guidance, investor sentiment could shift meaningfully, removing downside fears and paving the way for a re-rating. The improving trend in consumer engagement across platforms signals a potential inflection point for the business. For investors, this quarter could mark the beginning of a more constructive outlook, with left-tail risks to GMS and revenue expectations diminishing.\nPreviously, we covered a bearish thesis on Etsy, Inc. by Kostadin Ristovski, ACCA, in November 2024, which highlighted slowing GMS, poor acquisitions, and rising marketing costs. The company's stock price has appreciated by approximately 8% since our coverage. This is because GMS trends stabilized. The thesis still stands as structural issues remain.

Since she no longer communicates with her ex-fiance, she isn’t sure how to fix her situation, so she called into The Ramsey Show to find out what her options are.\nBoth Janelle and her ex are on the mortgage and property deed.\n“We’re four months behind,” she told the show’s cohosts, and while they’ve been trying to sell the home and recoup their losses, so far they haven’t had any takers — and they still have $465,000 left on the mortgage.\nWhen the romance is dead — but the mortgage lives on\nNow, Janelle says they’re “in the process of asking the mortgage company for a short sale to see if that’s even possible.”\n“I don’t see a way out of this unless you guys can find a way to sell it before it forecloses,” cohost George Kamel said. “That’s going to be your best bet — just trying to sell this thing ASAP even if you have to lower the price.”\nFirst, however, they need to get caught up on their mortgage payments and try to avoid foreclosure. While her ex tried to float the mortgage for a few months, he’s now stopped making payments. Janelle also stopped paying her share when she moved out because she’s paying rent elsewhere.\nBut when your name is on the mortgage, that reasoning doesn’t fly.\nJanelle brings home about $6,000 a month after taxes, pays about $2,400 in rent and still has money leftover for her expenses, which include putting money into her 401(k). She also has about $4,000 in savings.\n“We need to pause all of that,” Kamel advised. “You need to act like everything is on fire. And you need to work on getting out of this house mess and paying off your debt.”\nThey’re about $12,000 in arrears on their mortgage, so they need to “both put some skin in the game” to get caught up on payments. That means giving up any expenses that aren’t necessary — including investments — until they’re out of this hole.","content_hash":"c8e16969e84eb5231d8536b6d343270f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2916,"method_rank":0}

Are you getting ‘highballed’ too?\nIf owning a home is the American Dream, property taxes could be a rude awakening for many dreamers. Opinion surveys gathered by the National Council of State Legislatures in 2023 found that property taxes were “the most hated tax” in the country, because of the lump-sum payments involved and the lack of control taxpayers have over the size of this liability.\nUnfortunately, a recent analysis by ABC News and its affiliates found another reason to hate the tax: It unfairly impacts some homeowners more than others. According to the report, families in certain neighborhoods pay a disproportionate amount of property taxes and that could be putting them at greater risk of missing payments and losing their homes.\nHere’s a closer look at this shocking discovery and whether you could be living in one of these ‘highballed’ neighborhoods too.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

But he says these 2 'easy-money' assets will bring in ‘great wealth’. How to get in now\nHighballed property taxes\nIn general, property taxes are based on the local government’s assessment of a home’s value. However, real estate valuation is highly subjective and experts told ABC News that a tax assessment of a home could be misaligned with its fair market value.\nIt’s this subjective gap in valuation that’s unfairly impacting some communities. According to ABC’s analysis of ATTOM and U.S. Census Bureau data, homeowners who live in predominantly black or brown neighborhoods tend to pay higher taxes than their counterparts in predominantly white neighborhoods.\nOn average, a homeowner in a white neighborhood receives a property tax assessment that is 70% of their home’s fair market value. For owners in black or brown communities, the assessment is 80% on average.\n\"We tend to see then, African American and Latino communities are paying higher tax rates,\" University of Chicago Professor Christopher Berry told ABC News7, explaining that the systematic overassessments could be the result of lower fair market values in these communities.\nThis heavier tax burden could be putting some vulnerable members of racialized communities at great risk of losing their homes. Like 70-year-old Baltimore resident Bonita Anderson, who lost her home in 2022 after falling behind on her property taxes by just $5,000. \"I sat down and thought, 'Oh my god, I'm 70 years old and I'm homeless,'\" she told ABC News.","content_hash":"fdfab9f5db218fa0107ca5bde60b9635","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2880,"method_rank":0}

The company offers a unique position as a defensive investment in an otherwise volatile stock market. While some investors seek to capitalize on market fluctuations, others prioritize stability and predictable cash flows—qualities that Lockheed Martin delivers consistently.\nApproximately 92.5% of its revenue is derived from government contracts, primarily with the U.S., providing a strong foundation of security and reliability. Further reinforcing this stability is a record backlog exceeding $166 billion in signed contracts, ensuring predictable revenue streams and visibility into future earnings. This robust pipeline underpins Lockheed Martin’s ability to generate steady cash flows, sustain operations, and continue its long-standing commitment to shareholder returns.\nThe company has increased its dividend for over 22 consecutive years, reflecting financial discipline and resilience. Currently, Lockheed Martin offers a dividend yield of about 3.14%, complemented by an average share buyback yield of 3.3%, making it an attractive option for income-oriented investors. This combination of predictable government-driven revenue, strong backlog, and consistent capital returns positions Lockheed Martin as a reliable choice for those seeking stability and long-term value amid broader market uncertainty.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) by Steve Wagner in April 2025, which highlighted strong Q1 results, a $173 billion backlog, and strategic ISR expansion.

However, the latest round of industrial restructuring appears to be a pared-down version of the sweeping supply-side reforms launched a decade ago that were pivotal in ending a deflationary spiral.\nThe producer price index fell 3.6% year on year in July, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Saturday, missing economists' forecast of a 3.3% slide and matching the near 2-year low recorded in June.\nExtreme weather and global trade uncertainties contributed to price declines in some industries, Dong Lijuan, NBS chief statistician, said in a statement.\nHowever, on a month-on-month basis, PPI shrank 0.2%, improving from June's 0.4% drop.\nDespite the headline figures, some analysts see signs of easing deflationary pressure. Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist at ANZ, pointed to improvements in month-on-month PPI and year-on-year core CPI.\nHe expects the current \"anti-involution\" policy measures - aimed at curbing disorderly competition in sectors like autos -to begin lifting year-on-year PPI from August.\nStill, other analysts remain cautious, noting that without demand-side stimulus or reforms to improve people's welfare, the measures may have limited impact on final demand. A prolonged housing downturn and fragile trade relations with the U.S. also continue to weigh on consumer spending and factory activity.\nChina's consumer price index was flat year-on-year in July, compared with a 0.1% rise in June, NBS data showed, beating a Reuters poll forecast of a 0.1% slide.\nCore inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, was 0.8% in July from a year earlier, the highest in 17 months. Food prices fell 1.6%, following a 0.3% decline in June.\nExtreme weather added to the economic strain, with sweltering heat gripping much of China's eastern seaboard last month and heavier-than-usual downpours lashing the country with the East Asian monsoon stalling over its north and south.\nOn a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.4%, against a 0.1% drop in June and exceeding forecasts for a 0.3% rise.\n\"Nonetheless it is still unclear if this is the end of deflation in China,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.\n\"The property sector has not stabilized.

The S&P 500 is sitting near all-time highs after a 28% rally since early April and 57% gains since ChatGPT was announced in November 2022.\nMeme stocks are ripping, suggesting investor sentiment is abnormally elevated. Excitement around AI has also driven up market valuations to levels consistent with prior major bubbles, like those seen in 1929 and 2000.\nTom Essaye, the founder of Sevens Report whose clients include advisors at some of Wall Street's biggest firms, recently addressed the topic in a couple of client notes.\n\"Every bubble in modern market history has been based on a narrative, whether it be the internet or real estate. Critically, that given narrative is widely perceived by the investment world to be a source of unlimited earnings growth across most market sectors,\" he wrote in an August 1 note. \"Today, that potentially bubble-inflating theme is unquestionably AI technology.\"\nAs Essaye sees it, the best way to measure the health of the AI trade is to look at how semiconductor stocks overall are behaving, as chips are the lifeblood of AI technology. One can do this using the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX), a group of 30 stocks, he said.\nComparing the index's performance to the S&P 500 over the last couple of years shows \"this bull market in equities has a serious problem,\" he said.\nThe concern for Essaye is that SOX still sits below its July 2024 highs while the S&P 500 has risen by almost 14% over that time. This suggests the market's rally, which is largely being fueled by the AI narrative, could be in an unhealthy place if many AI stocks themselves are failing to keep up their momentum.\n\"The takeaway here is that if AI remains the primary source of bullish optimism for a continued rally in the broader stock market in the months and quarters ahead, this market is in trouble and at risk of rolling over sooner than later as the SOX should still be leading the market higher like it was in 2024, not lagging considerably over the last 12 months,\" he wrote. \"That divergence in index performance is meaningful, and if we see the SOX roll over in the weeks or months ahead and start selling off materially, the S&P 500 will almost certainly not be far behind.\"","content_hash":"e44e9e1fc87ba94cd26baef9704f1182","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2822,"method_rank":0}

But he says these 2 'easy-money' assets will bring in ‘great wealth’. How to get in now\nIncome thresholds for the senior deduction\nThe Trump bill — which was enacted in early July — introduces an additional tax deduction for taxpayers who are 65 or older. The deduction could be up to $6,000 for an individual tax filer and up to $12,000 for a married couple if both spouses qualify.\nHowever, age isn’t the only criteria that determines eligibility — the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is also a critical factor. There are specific income thresholds built into the new rules that determine the actual amount of deduction you and your partner can claim.\nFor instance, individuals earning a MAGI of $75,000 or under can access the full deduction. Beyond that amount, the deductions are phased out gradually and, for anyone earning more than $175,000, the deduction is fully phased out.\nSimilarly, joint filers can expect to see a lower deduction if their combined MAGI is above $150,000 and could see none of the deduction if MAGI is more than $250,000.\nGiven that the IRS considers income from Social Security as part of the MAGI calculation, claiming benefits early could put you and your partner over some of these income thresholds.\nIf you earn a relatively high income from other sources and are between the ages of 65 and 70, not only will you have lower benefit payments because of claiming Social Security early, but you could also diminish some of these attractive seniors' deductions over the next few years.\nLet’s use an example to illustrate this: Jamie and her partner are both 65 years old and earn a combined income of $145,000. At this level, they qualify for the full $12,000 in seniors deduction.","content_hash":"23ea2e8d3718bf1fca7795e4e2ba095a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2783,"method_rank":0}

(NYSE:W) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:\n“We fully exited Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W) in May after owning it for about four years. We had given the company plenty of rope to right the ship and return to growth, but it has been unable to do so. It is hard to pin down exactly why they’ve been able to gain share (i.e. grow faster than the market, i.e. shrink less than the market), but not grow in absolute terms. The succinct summary is that we believe Wayfair does not have a differentiated enough value proposition to be a secular winner. It can be an “alpha” winner by slightly outperforming its end market, but it is not disruptive enough to grow through choppier periods. We were extra patient with Wayfair because of the exceptionally severe industry headwinds it faced, but enough time has passed to convince us that it is more “alpha” than “secular.”\nWe sold Wayfair at what was likely an inopportune price during the recent tariff-induced drawdown. However, our approach is to exit whenever we lose faith instead of hoping to sell at a higher price. In truth, this process of losing faith began in the second half of 2024 and it took me a disappointingly long time to arrive here. Even though we lost money on the Wayfair investment, we certainly earned some precious scar tissue that will surely help our idea filtering and portfolio sizing processes in the future.”\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of W as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

How to get in now\nLet’s say you’ve recently lost a loved one, and while sifting through an old filing cabinet you stumble across a bundle of stock certificates tucked into a folder. Maybe they’re for a household name like Walmart or IBM, dated sometime in the early ’90s. You have no idea if they’re still valid, what they’re worth, or what to do next.\nWhat exactly did you find, and how do you cash it in? Here’s what you need to know to assess the value, understand the process and avoid leaving money on the table.\nHow to find out what your paper stock is worth\nTo figure out whether your certificate still holds value, start by examining the company name, the number of shares and the date. If the business still exists, you’ll want to look up its investor relations department or check a reputable financial site to confirm it’s publicly traded. But if the company has changed names, merged or been acquired, things can get trickier. Your stock may have morphed into shares of another firm, or if the company went out of business the shares may be worthless. Take note of the registered owner’s name and the CUSIP number, which is crucial for tracking a stock’s history.\nAt this point, you’ll want to contact the present-day company’s transfer agent. These firms handle stock ownership records and can confirm whether the certificate is valid, whether the shares have split and what they’re worth today. An agent will likely ask for the information above and may help you trace any corporate actions that have affected its value over time. If you inherited these stocks, they may assist with transferring ownership, as long as you have supporting documentation, such as a will or death certificate.","content_hash":"209689f9cfa075e22a5d079d35b2c9d7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2769,"method_rank":0}

Known for his disciplined value investing and plainspoken wisdom, Buffett has shaped the mindset of generations of investors with his annual Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)(BRK.A) shareholder letters. Among his most enduring insights is the succinct observation: “Nothing fails like success.”\nThis phrase, first penned in Buffett’s 1982 letter, encapsulates a core principle of business and investing psychology: the paradox that success, if not approached with caution and humility, can become the root cause of eventual failure. At the time, Buffett was describing the structural weaknesses of industries with commodity-like products — such as textiles and insurance — where temporary prosperity often leads to overcapacity, price wars, and long-term decline. His point was not just theoretical. Berkshire Hathaway itself was once a struggling textile manufacturer, and a cautionary example of how short-term wins can mask deeper vulnerabilities.\nMore News from Barchart\nBuffett’s 1982 warning was rooted in a simple, yet powerful observation: success tends to attract capital, competition, and overconfidence. In industries where differentiation is minimal and pricing power is limited, sustained profitability often leads to a flood of new entrants or expansion by incumbents, eroding margins and stability. Today, the quote serves as a reminder that enduring success requires discipline, restraint, and a deep understanding of economic fundamentals — traits that are often sidelined by the euphoria that accompanies growth.\nBuffett’s authority on the subject stems from decades of capital allocation experience and a demonstrated track record of identifying both overvalued trends and undervalued opportunities. His investment philosophy, shaped by mentors like Benjamin Graham and honed through years of navigating boom and bust cycles, consistently prioritizes intrinsic value over short-term momentum. When Buffett warns of the hidden dangers of success, it comes not from cynicism, but from firsthand observation.\nThe principle remains relevant today, especially in modern markets characterized by rapid innovation, investor enthusiasm, and record-breaking valuations. Tech cycles, SPAC booms, and speculative bubbles often follow the same trajectory: early success leads to a rush of capital and participants, inflating valuations until fundamentals either catch up — or collapse. Companies may become complacent, prioritizing scale over sustainability, or mistaking luck for strategic brilliance. In such environments, Buffett’s words offer a grounded counterbalance.","content_hash":"99a921ebe493dbf3b97658218db931e7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2767,"method_rank":0}

But, there are wealth-building strategies you can employ, regardless of your income, to set yourself up for financial success in 2025.\nFor instance, Bank of America’s 2024 Study of Wealthy Individuals reported that 31% of investors with $3 million in investable assets believe real estate is the “greatest growth opportunity.”\nWith this in mind, it’s no surprise that the top three states for income listed above also have some of the highest home prices in the country.\nResidential real estate isn’t the only growth area, however.\nCommercial real estate can also offer lucrative investment opportunities — especially when it comes to necessity-based properties, such as grocers. CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate firm, foresees both positive developments and growth for the 2025 commercial market.\nAccredited individual investors can invest with First National Realty Partners to access institutional-quality commercial real estate investments without the legwork of finding deals themselves.","content_hash":"1d2bbb0fc5513d57751d7ed81a10d0f6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2754,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on TEVA. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited's share was trading at $15.71 as of August 5th. TEVA’s trailing and forward P\/E were 872.00 and 6.05, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA close-up shot of various types of medicines on a table, illustrating the specialty and generic products offered by the pharmaceutical company.\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries has quietly delivered its 10th consecutive quarter of growth, raising 2025 revenue and EPS guidance while reaffirming other targets, underscoring the success of its “Pivot to Growth” strategy. This transformation is driven by three pillars: maximizing innovative products, reigniting R&D, sustaining its generics powerhouse, and streamlining operations. Innovative drugs Austedo, AJOVY, and UZEDY are leading the charge, with Q2 2025 revenues up 19%, 31%, and 120% year-over-year, respectively, and full-year outlooks raised.\nCombined, these products are projected to drive revenue from $2.3 billion in 2024 to over $5 billion by 2030. Teva’s late-stage pipeline adds further upside, with olanzapine LAI and duvakitug offering multi-billion-dollar peak sales potential. Financial discipline is another hallmark of the turnaround, with net debt reduced from $34 billion in 2017 to $15.1 billion by Q2 2025 and leverage at 3.09x, on track for 2.0x by 2027. Credit ratings have improved as refinancing extended maturities at favorable costs, enhancing flexibility for reinvestment and future capital returns.\nDespite these achievements, Teva trades at a forward P\/E of 6.1x versus industry averages of 8–12x, with EPS projected to nearly double by 2028, creating significant rerating potential. While risks remain, including IRA pricing pressure on Austedo and high short interest, management expects continued growth even under discount scenarios. With innovative products gaining traction, a robust pipeline, a strengthened balance sheet, and a valuation that suggests the market has yet to price in its transformation, Teva offers a compelling turnaround story with substantial upside for long-term investors.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited by Kontra in May 2025, which highlighted its shift toward innovation, strong growth from Austedo, AJOVY, and UZEDY, and cost reductions under the “Acceleration Phase.” The stock has depreciated about 7% since then due to short-term concerns. The thesis remains valid as deleveraging and pipeline strength persist. Kontra updates their view, including “Pivot to Growth” strategy , product pipeline and re-rating potential.","content_hash":"d34587175017d62376af408521be91e7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2751,"method_rank":0}

Some of them are big winners, while others aren't. United Parcel Service (NYSE: UPS) falls squarely into the latter category.\nShares of the package delivery giant have plunged more than 30% year to date, with the sell-off intensifying after the company's second-quarter update last week. Here are four reasons I'm still keeping my eye on UPS stock right now.\n1. The dividend\nI'd be lying if I said the dividend wasn't the primary thing about UPS that's capturing my attention. The stock's forward dividend yield now stands at 7.57%. Such a juicy yield is hard to ignore.\nThe obvious question, though, is whether or not UPS' dividend is sustainable. CEO Carol Tomé thinks it is. In the Q2 earnings call, she said: \"UPS is rock-solid strong, and so is our dividend. The UPS dividend is backed by solid free cash flow and a strong investment-grade balance sheet.\"\nPerhaps the most striking thing Tomé said, though, was that management understands \"how important the dividend is to our investors.\" She added, \"[Y]ou have our commitment to a stable and growing dividend.\"\n2. Tariff impact\nThe economy has yet to feel the full brunt of the Trump administration's tariffs. However, UPS is already experiencing some tariff-related pain. Tomé expressed her opinion on tariffs bluntly in the Q2 call, stating, \"Trade follows policy, and generally, tariffs are not good for trade.\"\nI'm watching to see how UPS adapts to the new normal of high tariffs. The company is already dancing to some extent. For example, its most profitable trade lane is between China and the U.S. The average daily volume for this trade lane fell by 34.8% year over year in May and June. But UPS' volume from China to the rest of the world jumped 22.4% in Q2. The company also almost doubled its capacity in the India-to-Europe trade lane to meet growing demand.\n3. Amazon glide-down\nSome might view UPS' decision to slash its business with Amazon by 50% as crazy. I suspect the move might instead be crazy like a fox. Why? I expect UPS to emerge as a more profitable business.\nThe main hitch in the Amazon glide-down so far is that UPS' staffing attrition rate hasn't been as high as anticipated. However, the company initiated a voluntary separation program for its full-time U.S. drivers. As drivers (and especially the higher-paid ones) begin to leave at the end of this month, UPS should start seeing significant cost reductions.","content_hash":"1fb3227f3be8da996184625179f3da99","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2750,"method_rank":0}

Institutions found to have encouraged politicized or unlawful debanking will face remedial actions, including fines or consent decrees, according to the order.\nThe order also calls for bank regulators to strike a particular kind of risk assessment from their guidance and supervision efforts known as reputational risk. Two federal bank regulators — the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — have already eliminated reputational risk as part of their bank examination programs. The FDIC has signaled it plans to follow suit.\nThe Small Business Administration will also be tasked with requiring institutions to take efforts to reinstate customers previously denied services unlawfully.\nThe order did not lay out further details for how the investigative efforts by regulators will unfold, including which lenders these agencies will choose to scrutinize first.\nThe order is another boon to crypto, which during the Biden era, was flagged by regulators as a higher-risk industry for lenders. It also reflects how the president’s own interests continue to shape policymaking this year.\nOn Tuesday, President Trump claimed that the country’s two largest banks — JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) discriminated against him and other conservatives by denying them services. He cited his own personal experience as an example.\n\"The banks discriminated against me very badly,” Trump said in a Tuesday morning interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\nThe president is far from the only entity carrying the Trump name that has claimed denial of banking services.\nEarlier this year, the Trump Organization sued major credit card lender Capital One (COF) for allegedly debanking hundreds of its accounts following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol in Washington, D.C.\nThe bank has since said the lawsuit failed to include any facts to back the claim that the moves were politically motivated.\nFor years, conservatives have claimed that US banks have denied accounts to certain customers for political reasons. Crypto companies and their executives have also claimed they have lost or were denied banking services; Coinbase Global executives have shared several accounts.","content_hash":"5770ebbccfcafa54236f9c4325572d63","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2748,"method_rank":0}

Sid explained that he had $35,000 in cash sitting around—separate from his emergency fund—and no debt except his mortgage. He was thinking about putting that cash toward solar panels before the federal incentive expired.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90\/share.\n-\nAccredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM—Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8\/14\nDave Ramsey confirmed that the tax credit on solar panels is set to expire at the end of the year under the One Big Beautiful Act, backed by President Donald Trump. But he quickly cautioned Sid against making a rushed decision.\n\"Solar needs to have a break-even of six years or less,\" Ramsey said. Sid estimated his break-even point at eight to nine years after a $22,000 net cost with the credit. Ramsey didn't hesitate: \"Don't do it.\"\nWhy? Because solar is a fast-moving technology.\n\"Eight years ago, solar technology was substantially different than it is right now. Eight years from now, it will be substantially different than it is right now,\" Ramsey explained. \"People don't use 8-year-old technology for hardly anything.\"\nCo-host John Delony agreed and pointed out how quickly technology has changed even in household items like TVs.\nTrending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30\/share.\nCash Only, No Exceptions\nRamsey was explicit that if solar makes financial sense in your region and you can pay cash, it might be worth it. But debt is not an option. \"It never makes sense to buy solar on debt,\" he said. \"Do you have the cash to do this?\"\nIn Sid's case, he did. But Ramsey still advised against it.\nWith the 30% tax credit expiring, Ramsey predicts a shake-up in the solar industry. \"The solar people have based their business on tax law. Now they're going to have to base it on economics,\" he said. \"Either the cost of solar panels is going to have to go drastically down, or the business goes away,\" Delony added.","content_hash":"91f5d8848a7d5430622724c4cf1cb64c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2746,"method_rank":0}

The move came largely after the news broke that Joby announced the expansion of its manufacturing site in California and, in doing so, doubled its aircraft production capacity. In addition, Joby expanded a facility in Ohio that will manufacture and test components. It's an important development for two main reasons.\nJoby Aviation expands manufacturing capacity\nFirst, it's a sign of growing confidence in its ongoing certification process. The latest news on that front came from the recent announcement that Joby is \"preparing for final assembly of its first conforming aircraft intended for Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) flight tests\" with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\nManagement expects to complete its first TIA flight this year as it moves toward final certification.\nSecond, the news is particularly important for the company because of its vertical integration strategy. In this case, \"vertical\" means management is primarily designing and manufacturing its eVTOL components in-house. This differentiates it from eVTOL competitors like Archer Aviation or Vertical Aerospace, which have technology partners. As such, Archer and Vertical Aerospace both believe their business models should result in a quicker certification process and with less risk attached.\nHowever, it seems Joby is leading the field in terms of FAA certification, and expanding its manufacturing capacity helps de-risk the stock from one of investors' most significant fears: the possibility that its vertically integrated model will create manufacturing issues for a young company.\nToyota's and Uber's involvement is key\nWhile Joby has a vertically integrated model, it also has investment from and a manufacturing alliance with Toyota. The Japanese car company has invested $894 million in Joby, and Toyota is working with Joby to help optimize its manufacturing processes.\nIn addition, Uber has invested $125 million in Joby so far, with the eVTOL company acquiring Uber Elevate. This is a key part of Joby's overall business model, which involves owning and operating its own fleet of aircraft and offering transportation services (air taxis) itself rather than selling aircraft to other operators.","content_hash":"7868bf06ea2f269e2f57c9cd9637a821","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2745,"method_rank":0}

However, the company has seemingly taken a step back in the past few years as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom has boosted the value of many other big tech companies.\nIn the past three years, Apple's stock is only up around 30%, making it the second-worst performer of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks (trailing only Tesla) and underperforming the S&P 500. That's not something investors are used to seeing from Apple.\nDespite Apple seemingly lagging behind, there could possibly be a breath of fresh air coming to the company, sparking new life into the stock.\nA much-needed rebound for the iPhone and Mac products\nApple's fiscal third-quarter earnings, for the period ended June 28, were a pleasant surprise for many people. Its revenue grew nearly 10% year over year to $94 billion, which is a June quarter record for the iPhone maker. And speaking of iPhone, the smartphone's revenue grew 13% year over year to $44.6 billion, which Apple noted was driven by the popularity of the iPhone 16 family.\nMac (which includes products like MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac, and Mac Studio) revenue grew 15% year over year to $8 billion, but iPad and wearables, home, and accessories sales were noticeably down -- 8% and 9% year over year, respectively.\nStill, Apple's hardware revenue grew by 8% year over year and accounted for nearly 71% of its total revenue for the quarter. Apple's services segment reached an all-time high, bringing in $27.4 billion, but hardware remains -- and will likely remain -- king for the company.\nApple's year-over-year revenue growth was its highest in the past three years.\nIs Apple finally getting serious about AI?\nThe big cloud hanging over Apple's business has been AI (what it calls \"Apple Intelligence\"), and the lack of urgency in the space compared to rivals like Alphabet and Microsoft. It seems Apple is beginning to take it more seriously and address this issue.\nA major advantage on Apple's side is the number of devices it has in people's pockets, homes, and offices. Ideally, Apple can integrate AI into its various hardware, giving people even more of a reason to choose it over competitors. This has been the plan for a while, but it hasn't gone as smoothly or as quickly as most people thought or hoped.","content_hash":"64f24cffa06a497517a9a0047180d5ff","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2725,"method_rank":0}

SIMO’s trailing and forward P\/E were 32.36 and 21.60, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nAn engineer in a lab coat tweaking a circuit board with intricate semiconductors.\nSilicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO) is a fabless semiconductor company specializing in NAND flash memory controllers, which manage data storage between host systems and NAND memory. SIMO benefits from a capital-light model and outsources manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor. The company is positioned for significant growth through new product introductions targeting AI data centers (DCs), high-end PCs, and mobile markets.\nThe NAND market, currently near trough levels post-COVID, is stabilizing as AI-driven demand accelerates and competitors prioritize DRAM and HBM development, reducing NAND controller innovation and creating opportunities for SIMO. Industry consolidation has left SIMO, Phison, and Marvell as the main merchant suppliers, but SIMO’s focus on advanced controllers positions it favorably, especially as it enters new niches like AI DCs.\nKey growth drivers include Montitan, an enterprise SSD controller for AI data centers, which offers 14GB\/s read\/write speed at 40% lower power and uses cost-efficient QLC NAND. Montitan already has six design wins, including two tier-1 customers, and represents a multi-billion-dollar TAM. SIMO is also introducing PCIe5 controllers for high-end PCs, winning four of six major flash makers, and UFS 4.0 products for mobile, driving higher ASPs.\nAdditionally, SIMO is qualifying controllers for Nvidia DPUs, opening another high-margin segment. These innovations could boost EPS to $7 by 2026, implying $118\/share upside with net cash versus ~$70 today, and potential for $175+ in a bullish scenario. The company also has $8\/share cash, possibly rising to $13 if it collects a $160M breakup fee from MaxLinear. With catalysts including strong 2H25 results and potential settlement, SIMO offers asymmetric upside with limited downside risk.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI) by Stock Analysis Compilation in December 2024, which highlighted its leadership in high-growth semiconductor markets and strong R&D investments. The stock has depreciated about 2.62% since, as the thesis has not yet played out. The thesis still stands given robust industry trends. Motherlode shares a similar view but focuses on SIMO’s growth from AI-driven NAND controllers and new product launches.","content_hash":"1c6e8388ef1cab4a15c5e4888b62a974","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2724,"method_rank":0}

ROP’s trailing and forward P\/E were 37.78 and 29.24, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nAn engineer in front of a computer screen, reviewing a project-based outsourcing proposal.\nRoper Technologies has evolved from an industrial company into a software-driven business, with 75% of revenue now coming from software while maintaining select industrial operations in specialized niches such as medical and water systems. The company operates a decentralized model, acquiring high-quality, defensible businesses with strong cash-on-cash returns, negative working capital, and recurring revenues.\nAs a serial acquirer, Roper enjoys significant optionality, focusing on larger, higher-quality targets compared to peers like Constellation Software, which supports stronger organic growth and superior fundamentals. The company reinvests cash into new verticals and acquisitions, positioning itself to benefit from secular software growth trends. AI represents both an opportunity and a risk, as it accelerates innovation and creates new acquisition targets, while potentially disrupting existing portfolio companies.\nRoper’s cash conversion is exceptional due to its recurring revenue model and low CapEx requirements, resulting in cash flow exceeding accounting profits. Leadership alignment is solid, with the CEO holding a $250 million stake and 96% of compensation tied to performance, though the reliance on adjusted EBITDA for annual incentives is a minor concern. Margins have improved at the gross level, but an increasing gap between EBIT and EBITDA, driven by larger deals and amortization of intangibles, is a key watchpoint.\nWhile leverage stands at 2.7x net debt\/EBITDA—slightly higher than ideal—the company has a track record of deleveraging quickly after large acquisitions. Overall, Roper’s strategy of acquiring niche software businesses, combined with strong cash generation and exposure to long-term secular trends, provides a compelling investment case despite margin and leverage considerations.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP) by D Invests in February 2025, which highlighted its shift to a software-driven model, disciplined M&A, and strong recurring revenues. The stock has depreciated about 6.21% since then due to valuation concerns. The thesis still stands given robust cash generation and capital allocation.

The first major crypto legislation to become a law, it regulates stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar.\nFor those unfamiliar, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that strives to keep its value stable, in comparison to usually volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, by being pegged to a fiat currency or a commodity.\nTrump believes his latest move would encourage the global adoption of the USD-pegged stablecoins and hence cement the dominance of the American national currency in international trade. The president's enthusiasm is understandable, given that the USD's share in the trade payments has been eroding over the past few years.\nJoin the discussion with CryptosRUs on Roundtable here.\nThe Financial Times reported in August 2024 that while the USD payments declined from around 80% in 2010 to 40% in 2024, the renminbi payments rose from nearly zilch in 2010 to around 55% in 2024.\nThe renminbi or RMB is the national currency of China, the arch rival of the U.S. in trade. As the Trump administration attempts to recover the lost ground with USD-pegged stablecoins, China seems to be planning a similar move despite its skepticism around cryptocurrencies.\nOn Aug. 6, Financial Times reported that China is planning to launch its first stablecoins pegged to the renminbi. Since the country exercises a crypto ban throughout the mainland, Hong Kong is the testing ground of the project.\nThe region recently passed a law that lets licensed issuers launch stablecoins backed by any fiat currency. However, the authorities will permit only a “handful” of licenses starting in 2026, the report added.\nHow could it impact the dollar?\nStablecoins may look like just another crypto token, but they’re actually a powerful tool of monetary influence.\nWhen Tether issues new stablecoins, it backs them with reserves that include real-world U.S. dollar assets. As of June 30, Tether holds over $127 billion in U.S. Treasuries (including $105.5B direct and $21.3B indirect), making it one of the largest holders of American debt globally.\nThat demand flows straight into U.S. financial markets. It’s why Washington, through laws like the GENIUS Act, is embracing USD-pegged stablecoins.\nChina's crypto dilemma\nChina's dilemma is crystal clear: how to embrace the crypto economy amid the challenge of controlling its financial system.\nThe FT report cited Rebecca Liao, CEO at the blockchain firm Saga, who remarked, “This is not technology that can be centrally controlled...

This goes back nearly seven decades to when he was running an investment partnership and continues to this day as the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.\nA few months ago, he announced his plans to retire as the company's CEO at year-end. Investors shouldn't take that as a sign the Oracle of Omaha's investing prowess has slipped, however.\nAmong Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings, long-held Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Domino's Pizza (NASDAQ: DPZ) stand out. Fortunately, you don't need a lot of money to invest in the two companies.\nYou can start investing in each one with small sums. Here's what makes them attractive.\n1. Coca-Cola\nCoca-Cola first started selling soda in 1886. It has survived by adapting to consumer tastes. It now sells other beverages, such as water, juice, and plant-based beverages, in more than 200 countries.\nDividends remain one of the main attractions for investors. Earlier this year, the board of directors raised the quarterly payout by more than 5% to $0.51. The company has now increased payments for 63 straight years, making it a Dividend King.\nShareholders will earn a nice dividend yield. The stock's 3% yield easily bests the S&P 500 index's 1.2%.\nThose looking for breakneck growth should search elsewhere since Coca-Cola is a mature company. That's reflected in management's long-term goals, which include 4% to 6% revenue growth and a 7% to 9% increase in operating income, both adjusted for certain items like removing foreign currency translation effects.\nCoca-Cola has been meeting these goals. Second-quarter revenue increased 5%, driving a 15% operating income rise.\nThe combination of solid earnings growth and higher dividends makes Coca-Cola's stock an attractive investment based on its total return potential.\n2. Domino's Pizza\nDomino's Pizza has grown into the world's largest pizza chain with more than 21,500 locations. It franchises about 99% of its locations. This low-cost model allows Domino's to collect royalty fees based on a percentage of the franchisee's sales.\nSince opening its first restaurant in 1960, Domino's Pizza continues to resonate with customers based on its affordable prices and convenient locations offering pick-up and delivery options. Management's MORE strategy aims to produce more sales, more profits, and more stores in a smart way. This includes focusing on providing delicious food, and offering customers convenience, consistency, efficiency, and competitive prices.","content_hash":"d1f6d74882ab0bc14376434a1785668c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2718,"method_rank":0}

Programs like FHA loans and first-time buyer tax credits provide support for qualifying buyers. The mortgage interest deduction also remains available for many homeowners, according to the IRS.\nStill, buying a house requires a significant upfront investment.

The average price of a new car remains over $48,000, according to Kelley Blue Book (KBB), and loan rates have increased across the board.\n“Car prices remain high due to supply chain disruptions and the shift to electric vehicles is calling into question the resale value of conventional cars,” Grunnah explained. “Gas-powered vehicles are at risk of accelerated depreciation.”\nLearn More: The Cheapest Place To Buy a Home in Every State\nThe average new vehicle loses about 55% of its value within the first five years, according to KBB.

U.S. home prices have appreciated about 8% to 9% per year over the past five years and about 6% to 7% annually over the past decade, according to NCHStats.\nGrunnah recommends keeping car purchases modest. “A good used car in the $15,000 to $20,000 range is adequate for transportation needs without the massive depreciation hit of buying a new car,” he said. “The plan preserves money for the ultimate home purchase, which builds wealth in the long term.”","content_hash":"045afd6cad448967792996921ce368da","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2708,"method_rank":0}

Limited (CATL) for its forthcoming Chevrolet Bolt EV model.\nThis will support GM's EV rollout while it advances its US battery manufacturing capabilities with partner LG Energy Solution.\nThe decision, initially reported by The Wall Street Journal, involves a two-year period during which GM will source lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from CATL.\nProduction of the latest Bolt model is scheduled to commence at the Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas towards the end of this year, with the vehicle anticipated to arrive at dealerships in 2026.\nGM's choice to import batteries from China reflects the challenges automakers face in balancing cost with the implications of existing US tariffs. These tariffs, recently introduced by President Donald Trump's administration, add a financial burden to imported goods, including EV components, according to Bloomberg.\nGM said: “To stay competitive, GM will temporarily source these packs from similar suppliers to power our most affordable EV model.”\nCATL’s technology is said to offer an affordable alternative to batteries containing higher amounts of nickel and cobalt.\nIn an effort to strengthen its supply chain, GM has entered into a multi-year contract with Noveon Magnetics, a provider based in the US, for the supply of rare earth magnets.\nThese magnets are essential for a variety of vehicle applications, including GM's range of trucks and SUVs. The partnership with Noveon has already commenced, with the initial delivery of magnets occurring last month.\nPreviously, GM experienced a significant decline in earnings, attributing a loss of $1.1bn in the second quarter to the adverse effects of trade tariffs.\nThe company indicated that efforts to offset these impacts were largely ineffective. Consequently, net earnings fell to $1.9bn, a decrease of more than 33% compared to the previous year, even though the number of vehicles sold worldwide increased from 1.43 million in the second quarter of 2024 to 1.54 million in the same period of 2025.\n\"GM to import CATL batteries for Bolt EV amid tariff constraints – report\" was originally created and published by Just Auto, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

As of 2:17 p.m. ET, shares traded up around 44% to $66 per share.\nThe IPO market stays hot\nAfter several big IPOs including Figma last week, the IPO market stayed hot with Firefly Aerospace, which is now approaching a $10 billion valuation out of the gate.

Now, U.S. President Donald Trump's demand that Tan resign over his ties to Chinese firms will only distract him from that task, two investors and a former senior employee said.\nTrump said on Thursday that Tan was \"highly conflicted\" due to his Chinese connections. Reuters reported exclusively in April that Tan had invested in hundreds of Chinese firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military.\nTan may now have to mount an effort to reassure Trump that he remains the right person to revive the storied American chipmaker, pulling his focus away from the cost cuts he's trying to implement.\n\"It is distracting,\" said Ryuta Makino, analyst at Intel investor Gabelli Funds, which, according to LSEG data, owns more than 200,000 shares in Intel. \"I think Trump will make goals for Intel to spend more, and I don't think Intel has the capabilities to spend more, like what Apple and Nvidia are doing.\"\nAI chip market leader Nvidia and iPhone-maker Apple have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to expand domestic manufacturing, which, according to Trump, will bring jobs back home.\nUntil recently, Intel had emerged as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the 2022 CHIPS Act, as former CEO Pat Gelsinger laid out plans to build advanced chipmaking factories.\nTan, however, has significantly pared back such ambitions, as the company's goal of rivaling Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC's contract manufacturing chops have fallen short.\nTan said last month that he would slow construction work on new factories in Ohio and planned to build factories only when he saw demand for Intel's chips, a move that is likely to further strain relations with Trump.\nThe company, its board and Tan were making significant investments aligned with Trump's America First agenda, Intel said in a statement on Thursday, without any mention of Trump's demand.\nThe statement was \"bland\", said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Intel shareholder Aptus Capital Advisors, which owns Intel stock through index funds.\n\"Either defend your leader, which will be the beginning of a difficult road ahead, or consider making a change,\" Wagner said. Having this play out over a few months is not something that Intel can afford, he said.\nTan himself released a statement late on Thursday. \"The United States has been my home for more than 40 years.

And its year-to-date performance (as of Aug. 4) still isn't good: It's down 31%. But in the past three months, the stock has rallied by around 23%, as it's showing signs of life again.\nIs it just the stock's low valuation that is enticing tech investors to take a chance on Marvell, or are there catalysts behind the recent rally, which could potentially help send its value even higher in the future?\nEasing U.S.-China relations has made investors bullish\nOn June 26, Marvell's stock hit highs of more than $80, approaching levels it hadn't been at in months. That was the day the U.S. and China agreed to a trade deal involving rare earth minerals, and which signified an improvement in relations between the two countries.\nFor Marvell, that's a big factor to consider when investing in the business, as China accounted for 37% of its revenue in the most recent quarter (which ended May 3). And sales to Taiwan totaled another 17%, which means that more than half of its revenue is tied to that region. The company says that 74% of its shipments are to customers that have operations in Asia. As a result, tariffs and geopolitical issues may weigh more on Marvell than they might on other chipmakers.\nStrong demand from tech giants is likely to continue\nMarvell makes application-specific integrated circuits, which are custom chips that help large tech companies manage their artificial intelligence (AI) demands and workloads. The business is vulnerable, however, to the large tech players. And some investors and analysts worry about the potential for growing competition in the custom chip market, and the possibility that will diminish some of Marvell's growth. Plus, if economic conditions deteriorate, tech companies may cut back on some of their aggressive AI spending.\nRecently, however, an analyst report from investment firm Fubon suggested that Microsoft, one of Marvell's key customers, was finding internal chip work difficult, highlighting why the easiest option for the tech giant may be to simply rely on Marvell rather than making its own chips. And with Microsoft still investing heavily in AI, that means Marvell could be poised to benefit from those plans. Fubon suggested that due to its potential upside, Marvell wasn't a good stock to short at around $70. Ironically, in doing so, it created a bullish case for owning shares of the tech company.","content_hash":"10d6ae5dd1cca328b5f3e282644c9140","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2668,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on BRKR. Bruker Corporation's share was trading at $32.07 as of August 5th. BRKR’s trailing and forward P\/E were 61.67 and 13.14, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nA scientist in a laboratory wearing safety gear while operating a mass spectrometry machine.\nBruker Corporation (BRKR) delivered its second-quarter earnings after issuing preliminary results in late July, reaffirming the significant challenges facing the company this year. The primary headwinds remain the sharp decline in U.S. academic and government research funding, with NIH budgets under pressure, and uncertainty around U.S. trade policy. These issues, flagged earlier in the year, have intensified, forcing BRKR to revise guidance downward once again after already lowering expectations in Q1.\nThe company now estimates NIH funding to be down about 15% year-to-date, with Q2 seeing the steepest impact. This has weighed heavily on demand for high-end research instruments, particularly from U.S. pharma and industrial clients, while delays in releasing stimulus funds have further softened Chinese academic orders. Although tariffs have recently begun to see some resolution, visibility remains limited.\nThe market’s reaction has been predictably harsh, punishing the stock for negative earnings momentum and uncertainty. Management admits prior optimism was misplaced when characterizing Q1 guidance as a “floor with upside,” given how sharply conditions have deteriorated since then. Nevertheless, Bruker’s long-term fundamentals remain intact, and CEO Frank Laukien emphasized the company’s ability to control what it can—continuing to invest in innovation and maintaining leadership in life science tools.\nWhile near-term pressures persist, Bruker remains a critical player in enabling advanced research, and its management has historically adapted well to cyclical funding challenges. For investors with patience, the current dislocation may offer an opportunity once funding and macro conditions stabilize.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Bruker Corporation by FckYouMoney in May 2025, which highlighted temporary margin pressure, weaker China demand, and reorganization costs masking strong fundamentals and undervaluation.

BlackSky hit the revenue target, barely, but reported a quarterly loss of $1.27 per share.\nBlackSky Q2 earnings\nRevenue declined 11% year over year, with imagery orders rising nicely, but lumpier \"professional and engineering services revenue\" falling steeply. Net losses quadrupled year over year, a fact the company blamed on a large loss on derivatives contracts.\nThe per-share loss didn't increase quite as fast as the net loss, due to BlackSky selling a lot of shares (to raise cash) in the quarter, resulting in a much larger share count that spread out total net losses among more shares outstanding. Thus, the per-share loss increased \"only\" 144%.\nIs BlackSky stock a sell?\nWas there any good news to report? Actually, yes, although it took some hunting to find it. Way down at the end of the earnings report, on the cash-flow statement, BlackSky noted that through the first half of this year it's generated positive free cash flow of $11.9 million. The company did note that it spent $10.8 million in cash on \"satellite work in process,\" however. If considered a capital expenditure (and to be conservative, we probably should consider it capex), that would cut FCF for the first half to just $1.1 million.\nThat's not great, but at least it's positive.\nStill, with a $620 million market capitalization, falling sales and deeply negative earnings, it's hard to call BlackSky stock a buy right now.

Data showing higher-than-expected inflation could undermine the growing expectation for impending interest rate cuts.\n\"I do think the market is set up for a bit of a pullback,\" said Dominic Pappalardo, chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar Wealth. \"There's a lot of concern bubbling underneath.\"\nThe S&P 500 has surged 28% since its low for the year in April, as investor fears about a tariff-induced recession calmed after President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement earlier that month had set off extreme asset volatility.\nThe index is trading at over 22 times its earnings estimates for the next year, well above its long-term average P\/E ratio of 15.8 after recently reaching its highest valuation in over four years, according to LSEG Datastream.\nInvestors are also wary of risks posed by the calendar.

TickerTrends forecasts $239.12M in Q2 revenue for Alani Nu, implying a 64% YoY growth and pushing CELH’s combined market share above 17%. Yet, the market remains uncertain, largely due to differing revenue recognition methodologies—Alani books revenue on delivery (GAAP), while Circana tracks consumer scans at registers—creating a consistent disconnect between scanner data and reported sales. Complicating matters, Alani Nu’s business model heavily depends on Limited-Time Offerings (LTOs), which cause spikes not always mirrored in scanner data.\nTickerTrends' forecast leans on alternative data signals: search traffic to Alani Nu’s website surged from February through June, topping 430,000 monthly visits—a 27% MoM increase—indicating heightened brand engagement. This correlates well with scanner data trends shown in Celsius’ Q1 results, which noted consistent sequential sales growth. Additionally, the release of high-performing LTOs like Sherbet Swirl and Cotton Candy in Q2—both showing strong search and sell-through momentum—should materially boost reported revenue.\nSocial media is another key factor: user-generated content and brand mentions have doubled since December, with TikTok and Instagram followings surging. This viral traction fuels in-store demand and repeat engagement. While it remains difficult to precisely quantify Q2 revenue due to accounting complexity and lack of prior standalone benchmarks, TickerTrends’ data suggests significant organic growth and sales momentum, offering a clear directional edge for enterprise investors navigating this transitional period.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Celsius Holdings, Inc. by One-Hovercraft-1935 in May 2025, which highlighted strong brand equity, international growth, and strategic acquisitions like Alani Nu.

Copper projects alone could reel in $5.2 billion by 2030, if they reach the government's projection of producing 521,000 metric tons a year.\nThe copper projects are concentrated in the northern province of San Juan, which some call the \"Vaca Muerta of copper,\" an allusion to Argentina's shale oil and gas field the size of Belgium.\nSan Juan enacted a compensation program in 2022 that could help get infrastructure built. It allows mining companies that develop road or energy infrastructure to be repaid with mining royalties if provincial legislators deem the project a \"public utility.\" Miners normally pay royalties to governments.\nThe Vicuna project, from global miner BHP and Canada's Lundin, hopes to use the provision, said Vicuna's Argentina director Jose Morea.\n\"That speeds up investments that the private sector is currently in a position to make ... which the provincial government would probably have to defer otherwise,\" he said in an interview.","content_hash":"f3c69d7ae1f6bcb05dc97a0f1449a4e0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2644,"method_rank":0}

The magnitude of the divergence is unusual and mirrors a similar blowout earlier this year when fears over potential US tariffs created large price dislocations.\nNew York futures typically trade in lockstep with the London spot price. Gold in New York surged to an all-time high at $3,534.10 an ounce before paring some gains. Prices in London were little changed at $3,396.04.\nOne-kilo and 100-ounce gold bars — which are deliverable against the majority of contracts traded on the Comex in New York — should be classified under a customs code subject to levies, rather than in a tariff-free category, according to a July 31 letter from the US Customs and Border Protection agency seen by the FT.\nThe news raised uncertainty about the status of gold in President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda. His administration had exempted the precious metal from duties back in April, causing the futures premium to collapse at the time and ending a massive arbitrage trade that pulled nearly 850 tons of bullion into New York warehouses as traders raced to capitalize on large price differences.\nThere is widespread confusion over whether the latest customs apply to imports from Switzerland, which has so far failed to clinch a trade deal with the US, or to all imports of one-kilo bars, said David Wilson, senior commodities strategist at BNP Paribas SA. Managers at two major refineries in Asia, who did not want be named discussing sensitive information, are pausing all shipments to US until there is more clarity.\n“People I’ve been speaking to feel that this is an error on the CBP’s part, that they’re misclassifying gold.” But “if this is correct, this is quite a dramatic change,” he said.\nThe US imports large volumes of gold from Switzerland, the world’s biggest gold-refining hub. where 400 ounce bars are recast into smaller 1-kilogram ingots that can be delivered against futures contracts on the Comex exchange in New York via the “exchange for physical” mechanism or EFP.","content_hash":"1c786761f5d1cd384199a6d09123af70","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2643,"method_rank":0}

Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) limits access to its stores to people who have paid a membership fee.\nThis is a huge dynamic shift in retail, but the depth of the change this has on the business may be bigger than you think. Here's one little-known fact you can't overlook with Costco.\nCostco is a club store\nClub stores aren't unique. Costco competes with others in the space, including Walmart's Sam's Club division. But overall, club stores are a niche of the broader retail sector. The big difference between a regular retailer and a club store like Costco is the membership fee that customers pay for the privilege of shopping at a Costco or any of its direct competitors.\nThis is not a small difference. In fact, it is gigantic. For investors, one of the most important metrics to watch with Costco is its membership renewal rate, which generally hovers around 90%. That makes the membership fees an annuity-like income stream.\nIf you look at the company's top line, however, you might think that this isn't a big deal. In the fiscal third quarter of 2025, Costco generated total revenue of roughly $63.2 billion. The vast majority of that came from product sales, with only around $1.2 billion, or less than 2%, derived from membership fees.\nDigging into the details with Costco's costs\nFrom a big-picture perspective, then, Costco's membership fees are barely a rounding error. But that's not the whole story. Membership fees don't really have any costs associated with them, while product sales do.\nFor example, the cost of the merchandise it sold in the fiscal third quarter of 2025 was just shy of $55 billion. Then there were the costs of operating the company's stores. Sales, general, and administrative costs came in at roughly $5.7 billion in the quarter. The gross profit here was just about $2.5 billion, with almost all of the costs coming from the products themselves and the cost of operating stores.\nThis is where things start to get interesting. If membership fees have little cost associated with them, then fee income basically drops right down into gross profit. Since the gross profit was around $2.5 billion and the membership fees tallied up to $1.2 billion, these fees accounted for around half of Costco's gross profit. And that income, assuming the company can keep its membership renewal rate high, is an incredibly valuable annuity-like income stream.","content_hash":"522a1893b0bb0d57044afbec77e0f805","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2641,"method_rank":0}

And this is precisely the reason why Bailey voted to cut on Thursday – with alarm bells ringing across the country.\nThe UK economy shrank in both April and May, first by 0.3pc and then by a further 0.1pc. Meanwhile, unemployment has also risen to a four-year high of 4.7pc.\nWeakness across the labour market has led to the number of job adverts having fallen for the longest period on record in the last two decades, prompting experts to warn of a “hiring recession”.\nBy one provisional measure, there are now 178,000 fewer payrolled employees than a year ago.\nHowever, the lack of attention devoted to the struggling jobs market was notable during Thursday’s meeting, says Alan Monks at JP Morgan.\n“It was remarkable how much the statement downplayed the recent loosening in the labour market,” he says.\n“It shows that the MPC has become more rattled by the optics of high headline inflation.”\nYet a faltering job market is clearly a risk that rate-setter Alan Taylor is worried about, as he went against the grain to vote for an outsized 0.5 percentage point cut.\nBy contrast, four of the panel were reluctant to take their foot off the brake at all as they voted to hold at 4pc.\n“Policymakers are visibly worried about a more persistent bout of inflation as the headline number is way higher than target,” warns James Smith, at Dutch Bank ING.","content_hash":"ce062005a4c65035ed87eda526425762","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2636,"method_rank":0}

Not only were the numbers generally stronger than analysts had been looking for, but the company also is growing in all the right ways and has big plans.\nWith that in mind, here are some of the key takeaways from SoFi's earnings report that you need to know, and what to keep an eye on.\n1. Growth momentum isn't slowing down\nIn the second quarter, revenue growth was 44% year over year, an acceleration over its prior rate. The company grew its membership base by 34% year over year, adding 846,000 new members, the highest single-quarter total ever.\n2. Capital-light revenue streams are strong\nSoFi has been a personal lender for years, but the recent focus has been on the loan platform business, which consists of several capital-light streams of fee income. In addition to securitizing loans and selling them to investors, the company has been originating a high volume of loans on behalf of third parties and referring applicants to other lending partners. Its loan platform is generating high-margin fee income at a rate of more than $500 million annually on a run rate of $9.5 billion in loan originations.\nFee-based revenue now makes up 44% of the company's total, compared with 27% a couple of years ago, and this shift is a big reason for SoFi's surprisingly strong profitability. Noninterest income roughly quadrupled year over year, and the loan platform business has been the primary driver.\n3. Profits are better than expected\nNot only did SoFi produce better-than-expected profitability in the second quarter, but the company also reported its highest earnings per share (EPS) ever. It produced an 11% adjusted net margin, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 80% year over year.\nAnd management raised its full-year 2025 guidance for all major profitability metrics and now expects EPS to more than double from 2024 levels.\n4. Asset quality is improving\nSoFi's loan net charge-off rate ticked higher in 2023 but it has been in a clear downward trend for nearly two years. Since it peaked at 3.98% in late 2023, the net charge-off rate for personal loans has declined to 2.83%, including a 48-basis-point sequential drop in the most recent quarter.","content_hash":"a25e24feafe3db845d5cee3f437625c3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2630,"method_rank":0}

This move marks one of the largest deals in the cybersecurity sector, aimed at strengthening Palo Alto Networks’ portfolio in identity and access management.

Roughly 12,200 TCS middle and senior management jobs will be lost.\nThe industry, which has played a crucial role in creating a middle class in India, is increasingly seeing AI being used for everything from basic coding to manual testing and customer support.\nThe sector employed 5.67 million people as of March 2025 and accounted for over 7% of India's GDP. It has a huge multiplier effect due to the direct and indirect jobs it creates and the cars-to-homes consumption it drives in the world's fifth-largest economy.\nIt has historically absorbed a majority of India's engineers but that will change as rising AI use ekes out more efficiencies and demands newer skills that many current employees lack, according to half a dozen industry veterans, analysts, and staffing firms.\n\"We are in the midst of a massive transition that will transform white-collar work as we know it,\" said Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research founder and chairman Ray Wang, echoing other experts who warned that more layoffs are likely on the cards.\nThe most vulnerable employees include pure people managers with minimal tech knowledge, those in charge of testing or identifying bugs and ensuring user-friendliness before delivering software to clients, and infrastructure management staff who provide basic tech support and ensure networks and servers are working well, experts said.\n\"About 400,000 to 500,000 professionals are at risk of being laid off over the next two to three years as their skills don't match client demands,\" tech market intelligence firm UnearthInsight's founder Gaurav Vasu said, adding that about 70% of those layoffs would impact workers with 4-12 years' experience.\n\"This (fear stemming from TCS layoffs) may hurt consumer demand for tourism, luxury shopping and even delay long-term investments such as real estate,\" Vasu said.\nTCS and its peers Infosys, HCLTech, Tech Mahindra, Wipro, LTIMindtree, and Cognizant collectively employ over 430,000 workers with 13 to 25 years of experience, according to staffing firm Xpheno.","content_hash":"0679bff819c44106e11bf3c25c58be28","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2626,"method_rank":0}

When the two Boston-based institutions announced the $1.1 billion, all-stock deal in December, they indicated they would choose a new name for the consolidated company.\n\"The Beacon Bank name reflects our desire to be a reliable guide in financial decision-making, helping clients reach their goals with clarity, confidence, and trust,\" Brookline CEO Paul Perrault said Wednesday in a press release.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on BRC. Brady Corporation's share was trading at $71.14 as of August 5th. BRC’s trailing P\/E was 17.57 according to Yahoo Finance.\nBrady Corporation (NYSE: BRC) operates in the essential identification and safety products segment, offering solutions such as industrial labels, signage, printers, and software that support compliance and workplace safety across industries like manufacturing, healthcare, and utilities. This niche positioning provides a durable competitive moat, underpinned by recurring revenue and strong recession resilience, while its largely tariff-resistant nature adds defensive layer. The company’s valuation appears compelling, trading at approximately 17.3x trailing earnings and 14.6x forward P\/E—both notably below its 10-year average of over 25x.\nIts EV\/EBITDA multiple of 11.2x is slightly under historical levels, and a PEG ratio of 1.3 suggests fair, if not discounted, growth pricing. Financially, Brady demonstrates robust fundamentals: return on equity near 18%, ROIC comfortably exceeding WACC, and a conservative payout ratio of 26%, leaving room for consistent dividend growth. While revenue expansion has leaned heavily on acquisitions, organic growth remains subdued, which could explain part of the valuation discount.\nNevertheless, the company maintains stable margins, generates solid capital returns, and operates with a conservative balance sheet, signaling operational discipline and resilience. Given its strong cash generation and underleveraged profile, the current valuation may reflect market underappreciation rather than structural weakness. With a combination of defensive characteristics, room for further capital returns, and the potential for multiple re-rating if organic growth improves, Brady offers a compelling case for investors seeking stable, quality businesses at reasonable valuations. The question remains whether muted organic growth justifies the discount or creates an opportunity for long-term upside.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NSSC) by Value Chaser in April 2025, which highlighted its transition to high-margin recurring revenue, strong balance sheet, and attractive valuation. The stock has appreciated about 40% since then as the recurring revenue model strengthened. The thesis still stands, given continued margin expansion. Max061980 shares a similar view but emphasizes Brady’s defensive niche, valuation discount, and strong capital returns.","content_hash":"2d7c58145245f15d423843308b25d9f4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2623,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on IIPR. Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc.'s share was trading at $52.29 as of August 5th. IIPR’s trailing and forward P\/E were 10.08 and 13.44, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nInnovative Industrial Properties (IIPR) is an industrial and retail REIT focused on leasing greenhouse and industrial space to licensed cannabis operators in the U.S., with a portfolio spanning 8.3 million square feet across 19 states. The company’s model, centered on sale-leasebacks, enabled rapid growth between 2019 and 2021 as cannabis operators sought capital they could not access through traditional financing.\nThese deals offered operators large upfront payments and IIPR high initial yields of low- to mid-teens, resulting in a cost basis of roughly $281 per square foot, significantly above industrial replacement costs of $75–150 per square foot. This strategy now faces pressure as cannabis market fundamentals weaken amid oversupply, falling prices, and mounting competition.\nTenant distress is emerging as a critical risk. In the past nine months, four tenants, including IIPR’s largest, defaulted on leases representing 27% of annualized base rent, with many others showing severe financial strain. Restructurings have already led to meaningful rent reductions, such as a 37% cut for PharmaCann. Re-tenanting properties at current contractual rents appears unlikely, and intrinsic value for alternative uses is far lower, given rural locations, older assets, and Class B\/C quality.\nFinancial implications are significant: pro forma assumptions suggest AFFO payout ratios exceed 100%, necessitating a potential dividend cut of 24–40%. On a sum-of-the-parts basis, applying a 15% cap rate and factoring in further tenant defaults implies NAV per share of $39—over 30% downside from current levels. With elevated execution risk, sector headwinds, and limited re-leasing prospects, IIPR faces a challenging path ahead, making it a compelling short candidate.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on STAG Industrial, Inc. (STAG) by Steve Wagner in May 2025, which highlighted strong leasing spreads, disciplined asset recycling, and resilient demand from e-commerce and logistics. The stock has appreciated about 6% since then as fundamentals have remained solid. Tahoe88 shares a contrarian view on Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIPR), emphasizing tenant distress, flawed sale-leaseback economics, and significant downside risk.","content_hash":"809ed6ac34d39189a2d5fe79d7c15cd6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2609,"method_rank":0}

You've done amazing things for somebody your age,” he said. Jeremy had completed 30 jobs in two years, pulling in over $2 million.\nStill, Ramsey was adamant that Jeremy had to shift gears.

To determine if micro-retirement is right for you, he said it’s important to assess your readiness for a temporary shift in lifestyle and responsibility.\n“It’s not only a financial calculation; it’s also about knowing whether a break aligns with your long-term goals and priorities,” he explained.\nBelow are some clear signs you’re ready for this career shift. And if you are, take a look at some steps you should take to prepare.\nYou Have a Strong Financial Foundation\n“When I evaluate a client’s readiness for micro-retirement, I look for at least 12 months of living expenses saved separately from their emergency fund,” said Abid Salahi, finance expert and co-founder of FinlyWealth.\nHe’s found that clients who take career breaks with less than this buffer end up cutting their break short 82% of the time.\nYour Skills Are Marketable\nSalahi assesses whether his clients have maintained in-demand skills.

A clutch of analyst price target raises also benefited the stock.\nAs of early Friday morning, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, NYT shares were up more than 11% in value week to date.\nDigital does it\nFueled by growth in digital ad revenue and online subscriptions, two important pillars for its business, NYT's second-quarter revenue grew almost 10% year over year to nearly $686 million. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income increased more robustly, advancing by 27% to slightly under $83 million for the period. Per-share, non-GAAP (adjusted) profitability also saw a satisfying rise, to $0.58 from $0.45.\nAlso satisfying was the twin beats notched by the company.

McWhorter recommended vetting between three and four advisors before settling on one.\nI’m a Financial Advisor: My Wealthiest Clients All Do These 3 Things\nSwings Too Big\nWhether working with a new advisor or one you’ve been acquainted with for a while, be cautious, listen, and do your own research, McWhorter advised. Don’t go into the relationship trusting everything that is said. Be discerning.\n“Do not hire an advisor that is always swinging for the fences or tells you about how they are consistently outpacing the markets,” he said. “These types of advisors […] strike out many more times than they get a home run, in my experience.”\nNot Evolving With the Times\nWhen it comes to your financial future, especially in today’s volatile market, you need an advisor who evolves with the times. “If they don’t, it may be a red flag,” according to Melissa Murphy Pavone, a CFP and owner of Mindful Financial Partners.\nBe concerned if an advisor is ignoring recent legislation and policy changes. “From the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) to the impact of tariffs, your advisor should be proactively adjusting your plan, not waiting for you to ask,” she said.\nNo Stress Testing\nAnother worrisome sign is if your advisor is not stress-testing your retirement plan, Murphy Pavone said. “With persistent inflation and Social Security uncertainty, your advisor should run multiple scenarios so you know your plan is built to last.”","content_hash":"72a24a4f7d85a65a7e84c7ca3c523d9b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2596,"method_rank":0}

That’s why many investment firms and advisors warn against trying to time the market. One of those firms is Charles Schwab, which recently addressed the topic with an analysis from the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\nDoes timing the market really work? Read on to learn what Charles Schwab had to say about it.\nBetter Now Than Later\nIn its report, Schwab brought up the example of getting a year-end bonus or income tax refund and weighing whether to invest the money now or wait until you think you’ll get a better return on your money.\nThis might happen if the stock markets had recently hit high all-time highs (as they have lately). Should you wait until the markets soften and stocks are cheaper to buy?\nThe answer is probably “no” — at least according to Schwab. Its research found that the cost of waiting for the “perfect” moment to invest exceeds the benefit, mainly because timing the market perfectly is “nearly impossible.”\nSchwab’s recommendation was to avoid timing the market and instead invest “as soon as possible.”\nCheck Out: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\nDifferent Strategies\nTo illustrate its findings, Schwab laid out five basic investing scenarios and the likely results. In each case, the investor received $2,000 at the beginning of every year for the 20 years ending in 2024 and left the money in the stock market, as represented by the S&P 500 Index.\nHere’s a quick look:\n-\n“Peter” aimed to invest his $2,000 at the market’s lowest closing point each year, which essentially means timing the market perfectly.\n-\n“Ashley” took a simple approach in which she invested her $2,000 on the first trading day of each year.\n-\n“Matthew” adopted a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involved dividing his yearly $2,000 allotment into 12 equal portions, which he invested at the beginning of every month.\n-\n“Rosie” had the bad luck to invest her $2,000 each year at the market’s peak.\n-\n“Larry” opted to leave his money in cash investments rather than put it into the stock markets.\nEven ‘Perfect’ Timing Isn’t That Beneficial\nSo how did each investor do?

You get to buy a product or service with someone else's money, and you don't have to pay interest for a while. You can find financing options that let you avoid interest payments for 12 months or more, but even though it sounds good, there are a few ways these deals can hurt your finances.\nIt may seem like there's only one disadvantage. People who borrow money will get burned by high interest rates if they do not repay the balance on time. However, there is a much more subtle way that 0% interest deals can wreck your finances.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90\/share.\n-\nAccredited Investors: Grab Pre-IPO Shares of the AI Company Powering Hasbro, Sephora & MGM—Secure $0.63 Shares Before 8\/14\nUnintended Spending\nIt's hard enough to resist spending money due to the regular barrage of advertisements, an innate desire to keep up with everyone else, and how easy it has become to part ways with your hard-earned money. This environment makes it easy to spend money, and 0% APR is just another sweetener.\nBorrowing money at 0% APR means there isn't any immediate downside to making a purchase. Money doesn't leave your checking account right away, and interest doesn't immediately accrue on your balance. This setup may incentivize people to make purchases they would have otherwise ignored.\nUnintended spending has unintended consequences. That's extra money you now have to put toward your credit card bill instead of buying shares of a reliable index fund. Taking enough 0% APR deals can hinder your ability to build up a sufficient nest egg by the time you reach retirement age.\nTrending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30\/share.\nGetting Comfortable With Debt\nInterest-free promotions also get people more comfortable with spending other people's money. While debt can be a productive resource for real estate investors and startup founders, using it for discretionary purchases too often can result in interest payments. Even if you're not paying interest, you will have to repay the debt with money that you could have invested.\nSome people open multiple credit cards to capitalize on short-term 0% APR deals. These cards can be great for getting out of debt sooner if you do a credit card balance transfer. However, these deals can trap people into the habit of borrowing money.","content_hash":"fdbf799edccf65aee649d44a07ea14af","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2594,"method_rank":0}

A UPS spokesperson declined to provide any update on the situation.\nAbout 85% of UPS drivers are at the top end of the pay scale.

A driver with 27 years of experience would receive a $48,600 buyout, according to the offer sheet.\nIt’s unclear if the delay in achieving the job-reduction target will change the timing of the separation dates.\nApplicants were told they will be considered for separation dates between Aug. 31 and Oct. 31, depending on the local needs. If the number of applications exceeds eliminated positions, approvals will be granted in order of seniority. Additional applications may be considered for separation dates between Feb. 1 and March 31.

The results marked a slight improvement in profitability compared with second-quarter results, as the retailer continues to struggle in the wake of the closure of four stores that were heavily damaged during last year’s hurricane that caused extensive flooding in North Carolina.\nThree of those stores remain closed, although Ingles previously said it hopes to reopen them late this year or in 2026. The company is planning to build a replacement for the store that remains closed in Swannanoa, N.C., said Pat Jackson, chief financial officer, Ingles, in a statement to Supermarket News.\n“Plans are in the process of being approved for the new Ingles Swannanoa Valley shopping center,” she said. “The project will include demolition of existing shops, raising the site elevation and construction of Ingles’ newest prototype grocery store.\n“In addition, there will be new expanded small and large tenant space opportunities along with a new i Market,” Jackson said, referring to Ingles’ convenience-store format.\nLocal residents there had been frustrated with the lack of information about the future of the Swannanoa store, leading them to launch an online petition demanding more communication from Ingles. The community has reportedly struggled to access groceries since the storm last September.\nThe other two stores that remain closed are in Morganton and Spruce Pine, N.C. The retailer, which is based in Asheville, N.C., continues to operate 197 supermarkets in the region.\nGross profits improve as percent of sales\nIn the Q3 earnings report, Ingles said its gross profits for the quarter increased as a percent of sales compared with a year ago, to $327.3 million, or 24.3% of sales, compared with $329.8 million, or 23.7% of sales, in the year-ago period.\nOperating and administrative expenses increased slightly in the quarter, to $290.1 million, compared with $286.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nThrough three quarters, Ingles said its net income was down about 45.9%, to $57.9 million, compared with the year-ago, nine-month span. Sales through three quarters totaled $3.97 billion, down about 6.4% compared with the first three quarters of last year.","content_hash":"b7c85fcc62d64eaf66c345b79f86fffd","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2587,"method_rank":0}

Shares of rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed 2%, while Micron (MU) stocks edged up 0.7%.\nMost of the world's advanced chips are produced by leading contract chip manufacturer TSMC (TSM) in Taiwan, but the company has been building out its capacity in Arizona with a $165 billion investment, exempting it from Trump's tariffs. The company's US-listed shares jumped nearly 5% Thursday.\nTech companies have rushed to announce investments in their US manufacturing footprint in the hopes of avoiding Trump’s trade war wrath. So far, Nvidia has committed to producing $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the US. Micron made a similar $200 billion commitment. Texas Instruments (TXN) has said it’s spending $60 billion to bolster its manufacturing capacity in the US.\nCiti analyst Christopher Danely said the exemptions mean the semiconductor tariff will have “minimal impact … as US-based semiconductor companies with in-house fabs have operations in the US and fabless companies can commit to using TSMC, Samsung, GFS which have operations in the US.”\n“Fabs” refer to factories where chips are produced, and “fabless” companies outsource production of their chips to contract manufacturers such as TSMC, Samsung (005930.KS), and GFS (GFS). Companies with in-house fabs include Intel (INTC), Micron, and Texas Instruments. Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Qualcomm (QCOM) are fabless.\nMorgan Stanley (MS) analyst Joseph Moore echoed Danely's sentiment, writing in a note to clients Thursday, “To some degree this outcome would be something of a relief.”\n“Yes, 100% tariffs are unpalatable but if companies are given time to restore them, the real tax is just the higher cost of building chips in the United States,\" he wrote. \"The biggest fear was that such a tariff would be implemented immediately.”","content_hash":"4c5655270c3f852613ea19c4876618da","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2583,"method_rank":0}

Although top-line revenue is growing faster than expected, the company's profitability was a little lower than analysts had hoped for, and there are some concerns about the effect of new tariffs on ad demand.\nIn other words, there was a lot of good to balance out the bad. So why is the stock falling so much? Is it a buying opportunity for long-term investors, or would it be best to stay away for the time being? Here's a quick rundown of Pinterest's Q2 results, why the stock is down, and whether it could be a good time to buy.\nPinterest's second quarter: The good and the bad\nWe'll start with the good. Pinterest reported top-line revenue that grew by 17% year over year and handily surpassed analysts' expectations. Not only that, but the company gave upbeat third-quarter revenue guidance, and the platform added 8 million users for the quarter, nearly twice as many as were projected. There are now 578 million monthly active users worldwide, and there was growth in all three geographical segments Pinterest reports (U.S & Canada, Europe, and Rest of World).\nThe weakness, however, came on the bottom line. Pinterest missed earnings per share (EPS) estimates by two cents, which appears to be the main negative in the earnings report.\nTo be sure, other profitability metrics were quite strong. Free cash flow margin was almost 20%, compared with just 12% in the second quarter of 2024. Monetization of the user base is also progressing nicely, especially outside of the U.S., which is where the bulk of Pinterest users are.\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) from the platform's 146 million European users grew by 26%. In the crucial Rest of World group, which includes 329 million users, Pinterest generated 44% more than it did a year ago. This remains a massive opportunity, as the average user in this group still generates less than 3% of the revenue that a typical U.S. user brings in.\nPinterest has $2.66 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet, nearly $150 million more than a year ago. The company's outstanding share count has fallen by almost 3% over the past year thanks to buybacks, and Pinterest has financial flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities that arise.","content_hash":"b90887fc661df4fdac5519cd3a9fd914","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2573,"method_rank":0}

On a non-GAAP (adjusted), per-share basis, however, APA earned $0.87 on the bottom line against $1.17.\nYet these results were more than good enough to top the average analyst estimates -- to understate the case. These called for an adjusted, bottom-line profit of merely $0.45 and total revenue of $2.07 billion.\nUpside surprises both at home and abroad\nAPA attributed the better-than-expected performance to several factors, not least of which was its operations in the Permian Basin.

GD’s trailing and forward P\/E were 21.07 and 20.70 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nGeneral Dynamics (GD), one of the largest U.S. defense contractors, operates through four major segments: Aerospace, Combat Systems, Marine Systems, and IT & Mission Systems. Its Gulfstream business jets dominate the private, corporate, and government markets, while its Combat Systems division provides tanks, armored vehicles, and advanced weapons systems. Marine Systems builds submarines and surface ships, and the IT & Mission Systems unit delivers secure communications, cybersecurity, and IT services to critical defense agencies, including the Department of Defense. With over 110,000 employees worldwide, GD is deeply embedded in national security infrastructure, making it a strategically vital player.\nFinancially, the company remains strong, posting 11.8% revenue growth over the last four quarters, generating $4.1 billion in free cash flow, and holding long-term debt of $7.3 billion. Its most recent quarterly earnings of $1 billion, reported on July 23, exceeded expectations and drove the stock higher. The shares have been in an intermediate-term correction since November 2024, but technical signals suggest a potential breakout. Investors are watching for the stock to sustain a move above $318 for a couple of weeks, which could mark the start of the next upward leg.\nWith solid fundamentals, strong cash generation, and a leading position in mission-critical defense and aerospace markets, GD offers both stability and growth.

The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 3.75% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out with continued defense demand.

Meanwhile, 12.9% of student loans entered serious delinquency in that time period, the highest rate in 21 years of data.\nRead more: After Trump's budget bill, are federal student loans still the gold standard?\n“Missed federal student loan payments that were not previously reported to credit bureaus between Q2 2020 and Q4 2024 are now appearing in credit reports,” the New York Fed said in a press release. “Consequently, student loan delinquency rates continued to rise.”\nThe repayment issue has come full circle from March 2020, when Congress passed a massive COVID-19 relief package that allowed borrowers to pause payments on federal student loans without penalty, reduced interest rates to 0%, and stopped reporting missed payments to credit bureaus. Delinquency rates fell to less than 1%. After that provision was extended several times, interest rates resumed in September 2023, and payments restarted in October of that year.\nStill, there was an “on-ramp” period for a year, said Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Even though payments were technically due, missed payments didn’t damage borrowers’ credit scores, and delinquencies weren’t recorded. That policy expired last fall, and delinquencies began appearing on credit reports again this year.\n“This is when the trouble kind of began,” Cooper told Yahoo Finance. “We have a lot of people who had been told over and over again that payments are going to be due, only for the pause to be extended. Now they’re told payments are going to be due, and the pause actually does end. You can imagine a lot of people just really weren’t paying attention.”\nDuring the relief period, many borrowers also moved, changed their loan servicers, and changed their contact information, Cooper said.\n“We’re not in a great situation right now,” Cooper said. “The percentage of borrowers who are in current repayment on their loans is just about 35%, according to the most recent data, which was in March. We have delinquencies being very elevated, we have a lot of people in forbearance, and we have repayment rates that are very far below what they were pre-pandemic.”\nLearn more: 10 ways the One Big Beautiful Bill affects student loans and financial aid","content_hash":"a2781d313fe3f8517198a75109948685","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2557,"method_rank":0}

Its tenants include leading names such as Eli Lilly, Moderna, and Google, who sign long-term leases—offering predictable, high-quality rental income. As of the latest trading, ARE is priced at $72, yielding a 7.2% dividend, the highest in over a decade. The dividend is well-supported by Funds From Operations (FFO), which totaled $8.11 per share in 2024, with guidance of $9.26 per share for 2025.\nAlexandria’s payout ratio remains healthy, and its dividend has increased for 15 consecutive years at a 5.2% CAGR. The REIT boasts a strong balance sheet, with a 0.6x debt\/equity ratio, a 12.7-year average debt maturity at a low 3.86% interest rate, and an investment-grade credit rating. The company’s capital allocation strategy centers around its Megacampus model—large-scale, amenity-rich campuses near top research universities. To fund this strategy, ARE has actively recycled capital by selling non-core assets and repurchasing shares, minimizing shareholder dilution. While its occupancy dipped to 91.7% in Q1 due to expected tenant transitions, fundamentals remain intact.\nHowever, its tight concentration in the U.S. life sciences sector introduces risk, especially as federal research funding faces political scrutiny.

However, the company also unveiled its next-generation storage product, which management noted could lead to some delays or lumpiness in recognized revenue in the near future.\nSymbotic sees profit-taking after a big run\nIt should be noted that Symbotic's stock had an incredible run heading into earnings, with the stock up 124% on the year. So, one might understandably chalk today's action up to profit-taking on a less-than-perfect quarter.\nRevenue came in stronger than expectations at $592.2 million, up 25.9% on the year, while net loss per share of $0.05 missed expectations by $0.04. Still, as a growth company, investors are likely more focused on the top-line trajectory than bottom-line profits at this point.\nAnd here is where the problem may lie, if one can call it that. For the upcoming fiscal fourth quarter, Symbotic only guided for between $590 million and $610 million in revenue -- basically very little sequential growth, if any at all.\nBut management gave a \"good\" reason for the revenue hiccup. In conjunction with earnings, the company unveiled its next-generation storage technology system, which offers increased storage capacity, faster case handling, and better fire suppression. With the new system just now commercially available, management noted: \"With the launch of a proprietary new storage structure, we expect a temporary short-term impact on revenue based on schedules shifting to accommodate. Importantly, the new structure does not affect our backlog and supports our long-term value creation.\"\nSymbotic is an interesting physical AI play, but expensive\nSymbotic is a leader in next-generation warehouse automation, and the company is clearly executing well. A near-term slowdown due to supply constraints of its next-generation product isn't a big deal.\nHowever, valuation may be an issue after this year's huge run. Shares trade at over 14 times this year's revenue estimate and over 223 times this year's adjusted earnings estimates. So today, Symbotic is an interesting stock to watch, but too expensive for this investor's liking.","content_hash":"f56cff4b71f6fb5242f7c8ec9c622714","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2540,"method_rank":0}

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LIF. Life360, Inc.'s share was trading at $77.75 as of August 6th. LIF’s trailing and forward P\/E were 598.08 and 147.06, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.\nPhoto by Dean Brierley on Unsplash\nLife360 is poised to deliver a solid Q2 2025, with TickerTrends projecting $110.2 million in revenue—slightly above the Street’s $109.77 million estimate—driven by continued momentum in Monthly Active Users (MAUs), premium subscriptions, and advertising monetization. KPI tracking indicates MAUs will rise to approximately 87.63 million, up 5.6% QoQ and nearly 15% YoY. Subscription revenue is expected to reach $86 million, marking 5% QoQ and 30.9% YoY growth, while other revenue is forecasted at $13.8 million, benefiting from growing free-user monetization.\nSearch trends, app usage, and web traffic metrics show stable to accelerating YoY growth, signaling user engagement resilience despite earlier price hikes. YouTube search data reveals surging interest, which is anticipated to enhance ad revenue momentum through H2. Life360's Q3 outlook is strong, supported by back-to-school seasonality, a favorable subscriber tier mix, and possibly scaled pricing adjustments. TickerTrends believes these dynamics will help FY25 subscription revenue land at the high end of the $355–$365 million guidance range. Meanwhile, the Q4 launch of a Pet monitoring product introduces a structural growth vector that could lift ARPPC through bundling and higher-tier conversions, improving retention and long-term pricing power.\nOn the ad front, the rollout of Place Ads and Uplift by Life360 is gaining traction, offering real-world targeting and offline attribution, which, paired with surging MAUs, should support an upside surprise to full-year ad revenue estimates of $55–$65 million. With accelerating product monetization and subscriber expansion, Life360 appears well-positioned to outperform both Q2 expectations and potentially raise full-year guidance in Q3.\nPreviously, we covered a bullish thesis on Dave Inc. (DAVE) by Next 100 Baggers in May 2025, which highlighted improved monetization, strong unit economics, and free cash flow positivity. The company's stock price has appreciated by approximately 1.2% since our coverage. This is because the thesis is still playing out gradually. TickerTrends shares a similar view in Life360, emphasizing MAU growth and ad monetization.","content_hash":"a5e8d8860e882f4bf2f711bddc03a303","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2536,"method_rank":0}

As previously announced, AppLovin completed the sale of Apps for $400 million and 20% of Tripledot's equity.\nOn the bottom line, the company continued to deliver incredibly high margins with adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) nearly doubling to $1.02 billion, while net income rose 164% to $820 million.\nEarnings per share (EPS) rose from $0.89 to $2.39, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

It also sees adjusted EBITDA of $1.07 billion to $1.09 billion, representing a margin of 81%.\nThe sale of the Apps business should allow management to focus on only the high-growth advertising business, which continues to deliver incredible results.\nAppLovin is also set to launch a new self-serve feature for its e-commerce platform, which could accelerate its growth further.

Why that’s bad news for employers\nSimilarly, its weight-loss medication Zepbound reached $3.4 billion in sales, up 172% year over year and exceeding estimates of $3 billion.\nAccording to Eli Lilly, the company’s market share for the class of drugs that includes Mounjaro and Zepbound increased to 57% during the quarter.\nAdditionally, Mounjaro demonstrated its ability to protect cardiovascular health in trial results announced July 31. And the company on Thursday also announced its oral GLP-1 pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose an average of 27.3 pounds in a Phase III clinical trial.\nThese successes, along with high demand for its weight-loss drugs, led Eli Lilly to increase its 2025 guidance. Still, investors are wary of the 148-year-old pharmaceutical company. Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) stock fell over 14% today, dropping to its lowest price in more than a year.\nMeanwhile, Eli Lilly’s key competitor in the weight-loss sphere, Novo Nordisk, saw its shares surge more than 7%, even after a disappointing earnings report yesterday suggested lower growth expectations as Wegovy and Ozempic face mounting competition from the cheaper Eli Lilly alternatives.\nThe seemingly counterintuitive investor reactions come down to Eli Lilly’s recent clinical trial testing the efficacy of its oral GLP-1 among a group of 3,127 adults who are obese or overweight and experiencing weight-related medical issues.\nThe drug is effective. At the highest dose, over half of the patients in the trial saw at least a 10% reduction in weight, and nearly 40% saw at least a 15% reduction.\nHowever, investors were hoping for higher levels of weight loss to compete with Novo Nordisk’s medications—including an oral version of Wegovy that is up for approval by the Food and Drug Administration later this year.\nAfter Eli Lilly’s trial results were released, David Risinger, an analyst at Leerink Partners, downgraded Eli Lilly’s stock and changed his expectation for sales of the drug from $21.6 billion to $13.5 billion.","content_hash":"32d7ebd6ca671b152c642b02c41f87e8","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2513,"method_rank":0}

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily MedTech Dive newsletter.\nMedtech executives discussed planned changes to how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could pay for diabetes technology in earnings calls this week. Insulin pump makers Insulet and Tandem Diabetes Care don’t expect much of an impact on their business from the proposed changes, but said they would be monitoring the policy.\nIn June, CMS issued a proposed rule that would seek to include insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors in a competitive bidding program. The rule would also change payments to a monthly rental schedule instead of a contract where the devices are paid for upfront.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Shagun Singh expects Tandem and Medtronic to be impacted the most, “as the new proposal would allow for competitive switching,” she wrote in a July 1 research note. Singh expects Insulet to see less of an impact as the company already uses a “pay-as-you-go” model, and Dexcom’s and Abbott’s CGMs are already sold on a monthly bundle basis.\nTandem CFO Leigh Vosseller said on an earnings call Wednesday that the company does not expect the changes to have a material impact on the company’s business, and “we anticipate it could help drive more people to pump therapy.”\nCurrently, traditional Medicare makes up less than 10% of Tandem’s sales. Vosseller said the payment change would shift pump reimbursement from a 13-month rental to a pay-as-you-go model. Tandem, which currently sells most of its pumps through a durable medical equipment model, plans to begin selling supplies for its t:slim X2 pump through the pharmacy channel starting in the fourth quarter.\n“Transitioning to a pay-as-you-go model is something that we've contemplated anyway from a commercial perspective as we've pursued the pharmacy channel,” Vosseller said.\nShe added that Tandem will be participating in the comment period and anticipates final rulings in November.\nTandem lowered its earnings forecast for U.S. sales in 2025 to $700 million for the year, down from a previous range of $725 million to $730 million. CEO John Sheridan said the change was due to a new market entrant that has built a larger-than-expected sales team, and initiatives that are still in progress to modernize Tandem’s systems and grow its salesforce.\nThe company also disclosed a recall related to a speaker problem with its devices, which has been associated with 59 injuries.","content_hash":"a9cf0fce1556c93f4f4ce6b40fa7f219","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2510,"method_rank":0}

Between allegations Tesla isn't paying its bills and hurting small businesses, to facing consumer backlash from CEO Elon Musk's political tour (and we can't forget the sliding sales and global profits), it's been a full downpour. Let's consider the recent speed bumps, as well as Musk being rewarded with a hefty $29 billion payday.\nThe overseas spiral\nJuly figures are seeping in from Europe, and they show that Tesla registrations checked in 41.6% lower compared to the prior year, despite sales of electric vehicles (EVs) surging across the Continent.\nIt's a continuation of the sales spiral the EV maker faced during the first half of 2025. And the problem is that the decline was supposedly due to the new Model Y being in limited supply -- but the issues appear to be deeper than that.\nThe story is similar in China, another crucial market for Tesla. Its sales of China-made EVs dropped 8.4% in July compared to the prior year. That was a reversal from the small gain Tesla posted in June, which at the time reversed an eight-month losing streak.\nThe consumer backlash\nThe consumer displeasure is real, and Musk's political allegiances have pushed some buyers to new and different brands. There's evidence of the effect this is having on Tesla's once-spotless brand image, according to new data from S&P Global Mobility, which tracks sales data across the automotive industry.\nThe new data, shared with Reuters, showed that Tesla's consumer loyalty took a nosedive in July 2024, correlating with Musk's public commitment to an anti-environmental political campaign. According to Reuters, Tesla's loyalty peaked at 73% in June 2024 before bottoming out in March at 49.9%. No matter how you slice it, that's a quick and dramatic decline in consumer sentiment, literally driving buyers to another brand.\nA massive payday\nTesla's board granted Musk 96 million shares, worth roughly $29 billion, in an attempt to keep the billionaire focused on the EV company amid his multiple businesses and ventures. The vote comes after a 2024 Delaware court ruling that voided Musk's 2018 compensation package, which was valued at over $50 billion. The court said the approval process was flawed and unfair to shareholders.","content_hash":"d3516dd620d547f39b044316359ce264","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2503,"method_rank":0}

The end of the war could boost global oil supplies as sanctions on Russian energy exports could be lifted, which would add crude supplies to the global market.\nCrude prices have moved higher after President Trump said last Monday that he would impose new tariffs on countries buying Russian energy unless Russia reaches a ceasefire with Ukraine by this Friday. On Wednesday, President Trump doubled tariffs on Indian exports to 50% from 25% because of India's purchases of Russian crude. JPMorgan Chase warned that if enforced, oil markets would be unable to ignore the impact of triple-digit tariffs on Russian oil, given the significant scale of Russian exports and limited OPEC spare capacity, which could potentially lead to a supply shock.\nConcerns about a global oil supply glut are weighing on crude prices after OPEC+ on Sunday endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1. OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. After Sunday's meeting, the group said it will closely monitor demand and may maintain production levels, restart halted supplies, or reverse recent production increases. OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. The International Energy Agency said inventories have been accumulating at a rate of 1 million bpd and that the global crude oil market faces a surplus by Q4-2025 equivalent to 1.5% of global crude consumption. OPEC July crude production fell -20,000 bpd to 28.31 million bpd.","content_hash":"18225685b6d4165b02a4e425a72fc7f7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2502,"method_rank":0}

For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $41,906 or around 380 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($3.16 in this case). So, $6,000 \/ $3.16 = 1,899 ($500 per month), and $1,200 \/ $3.16 = 380 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2\/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2\/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2\/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nGILD Price Action: Shares of Gilead Sciences fell 1.9% to close at $110.28 on Wednesday.\nRead More:\nPhoto via Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Whether people are looking for a good deal on electronics, shopping for back-to-school clothes, or buying groceries, Costco's discount warehouses are a popular destination.\nThat's made Costco's stock quite popular among investors. The company's share price is up 178% over the past three years, easily outpacing the S&P 500's gains.\nBut is the stock still a good buy right now? Here are a few reasons why Costco should be on your buy list in 2025.\n1. Costco has strong sales and earnings\nMany companies are experiencing big share price gains right now, but some of them don't have the revenue and earnings to back up their stock growth. That's not true for Costco.\nThe company's sales rose 8% in the third quarter to nearly $62 billion, and earnings jumped to $4.28 per share, a 13% increase from the year-ago quarter. Costco's also experiencing strong growth from its e-commerce business, which grew by 16% in the first 12 weeks of the year.\nThe result is a retailer that's very profitable and is on track for more growth. Analysts' consensus estimate for Costco's 2025 earnings is about $18 per share, which would be a nearly 12% increase from 2024.\n2. Costco is recession-proof\nOK, fine, no company is 100% recession-proof, but Costco is certainly recession-resilient. One of the reasons it can weather a recession, or economic downturn, well is that its members are loyal. The company enjoys membership renewal rates of 93% in both the U.S. and Canada.\nWhen customers need to pinch pennies, Costco saves them money. A recent study found that buying groceries at Costco was 9.5% cheaper than at a comparable Walmart. Costco CEO Ron Vachris emphasized the value its Kirkland Signature brand brings to customers, saying on the Q3 earnings call:\n\"In times of consumer uncertainty, our Kirkland Signature brand is uniquely positioned to provide our members with great quality and great values. And during the third quarter, sales of Kirkland Signature items again outpaced our overall sales growth, with our KS sales penetration up approximately 50 basis points year-over-year.\"","content_hash":"b2270ea65014303b9ba18a949ab1e6a0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2474,"method_rank":0}

Fundamentally this would indicate the US Federal Open Market Committee could make rate hikes before the next cut is announced, despite all the bluster from the US administration. On the other hand, the technical pattern on the greenback’s monthly chart could be nothing more than a shift in long-term investment opinion, meaning it might have nothing to do with fundamentals, for now.

Another public miner, IREN, revealed earlier this year that it is involved in a similar issue with CBP over $100 million in duties.\nIn IREN's instance, CBP claims that the mining equipment shipped between April 2024 and February 2025 likewise originated in China.

That means it can now directly issue credit and debit cards and offer its spend management products to any business in all 30 EU countries with “no workarounds required,” as co-founder and CEO Pedro Franceschi wrote in a blog post.\nWhile the corporate spend management startup previously supported 60 currencies in 200 countries, it could only sell its products to companies with a U.S. presence.\nWith the expansion, Brex is now authorized to sell spend management (complete with issuing cards) and other tools like embedded payments to EU companies and startups, a spokesperson tells TechCrunch. However, there’s a caveat: Banking and bill pay will not be initially available. The company hopes to roll those services out in the future.\nWhile this is good news for Brex, it may also be good news for European startups. Brex’s claim to fame is offering startups expense management cards for their employees even if they wouldn’t yet qualify from traditional banks. Without a bank account offering, the youngest EU startups will still have to weigh their options.\nNext up, Franceschi says he wants to expand Brex in the U.K., though he offered no specifics on those plans.\nFranceschi said in December that Brex is on track to stop burning cash in 2025, “an important milestone to our future IPO.”\nIn February, sources told various news outlets that Brex was on track for $500 million in revenue this year as well. That’s quite the turnaround from a shaky moment in 2023 when Brex conducted layoffs and reportedly told employees that its cash burn was too high.

It did, however, sell a fresh $260 million of bonds in March 2024, packaged from its spend management receivables which are used to manage that cash-intensive business.","content_hash":"5d883ba42b0b7597f49896180bd1e062","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2424,"method_rank":0}

He highlighted Joby’s long development timeline and deep operational integration as strategic advantages. A key strength, he noted, is the company’s partnership with Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE:TM), which underpins Joby’s manufacturing strategy.\nPeterson believes the market opportunity post-certification could surpass the current helicopter industry, driven by the noise reduction and safety improvements that eVTOLs are expected to deliver. Over the long term, he estimates Joby’s total addressable market could reach $200 billion to $300 billion.\nHowever, Peterson cautioned that the investment case carries significant risk, citing regulatory uncertainty, a largely unproven business model, and challenges around market adoption and competitive dynamics. As a result, he continues to rate the stock Underweight.\nThe $7 price target for December 2026 is based on a blended valuation model, using 8x EV\/Sales and 24x EV\/EBITDA multiples applied to the company’s 2030 projections, discounted back to 2026 at a 12.5% rate to reflect elevated execution risk.\nPeterson sees potential upside if adoption outpaces expectations or if Joby secures FAA certification earlier than projected. He added that Joby’s vertically integrated, ride-sharing-driven model could outperform traditional OEM approaches, and real-world fleet performance might exceed current forecasts.\nOn Wednesday, Joby reported a second-quarter loss of 41 cents per share, missing Wall Street’s expected loss of 19 cents. Revenue also disappointed, coming in at $15,000, well below the $43,000 estimate.\nDespite the weak results, Joby ended the quarter with $991 million in cash and short-term investments.

Not unexpectedly, UBER is considered a budding blue-chip by some, evidenced by its inclusion in the Dow Jones Transportation Average.\nHowever, not all investors want to focus their attention on the more established, $100 billion-plus types.

But there is a growth story here, and nearly half of the last four quarters’ earnings occurred in the just-reported quarter.

The good stuff is in the daily, in the percentage price oscillator (PPO) indicator at the bottom. That is not what I’d call a “buy” signal at all. However, you can see that it is trying to bottom, as is the stock following Wednesday’s quarterly announcement. I don’t see this as an instant-gratification situation, apart from the nice pop it had Thursday morning. But this is what I’d describe as “showing signs” of turning up.

The pattern reflects a period of consolidation where price gets squeezed, followed by a breakout.\nXRP would target $3.34 after breaking out of the triangle, Martinez predicted.\nThen, surprising news came out at 5:16 p.m. EDT on Aug. 7 that the legal case involving the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, the company associated with the XRP cryptocurrency, is finally over.\nThe development had an enormously positive impact on XRP's price trajectory. The cryptocurrency skyrocketed to trade as high as $3.37 following the announcement.\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\nThe next day, Martinez didn't forget to remind his followers on X that he had nailed the prediction.\nAs far as XRP is concerned, its regulatory status in the U.S. is closely related to the outcome of the legal battle that began way back in December 2020.\nFor now, a landmark court ruling from July 2023 remains intact that classified XRP as a non-security when it is sold via programmatic sale to retail traders on crypto exchanges but ruled that XRP's institutional sale violated U.S. securities laws.\nThe status of crypto assets such as XRP in the U.S. has been a bone of contention for years.

Binance then accepts the Treasuries as margin for trading, the FT said, citing people familiar with the process. If Binance were to fail, funds would remain secure in the Treasuries under BBVA’s control.\nThe deal distances the exchange from its earlier model of holding user funds in-house. The shift follows mounting pressure on crypto exchanges to isolate custody from trading, especially after FTX’s collapse in 2022, which left users’ funds frozen and shattered confidence across the market. Others measures exchange adopted include proof-of-reserves, a cryptographic method of proving customers’ funds are in their wallets.\nBinance, which paid a $4.3 billion penalty last year to U.S. regulators for anti-money laundering failures, has since allowed clients to use third-party custodians including Sygnum and FlowBank.\nBBVA has been moving deeper into crypto. Just this year, it rolled out crypto trading and custody services through its mobile app and advised private clients to allocate up to 7% of portfolios into bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).","content_hash":"15477b3d712452f3e63ac96203b24d2c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1503,"method_rank":0}
