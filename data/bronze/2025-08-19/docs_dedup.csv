Takeaways for convenience services operators
-
Smart markets are no longer optional. They’re becoming a mainstream growth driver, especially in locations unsuitable for micro markets.
-
The right location is everything. ROI depends on matching the technology to client needs and ensuring pricing flexibility.
-
Embrace new pricing strategies. Operators must move away from “boomer bucket” thinking on price and align with consumer expectations shaped by delivery apps and convenience culture.
-
Diversify product mix. Fresh food, protein, and non-food items thrive in smart markets thanks to improved accuracy and theft control.
-
Service is non-negotiable. An empty or broken cooler damages brand reputation; reliable support remains central.
-
Expect industry shifts. Continued growth of smart markets, ongoing operator consolidation, new entrants, and selective use of vending where theft or cost makes it practical.

Smart stores are already having a big impact, and it is just the beginning.
Industry observers, including Automatic Merchandiser’s Vending & OCS Nation Podcast host Bob Tullio, are wondering aloud what next year’s State of the Industry Report will reveal. Sales jumped 30% in the vending and micro market segment, and smart markets were not even part of the equation. Next year’s numbers could be off the charts!
Listen now
In this episode of Vending & OCS Nation Podcast, the second that explores insights from Automatic Merchandiser’s exclusive State of Vending and Micro Markets Report, industry experts continue their discussion on the latest data. The conversation turns to what seems to be an inevitable subject these days: smart markets and their impact on the industry.
- “There is a new wave of operators who are no longer looking at vending and micro markets — they are going straight to smart stores,” said Ben Thomas of Nayax.
- “We need to change our mindset on pricing. We need to step out of that boomer bucket,” said Josh Rosenberg of Forward Thinkers.
- “We’ve been installing smart stores like crazy in FedEx locations, and to say they are doing well in sales is probably the biggest understatement I can make,” said Tony Danna of Cantaloupe Inc.
- “If we have an empty cooler, that is basically a coffin with our logo on it. That user experience comes with committed service,” said Jon Holden of All Star Services Inc.
- “Anyone who is willing to put in the work, the time, the energy and the money can compete if they have the right tools in place,” said Natali Pupovac-Peters of Naturals2Go.
- “Looking ahead, I think smart markets will increase in a big way, there will be plenty more industry consolidation, vending will decline, and new operators will continue to appear,” said consultant Orrin Huebner.
It was a lively conversation full of outstanding insights taken from two webinars in July. Both webinars are available on demand.
Episode at a glance: How smart stores are changing convenience services
No time to listen? Prefer to read? Here is an edited podcast transcript:
Bob Tullio: In July, Automatic Merchandiser hosted two webinars, both of which offered plenty of material that is certainly worth sharing on our Vending & OCS Nation podcast.
These one-hour live webinars are available on demand, but I’m glad we did a podcast on the subject because I heard the same comment from a couple of people. They said, “Wow, I had no idea the webinar content was that good.” That’s often the case with webinars. Great subject matter, but you need to commit the time to watch. So here I am with my shortened version, and I’m glad listeners enjoyed it.
We spent most of the last podcast trying to determine what is driving the explosive growth in the micro market business. Let me set the table for part two. Here are some of the conclusions we reached in part one regarding the state of the industry.
We concluded that price increases certainly contributed to the 30% jump in revenue, but that operators are getting better at operating markets and the food is getting better, all of which is driving revenue.
We agreed that today’s consumer is looking for a frictionless buying experience and that micro markets are resonating strongly with Gen Z and millennials, now dominating the workforce.
We talked about the importance of using data, making micro market service that much more efficient and keeping labor costs down.
We discussed the steady flow of new operators, both full-time and part-time, who are entering the business. What’s the number one challenge for all operators, new and old? Lack of capital.
We talked about the industry consolidation that actually sweetens the business climate for newcomers.
What we did not heavily address in part one — and we are going to take a much closer look at it in this episode — is how our panel feels about smart coolers, or smart markets, and what impact that will have on the industry. That will be a big part of the state of the industry discussion in today’s episode. We will also talk about how some operators are weaponizing technology to get new business, what the future looks like for operators and more.
Let’s start with a multiple-choice question that I offered up to Jon Holden of All Star Services and Josh Rosenberg of Forward Thinkers.
Bob Tullio: Jon, when I talk to old school operators, especially those who have lots of micro market kiosks and coolers on the shelf, I hear, “They’re just too expensive, those smart coolers.” When I talk to newcomers, they want nothing but smart coolers and smart markets. So I’ll make this a multiple-choice question for you. And Josh, pay attention, you’re gonna get the same question next.
- A. Smart markets are too expensive.
- B. Smart markets are the answer. The ROI is there.
- C. It’s about location, location, location. They are a perfect fit in the right location.
Go ahead, Jon.
Jon Holden: I think you know what my answer is going to be, Bob. That is definitely going be...
Bob Tullio: I think I do.
Jon Holden: It’s going to be C: They are the perfect fit in the right location. And guess what? I’m one of those operators that’s got a warehouse full of vending machines, micro market coolers, micro market fixtures and kiosks. We’re redeploying them constantly, but they’re there. And I’m sure if you go back in time to the early 1900s, and talk to a guy who owns a horse-drawn carriage manufacturing center, he’s going to tell you that automobiles are way too expensive, right?
So, this is all something that’s just pushing towards the future. And in the right location, the ROI is absolutely there for an autonomous retail solution. These can be very diverse retail options for people. Just such a cool thing that we can branch into. It’s just something that, as an operator, is really fun, but that’s exactly it. You know, it’s something that this is moving towards in the future.
If I were starting a company from scratch right now, and I was looking to make investments in certain pieces of equipment, I would definitely focus more on the smart cooler and smart stores rather than the legacy equipment. Now, the caveat to that: they are expensive. So you have to be going into the right customer location. You can’t be going into a customer where, you know, price sensitivity is a hot button issue. To operate these coolers and turn a profit, most of the time you need some good pricing flexibility, which is something that you have to consider when you are going into this space and utilizing these new emerging technologies — that you’re going in and doing it for the right clients and for the right reasons.
Bob Tullio: Good answer. I don’t think you left anything for Josh, but Josh, you’re a consultant and with Forward Thinkers, you’ve got operators looking to you for advice on a regular basis. What do you tell them about the whole smart market thing? And do you think it’s a good model for a newcomer to go in there and just say, “Hey, I’m going with smart markets.”
Josh Rosenberg: Yeah, listen, I’m going to put my old Coke hat on first: Right product, right price, right location, right equipment. And then we always said, right message.
Jon said it. I mean, just I repurposed his words, but it really comes down to this. A lot of operators, when I worked with them, bought them, now work with them on the other side, they don’t always step back and think about the location dynamics.
You cannot think about every location in the same sense of “This is our price, they’re price sensitive, this is equipment, this is ROI.” If you do, you’re burdening your business. You’ve got to think about every location as to “What problem am I’m solving?” When you walk in with a smart cooler, you’re in control. You can typically look at market basket pricing.
But most of us as operators are not the new age. Most of us generationally sit in that higher bucket, that boomer bucket. We think differently. We have to change our mindset.
So, the ROI is often there. We pigeonhole ourselves against price. We have to change our mindset and think about, “What’s the segment we’re selling against, and price and program?” against the problem we’re solving, and we can overcome price sensitivity.
So, there’s a lot of different ways to position yourselves. And that’s what new-age operators are benefiting from. So yes, it may cost more on the front end, but if you think about the opportunity differently, the transaction with the client, segmented by a different type of client, you think about how to merchandise and sell products differently, and you think about the problem you’re solving, it’s not that expensive.
But it still comes down to right product, right equipment, right price, right location. It’s not a one-size-fits-all.
Bob Tullio: Well, a boomer bucket, man, that’s tough to step out of that boomer bucket. You’re absolutely right. We have to because there are 120 million people in the workplace and only 20 million of them are less than or still Boomers.
Ben, how do you address the cost issue? Give me your take on why operators can’t afford to be without the Nova Smart Cooler.
Ben Thomas: I would say over the past three years, I’ve been fully immersed in this kind of smart store, smart cooler space. And I can say without hesitation, the smart coolers, smart stores, already are defining the future of unintended retail. Now they’re unlocking entirely new revenue streams, opening doors to new locations, as we’ve mentioned, and bringing a fresh new wave of operators to this space, right? I think there’s this new future operator who’s no longer looking at venue and micro markets. They’re going straight to the smart store, straight to the smart cooler as their form of business. So, it’s a huge opportunity for both existing and new businesses. And this technology fills the critical gap that has existed since the early days of micro markets, offering flexible, scalable, and secure solutions that are going to thrive in today’s world.
What makes these kind of smart stores, smart coolers, game changers? The number one: frictionless checkout, leading to higher engagement and better use experiences. A big component of that is this new technology. We’ve got CV detection, we’ve got a weight sensor, we’ve got a combination of both, and that’s really driving this kind of new reduction to shrink, and giving operators the peace of mind, saying, “Okay, I can go out and test the waters with this location. That’s begging for a micro market, begging for better products, but I don’t have the ability to do it with the vending machine.”
And from a Nayax perspective, you know, we’ve got our Nova smart cooler. So with that, we’ve got, um, kind of the best of both worlds. We’ve got Shekel’s weight-based technology. We’ve got Due North industry-leading smart cooler. And we’ve got the Nayax global payment experience: coming together, providing an accurate, flexible and secure solution.
And I think from my perspective, there’s not a one-size-fits-all solution out there, right? You’re gonna see a range of these products come to the marketplace. I mean, from two years ago to now, there’s probably a 10X increase in different providers coming to this space. And I think it’s important for operators to be educated by it.
And at Nayax, we want to provide that education as well. From our perspective, we went with a weight-based solution because we liked the accuracy, you know, and we liked the flexibility. A lot of these operators want to expand their product mix, right? They want to get away from just traditional vending products and look to provide fresh food options, right? Maybe non-food items. And I feel like with the accuracy level that shelves are able to provide now, it does give the operator that flexibility to expand that product mix. And then again, with our experience with Due North and ourselves, you know, we feel that we’ve built a solution that can really meet that demand.
Bob Tullio: Tony Danna from Cantaloupe is a firm believer in smart stores, and he has some pretty compelling case studies to back it up. Tony, talk to us about some of the technology from Cantaloupe that you believe will improve the results for operators next year.
Tony Danna: It’s smart stores. Everything needs these smart coolers. It’s allowing operators to look at some of these traditional vending locations where they would have never felt comfortable with micro market. But now they can put a solution that offers the same benefits of a micro market. And I think we’ll see a big drive in the top-line revenues for the operators with that.
And then — very similar to when micro markets took off like a rocket ship in 2015, maybe just before that — we saw some tremendous growth. I think that’s what we’re going to see a lot of these operators with these smart solutions. And then really these smart solutions: Not being limited to being able to DEX every six hours of getting your product info. With these smart solutions, everything’s in real time because it’s connected to the internet. So on the back end of the VMS, we can be a lot more dialed in to when you got to be somewhere and what you need to bring to that location. So, I think that’s going to be a big driver.
Where we’ve seen a lot of success with these: non-traditional micro markets. Residential — yeah, we’ve had success with micro markets and residential and apartments, but it didn’t take off as much because of the theft discussion. Same with fitness centers and gyms. Yes, we have micro markets and fitness centers and gyms, but it didn’t take off at scale. [I see other opportunities for smart markets at] hotels, hospitals, college campuses, car dealerships, senior living facilities and then municipal government buildings. We are seeing success in each one of these verticals.
And we actually have a couple of case studies. So here’s one in a fitness gym. Again, energy drinks, waters, protein drinks, protein bars, Rice Krispies bars. And this operator is seeing $104.81 per day and growing. 569 total transactions.
The largest transaction was $22.37. That was pretty cool because it’s about once every other day. So, I have a feeling it’s the same gym goer, the same two gym goers. We’re seeing that same transaction happen just about every other day. So, they’re purchasing the same products out of this machine.
And so total revenue, they did $3,100 last month. And when you look at an ROI, that’s about 12 months. And I think a lot of operators that are on this call and out there in the industry are pretty happy with the 12-month ROI.
I found this very interesting right when we introduced these smart stores were going into FedEx locations like crazy. The theory is something happened at the corporate level, where they didn’t want to deal with micro markets and theft anymore. But we’ve been installing these smart stores like crazy across FedEx locations, and to say they are doing well in sales is probably the biggest understatement I could say. So, this unit is doing about $663 per day in sales, 4,800 transactions. Average transaction is $4.12. Total revenue last month was just under $20,000. That is a heck of a micro market out there. And now they’re not dealing with theft at this location.
Finally, the last one here, we’re seeing a lot of success with these is car dealerships. So, this one down in Texas is doing about $140 a day. Largest transaction, $20.41. Last month, that did just over $4,200 in sales. We’re seeing the average transaction $5.25.
So what we’re seeing with these smart stores is the same upside as the micro markets, and you just don’t need to deal with the theft aspect of it anymore.
Bob Tullio: Impressive numbers, no question about it.
New technology, Jon Holden, has really opened a lot of doors for operators, know, like grab-and-go options. But ultimately, the end product is the most important thing to the end users. Would you expand on that from your experience?
Jon Holden: Absolutely. I mean, this is the entire convenience services industry, right? From start way back when to finish. Our product that we are putting out there is the user experience. You know, we’re doing it in different ways, whether it’s old school, traditional vending machines, micro markets, now smart markets, office coffee, whatever it may be.
But our end product as operators is that user experience.
So you can have all the bells and whistles. You can have the coolest technology out there. You can have the newest things, the best graphics, but guess what? If your service isn’t there to back it up, you don’t have anything.
You know, I tell my team all the time, if we have a non-functioning cooler and if we have an empty cooler, that is basically a coffin with our logo on it, you know, so you have to have the service to back up what you’re putting out there, managing those client expectations, making sure that your team is ready.
That user experience comes from good, committed service, and it’s got to be repeatable service as well. You know, it can’t be a flash in the pan. So, you know, with that user-experience focus, you have to kind of take it from, okay, customer purchases the item and work back from that. How do we get to that perfect place where once that person walks up to the cooler, it’s a quick transaction? It’s a seamless transaction? It’s a frictionless transaction?
We’ve used that word a couple of times today, but you know, that user experience is what we do as operators in the convenience services industry. And that’s where we have to really put our focus to make sure that any type of technology — new or old — is beneficial technology for us.
Bob Tullio: Hey, Jon, do you see a little bit of people weaponizing technology out there to try to work their way into your locations? In other words, competitive pressure — maybe from a newbie who’s throwing the technology around, maybe inappropriately coming in with something less than a state-of-the-art smart market, maybe a not-so-smart market —and how do you deal with that?
Jon Holden: Well, I mean, Bob, we’re in a super competitive industry, relatively low barrier for entry. I mean, you can leave here, hop on any social media site, type in vending business in the search bar, and you’re going to have 100 videos telling you how you can make $20,000 in profit a month with zero dollars down, and maybe spending one hour a month working on that business, right? But we as operators have found maybe that’s not quite entirely true.
And so, we have seen some competitors that are emerging into this space with smart coolers or micro markets even, that really aren’t getting a full — and I’m trying to say this as nicely as I possibly can here, Bob, it’s the family show, right? — so they may have not figured out all of the factors before going and promising a potential client, a smart cooler or smart store or micro market. And really, you know, everything comes back to can it be serviced effectively, and can it be serviced with profitability?
And so you can walk into any location. If they don’t have the right headcount for that market, you’re not going to get your ROI. You have then soured that client on a micro market. Same thing for a smart store. Same thing for really any of our options within the industry here. And so, it all just comes back to, how can we service this client? Like Josh was saying, it’s got to be the right products, the right equipment, right pricing.
We’ve definitely seen our fair share of people popping in and kind of flash-in-pan situations. You know, I’m fortunate to work for a company that’s been doing this for over 60 years. I’ve learned from some really great people. I’ve got some great mentors within the industry as well.
It all just comes down to the fact that we all need to do our homework and not race to the bottom. I’m a big industry supporter. I want every operator out there to do well. And when we start undercutting on price or over-promising equipment for the wrong locations, it kind of sours the whole pot.
In support of the entire convenience services industry: New guys, we love having you here, but do your homework, and know what you’re putting out there before you promise it to a client.
Bob Tullio: Natali Pupovac-Peters of Naturals2Go said her company focuses on training, and that often means teaching operators to choose the right equipment.
Natali Pupovac-Peters: As much as we may be excited about micro markets, as much as we may be excited about AI, you know, as all the rage right now, what does your business or that location actually need? And that’s something that we really focus on with both our clients, as an operator, and then also teaching our clients or our operators as well, is you have to look at what the business needs.
You know, we provide all the training, we provide all the equipment, we provide all the support in creating that successful entrepreneur. State-of-the-art equipment that’s easy for our customers to use that are actually using the machines or the micro markets or the coffee. But at the end of the day, we need to really make sure that that location is one that is happy with what we’re doing with the products that we’re putting in there with the service that we’re providing and really looking at it as a holistic approach to this industry, because it’s not at the end of the day about about us as the operator, it’s about the customer that gets that end user experience.
Naturals2Go is really here to support those smaller operators to get into the business, and then be able to grow as big as they want, and provide them with all the tools and the resources they need to be able to scale and grow their business — and compete with the big dogs in the industry. Because I think that they can definitely do that. Anybody that’s willing to put in the work and the time and the energy and the money to do that can compete with the right tools in place.
Bob Tullio: Here is Orrin Huebner, Tony Danna and Natali Pupovac-Peters, each with their own crystal ball perspective.
We’re going to go to the crystal ball here. And this is one of my favorite things because we get to hold you guys accountable for next year in terms of your predictions. So, you’ve got 30 seconds each. Let’s pull out the ball. We’ll make it a multiple-choice question. What do you think will be the most prevalent trend over the next 12 months?
Huge increase in new operators entering the industry? Even more operator consolidation? Decline in vending? Continued growth of micro markets? Or smart markets will increase in a big way? Let’s start with Orrin.
Orrin Huebner: Can I get an all of the above? I really believe that all of the above is going to continue to happen. But if I were to pick one, I think smart markets will increase in a huge way. I don’t think big will be the answer.
Bob Tullio: That’s exactly what Tony wants to hear. Tony?
Tony Danna: Managing the small and medium business team, new operators are coming in this industry like crazy: what I’ve seen from August last year to today on smart markets, it’s a wild ride. And it’s something that can get more wild.
Bob Tullio: How about you, Natalie?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: I do agree with both of the gentlemen. But I do have a little bit of a different take on it. First off, I don’t necessarily think that we’re going to see a decline in vending.
If anything, what we’re seeing is sometimes we’re going to locations now and replacing micro markets — because of theft and things like that — with vending. Because it does seem to be an easier way for locations to manage that type of stuff.
And I do think there’s going to be a smart markets increase in a really big way, but I’m very curious to see what that looks like, know, one, two, three years down the road. The new fad, it’s the exciting thing, but I do think there will be some obstacles along the way. So I’m curious to see how that looks, but I do think all four of those will happen as well.
Bob Tullio: That’s it for now. On the next episode of Automatic Merchandiser’s Vending and OCS Nation podcast, we’ll take a long look at a company that is having a definite impact on the number of new operators in the convenience services industry.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently gutted a key government vaccine panel, saying it was necessary to eliminate what he called ""persistent conflicts of interest"" on the committee.
But new research from the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy & Economics appears to challenge that argument. Conflicts on that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel had been at ""historic lows for years"" before Kennedy restacked it with new members, some of whom are widely known vaccine critics, the researchers found.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA on Monday, also found that the type of conflict considered to be the ""most concerning"" – income from vaccine makers – had been virtually eliminated among members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.
Conflicts of interest rates were also low on a separate panel of advisors to the Food and Drug Administration called the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, or VRBPAC, according to the research.
Both groups are crucial to shaping U.S. vaccine policy: While the FDA committee advises the agency on whether to approve shots, the CDC panel determines who is eligible for jabs and whether insurers should cover them. The panels are typically made up of top experts in infectious diseases, pediatrics, immunology and public health.
Kennedy has long contended that the advisors on those panels have close ties to the pharmaceutical industry. At his first Senate confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy claimed that 97% of the CDC panel members had conflicts of interest.
""Before he was confirmed, I saw this 97% number and thought, wow, that's some serious stuff. But after looking at the vaccine data myself, I certainly couldn't see anything at that scale,"" said the study's lead author Genevieve Kanter, an associate professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, in an interview.
""I think it will be reassuring to the public and to the [Trump] administration that issues that we thought were pretty serious or in the past were serious are not anymore,"" she added.
The research comes as Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic himself, overhauls federal health agencies and pursues efforts that could change immunization policy and undermine vaccine uptake in the U.S.
The USC researchers analyzed reported financial conflicts of interest among experts on the two vaccine panels between 2000 and 2024.
Here's how conflicts of interest disclosures work on the panels, which meet several times a year to review vaccines: For each product being discussed, members must say if they have a tie to the vaccine maker or a competitor and disclose the nature of the relationship. People on the panel with conflicts either receive a waiver to participate if they are deemed to provide essential expertise, while those with conflicts considered too significant are recused.
Since 2016, an average of 6.2% of ACIP members and 1.9% of VRBPAC members have reported a financial conflict of interest at any given meeting, according to the paper. During that period, less than 1% of reported conflicts on both panels were tied to personal income from vaccine makers, including consulting fees, stock, royalties or ownership.
Rates of reported conflicts among ACIP members fell to 5% by 2024, and stayed below 4% among VRBPAC members since 2010, including 10 years where there were no reported conflicts at all.
Conflict of interest rates were significantly higher in the early 2000s, peaking at around 43% for ACIP in 2000 and 27% for VRBPAC in 2007, the researchers found.
The study said the decline over the years may be due to policy changes in 2007 that cracked down on conflicts of interest on the FDA panel, and ""greater awareness and scrutiny"" of conflicts in agency decision-making. It's not clear when exactly the CDC committee began to do the same.
Across the study period, the most frequently reported conflict of interest was research support, which is generally considered less of a concern than financial ties associated with personal income. Kanter said that's a reflection of the panel members' areas of expertise that are relevant to evaluating the safety, efficacy and applicability of shots.
""The dominant conflicts were grant support for research. In a way that makes sense because, who do we want on these committees? It's people with expertise on how to conduct research on these vaccines,"" Kanter said.
""These conflicts are not about personal gain, but related to measures of expertise.""
While some of the rates appear to be higher with ACIP members than with people on the VRBPAC panel, Kanter said it is not comparable because the CDC provides ""far less granular"" data on conflicts of interest. She added that the FDA panel typically reviews one product at a time during a meeting, while the CDC committee evaluates multiple.
Kanter said it is important to examine conflicts of interest and the influence of the pharmaceutical industry in many aspects of health-care regulation.
But she added that ""if we do want to focus on conflicts of interest, there may be other areas where the prevalence is a greater concern than what we've seen here with these vaccine panels.""

Latest in health care: UnitedHealth's Buffett bounce holds for now
Warren Buffett was just what the doctor ordered to stabilize UnitedHealth Group shares.
Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing revealing a new stake of more than 5 million shares has helped lift the stock back above $300 — a far cry from the 52-week low of under $235 that it hit earlier this month.
This marks Berkshire's first foray into the complicated area of managed care. David Tepper's Appaloosa Fund also provided a vote of confidence in the embattled health care giant's stock, boosting its stake to 2.5 million shares.
For both, it's a bet on recovery, but analysts say the wait could take well over a year.When assessing the purchases, Baird analyst Michael Ha invoked Warren Buffett's own words about ""complicated, uncertain investments"" which belong in the ""too hard pile.""
In a note to clients, Ha wrote that UnitedHealth's issues extend beyond pricing in its Medicare Advantage plans to real structural problems with its Optum health physician unit that aren't as easily fixed. Ha added that ""near-term execution risk is high and we see potential for the situation to worsen over the next 12-18 months before improving.""
For now, on a technical basis, UnitedHealth shares are trading above their 50-day moving average for the first time since the company first lowered guidance in April.

It's that time of year again! I'm attending Epic's annual Users Group Meeting, where thousands of health-care executives flock to the company's 1,670-acre headquarters to learn about the company's latest products and features.
Epic is a health-care software company best known for its electronic health record, or EHR software. An EHR is a digital version of a patient's medical record that's maintained by doctors and nurses over time. Epic is the dominant EHR vendor in the U.S., and its technology is used in 3,300 hospitals and 73,000 clinics and by 325 million patients around the globe, according to the company.
Artificial intelligence was front and center at UGM this year, much like it was last year. During a three-hour-long executive address Tuesday morning, Epic executives shared updates about the roughly 200 new AI features it's been developing for patients, clinicians and payers. Keep an eye out for additional coverage from CNBC that explains some of these upcoming features in more detail.
Epic confirmed that it is developing its own AI-powered clinical documentation tool, which was one of the most anticipated announcements of this year's event. These tools, which are often called AI scribes, are able to draft clinical notes in real time as doctors consensually record their visits with patients.
A fiercely competitive AI scribing market has taken off as health-care executives search for solutions to help reduce staff burnout and daunting administrative workloads. Some AI scribing startups like Abridge and Ambience Healthcare have raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors, and there was a lot of speculation about whether Epic would ultimately join the fray.
The company said it is working on this feature in partnership with Microsoft, and that it will be available for limited use early next year.
""AI is here, it's accelerating, you can't wish it away, you've got to keep up with it,"" Epic's President Sumit Rana said during the address.
The presentations took place in Epic's 11,400-seat underground auditorium called Deep Space, which is just one of the many unique facilities on campus. Epic's office buildings are themed, with many inspired by science fiction and stories like ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the Harry Potter series and ""Alice in Wonderland.""
UGM meetings are also themed, and Epic executives famously take the stage dressed in costume. This year's theme was ""sci-fi,"" and Epic's 82-year-old founder and CEO Judy Faulkner wore a purple wig, bright green shoes and a metallic vest that appeared inspired by the fictional character, Buzz Lightyear.
CNBC had the opportunity to sit down with Faulkner earlier this summer in a rare interview, where she reflected on her 46 years at the company's helm. During her presentation on Tuesday, Faulkner discussed Epic's AI initiatives and roadmap.
""We are combining the intelligence and curiosity of the human being with the investigative capabilities of gen AI,"" she said.
Many of the new features Epic teased on Tuesday are still several months, or over a year, away. But it's clear that Epic is leaning in on AI, and they didn't let this year's UGM attendees forget it.

That backdrop has forced retailers to get creative to protect margins while shoppers hunt for deals on clothes, dorm-room decor and more. Tariffs are front and center. Just over half of respondents to UBS's back-to-school survey last month cited elevated import duties as a top economic concern, behind only inflation. The result is ""lackluster"" consumer spending intentions, according to UBS. Based on its survey data, the firm estimated that spending on clothing, shoes, and accessories will decline 2.3% year over year. That's in line with a forecast from the National Retail Federation . The trade group predicted that families with students in elementary through high school will spend an average of $858.07 on clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics — about 2% less than 2024's $874.68. Parents started their shopping earlier than normal, the NRF's survey found, with a majority of those saying they are doing so specifically out of concern that prices would rise due to tariffs. The behaviors described in these surveys don't necessarily signal that the U.S. consumer is collapsing. In an interview, Morgan Stanley retail analyst Michelle Weaver said she is ""seeing the health of the consumer weaken but it's not outright weak,"" pointing to mixed data points. The July retail sales report showed ""pretty robust"" spending activity, Weaver said, rising 0.5% for the month after an upwardly revised 0.9% gain in June. At the same time, during the latest earnings season, Weaver noted many consumer-exposed companies in the restaurants and staples industries reported poor sales growth and value-seeking behavior. This dynamic is occurring against a backdrop of creeping inflation, albeit at a slower pace. Consumer sentiment in August fell for the first time since April as inflation expectations rose, the University of Michigan's closely watched monthly survey found. However, for value-oriented players like Club names TJX Companies , Costco and Amazon — all known for their pricing flexibility — the tariff and inflation picture could drive traffic as consumers seek ways to stretch their budgets. For retailers more broadly, though, this dynamic may mean tighter profits if they avoid passing through costs to already-pressured consumers. Many retailers are reporting earnings this week, including TJX and Target on Wednesday and bellwether Walmart on Thursday. Tariffs are beginning to show up in consumer prices, even if the overall headline inflation numbers haven't deterred Wall Street from betting on a Federal Reserve rate cut next month. The June inflation data ""clearly showed the start of tariff-driven inflation,"" Weaver said. For example, apparel prices rose 0.4% in that month's consumer price index report, while household furnishings were up 1%. In the July CPI report, which was released last week, household furnishings saw a 0.7% gain — though apparel increases moderated, up just 0.1%. In general, Weaver warned that the the trend could continue throughout the year as the full effect of tariffs unfolds. This makes ""a challenging environment for both the consumer and consumer companies given that they're now getting hit with tariffs,"" Weaver noted. To blunt the impact of tariffs, Weaver said retailers are leaning on a range of mitigation strategies. First is pricing power but ""companies aren't likely to pass 100% of the cost of tariffs to consumers."" Beyond pricing, she highlighted stockpiling inventory ahead of tariffs, diversifying supply chains and negotiating with suppliers to share the burden. Now let's zoom in on three Club retailers that count on the back-to-school period to drive sales. Costco Costco stands out as a retailer that has embraced all these strategies to address the tariff risk. Historically, the company is known for pressing suppliers to cut prices before considering passing costs on to consumers. If suppliers don't play ball, Costco can choose to put more of its private label Kirkland Signature brand on its shelves instead. Leveraging Kirkland is an important lever for the company because it comes with better margins and allows Costco to control more its supply chain. On its latest earnings call in late May, management highlighted additional tactics, including sourcing inventory from other countries not subject to tariffs, leverage its global footprint to reroute products sourced from countries exposed to tariffs, and pull forward inventory purchases on items such as sporting goods, allowing it to hold prices or only increase them slightly. These measures have helped the business maintain momentum during a challenging operating environment for retailers. Indeed, its monthly sales reports have continued to show strength across categories despite a tougher retail backdrop. TJX Companies For TJX, the off-price model itself functions as a built-in defense against tariff pressures. As Telsey Advisory Group's Dana Telsey wrote in her back-to-school 2025 outlook, discount formats are set to ""dominate expected BTS shopping."" She added that off-price retailers like TJX are positioned to keep capturing share as shoppers trade down ""in search of value and secondhand options amid ongoing macro caution."" That's because TJX's flexible and opportunistic buying model allows it to absorb cost pressures while still offering branded goods at steep discounts compared with what a full-price retailer offers. Telsey maintains a buy-rating on the stock with a $150 price target. UBS echoed that optimism in a separate preview note, forecasting ""solid sales momentum"" and an earnings beat when the company reports fiscal second-quarter results Wednesday, along with the potential to raise guidance. ""Not only do we expect TJX to take major share from department stores, but also we believe TJX should benefit from the disruption tariffs may cause for US retailers"" in the second half of 2025, UBS wrote. The firm reiterated its 12-month buy rating on TJX and a price target of $164 on the stock. Amazon One of the most popular destinations for back-to-school shopping this year is online retailers, favoring Amazon's colossal e-commerce marketplace, per the NRF. According to the firm, many back-to-school shoppers planned their purchases around the retailer's discount-heavy Prime Day in July, which ran four days this year instead of 48 hours. In its survey work, Telsey similarly found that the vast majority of respondents were looking to find school supplies on sale — and data suggests they did just that. July Prime Day proved to be a huge early back-to-school shopping opportunity, with sales of school supplies, including backpacks, lunchboxes, binders and kids apparel, up a massive 175%, according to Adobe for Business . The internet category is ""ready to capture shares during the back-to-school shopping season by highlighting value-focused school essentials and discretionary products,"" wrote Telsey. Amazon's appeal isn't just pricing, but also its speed. The combination of competitive deals and fast delivery enables students to grab essentials early with convenience. That's why Telsey believes Amazon ""should continue to gain share ... given the timing of its Prime Day, combined with the leverage of Prime members data over a wider selection of products, and faster fulfillment."" Bottom line Back-to-school spending may look softer on the surface this year, but this environment is still creating winners among retailers. Rising tariffs and shaky consumer sentiment are pressuring households, prompting them to shop earlier and hunt for deals to make their dollars go further. For investors, this means value players like TJX, Costco and Amazon stand to capture more dollars from parents who prioritize affordability. With tariff-driven inflation still filtering through, we are staying selective in our retail exposure, leaning toward companies that can both protect their margins and delivery value to cost-conscious consumers. TJX, Costco and Amazon check those boxes. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long COST, TJX, AMZN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

But if they wanted to get to the finish line, they would need to pair up.
The bank pitted the two teams against each other for the right to give some $29 billion to Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Platforms Inc. so that it can build a sprawling data center in Louisiana to undergird the company’s most powerful artificial intelligence models.
The deal was so large that Meta and Morgan Stanley didn’t want to rely on just one financial firm, no matter how big, according to people familiar with the negotiations. The bankers put Pacific Investment Management Co. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. on one team, and the private capital behemoths Apollo Global Management Inc. and KKR & Co. on another, to ensure that both pairs would have the ability to fund the whole deal quickly, the people said.
The competition between the firms came to a conclusion in early August when Morgan Stanley gave the nod to Pimco and Blue Owl, Bloomberg reported. The social-media giant opted for a solution that pairs one of the biggest institutional bond firms with one of the fastest growing players in the private credit world.
The decision brought to an end a process that began in early 2025, not long after a dinner that Morgan Stanley hosted to pitch asset managers on the opportunity in funding AI infrastructure. The negotiations that ensued were so complicated that they went on for some eight months after informal discussions began, longer than some of the participants had anticipated, the people said.
All the firms involved declined to comment.
The final result was a particularly important win for Pimco, which has been striving to diversify beyond its background in publicly traded debt. Alongside Morgan Stanley, it will arrange $26 billion of investment-grade bonds for the Meta project, with Blue Owl putting up $3 billion in equity funding.
The intense jockeying that went on behind the scenes underscores the huge financial stakes behind the rise of artificial intelligence, and the rapid build-out of the computing and power infrastructure needed to feed the chatbots sweeping the digital world. This article is based on interviews with numerous people familiar with the deal, all of whom declined to be identified because the discussions are private.
Private Capital
A decade or two ago, this kind of spending could have only been funded through debt and equity raised in the public markets. While some of the big AI projects currently under construction have gone that path, for its biggest data center yet, Meta chose to tap the more opaque wells of private capital that have come to assume an outsized role in the financial system over the last decade.
For borrowers, private credit costs more, but is attractive because it allows them to keep a tighter leash on the process without broadly releasing information about their data centers. For lenders, it offers a bigger return than they would have gotten from Meta’s traditional corporate debt. Deals such as Meta’s also offer additional security to investors because they are backed by valuable real estate and infrastructure.
The Meta financing is not finalized and the details are still in flux, but potential investors have had initial discussions about pricing the bonds at 1.5 percentage points above the company’s publicly traded debt. Some of the securities are expected to be syndicated in the coming weeks.
It is the largest funding package related to a specific AI data center by a wide margin, with others involving xAI Corp. and CoreWeave Inc. worth less than $10 billion. Apollo announced this month that it had agreed to buy a majority stake in Stream Data Centers, its first such acquisition as it capitalizes on the booming demand for digital infrastructure.
The most recent debt deal anywhere close to the size of Meta’s was a $26 billion bond sale to support Mars Inc.’s purchase of rival food-maker Kellanova in March.
The race to capture this business comes with obvious risks. The most visible face of the AI industry, OpenAI, released its latest chatbot, GPT-5, to tepid reviews this month, ramping up questions about whether the progression toward super intelligence is slowing down, and with it, the bid to turn the models into real business opportunities.
But the opportunity is too big for any financial firm to pass up. The data centers being built in just the next two years will require some $150 billion of financing, on top of what the AI companies are funding themselves, according to an analysis released by JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Aug. 7. Half of that could be bundled into commercial mortgage-backed securities, the analysts wrote. But that leaves another $70 billion to $90 billion up for grabs.
AI Gamble
The stage for the Meta deal was set late last year at the private dinner Morgan Stanley hosted for most of the largest private capital firms. The bankers spoke about the massive funding needs of the AI industry, which would, they said, be so large that the asset managers would need to work together.
Not long after, Morgan Stanley began approaching firms about the latest and largest of Meta’s 27 data centers around the world, a 4 million–square–foot complex in rural Louisiana dubbed Hyperion, which is expected to eventually be able to draw, at full capacity, as much as 5 gigawatts of power — roughly the equivalent of 4 million US homes, according to a Bloomberg analysis of government data.
Rather than paying for the center with Meta’s own cash, which would be more expensive, or with straight corporate debt, which would add leverage to the corporate parent, Morgan Stanley proposed a special purpose vehicle that would be tied to the assets themselves.
The process began in earnest back in April when non-disclosure agreements were signed and the first term sheets came in.
Early on, some of the biggest asset managers were eager to handle the deal on their own, people familiar with the negotiations said. And it appeared that Apollo was a frontrunner, Bloomberg reported. The firm had shown its strength last year with an $11 billion deal to help pay for an Intel Corp. facility in Ireland. This was all a crucial part of Apollo’s effort to find a home for the vast amounts of cash its booming insurance business needs to put to work.
Meta, though, kept the process running as it looked for better terms. Negotiations regarding leases, pricing and the private and public elements of the deal were hashed out, as Apollo and KKR sought to secure terms that better suited their insurance funds.
Morgan Stanley reached out to several large Wall Street banks about lending money, and a number of other large asset managers, including Blackstone Inc., Brookfield Asset Management, Ares Management Corp. and Sixth Street Partners, each of which made its own bid.
Those firms all declined to comment.
Syndication Option
By July, Meta and its bankers had narrowed it down to the final four. Apollo was assigned to work with KKR, which has a similar reliance on insurance funding. Pimco and Blue Owl were teamed up because they had already worked together and had each offered to take a different piece of the financing.
The structure pitched by Apollo and KKR would have come with more private terms, which would have restricted the pool of potential investors who could participate in a future syndication and given the lenders more control over the process. By contrast, the format ultimately agreed upon with Pimco — known in the industry as a 144a bond — makes it easier to distribute the debt to other investors in the future.
Pimco agreed to underwrite a portion of the $26 billion of debt and to work with Morgan Stanley to potentially syndicate some of it to other investors. Apollo and KKR had offered to handle the financing themselves and would have relied on their internal capital markets teams if they had distributed any of it to other buyers.
The participants were expecting a final decision by Aug. 1 but the process stretched out for another week as Meta went back to the finalists with more questions, the people said. Eventually, Blue Owl and Pimco got the call on Aug. 7.
The bonds they agreed to will have a tenor of 24 years, including four years for construction before the lease payments begin. The equity for the joint venture will be divided between Meta and Blue Owl, the people said.
Morgan Stanley has helped arrange large private credit deals before. Earlier this year, it worked with Ares on a $5 billion debt package to support Clearlake Capital Group’s acquisition of Dun & Bradstreet Holdings Inc.",d2754f06b9e871e9627d83a0b8e5effd,trafilatura,8746,0

These strong results should ease concerns that the $25 billion CyberArk deal was masking a slowdown in the core business. Revenue for the company's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter increased 16% year over year to $2.54 billion, exceeding the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.5 billion, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 27% to 95 cents in the quarter, ahead of the 88-cent LSEG consensus estimate. PANW YTD mountain Palo Alto Networks YTD Shares rose about 5% in after-hours trading to about $185. The move would put the stock back in positive territory for 2025, though the stock was still down from $204 when the company's interest in CyberArk was first reported. Bottom line It's been a rocky earnings season so far for the cybersecurity stocks, with Fortinet and Check Point getting hammered after reporting, and Cisco Systems' security revenue significantly missing its consensus estimate. But Palo Alto Networks is a best-of-breed company, and it proved why Monday night with solid beats across all the key metrics: revenue, adjusted EPS, adjusted free cash flow margin, next-generation security annual recurring revenue (ARR), and total remaining performance obligation (RPO). The company also issued upside guidance for its fiscal year 2026. Now that we've seen the quarter and upbeat outlook, the CyberArk acquisition — which sent Palo Alto shares from $204.50 before the deal was announced to a low of about $167 about one week ago — shouldn't be perceived as a defensive move to help a struggling core business. Palo Alto is playing offense by adding a leader in Identity security to its portfolio at a time when management believes the market will inflect in the next 12 to 24 months due to the emergence of agentic AI. ""If you believe that we have been able to identify inflections in a good way at Palo Alto Networks, it is important for you to believe that we have this one right as well,"" CEO Nikesh Arora said on the earnings call. Why we own it We believe cybersecurity is a secular growth market, as bad actors are relentless and companies simply cannot afford not to invest in defense. It is a never-ending arms race. We believe Palo Alto Networks, in particular, is uniquely positioned to thrive due to its best-in-class tools and a broad product portfolio that allows it to provide an all-encompassing ""platform"" solution to cybersecurity. Competitors : CrowdStrike (also a Club stock), Fortinet , Cisco Systems Last buy : Aug. 11, 2025 Initiation : Feb. 15, 2023 Any deal of this size comes with execution risk, creating an overhang on the stock until management proves otherwise. However, we have great confidence in Arora's ability to deliver, given his extensive background in deal-making. That's a big reason why we upgraded the stock to our 1 rating when Arora explained the deal on CNBC and added to our position last Monday. We're reiterating our buy-equivalent 1 rating and our $225 price target. Commentary Palo Alto Networks and the term ""platformization"" have now become synonymous. It's been about 18 months since the company announced a strategic shift toward accelerated ""platformization"" of its cybersecurity offerings. This strategy is all about getting customers to buy entire suites of products and consolidate their cybersecurity spending with Palo Alto. It's a change from the old way client companies used to buy individual products from different cybersecurity vendors. By accelerating a platform strategy, Palo Alto has said it would lead to more market share, bigger deals, and higher ARR per customer, as well as better security outcomes and lower churn rates. Palo Alto Networks set a new record for platformization in the quarter, bringing the total count to 1,400. That's up from 1,000 one year ago and keeps the company on track to reach 2,500 to 3,500 total platformizations by fiscal year 2030. ""The record-breaking number of platformization deals this quarter demonstrates that customers are not just buying products, they are buying into a strategic partnership,"" Arora explained on the earnings call. ""We believe that integrated best-to-beat platforms deliver superior security outcomes, and our customers are validating this conviction by making larger, more strategic commitments with us than ever before."" We're encouraged by how the company is seeing strong growth from its largest customers. It had 156 customers with over $5 million in next-gen security ARR in the fourth quarter, up 51% year over year. It had 51 customers with over $10 million in next-gen security ARR, up 50% year over year. One of the big wins in the quarter was a $111 million deal with a leading global consulting firm. Another big transaction was a $61 million deal with a global financial services firm. A third big win was a $33 million deal with a large U.S. insurance provider. Palo Alto does not disclose the names of its clients. Guidance For Palo Alto's full-year fiscal 2026, here's what the company expects. All estimates are sourced from FactSet. Total revenue in the range of $10.48 billion to $10.53 billion. This midpoint of $10.5 billion is above the consensus estimate of $10.42 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) in the range of $3.75 to $3.85, which at the midpoint of $3.80 greatly exceeds the $3.67 consensus estimate. GAAP stands for generally accepted accounting principles. Adjusted free cash flow margin in the range of 38% to 39%. This implies adjusted free cash flow of about $4 billion, which is above the consensus estimate of $3.9 billion. The adjusted free cash flow margin is calculated by dividing adjusted free cash flow by revenue. RPO of $18.6 billion to $18.7 billion, which is well above the consensus estimate of $18.12 billion. Next-generation security ARR of $7 billion to $7.1 billion, which is a beat versus the $6.94 billion consensus estimate. The company's outlook for the fiscal 2026 first quarter was in line/better than expected across every major line item. Here management expects. Revenue in the range of $2.45 billion to $2.47 billion. Adjusted EPS in the range of 88 cents to 90 cents. Next-gen security ARR of $5.82 billion to $5.84 billion. RPO of $15.4 billion to $15.5 billion. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long PANW, CSCO.

His administration called for the high court to put the case on a highly expedited schedule, with arguments starting in early November, according to reported filings.
On Wednesday, Trump said the US may have to ""unwind"" existing trade deals, including with the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, if the Supreme Court doesn't uphold the tariffs.
""If we don't win that case, our country is going to suffer so greatly,"" Trump told reporters before meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki. ""These deals are all done. I guess we'd have to unwind them.""
One of those deals was cemented Thursday, as Trump signed an executive order implementing the US's pact with Japan.
A federal appeals court ruled Friday that most of Trump's global tariffs were illegal, reaffirming an earlier ruling by the Court of International Trade and saying he exceeded his authority in using emergency powers to impose them. The judges, however, allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the case moves through the appeals process.
Other members of the administration are making backup plans, however. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he is confident the Supreme Court will back Trump's use of the 1977 emergency law to impose broad tariffs but said the administration is working on a Plan B.
In any case, the ""reciprocal"" tariffs Trump unveiled on dozens of US trade partners (which you can see in the graphic below) now face legal limbo.
Elsewhere, Trump has said he is not considering lowering tariffs on India, a week after the US doubled duties on its imports to 50% in response to India's purchase of Russian oil.
When a reporter asked if he might roll back some of the tariffs, Trump replied, ""No.""
Trump has amped up criticism of the trade relationship between the US and India, saying it has been heavily one-sided for decades. Trump's comments came as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has embarked on bids to strengthen ties with China and Russia as relations with the US have deteriorated. On Tuesday, Trump suggested he wasn't considering lowering tariffs on India.
Here are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.

Trump signs executive order implementing trade pact with Japan
President Trump has signed an executive order implementing the US's trade deal with Japan, the White House said Thursday.
The move cements tariffs of 15% on most imports from Japan.
""Under the Agreement, the United States will apply a baseline 15% tariff on nearly all Japanese imports entering the United States, alongside separate sector-specific treatment for automobiles and automobile parts; aerospace products; generic pharmaceuticals; and natural resources that are not naturally available or produced in the United States,"" the order
The US trade deficit widened to its largest amount in four months in July as companies raced to import products in order to front-run President Trump's latest round of broad-based tariffs.
Bloomberg reports that the goods and services trade gap grew nearly 33% from the prior month to $78.3 billion, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The value of imported goods increased 5.9% in July, driven by industrial supplies, consumer goods, gold, and capital equipment. Exports also ticked higher during the month.
The swings in trade this year have created volatility in gross domestic product (GDP) readings as well, as frequent policy changes have led some importers to pull forward or pause shipments. Following the release of trade deficit data, Goldman Sachs lowered its third quarter GDP growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.7%.
If Trump's biggest tariffs get thrown out, companies could get a refund — but not consumers
While companies absorb tariff costs and pass some of them along to consumers, President Trump has been touting the amount of money US tariffs are bringing the government.
But if the Supreme Court upholds a lower court's ruling that the tariffs are illegal, thereby striking them down, the government could have to refund the taxes it has collected on imported goods. That would mark a huge reversal in Trump's trade policy — but not one that is likely to land consumers any cash back.
India looking beyond US for pharma exports amid tariff tensions
India is seeking to boost drug exports to Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, in an effort to reduce dependence on the US market amid tariff concerns, Reuters reports.
China just made its latest deliberated move in its trade dance with the Trump administration.
Bloomberg reports:
China started imposing levies on additional US optical fiber imports, after a six-month investigation found that American companies had circumvented its anti-dumping measures.
The duties, ranging from 33.3% to 78.2%, took effect Thursday Beijing time on “certain cut-off shifted single-mode optical fiber” from the US, according to a statement from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
Among the companies subject to the new duties, Corning Inc. (GLW) now faces a 37.9% levy, OFS Fitel LLC is at 33.3% and Draka Communications Americas Inc. has a 78.2% duty.
The probe was the first anti-circumvention investigation China has ever initiated, the Mofcom said in a separate statement published Thursday.
Carney sends envoy to DC after 'constructive' Trump call
Bloomberg reports on some progress around talks between the US and Canada:
As a reminder, some goods from Canada face 35% US tariffs. But many goods are exempted under the US-Canada-Mexico trade agreement, leading Carney to boast that the effective 5.5% rate is the ""lowest average tariff of any country in the world.""
But sectoral duties — and overall certainty — remain a concern:
Bolsonaro's coup trial speeds ahead as his son tries to keep Trump engaged
Bloomberg has an interesting nugget in a story today about former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's coup trial.
Eduardo Bolsonaro, the former president's son, took a leave from Brazil's Congress and moved to the US to lobby President Trump on his father's cause. He wasn't pushing for — and didn't expect — the US leader to respond by levying 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports. Politically, it has backfired.

Ford made its big EV announcement early this week — a plan to invest $2 billion to transform its Louisville Assembly Plant into a factory capable of making a new generation of affordable EVs, starting with a midsize pickup truck with a base price of $30,000 that is slated to launch in 2027.
Amid the presentations from various executives, union leaders, and employees, CEO Jim Farley said something I couldn’t quite shake:
“There are no guarantees with this project. We’re doing so many new things, I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right; it is a bet. There is risk.”
The bet? The company put together a skunkworks team, which worked for a couple of years to find a way to build a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. To do that, the company has scrapped the century-old system that made Ford a household name and developed a new three-pronged assembly line that uses more automation and unicastings.
Ford, like many other automakers, is being squeezed by tariffs, slower than expected EV demand, and the looming threat of competition from China. The company has to act if it wants to stay relevant. But is this the move?
Ford can’t really use this manufacturing technique at other factories, since it is pinned to how the vehicle is designed and then split into three unicastings — a major departure from the method used to assemble its other vehicles. What this means is we’re witnessing a $5 billion experiment ($3 billion for the LFP battery factory and $2 billion for Louisville) to keep jobs in the United States.
A little bird
A few little birds told us that rental car startup Kyte, which once billed itself as the “best alternative to Hertz,” is no longer operating.
The startup was already in trouble late last year after slashing staff and cutting down to just two markets. But in July, the company sold its customer list to peer-to-peer car share company Turo. (Turo declined further commenting on the terms.) And since then, Kyte appears to have gone fully under, entering a form of receivership in California in late July.
That has apparently left a number of customers in the lurch who had already booked rentals through Kyte; Turo told TechCrunch it is only responsible for the assets it purchased — not any financial claims against the now-defunct Kyte.
Bumper, a U.K.-based buy now, pay later platform for car servicing and repairs, raised $10.8 million in a Series B extension funding led by Autotech Ventures. InMotion Ventures, Suzuki Global Ventures, Porsche Ventures, and Shell Ventures also joined.
Chowdeck, a Lagos-based food delivery startup, raised $9 million in Series A funding led by Novastar Ventures, with participation from Y Combinator, AAIC Investment, Rebel Fund, GFR Fund, Kaleo, HoaQ, and others.
Eve Air Mobility — the urban air mobility company, announced a $230 million capital raise and dual listing in the U.S. and Brazil. The company has raised $1 billion to date.
Ultraviolette, the Indian electric motorcycle startup, raised $21 million in an all-equity round led by the corporate venture arm of Japanese electronics giant TDK Corporation. Ultraviolette’s existing investors Zoho Corporation and Lingotto (previously Exor Capital) also participated.
Via has filed its S-1 paperwork on its road to IPO. The transit software company has not yet determined the number of shares to be offered or the price range. This dropped just as I was sending out this newsletter, so I haven’t read through the entire doc yet. A couple of items worth noting, though: The company’s revenue grew 35% to $337 million from 2023 to 2024. Its net loss narrowed to $90 million over the same time period. And CEO Daniel Ramot’s 2024 compensation package, which includes stock grants, is $9.5 million. Per the footnotes, the company is issuing him an additional grant package for 2025 and a cash bonus program.
WeRide, the Chinese autonomous vehicle company, has secured an investment from Grab. The companies did not disclose the investment amount. WeRide said the funds will help speed deployment and commercialization of Level 4 robotaxis and shuttles in Southeast Asia.
Notable reads and other tidbits
Foxconn will no longer build electric tractors for California startup Monarch Tractor after the Taiwanese tech giant recently sold its Ohio factory to SoftBank. History lesson: Foxconn had planned to establish an electric vehicle contract manufacturing operation at the factory and Monarch was one of four companies it was working with. The other three (Lordstown Motors, Fisker, and IndiEV) have all gone bankrupt.
Some high-profile executive shuffling is underway. Self-driving truck maker Waabi hired Uber Freight CEO Lior Ron (who has a long and interesting history in the AV world) as chief operating officer. Rebecca Tinucci, who previously spent six years building Tesla’s charging network, has taken over as head of Uber Freight. Ron will stay on as Uber Freight’s chairman.
A spending freeze on the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program has thawed after months of uncertainty. The Trump administration has finally issued new guidance that states can use to dole out $5 billion in funding for electric vehicle charging infrastructure, after spending months withholding the money.
Rapido, a popular ride-hailing platform in India, is beta-testing its food delivery service in Bengaluru in a challenge to market leaders Swiggy and Zomato.
How many pivots can one company make in its lifetime? Revel is testing the bounds of that question. The company, which started out as an electric scooter rental service, has shut down its ride-hailing service in New York City. Revel will instead focus on its nascent EV charging business.
A bit more on the “Tesla Dojo is dead” news that I wrote about last week. Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has disbanded the team working on its Dojo AI training supercomputer, just weeks after announcing he expected to have Tesla’s second cluster operating “at scale” in 2026. Tesla is shifting its focus to its AI5 and AI6 chips, which are being manufactured by TSMC and Samsung, respectively. Note: Tesla’s plant in Buffalo, New York, was supposed to be the home of the Dojo supercomputer and the company had committed to investing $500 million into the factory over five years to bring Dojo there.

Stocks are mixed today on geopolitical concerns as European leaders are set to meet with President Trump in Washington today to discuss potential terms to end the Russian-Ukrainian war. The outcome could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security. Also, concerns about how consumers are holding up in the early days of President Trump's tariffs are limiting gains in stocks ahead of earnings results this week from some of the biggest US retailers, including Walmart, Target, and Home Depot.
Today's US economic news was negative for stocks after the Aug NAHB housing market index unexpectedly fell -1 to 32, weaker than expectations of an increase to 34.
The focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal, with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy and European leaders set to meet President Trump in Washington later today. On Tuesday, Jul housing starts are expected to fall -1.6% m/m to 1.300 million, and Jul building permits are expected to fall -0.4% m/m to 1.388 million. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000 and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July. Also, the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 49.8. In addition, Jul existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Regarding tariffs, President Trump said last Friday, ""I'll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we'll be setting sometime next week, week after."" Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.
In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced ""within the next week or so."" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 84% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 51% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 92% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.44%. China's Shanghai Composite rallied to a 10-year high and closed up +0.85%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 rallied to a new record high and closed up +0.77%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are down -2 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is up +1.2 bp to 4.328%. T-note prices are slightly lower on concern that last week's bearish US July CPI and PPI reports could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month's FOMC meeting.
Losses in T-notes are limited after today's news showed the Aug NAHB housing market index unexpectedly declined. T-notes are also supported by an increase in safe-haven demand after there was no breakthrough in the Trump-Putin summit last Friday to end the war in Ukraine.
European government bond yields today are mixed. The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.3 bp to 2.776%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 2.5-month high of 4.743% and is up by +4.3 bp to 4.739%.

Driven by younger consumers who crave customized, cold beverages, chains from Dunkin' to Dutch Bros, Starbucks and McDonald's are answering the call.
The number of beverages offered by the top 500 chains has increased by more than 9% in the last year, according to Technomic's 2025 Away-From-Home Beverage Navigator Report. Companies have leaned even more into cold drinks. Offerings like specialty coffees and energy drinks have seen the most growth on menus over the past two years, as hot coffee and tea beverages on menus decline, the market researcher reported in July.
What's more, consumers are increasingly heading to a chain simply to get an iced coffee or soda. Last year, the primary driver for beverage sales was ""getting a pick-me-up,"" as 22% said that was their most common reason for going, up from 20% in 2023, the data found. Meanwhile, 20% said they bought a beverage to ""wash down food."" The two occasions for a purchase switched places from the previous year.
""This shift suggests that consumers may be moving toward more beverage-specific occasions, where beverages are the main driver of the foodservice purchase rather than an add-on to go alongside food. This aligns with the influx of beverage-forward concepts in recent years,"" the report said.
Higher drink sales are key for major players as they seek to reverse slumps in a tough consumer environment. McDonald's U.S. restaurants saw same-store sales growth of 2.5% in its second fiscal quarter, reversing two straight quarters of domestic declines as it leaned into buzzy partnerships and value offerings. But executives cautioned low-income consumers remain challenged. While Starbucks also saw better than expected U.S. sales, they still fell 2% from the prior-year period.
Trying to capitalize on the desire for buzzy new drinks will bring its own challenges. Technomic forecasts beverage volume will grow 1% through 2029, but the group said it will likely revise that outlook lower. Customers are also more price sensitive, with 61% of consumers who said they noticed price hikes saying they order beverages less often.
What Gen Z wants
The success of many new beverage lines will hinge on Gen Z consumers, who have flocked to customized and sugary drinks.
Dunkin' saw its colorful and sweet Refreshers platform hit new record highs in the most recent quarter, with unit sales up more than 30% year-on-year. It will release its fall menu later this week and lean further into what Gen Z consumers are seeking.
The rollout will feature an expansion of pop star Sabrina Carpenter's Daydream Refresher lineup into Mango and Mixed Berry, along with a Cereal N' Milk Latte, featuring a blend of espresso and real cereal milk that delivers a ""nostalgic marshmallow cereal flavor.""
The curation of drinks is key for customers — and Gen Z consumers in particular, Dunkin' Chief Marketing Officer Jill Nelson told CNBC. It has to feel unique and special in this environment.
""On the product side, it's overwhelmingly about cold beverages, customization and bold flavor,"" Nelson said.
""And then on the promotion side ... when we think about Gen Z, this is a generation that grew up on sneaker drops and stories that disappear in 24 hours. So it's all about how do you create new news and interesting flavor combinations that you can't really recreate easily at home and feel like you're in the know when you go to the drive through and order them,"" she said, adding that the company prioritizes speed and accuracy as customers ask for more customization.
The competition will heat up next month as McDonald's enters the beverage category in a more meaningful way. On Sept. 2, McDonald's will launch an expanded market test in 500 restaurants across Wisconsin and Colorado of new drinks that include a ""Creamy Vanilla Cold Brew"" and ""Toasted Vanilla Frappe.""
In addition, the fast food giant will roll out ""dirty sodas"" and Strawberry Watermelon Refreshers, aimed at Gen Z consumers. McDonald's created the lineup with learnings from its now-shuttered CosMc's concept, which leaned heavily into customized drinks.
""We're seeing real momentum in beverages, with more people – especially our Gen Z fans – turning to cold, flavorful drinks as a go-to treat,"" said McDonald's USA Chief Customer Experience and Marketing Officer Alyssa Buetikofer in a release.
On McDonald's most recent earnings call, CEO Chris Kempczinski said beverages present a ""big opportunity"" for the brand.
""It's growing and it's more profitable than food. So, there's a lot of things to like, which is why us as well as, I think, a few of our competitors are also excited about this,"" Kempczinski told analysts. He added that while there are value offerings in the beverage space, you can get a lot of ""full margin products"" that franchisees would not have to discount.
The protein play
The new beverage options go beyond the sweet and bold. Chains also aim to win consumers by tapping into health trends.
As Starbucks continues its ""Back to Starbucks"" turnaround plans under CEO Brian Niccol, it is making more changes to the menu, including a late fourth-quarter launch of protein cold foam. On the company's recent earnings call with analysts, Niccol said the item ""taps into what has become one of our most popular modifiers, cold foam, which grew 23% year over year.""
""Protein Cold Foam with no added sugar is an easy way to add 15 grams of protein to virtually any cold beverage. And customers can also add the flavor of their choice,"" he said.
The coffee giant said it's seeing increases in satisfaction among younger consumers. Niccol told analysts customer value perceptions were near two-year highs in its most recent quarter, driven by gains among Gen Z and millennials, who make up over half of its customer base.
It's betting that innovation, coupled with better customer service under its new ""Green Apron Service"" strategy, will help to boost business.
Coffee chain Dutch Bros has leaned into some of those beverage trends to drive strong growth. The chain has been a standout stock performer — up over 22% year-to-date — and saw its same-store sales increase more than 6% in the most recent quarter.
CEO Christine Barone said protein milk that launched in 2024 has boosted business. But more broadly, unique and surprising toppings and offerings are a way to engage in a tough competitive landscape, she added.
""I think the key with innovation is to really understand when something might be ready to pop, or something might be of high interest, and then be able to move really fast to execute on it well,"" Barone told CNBC.

A large number of Generation Z — born between 1997 and 2012 — entered the workforce during the Covid-19 pandemic and were forced to tune in remotely. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy even declared a loneliness epidemic in the U.S. in 2023, saying it was especially affecting young people.
Some Gen Z workers are even returning to the office in a bid to expand their network. One recent Freeman survey of nearly 2,000 U.S. adults in professional jobs found that 91% of Gen Z said it would be nice to have a balance of virtual and in-person events to connect with others at their company and in their industry.
""In general, young people seek the social atmosphere because many of them just graduated college or are a few years out and are looking for similar social conveniences,"" Dan Schawbel, managing partner at Workplace Intelligence, explained.
Some employers are catching on and trying to fill this gap. Canary Wharf, London's privately owned financial district, which houses companies like JPMorgan, Barclays, and Morgan Stanley, launched the Wharf Connect networking program in 2024 for professionals in the first 10 years of their career.
Part of the area's return-to-office drive, Wharf Connect is accessible via an app and offers free events from LinkedIn workshops to pub quizzes. The initiative gets an average of 36 attendees per event and has seen 1,500 RSVPs since its inception last year.
""Part of the return-to-office push is that young people, especially, yearn for those connections, and relative to older generations, they are much more isolated and lonely, so return to office at least partially allows them to meet their coworkers,"" Schawbel said.
Last week, I took a trip to Canary Wharf to attend a Xiao Long Bao (dumpling) masterclass at Taiwanese restaurant Din Tai Fung — an event organized by Wharf Connect. Walking into a dining room nestled at the back of the restaurant where the workshop was taking place, I was stunned to see how busy it was with over 50 young professionals in attendance and chattering away.
The event featured a hands-on dumpling-making session with the chef, accompanied by complimentary food and drinks.
CNBC Make It spoke with three Gen Z attendees who shared how structured networking events are helping them find community.
Filling a social gap
Twenty-five-year-old Vivek Haria, a senior tax advisor at a financial services firm, has attended 10 Wharf Connect events.
Before starting his job in the Canary Wharf area, he was already seeking out social events or communities that would allow him to socialize and mingle outside of the workplace, but they left much to be desired.
""In fact, there were hardly any, and the ones I went to were pretty much a bit crap. Then I moved here, and this was the last place that I expected these kinds of events. It's definitely filled that gap. I've made some really good friends that I meet up with on weekends as well,"" Haria said.
For Sinny Wei, a 27-year-old human resources professional, moving from New Zealand to London meant she didn't have an established network or community in the U.K.
""For me, personally, it is difficult to make friends, because I've moved over here as well, so you've really got to put yourself out there a lot. I really do like it [Wharf Connect] for that as well,"" she said.
Wei said it's a good way to socialize informally, with free tickets, food and drinks being a great draw to the events.
""I've only been to two events, so maybe if you ask me after three events, I'll have made some friends by then,"" she said.
Haria noted that, although he returned to the office, many of his colleagues weren't physically at the workplace. The Wharf Connect events makes going to the office worthwhile, because he has something to look forward to in the evenings, he noted.
""So I go into the office as many times a week as I can…working from home after Covid has been a bit s--- like I'll go into the office three or four times a week and most of my team won't be in,"" Haria said.
In fact, a 2023 survey by employee background screening company Checkr, which polled 3,000 U.S. workers, found that 68% of managers were keen to continue remote and hybrid work in 2024, while only 48% of employees felt the same way.
Senior professionals have less motivation to be in the office, according to Schawbel. With more established social lives, less of a need for mentorship, and better home office setups, older professionals are less drawn to the in-person workplace. This is creating a social void for younger workers.
In-person events are trendy now
Organized in-person events, from professional networking to speed dating, are in vogue right now, and they are very appealing for Gen Z — some of whom may have underdeveloped social skills.
""Covid, plus over-reliance on technology equals socially awkward,"" Schawbel said. ""I'm not saying everyone is socially awkward. I'm just saying it's a recipe to create socially awkward individuals.""
Activity-focused events enable young people to socialize in a structured environment, rather than forcing them to spark up conversations at random.
Dating giant Hinge is even funding free activity-based social events for young people in London, Los Angeles, and New York to make friends. Another example is social app Time Left, which arranges weekly dinners for strangers to meet up, with over 80,000 strangers brought together in 60 countries each month.
Morayo Adesina, a 25-year-old equity research bank analyst, said that London changed after the Covid-19 pandemic, with many restaurants and bars not staying open as late — making it hard to get out of the house spontaneously.
""Speed dating has definitely become very popular amongst my friends. I just think in general, there's been, a real push to have different kinds of events,"" she said.
Wharf Connect has been an opportunity for Adesina to meet ""a lot of cool people"" and try new things. ""The events that they put on are quite fun, like it's not every day that I get to go to Din Tai Fung to do dumpling making or sushi making.""
Schawbel said that for many years, people have over-relied on technology to form connections, such as on dating apps or social media, but the abundance of options has created a sense of overwhelm. The rise of in-person events and the demand for them is a rejection of online culture, he added.
""They're resisting this digital age, because the digital age has become very cluttered and unreliable, therefore, they're yearning to connect in person more,"" Schawbel said.",d3aea722824840afc6c472b9c31d0d73,trafilatura,6644,0
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/solana-millionaire-maker-093000601.html,44c8eb2f6ac9aee940416a32c5411e2e,Is Solana a Millionaire - Maker ? ,Is Solana a Millionaire - Maker ? ,2025-08-19 18:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), the native cryptocurrency of the Solana blockchain, turned a lot of its early investors into millionaires. It was officially launched in 2020, but it previously sold some of its tokens at just $0.04 in a seed sale in 2018. Solana now trades at about $185, so a $1,000 investment in that seed sale would be worth almost $5 million today.
However, Solana trades more than 35% below its all-time high from this January. Let's see why this cryptocurrency initially rallied, why it pulled back, and whether it can churn a fresh $1,000 investment into $1 million again during the next few years.
Why did Solana's price skyrocket?
Unlike Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which is mined with the energy-intensive proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Solana uses the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism to validate its transactions. Therefore, Solana's tokens can only be staked (locked up for interest-like rewards) instead of mined.
So, while Bitcoin is a deflationary token with a set maximum supply, Solana is an inflationary one with no maximum supply. That makes Solana, which has a circulating supply of nearly 540 million tokens, difficult to value by its scarcity. Instead, it's mainly valued by the growth of its developer ecosystem.
As a PoS blockchain, Solana supports smart contracts, which are used to create decentralized apps (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other tokenized assets. Its Layer-1 (L1) blockchain, which has a real-world top speed of about 4,000 transactions per second (TPS), is much faster than other L1 PoS blockchains, such as Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Cardano(CRYPTO: ADA), which have comparable maximum speeds of about 15 and 250 TPS, respectively.
Solana achieves those higher speeds by integrating its own proof-of-history (PoH) validation mechanism (which timestamps transactions before they're validated) into its PoS blockchain. Those higher speeds drew in more developers and investors who expected it to disrupt Ethereum and other developer-oriented PoS blockchains.
That enthusiasm, along with expectations for lower interest rates and more relaxed regulations for cryptocurrencies, drove Solana's price to its record high earlier this year. Solana's expansion of its own ecosystem with its digital payments platform Solana Pay, support for stablecoins, and the launch of its own Android phone fanned those flames.
Why did Solana's price pull back?
Solana has some obvious strengths, but it also has three glaring weaknesses. First, its L1 blockchain often struggles with network congestion, outages, and security issues. Those problems could outweigh the advantages of its faster transactions.
Second, Solana isn't natively cross-compatible with other blockchains, like Ethereum, and its main developer languages (Rust and C) have a steeper learning curve than Ethereum's Solidity. That's why Solana still attracts a much smaller pool of developers than Ethereum.
Lastly, its competitors are using more Layer-2 (L2) solutions, which bundle together multiple transactions and process them off-chain at higher speeds to ease the congestion on their L1 blockchains. For example, Ethereum's L2s ""rollups"" can achieve real-world speeds of up to 4,000 TPS, while Cardano's L2 ""hydra heads"" can each achieve real-world speeds of up to 1,000 TPS. Those solutions could lure more developers away from Solana's speedy but volatile network.
Could it generate more millionaire-making gains?
Solana needs to address those issues, but a few major catalysts could be on the horizon. First, new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for Solana could stabilize its price while drawing in more retail and institutional investors. The REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF(NYSEMKT: SSK) already started trading in the U.S. last month as the first Solana ETF. Instead of being directly approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that ETF was launched after the SEC simply didn't object to its filing.
Several filings for Solana ETFs from bigger firms -- including VanEck, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton -- are still being reviewed by the SEC, but they could be launched in the near future. As interest rates decline, more investors should shift back toward cryptocurrencies and other riskier investments. Solana's high staking yield of 7% to 8% could also attract more yield-seeking investors than Ethereum, which has a staking yield of 3% to 4%.
Solana's expansion of its ecosystem with more digital payment partners, which already include Visa(NYSE: V) and Shopify(NASDAQ: SHOP), could attract more developers. Its future network upgrades should also reduce its congestion issues and fortify its security features.
But for a $1,000 investment to grow into $1 million, its price would need to skyrocket 1,000-fold to $185,000 and boost its market cap from about $100 billion to $100 trillion. That would make it more valuable than gold, which has a market cap of $22.8 trillion; Bitcoin, which is worth $2.3 trillion; and Ethereum, which is valued at $530 billion. That doesn't seem like a realistic goal. So, while Solana might stabilize and rise in the future, it probably won't come close to replicating its previous millionaire-making gains.

The trend reaffirms the phenomenon of so-called ""coolcations"" — a portmanteau of ""cool"" and ""vacation,"" which refers to tourists seeking cooler climes instead of a hot, peak-summer destination.
Record-breaking heat has swept across Europe in recent days, pushing temperatures in some areas well above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and fueling regional wildfires.
Jenny Southan, CEO of travel trend forecasting agency Globetrender, described the summer of 2025 as ""a turning point for European tourism, underscoring that no destination is truly immune to climate volatility.""
Extreme heat is made much more likely by the climate crisis, the chief driver of which is the burning of fossil fuels.
Heatwaves and wildfires across popular vacation destinations in Spain, Portugal and Greece have taken their toll on local infrastructure in recent weeks, triggering mass evacuations and shuttering beaches.
Alarmingly high temperatures have also been recorded in Nordic countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland, posing a direct challenge to the notion that northern Europe ""offers guaranteed relief"" in peak summer, Southan told CNBC by email.
""This double blow has accelerated a behavioural shift already in motion: travellers are avoiding the most intense heat periods, favouring cooler coastal or alpine locations, moving trips to spring and autumn, and experimenting with higher-latitude destinations from the Baltics to the Scottish Highlands,"" Southan said.
Off-the-beaten track
Data published last month by the European Travel Commission (ETC) showed that travel remains a top priority for Europeans despite economic uncertainty.
The ETC found that heightened concern about overcrowding had prompted tourists to spend their 2025 summer vacations in less popular or off-the-beaten track destinations, while interest in traditional hotspots has declined.
""Our latest data shows that, even amid shifting economic and social realities, Europeans are not willing to compromise on travel, and they increasingly prefer quieter destinations and trips outside peak seasons,"" ETC President Miguel Sanz said in a statement.
Global travel network Virtuoso said in its latest advisor survey that 79% of respondents agreed extreme weather events impacted travel planning, while 55% reported that their clients were choosing to travel at off peak times due to the climate crisis.
Nicholas Smith, holidays digital director at Thomas Cook and the eSky Group online travel agency, said there had been a surge in alternative seasonal choices this year.
""One of the fastest-rising trends among British travellers is the 'coolcation' - swapping peak heat for more temperate destinations,"" Smith told CNBC by email.
European destinations such as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and increasingly Poland were among those attracting tourists who want active vacations, comfortable weather ""and experiences with real depth,"" Smith said.
Another one of the winners to emerge from the coolcations trend has been the small central European country of Slovenia, which has received growing interest in higher altitude, cooler destinations.
""Due to increasingly high summer temperatures and the rising demand for quality leisure time in nature, visitors are increasingly choosing destinations at higher elevations, which offer diverse experiences and active opportunities throughout the year. And also lakes and rivers are favorable destinations,"" a spokesperson for the Slovenian Tourist Board told CNBC by email.
Tourism challenges
While a shift in travel preferences may help to alleviate overtourism in Europe's traditional hotspots, the coolcations trend could have significant economic consequences.
Southern European countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are all heavily reliant on tourism, with the latest available data showing the sector accounted for 18%, 12.3% and 11.9% of gross domestic product, respectively.
Linda Jonczyk, a spokesperson for TUI, Europe's largest tour operator, said the company was seeing growing interest in Nordic destinations such as Iceland, Norway and Sweden due to the coolcations trend. Yet, bookings were still relatively low compared to other traditional summer hotspots.
""Classic sun and beach destinations around the Mediterranean continue to be high in demand – Spain, Greece and Turkey are and remain the undisputed favourites,"" Jonczyk told CNBC by email.
For its part, Portugal's national tourism authority said summer demand in key regions remains robust. A spokesperson for Turismo de Portugal said that while some regions in the north and center were managing localized wildfires, the vast majority of the country was unaffected.
""Portugal's tourism infrastructure is highly prepared to respond to such challenges, with contingency measures in place to ensure minimal disruption,"" Turismo de Portugal told CNBC by email.
""Airports and ports across the country are operating at full capacity, and the tourism sector remains strong — with summer arrivals in key regions matching or surpassing last year's numbers,"" they added.
A 'climate risk zone'
Globetrender's Southan said she expects the coolcations trend to solidify over the coming years.
She predicted that by the late 2020s, the Mediterranean's peak travel season could shift to May-June and September-October, with July-August ""becoming a 'climate risk zone' for mass tourism.""
""Southern destinations will increasingly invest in climate-resilient infrastructure – shaded public spaces, heat-adaptive hotels, wildfire prevention corridors – while promoting alternative experiences beyond the midday sun,"" Southan said.
""Meanwhile, northern Europe, once a niche summer escape, may need to manage its own version of 'overtourism' as hotter summers drive demand. For the travel industry, adapting to this new normal is no longer optional – it's the difference between thriving in a changing climate and being left behind.""",85ae7b49a2f53883cc89ae45ad7feb93,trafilatura,6106,0

Today’s business leaders must navigate a tax environment that’s growing steadily more complex, with new legislation, emerging technologies and macroeconomic uncertainty all impacting how businesses must think of their tax processes and standing as they make critical decisions regarding their future strategies.
When it comes to thinking through business decisions that might have a tax impact, it’s crucial for executives and major stakeholders across the company to reach common ground regarding both the goals and objectives of such initiatives, as well as their potential risk — and that’s where the finance chief’s relationship with tax is playing a starring role, according to Monika Loving, specialized tax services managing principal at BDO, a public accounting, tax and advisory firm.
The CFO is the “driver that helps to fuel those other relationships” between tax and other business functions, Loving said in an interview. Citing data from a recent survey of 300 senior tax leaders by BDO, in most organizations, the CFO “acts as that chief collaborator” when it comes to reaching that essential common ground, she said.
Ninety-two percent of tax leaders said CFOs bring them to the table for “important business strategy conversations,” according to the survey. Meanwhile, 90% said CFOs help to “facilitate cross-collaboration between tax and other functions,” BDO’s Tax Strategist Survey found.
Bringing tax to the strategic table
While the tax department typically serves under the office of the CFO, necessitating a close relationship, “more tax leaders have firmly established themselves at the decision-making table than ever before,” BDO said in a press release on its survey finds. Moreover, “the level at which they're really, on a day-to-day basis, interacting on key business decisions, has absolutely increased,” Loving said of the relationship between CFOs and the leaders of their tax teams.
The year 2020 was a pivotal one for tax’s involvement with the strategic direction of their organizations, she said, with tax “helping with resilience or cash planning opportunities coming out of the pandemic” — and that trend of involvement has only increased in the years since that time.
As companies seek to navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment — including ongoing shifts regarding tariff policies and inflation as well as changes to tax legislation brought about by the enactment of the Trump administration’s recent spending bill — more and more businesses are turning to their tax departments to inform their future strategies, BDO’s survey found.
Sixty-three percent of survey respondents said they were “very involved” in strategic discussions surrounding business resilience strategy, which includes areas such as preserving revenue or prepping for economic volatility, according to the survey. Meanwhile, 60% said they were very involved in strategic transactions such as mergers and acquisitions or restructuring, and 58% said the same of organizational risk management discussions.
Tax departments have “learned to be ready” when it comes to modeling out potential tax changes, Loving said. The survey data, collected in May ahead of the passing of the spending and tax bill in July, shows respondents were anticipating coming tax legislation, though the details of what that entailed weren’t fully formed. However, leaders took steps to “position the tax department in a space where they can be advisors to the business as what they might anticipate coming out of those changes,” she said.
A strong relationship between tax leaders and CFOs is key to being able to weather such legislative shifts effectively. While it’s the job of tax leaders to understand how such changes will impact their organization’s tax position, afterwards, it’s “the role of the tax department to advise the CFO on what they found from that analysis, and the CFO from there would make a strategic business decision,” Loving said.
Making space for tech
Positioning tax as a strategic leader can help businesses more effectively plan out future initiatives such as integrating new technologies or tools, with more tax leaders spending time assessing the role of technology inside their organizations. Company leaders today are mulling the pros and cons of artificial intelligence, whether for their own operations or integration into customer-facing products, and “that's often an area that you see tax providing input and advice as to what that means from an opportunity or a risk mitigation standpoint,” Loving said.
Outdated technology remains a key concern for tax leaders, with 20% of tax professionals pointing to technology challenges or outdated tax technology as a top risk for the next 12 months, BDO’s survey found.
The CFO also has a critical role to play in helping to ensure not only that the tax department has the technology they need, but in helping to ensure the clarity of the data changing hands between the two areas. There can be “an inherent risk in that handoff on the data from the finance side of the house to the tax side,” so it’s important to ensure “everyone is speaking the same language with that data, and the accuracy of that data from the financial systems into the tax systems is flowing properly,” she said.
Emerging technologies like AI can also help to further strengthen the relationship between the tax department and the CFO, Loving said.
There are numerous ways tax can help to bring value to the business’ operations, but in order to demonstrate to the CFO — who is generally, the person responsible for giving the go ahead on those strategies — tax professionals “need to arm the CFO with data that will inform that there's ROI for [that] particular strategy,” she said. Using AI to “more nimbly and more quickly pull that data together in a succinct way” is one of the ways tax can tap the technology to add that value, she said.",f0fc986d81bd4f8153cb5027c30ff20d,trafilatura,6026,0

The cryptocurrency market, once dismissed as a risky gamble, is now viewed as a legitimate hedge in a world drowning in debt and shaky fiat. Plus, with Washington finally offering regulatory clarity, digital assets are emerging as a new pillar in the financial order, attracting institutional giants.
When the financial world tilts, investors can bet Cathie Wood is nearby. The Ark Invest chief built her reputation by betting on disruptive innovations before the crowd caught on. Now, Wood is steering hard into crypto, having recently snapped up more than 2.5 million shares of Bullish (BLSH) valued north of $170 million, right out of its blockbuster initial public offering (IPO).
Backed by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Bullish skyrocketed from $37 to $118 in its opening hours, echoing global financial tech company and stablecoin market leader Circle’s (CRCL) white-hot market debut earlier this summer. But BLSH stock’s fireworks didn’t last forever — after that explosive debut, shares have already cooled off, sliding 45% from its highs.
Sure, stalls and dips are common after the post-IPO sugar rush. But is this just a healthy reset, or a red flag for investors?
About Bullish Stock
Based in the Cayman Islands, Bullish is a crypto exchange reshaping digital finance. Launched with big-name backers, it blends trading power with media influence after scooping up CoinDesk in 2023. That move gave Bullish both the marketplace and the megaphone, positioning it as a force at the intersection of crypto assets and information.
Bullish’s Wall Street debut was pure spectacle. On Aug. 13, BLSH stock opened at around $90, already up 143% from $37. By midday, BLSH stock spiked to $118, a staggering 219% intraday jump. The frenzy helped Bullish raise $1.1 billion, sending its market capitalization soaring toward $10.2 billion.
But the rush didn’t last. By Aug. 15, BLSH stock closed at $69.54, down 6.8% on the day with over 9.1 million shares traded. Still, even with that pullback, BLSH remains up nearly 88% from its IPO price. The chart tells the story — an opening spike followed by steady cooling, typical of high-volatility debuts. Bullish may have stumbled from its peak, but it’s still proving that investor hunger for crypto platforms is very real.
Cathie Wood is more than just dipping a toe in. ARK Invest now holds over 2 million shares of Bullish after its fiery IPO debut, spreading the bet across three flagship exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of Aug. 18, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) holds nearly 1.18 million shares, the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) has 479,286 shares, and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) rounds it out with 261,876 shares.
This kind of distribution demonstrates Wood’s confidence in Bullish’s role at the intersection of crypto, fintech, and digital markets. By planting the stock in three different funds, she is signaling that this is not just a short-term gamble.
Bullish’s Digital Assets Sales Surges
Bullish’s books read like a reminder of how wild the crypto ride can be. In its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission F-1 filing dated July 18, Bullish revealed that it went from reporting $104.8 million in net profit during the first quarter of 2024 to bleeding a $348.6 million net loss in Q1 2025. Still, it closed out fiscal 2024 with $79.6 million in net income — proof that when markets swing in its favor, it knows how to cash in.
What really turns heads is its digital asset sales. From $72.9 billion in 2022 to a staggering $250.2 billion in 2024, Bullish has been scaling fast. The first quarter of 2025 alone delivered $80.2 billion in sales — almost flat compared to last year’s $80.4 billion, but still massive.
Meanwhile, as of March 31, its balance sheet showed $28.3 million in cash, $144 million in stablecoins, $1.73 billion worth of Bitcoin, $22 million in ETH, and $33 million spread across other cryptos.
What Do Analysts Expect for Bullish Stock?
Analyst chatter may be thin, but the tone is largely upbeat. Unlike retail-heavy exchanges, Bullish runs as an institutional-grade platform, focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum trading. That makes it less exposed to mood swings and more in step with long-term demand from serious money.
The company’s backers speak volumes, too. While Peter Thiel and Cathie Wood are already on board, BlackRock (BLK) intends to scoop up $200 million worth of BLSH stock. That kind of early endorsement builds credibility, and shapes market confidence.
Meanwhile, Nickel Digital Asset Management's Michael Hall believes Bullish’s model could deliver steadier, recurring revenue compared to retail-driven rivals. In a market built on speculation and volatility, that kind of stability is a rare play.
Final Thoughts on Bullish Stock
Crypto keeps getting harder to ignore. With decentralized finance on the rise and regulators showing more clarity, digital assets are moving from the sidelines to the main stage. Bullish sets itself apart with a balance sheet stacked with BTC and stablecoins, while primarily catering to institutions over retail. That focus gives it a steadier footing as crypto adoption expands.
Plus, Cathie Wood’s decision to scoop up BLSH stock right after its IPO has turned plenty of heads. Wood is known for spotting winners early, and many investors trust her conviction.
Still, buying before the lockup period ends is a risky move — early IPO investors often cash out fast. The question now is whether Bullish can hold its ground and justify that faith.

Senior living has long been a somewhat under-the-radar real estate play, with a somewhat unappealing reputation. But it's on the edge of a boom — a baby boom, to be exact.
More than 4 million boomers will hit 80 in the next five years, and occupancy at both active adult and assisted living communities is already rising fast. This comes as annual inventory growth in senior housing just dropped below 1%, the first time that's happened since the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care began tracking the metric in 2006.
Ventas, a senior living real estate investment trust with a $31 billion market cap, is betting big on what CEO Deb Cafaro calls the longevity economy.
""We're buying billions of dollars a year in senior living, and we're seeing returns in the sevens going in, with low to mid-teens, unlevered IRRs [internal rates of return], so there's significant growth in assets, and we're buying below replacement costs,"" said Cafaro, who has been at the helm of the company for over 25 years. ""I've never seen that combination of investment characteristics in my long career in real estate, and so we're fully taking advantage of all of that.""
Cafaro said growth in the senior living demand pool is expected to be 28% over the next five years. She called the demand tailwinds ""incredibly strong and durable.""
""Think about 2000 in the real estate investment trust business — office was over 20% of the overall REIT pie, and health care was 2%. Now when you look at the pie, office is 5%, and what is it now? It's health care, senior living. It's data centers. It's cell towers. Why? Because that's where the demand is,"" she said.
Cafaro said Ventas, which purchases properties but doesn't develop them, benefits from the deep lack of supply in the senior living sector, from active adult to assisted living to memory care facilities.
""As an owner with one of the largest footprints of senior housing, of existing stock in the U.S., we're benefited by the higher cost of development, because we have an installed base and we're acquiring assets actually at below replacement cost, and, right now, that's part of our strategy,"" Cafaro said. ""We feel really good about our base of 850 senior living communities, where occupancies are increasing. And we also feel good about the multibillions of dollars we're investing every year in existing assets.""
Why no supply?
Aegis Living is a developer and operator of senior living facilities in Washington, California and Nevada. The massive supply-demand imbalance weighs heavily on its founder and CEO, Dwayne Clark.
""There's a problem brewing, and the only metaphor I can think of, it's like putting a party balloon on the end of a fire hose and watching it increase with great velocity. Velocity without being able to do anything until it pops,"" Clark said.
According to NIC data, there will be just about 4,000 new senior living units developed this year and next year, but demand growth would necessitate 100,000 new beds each year through 2040.
""It's the lowest amount of units we've seen since 2009, the lowest. And, again, I've done this for 40 years. I've never seen such a lack of construction starts,"" Clark said.
Average rents at Aegis are around $12,000 a month, but that includes utilities, transportation, food, activities and differing levels of care. Clark said most residents are covering costs in part by using the proceeds from the sale of their homes, which have appreciated dramatically in the past five years.
Higher interest rates, he said, are the primary roadblock to new development.
""We have six buildings waiting to get refinanced. We never, in our 28-year history, have had more than two. We've got six, and soon to be seven, and it's all on floating debt. So that is a catastrophic problem for the industry. And again, we're not catching up with the demand,"" he said.
Investor interest
Harrison Street is an alternative real estate investment management firm with $55 billion in assets under management. Its U.S. Core Senior Housing strategy posted a more than 30% increase in same-location net operating income last year, according to a company spokesperson. Harris Street has maintained that with new supply constrained and demand durable, this could be the strongest entry point for alternative real estate investment in its 20-year history.
""Frankly, over the course of the past 20 years, I can't identify another period where we were more excited about the current setup within the sector,"" said Mike Gordon, global CIO of Harrison Street, which invests in the independent and assisted living segments, as well as memory care.
Gordon said severe uncertainty in the first years of the pandemic — when there were horror stories of infections and fatalities in senior living facilities — has largely been resolved. He said now more seniors are living in these communities than there were pre-Covid.
Harrison Street acquired about 20 senior communities during 2020-2021, at the start of the pandemic, when there was virtually no liquidity in the sector. Over the past few years, growing demand and tight supply have resulted in annual average rent increase of nearly 5% across the sector and high single digits in certain markets, according to Harrison Street.
Despite high interest rates overall, Gordon said private investors have new interest in the sector, thanks to that strong rent growth.
""What we're seeing right now is a real quick return of liquidity into the sector,"" Gordon said.",5683b5fa2dc26d60fa18d10a150ae75b,trafilatura,5858,0

The ambitions that Lutnick confirmed in a televised interview with CNBC came the day after various news outlets reported on the negotiations between the Trump administration and Intel. The investment would be made by converting federal government grants previously pledged under President Joe Biden's administration into a bushel of Intel stock that would turn the U.S. government into one of the company's largest shareholders.
“We think America should get the benefit of the bargain,” Lutnick told CNBC as he explained why President Donald Trump is pushing for the deal. “It's obvious that it's the right move to make.”
Intel declined to comment on the negotiations with the Trump administration.
The notion of the U.S. government holding a huge stake in Intel would have seemed inconceivable back in the company's heyday when its processors were powering a personal computer boom that began in the mid-1970s. But Intel has been mired in tough times after missing mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut.
Intel has fall even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for two of its once-smaller rivals, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. The Trump administration is hitching a ride on their success by imposing a 15% commission on their sales of their chip sales in China in exchange for their export licenses. Those fees are expected to translate into billions of dollars in additional government revenue.
The U.S. government's negotiations to become a major Intel shareholder are coming on a heels of a $2 billion investment Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed late Monday that it plans to make in the Santa Clara, California, company. Softbank is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel at $23 per share — a slight discount from the stock's price when its investment was announced.
Intel's shares surged nearly 7% to close at $25.31 on the news of Softbank's big bet on Intel, coupled with Trump's designs on the company.
SoftBank invests in an array of companies that it sees as holding long-term potential. It has been stepping up investments in the United States since Trump returned to the White House. In February, its chairman Masayoshi Son joined Trump, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle in announcing a major investment of up to $500 billion in a project to develop artificial intelligence called Stargate.
“Semiconductors are the foundation of every industry, Son said in a statement. ”This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role.”
Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world since he returned to the White House earlier this year for his second term in office. “We want Intel to be successful in America,” Lutnick said during his CNBC interview.
Boosting domestic production of computer chips also ranked high on the Biden administration's agenda, which resulted in the 2022 passage of the CHIPS and Science Act.
Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the program, but it hasn't been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the CHIPS program. The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program — money that Lutnick derided as a “giveaway” that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it's turned into Intel stock, which he said would be in the form of non-voting shares so the government wouldn't be able to use the stake to sway how the company is managed.
But Intel's ongoing struggles also means the U.S. government is taking on a risky investment. The company is in the midst of its latest turnaround attempt under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who was hired in March to shake things up. Tan’s turnaround effort so far has been focused on a cost-cutting spree that is gutting the company’s workforce and further delaying construction on a chip plant in Ohio that has been in the works since 2022.
Intel’s market value is hovering around $110 billion, only a slight uptick from where it was when Tan arrived and leaving it more than 60% below its peak reached about a quarter-century ago during the early phase of the internet boom.
In another strange twist to the new alliance, President Donald Trump had demanded that Tan resign in an August 7 post spurred by concerns about investments that Tan had made in China chipmakers while he was working as a venture capitalist.
But Trump backed off after the Malyasia-born Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an “amazing story.” That truce apparently sparked the negotiations that may culminate in the U.S. government owning a chunk of Intel.
Although rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",1c04f735a096e231e95b98bf3063a959,trafilatura,5821,0

In fact, the world's five most valuable companies by market cap, worth more than $2 trillion each, are arguably at the forefront of AI innovation.
AI chipmaker Nvidia recently became the first company to surpass a $4 trillion market cap, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard for AI workloads, propelling its valuation to $4.5 trillion. Microsoft's growing suite of cloud-based AI tools has fueled its growth spurt, clocking in at $3.9 trillion. Apple has a captive audience of more than 1 billion iPhones amid an Apple Intelligence upgrade, driving its value to $3.4 trillion. Rounding out the top five are cloud and AI leaders Alphabet and Amazon, sporting market caps of $2.5 trillion and $2.4 trillion, respectively, as of this writing.
With a current market cap of roughly $1.3 billion, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), often referred to as TSMC, is, I predict, on the fast track to become a member of the $2 trillion club by 2028. The adoption of AI continues to gain momentum, driving up demand for its most advanced chips in the process. As the world's largest and most renowned semiconductor foundry, TSMC seems ordained to join this elite collection of businesses.
A chip off the old block
After years of working in the shadows, TMSC has recently found itself in the limelight. The company describes itself as the ""world's first dedicated semiconductor foundry,"" occupying a pivotal position in a tech world that increasingly relies on lightning-fast chips for AI and high-performance computing (HPC). And make no mistake, no chipmaker is held in as high a regard as TSMC. The company includes Nvidia, Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM), Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD), and Apple among its biggest customers.
The tech landscape has shifted since the dawn of AI. TSMC once depended on smartphone chips for the lion's share of its revenue, but HPC, including the specialized processors used for AI, has become the company's biggest breadwinner, recently accounting for 60% of sales.
TSMC's growth is accelerating. Revenue grew 44% year over year to $30 billion in U.S. dollars (USD) in the second quarter, while earnings per American depositary receipt of $2.47 soared 67%. The company is expecting this surging growth to continue. Management's forecast is calling for third-quarter revenue of $32.4 billion in USD at the midpoint of its guidance, representing growth of about 38%.
The path to $2 trillion
TSMC sits in an enviable position as the world pivots to AI. Since the biggest names in technology use its industry-leading processors, it stands to benefit from the accelerating adoption of generative AI -- which has spread like wildfire over the past few years. Furthermore, TSMC's accelerating revenue provides evidence that it's well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity and will soon be catapulted into the company of multi-trillionaires.
According to Wall Street, TSMC is on track to generate revenue of roughly $122 billion in 2025, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 10.4. Assuming its P/S remains constant, TSM would have to generate revenue of $192 billion annually to support a $2 trillion market cap.
Even more intriguing is that Wall Street is forecasting revenue growth of 16% and 19% in 2026 and 2027, respectively -- and TSMC has consistently outpaced expections. If the company clears those low-double-digit hurdles, it would probably achieve a $2 trillion market cap sometime in early 2029. However, given the company's history of outperformance -- and the accelerating opportunity -- I predict it will happen even sooner.
Estimates regarding the expanding adoption of AI vary wildly. One of the more conservative estimates posits that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually over the next decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Even the more conservative estimates have been climbing as new use cases for AI are uncovered.
Finally, at 28 times trailing-12-month earnings, TSMC is attractively valued, offering an economical way to invest in the once-in-a-generation opportunity afforded by AI.

If the Federal Reserve does lower rates as early as next month, stocks with long streaks of boosting payouts can deliver higher payouts at a time when fixed income options are going the other way.
You don't need a lot to hop on the dividend train. Even putting $500 to work in Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO) or Realty Income(NYSE: O) can pay off for long-term investors. Let's take a closer look at these two income generators that also have the potential to drum up capital appreciation.
1. Coca-Cola
There's no need to get you up to speed when it comes to investing in Coca-Cola. The king of pop has been in business for 135 years, and its reach spans 200 brands sold across more than 200 countries and territories. It's not just the namesake carbonated cola that put it on the map. Beyond the sparkling variety, Coca-Cola has hydration, coffee, tea, juice, and dairy products. The beverage stock owns 30 different brands topping at least $1 billion in annual sales apiece.
Today, 2.2 billion Coca-Cola-owned beverages will be served. Like its old slogan, Coca-Cola as an investment is the real thing.
Coca-Cola checks a lot of the boxes to quench the thirst of dividend investors. Let's lead with the payout itself. The current 2.9% yield is healthy, and the actual distributions are close to a lock to keep rising. Coca-Cola is a Dividend King, stretching its streak of annual hikes to 63 years in 2025.
There are some knocks for sugary soft drinks and consumption trends, but zoom out to look at the whole picture. Revenue growth has been positive in each of the last four years. It's been a flat start to 2025, but the fizz is coming. Analysts see revenue topping 5% over the final six months of the year.
The bottom line has been an even bigger star in Coca-Cola's run. The positive surprises aren't flashy, but they're consistent. Just check out Coca-Cola's last six financial updates.
Data source: Yahoo! Finance. EPS = earnings per share (adjusted).
Coca-Cola may not seem cheap at 22 times next year's profit target. It's a premium to the single-digit growth that investors should expect on both ends of the income statement in the next couple of years. However, I will argue that it's a cheap multiple for one of the world's top brands. Offering low-priced refreshment makes it a company that should fare well even in a slow economy. With a trailing net margin north of 25% and a long runway of annual dividend hikes to come, don't dismiss the pop star. It's time to get fizzy with it.
2. Realty Income
If Coca-Cola turns heads with its run of 63 straight years of payout boosts, Realty Income has delivered 111 quarters of hikes over the past three decades. Its current yield of 5.5% is also nearly double what the Coke folk are distributing. Realty Income also is one of the few companies announcing monthly disbursements, a handy move for folks leaning on the frequency of dividend checks.
Realty Income is a real estate investment trust (REIT). It manages a portfolio of more than 15,000 commercial real estate properties. This might seem like a tough spot to be in if the economy takes a tumble in the coming quarters, but its long streak of dividend increases shows how well it's been able to manage the volatility. Its largest industry concentrations are convenience stores, supermarkets, and dollar stores that fall into the non-discretionary basket of consumer purchasing habits. It estimates that 91% of its lease payments come from retail chains and service providers that are either recession-resilient or not challenged by the threats of e-commerce.
Its current annualized distributions of $3.228 per share are easily covered by the $4.24 to $4.28 in adjusted funds from operations per share that Realty Income is targeting for all of this year. Yielding a lot more than even the most generous of money market funds is compelling, but it's not a fair comparison. Before bouncing back in 2025, the REIT saw its share price decline slightly for three consecutive years. The monthly distributions in that time were not enough to cover the downticks. However, those down years combined with its long track record of payout boosts make this a good time to consider Realty Income with money market fund rates sliding over the past year.

(CSCO) delivered strong free cash flow, despite significantly higher capex spending in its fiscal year ending July 31. That could propel CSCO stock at least 14% higher over the next 12 months using its average FCF margins.
CSCO is at $66.50 in morning trading on Monday, Aug. 18. That's down from its price on Aug. 13 of $70.40 just before the release of its latest results.
But it could be worth $75.75 per share using its historical FCF margins and revenue forecasts. Moreover, the average analyst price target is close to this. This article will delve into these points and explore a strategy for playing short out-of-the-money (OTM) puts.
Strong Results for FY 2025
Cisco is one of the beneficiaries of the huge artificial intelligence (AI) spending boom. It provides networking equipment, cloud software, and security solutions used by data centers and companies involved in AI-related activities.
As a result, its Q4 revenue rose 8% year-over-year (Y/Y) to $14.3 billion, and its fiscal year (ending July 31) sales were up 5% to $56.7 billion.
However, its AI infrastructure division took in over $2 billion in orders in FY 25, higher than its goal of $1 billion. That included over $800 million in orders in Q4 alone.
This is a strong growth driver for the company going forward.
Moreover, Cisco reported that its operating cash flow was very strong and its free cash flow (FCF) - i.e., OCF less capex spending - was also high.
For example, in the latest fiscal Q4 ending July 31, the company generated $4.234 billion in OCF, representing 28.9% of its $14.67 billion Q4 revenue. That was +13.5% higher than last year, and the prior OCF margin was lower at 27.3%.
Moreover, even with +9.5% higher capex spending in Q4, its FCF margins improved as well. For example, Cisco generated $4.017 billion in FCF, which was 27.4% of revenue. That was higher than the 25.89% FCF margin last year. Moreover, it beat the $13.288 FCF for the year was just 23.4% of its full-year revenue of $56.7 billion.
This implies that Cisco's FCF margins will rise over the next year with higher sales.
Forecasting FCF
For example, analysts are now projecting about $60 billion in sales for the next fiscal year ending July 2026. That is also the upper end of management's guidance for FY 26.
As a result, if we assume the company can generate at least 25% FCF margins (higher than the 23.4% in FY 25, but lower than the 27.4% Q4 margin), its FCF could be:
$60b x 0.25 FCF margin= $15 billion FCF target
That would be an increase of 12.9% over last year's $13.288 billion in FCF. Moreover, it could push up the value of CSCO stock at least that amount.
Target Prices for CSCO Stock
Last year, the company paid out $12.4 billion in dividends and buybacks to shareholders. That represented 93.3% of its $13.3 billion in FCF.
As CSCO's market cap is $262.726 billion today, according to Yahoo! Finance, that means its historical FCF yield is about 5%:
So, using a similar 5.0% FCF yield and applying this to our forecast of $15 billion:
$15b FY 26 FCF / 0.05 = $300 billion market cap
In other words, if the market gives the stock a 5% FCF yield in the future, and if Cisco generates $15 billion in FCF, its market cap will rise 14.2% to $300 billion.
That means its stock price will be worth 14% more, or
$1.14 x $66.50 = $75.81 per share target price
This is about the same as the average of 26 analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance ($75.58 per share). Similarly, Barchart's mean survey price is $75.06, and Stock Analysis says 18 analysts have an average price target of $74.94.
Moreover, AnaChart.com, which tracks recent analyst recommendations, writes that 21 analysts have an average of $77.17 per share as their price targets.
The bottom line is that CSCO stock looks undervalued here. One way to play this, setting a lower buy-in price, is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in nearby expiry periods.
Shorting OTM Puts
For example, look at the Sept. 19 expiry period, one month away. It shows that the $64.00 strike price put option contract has a midpoint premium of 62 cents.
That represents an immediate short-put yield of about 1% (i.e., $0.62/$64.00 = 0.96875%) for a strike price that is about 3.5% below today's trading price.
The point is that an investor who does this play can set a potential lower buy-in point and get paid while waiting.
Moreover, even if CSCO falls to $64.00, the investor's breakeven point is $63.38 per share ($64-$0.62), which is 4.7% below today's price. So, the investor potentially gets to buy in at a significantly lower price using this play.
However, it could still result in an unrealized capital loss, if CSCO stays below the $63.38 breakeven. Investors should study the risks here. One way to do that is to research Barchart's Options Education Center and the Profit and Loss charts on any options contract.
The bottom line is that CSCO stock is cheap here, and OTM selling short OTM puts is one way to play short puts.

With just $1,000, you've got a tremendous number of choices.
For investors looking for a hands-off approach, a broad-market index fund may be the best option. But for those willing to take a little risk, buying high quality individual stocks and holding them for years is a great bet.
Two top stocks to buy now are DigitalOcean(NYSE: DOCN) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).
DigitalOcean: Simplifying cloud and AI
Big cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are built for big enterprises with vast budgets. On these mega-cloud platforms, there's every cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) product and service one could ever want -- but one hidden cost is complexity. That's not ideal for small businesses and developers.
DigitalOcean has carved out a niche in the cloud computing market by keeping things simple. The company's cloud platform is narrower than the big players in the industry, and its pricing is more transparent.
Recently, DigitalOcean has taken the same strategy and applied it to artificial intelligence. The Gradient AI platform, which DigitalOcean launched in July, combines the company's AI infrastructure offerings with high-value tools that allow customers to easily build and deploy AI agents.
DigitalOcean's AI push is already starting to show up in the company's results. Revenue grew by 14% year over year in the second quarter, and the company gained the most annual recurring revenue in nearly three years, thanks to a more than doubling of AI-related revenue.
The company's highest-spending customer cohort, which, on average spend $30,000 monthly on the platform, now accounts for nearly a quarter of total revenue. While DigitalOcean still caters to smaller customers, those bigger customers help make the company's revenue a bit more predictable.
DigitalOcean is profitable and cash-flow positive. The company is calling for its adjusted free-cash-flow margin to be as high as 19% of revenue for the full year. With a reasonable valuation of around 18 times that free-cash-flow guidance, DigitalOcean stock looks like a compelling long-term buy for growth investors.
TSMC: Overwhelmingly dominant
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing dominates the global foundry market, particularly for the most advanced nodes required for cutting-edge semiconductor chips. The company faces competition from Samsung and Intel, with the former recently winning a deal to manufacture future chips for Tesla and the latter betting on its upcoming Intel 14A process to shake up the industry.
While both represent real threats, TSMC's lead will be tough to overcome.
TSMC produced revenue of $30.1 billion in the second quarter, up an astonishing 44.4% year over year. Nearly one-quarter of the company's shipments now use TSMC's advanced 3-nanometer (nm) node, and three-quarters of shipments use 7nm or better manufacturing processes. Booming demand for AI accelerators, which benefit from the most advanced manufacturing nodes available, as well as complex advanced packaging techniques, is a key driver of TSMC's soaring revenue.
TSMC's profitability is also incredible. Gross margin was 58.6% in the second quarter, and the company managed a net profit margin of 42.7%. With its leading position in the industry and no viable alternative for companies like Nvidia, which need advanced manufacturing at scale, TSMC will continue to benefit from the AI boom.
There are some risks -- namely, TSMC being based in Taiwan. That exposes the company to the potential impacts of changes in U.S. tariff policy, as well as the looming threat of China taking military action. However, it's tough to find a better growth stock in the semiconductor industry than TSMC.

The U.S. and Ukrainian leaders were pictured looking jovial and smiling together — a far cry from the extraordinary shouting match and public humiliation inflicted on Zelenskyy during his last trip to the White House in February.
Monday's talks, which involved a raft of European leaders, appeared to make progress toward ending the protracted war between Russia and Ukraine, with Trump saying a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy would be arranged, followed by a trilateral meeting that he would join.
The most significant development result for Kyiv and Europe, however, was Trump's statement that security guarantees for Ukraine would be ""provided"" by European countries in ""coordination with the U.S.""
Describing that as a ""major step forward,"" Zelenskyy said later that the package of security guarantees for Ukraine — highly coveted by Kyiv's leadership and seen as a deterrent to future Russian aggression — will include a massive purchase of American weapons, with financing reportedly supported by Europe. The agreement would be ""formalized on paper within the next week to 10 days,"" he said.
What security guarantees?
As for what the security guarantees could include, the detail is still scant. Trump commented at a post-talks press conference that Europe would ""take a lot of the burden"" for these, but said the U.S. would help and would make it ""very secure.""
In any case, security guarantees likely mean that Europe, and the so-called ""Coalition of the Willing"" of countries offering to oversee a peace deal, is on the hook to fulfill what they've previously promised.
French President Emmanuel Macron hinted Tuesday that the ""first security guarantee we are working on — and it is the most important — is a strong Ukrainian army, composed of several hundred thousand men, well equipped, with defense systems and higher standards.""
""The second is to have reassurance forces, the British, the French, the Germans, the Turks, and others ready to carry out these operations — not on the front line, not in a provocative way, but reassurance operations in the air, at sea, and on land. The goal is to send a strategic signal: peace in Ukraine is also our concern,"" he told French broadcaster TF1-LCI, in comments translated by NBC News.
Jaroslava Barbieri, research fellow at Chatham House, told CNBC Tuesday that the overall mood from the talks on Monday was one of ""cautious optimism,"" but there are many unknowns.
""However, we have to say that the Kremlin's maximalist demands on Ukraine have not changed and so there's still a number of uncertainties about the security guarantees, the details, who is going to be doing what, if there are any troop deployments then where will they be stationed and for how long, which countries will be contributing?"" she asked.
Obstacles to peace
European leaders have voiced misgivings over the lack of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine before a peace deal is negotiated, but they seem willing to acquiesce, for now, with the end goal of peace and Ukraine and Europe's security in mind.
Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuania's former foreign minister, told CNBC Tuesday that Europe still appeared to be struggling to be heard, saying the bloc had not yet found its strength and ""ability to create leverage.""
""What came out of the meeting yesterday was that Europe was asking the U.S. yesterday to continue its assistance, to ask for a ceasefire, to assist any stationing of troops, and then some of the leaders were even saying, 'Well, some of the Ukrainian territories might be lost, but that's a reality.' Well, that doesn't sound like Europe finding it's strength,"" he said.
""It's more like Europe agreeing that, 'we are in a very weak position and we have to please President Trump as much as we can and we have nothing to put on the table',"" he noted.
What's more, it's unclear whether the Kremlin will even agree to direct talks with Zelenskyy. Putin's presidential aide Yuri Ushakov stated Monday that Trump and Putin had discussed ""that it would be necessary to study the possibility of raising the level of representatives of the Ukrainian and Russian sides,"" but that no firm decision was made.
The proposed future summits between Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy would keep a process towards a possible resolution of the conflict alive, but it would still follow the Russian script of a no-ceasefire scenario, Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, cautioned.
""Putin may already set difficult conditions for a meeting with Zelenskyy. And in a meeting with Zelenskyy, Putin's major goal may be to pin the blame for any failure on Zelenskyy instead of agreeing to a truce or a final deal. The outcome remains very uncertain,"" he noted.",a8198566b384a447be2c791f8f92ea6d,trafilatura,4879,0

So far this year, the stock has risen 74%, reflecting growing confidence in the company’s vision and operational execution.
Two major developments have amplified the spotlight on RKLB stock. First, the company completed a $275 million acquisition of Geost, a specialist in electro-optical and infrared sensor systems, strengthening its capabilities for government and defense-related space projects. Second, several analysts raised their price targets following the company's latest earnings release, signaling renewed optimism around future growth.
Needham, for example, maintained a “Buy” rating while projecting non-GAAP operating margins to reach breakeven by the fourth quarter of 2026. The firm's rating and $55 price target were based on management’s confidence in consistent revenue expansion and margin improvement.
As Rocket Lab executes ambitious plans and builds a robust backlog of contracts, RKLB continues to gain traction. That leaves investors to wonder whether the stock has the momentum to climb toward the $55 mark in 2025, making it one of the more closely watched names in the space economy.
About Rocket Lab Stock
Rocket Lab is based out of Long Beach, California, and has steadily built itself into an end-to-end space solutions company. Its operations cover the design, production, and launch of small and medium-class rockets, spacecraft, spacecraft components, and the software needed to manage these systems.
With a market capitalization of approximately $20.4 billion, the company has attracted significant investor attention for both its commercial ventures and its growing role in government and national security projects.
Over the past 52 weeks, RKLB stock has soared 659%, with a remarkable 75% climb in the last three months alone, underscoring the market’s recognition of its accelerating momentum.
Trading at 45 times sales, well above the industry average, the stock reflects investor confidence in Rocket Lab’s ability to convert innovation into tangible growth, signaling expectations of continued market leadership.
Rocket Lab Surpasses Q2 Earnings
On Aug. 7, Rocket Lab released its fiscal Q2 2025 results, which showed revenue rising 36% to $144.5 million, surpassing analyst estimates of $135 million. The beat was fueled in part by five Electron missions during the quarter as well as an expanding satellite manufacturing division.
Gross margins showed healthy improvement, with GAAP margin reaching 32.1% and non-GAAP margin climbing to 36.9%, marking notable year-over-year (YOY) increases. Despite this progress, net loss widened by 59.5% to $66.4 million, marking the continuation of a five-year streak of losses.
Loss per share widened to $0.13 during the quarter, missing consensus expectations for an $0.11 loss. Management underscored that these losses are deliberate investments in the company's Neutron rocket program and other strategic expansions, designed to position Rocket Lab for sustainable long-term growth. Rocket Lab's backlog remains strong at $1 billion, representing a balanced mix of government and commercial contracts.
Looking ahead, Rocket Lab projects Q3 revenue between $145 million and $155 million, with non-GAAP gross margins ranging from 39% to 41%.
Meanwhile, analysts expect Q3 2025 loss per share of $0.10, while the full fiscal-year 2025 loss is anticipated to widen 11% to $0.42. For fiscal 2026, however, the outlook improves, with expected losses narrowing 57% to $0.18 per share.
What Do Analysts Expect for Rocket Lab Stock?
Analyst sentiment around Rocket Lab has turned increasingly positive, driven by operational execution and strategic developments. Deutsche Bank recently raised its price target on RKLB stock to $45 from $27 while maintaining a “Buy” rating, highlighting confidence in the company’s revenue growth and margin expansion. KeyBanc analyst Mike Leschock also increased his price target to $50 from $40 on stronger-than-anticipated margins and steady Neutron rocket program progress.
Analysts assign RKLB an overall rating of “Moderate Buy.” Of the 15 analysts covering RKLB stock, eight rate it a “Strong Buy,” one gives a “Moderate Buy"" rating, and six recommend to “Hold.”
RKLB stock already trades above its average price target of $43.85, while Needham maintains the Street-high target of $55, indicating potential upside of 24% from current levels.

Startups with little more than a pitch deck are raising hundreds of millions. Valuations have become ""insane."" Capital is chasing a ""kernel of truth"" with feverish speed.
The OpenAI CEO still believes the long-term societal upside of AI will outweigh the froth, and he's ready to keep spending in pursuit of that goal.
""Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes,"" he said at a recent dinner with reporters. ""Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.""
He repeated the word 'bubble' three times in 15 seconds, then half-joked, ""I'm sure someone's gonna write some sensational headline about that. I wish you wouldn't, but that's fine.""
While Altman warned that valuations are now out of control, he's ready to shell out on more infrastructure.
""You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on datacenter construction in the not very distant future,"" Altman said. ""And you should expect a bunch of economists wringing their hands, saying, 'This is so crazy, it's so reckless,' and we'll just be like, 'You know what? Let us do our thing.'""
OpenAI is already looking beyond Microsoft Azure's cloud capacity, and is shopping around for more.
The company signed a deal with Google Cloud this spring and, according to Altman, OpenAI is ""beyond the compute demand"" of what any one hyperscaler can offer.
""You should expect us to take as much compute as we can,"" he added. ""Our bet is, our demand is going to keep growing, our training needs are going to keep going, and we will spend maybe more aggressively than any company who's ever spent on anything ahead of progress, because we just have this very deep belief in what we're seeing.""
It's not just OpenAI. All the megacaps are trying to keep up.
In their most recent earnings, tech's biggest names all raised capital expenditure guidance to keep pace with AI demand: Microsoft is now targeting $120 billion in full-year capital expenditures, Amazon is topping $100 billion, Alphabet raised its forecast to $85 billion, and Meta lifted the high end of its capex range to $72 billion.
Wedbush's Dan Ives said Monday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" that demand for AI infrastructure has grown 30% to 40% in the last months, calling the capex surge a validation moment for the sector.
Ives acknowledged ""some froth"" in parts of the market, but said the AI revolution with autonomous is only starting to play out and we are in the ""second inning of a nine-inning game.""
""The actual impact over the medium and long term is actually being underestimated,"" he said.
Citi's Rob Rowe, speaking Monday on CNBC's ""Money Movers,"" pushed back on comparisons between today's AI boom and the dotcom bubble.
""Back then, you had a lot of over-leveraged situations. You didn't have a lot of companies that had earnings,"" Rowe said. ""Here you're talking about companies that have very solid earnings, very strong cash flow, and they're funding a lot of this growth through that cash flow. So in many respects, it's a little different than that.""
He added that the current wave of AI investment is being driven by structural shifts in the global economy, particularly the rapid growth of digital services, which now account for a large share of global exports. Also unlike the dotcom cycle of the late 90s, companies today are funding their infrastructure spending with strong cash flow rather than relying on debt.
Still, concerns about overheating have been mounting.
Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai pointed to worrying signs in the AI sector well before the hyperscalers raised their annual capex guidance during the latest earnings prints.
In March, he warned of a brewing AI bubble in the U.S.
Speaking at HSBC's Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong, Tsai said he was astounded by the scale of datacenter spending under discussion. Tsai questioned whether hundreds of billions in spending is necessary, and flagged concern about companies starting to build datacenters ""on spec,"" without clear demand.
Altman, for his part, sees these cycles as part of the natural rhythm of technological progress.
The dotcom crash wiped out scores of companies, but still gave rise to the modern internet. He expects AI to follow a similar path: a few high-profile wipeouts, followed by a lasting transformation.
""I do think some investors are likely to get very burnt here, and that sucks. And I don't want to minimize that,"" he said. ""But on the whole, it is my belief that... the value created by AI for society will be tremendous.""

The next test is earnings. The Club stock, which is one of the 30 names that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average , is having its best month of the year, even with Monday's more than 1% slide. Tuesday's earnings report before the opening bell, however, will spotlight the retailer's actual business performance and may determine where shares go from here. They have gained nearly 7.5% so far in August. ""Home Depot, the company, is not doing well. Home Depot, the stock is on fire,"" Jim Cramer said during our August Monthly Meeting last week. ""It's a stock that needs lower rates,"" Jim added, to bring down rates on mortgages and home equity loans. HD YTD mountain Home Depot YTD And, lower rates are, indeed, what the market expects from the Fed, with a more than 80% chance of a September cut, according to the CME FedWatch tool , and at least one more by year-end. Mortgage rates, which have followed the 10-year Treasury yield south since late May, hit their lowest levels since late October 2024. As of last Thursday, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.58%, according to Freddie Mac , the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Below 6.5% for a 30-year has historically been seen as a level that spurs housing activity, which Home Depot needs as a supplier to homebuilders, contractors, and homeowners doing their own renovation projects. ""We've seen the last couple of weeks, as rate cut odds improve, what could happen,"" said Jeff Marks, director of portfolio analysis for the Club. The real estate market has been stalled due to those high home prices and elevated mortgage rates. The latter is especially punitive because so many people secured super-low rates during Covid, which are keeping them put. During sluggish activity from do-it-yourself customers, Home Depot has been taking steps to bolster its business aimed at professionals. Last year, Home Depot acquired SRS Distribution, a leading supplier of roofing and building materials, in an $18.25 billion deal. The home improvement giant then doubled down this year, with a successful $4.3 billion bid to acquire GMS back in June. ""We believe the SRS platform has established a firm foundation for capitalizing on Complex Pro that is performing well,"" wrote Stifel analysts in a note to clients Sunday. The complex pro segment in the home improvement industry refers to large-scale projects handled by contractors. Analysts added, ""We view the potential GMS acquisition positively with modest synergy potential with HD leveraging its financial strength to invest behind favorable long-term construction trends amid difficult industry conditions."" In addition to listening for any further details on the GMS transaction and the SRS integration, investors on Tuesday will get a look at Home Depot's spring and early summer sales — a period that Jim has called Home Depot's Christmas . As my colleague Kevin Stankiewicz wrote in an earnings preview over the weekend, ""The market is looking for a companywide same-store sales increase of 1.3% in the July quarter, according to FactSet. That would mark a significant acceleration from the 0.3% drop seen in the February-to-April period. Investors also will be looking for any tariff-related hit to margins after executives said in May they expected to 'generally maintain' current prices."" Bottom line While encouraged by Home Depot's price action lately, the stock is coming into Tuesday's earnings print hot, which Jim has often said makes him cautious. ""It's such a hard stock to own because we're playing rates. We're not playing the business,"" he added. We may get a hint on rates before the Fed's meeting next month.

Investors can still find compelling yields while navigating both uneconomic uncertainty and concerns over global tensions, he said. This week, the global focus has been on the Russia-Ukraine war . On Monday, President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders following the his summit last week with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Meanwhile, investors are closely watching U.S. economic data for an indication of when the Federal Reserve might start decreasing rates.

Those with a five-year time horizon can earn yield and, with careful asset allocation decisions, earn a bit more, he said. Bond yields move inversely to prices. ""Yields are high, bonds are cheap from a historical perspective, while stocks look expensive under any reasonable long term valuation metric, and credit spreads are tight,"" Ivascyn said. ""You can put together a portfolio where you have a high-quality yield in the 6%-to-7%-type range, if you can make some thoughtful asset allocation decisions along the way, you, in theory, can get a high single-digit return,"" he added. ""That's very good."" Recently, there has been a high correlation between starting yield and a bond's performance, he explained. Therefore, the starting yield means a higher expected return. Where Ivascyn sees opportunities Ivascyn focuses on that stability and resiliency as the portfolio manager of the Morningstar 5-star rated Pimco Income Fund . Its institutional shares, PIMIX, are rated five stars by Morningstar and its A-shares, available to individual investors, are rated four stars . The latter has a 4.33% 30-day SEC yield and adjusted expense ratio of 0.9%. It has a total return of 6.36% year to date, ranking in the top eighth percentile in its category, according to Morningstar . PONAX YTD mountain Pimco Income Fund, A shares Ivascyn targets maturities in the five- to 10-year range, which will benefit from curve steepening, he said. Right now, he is investing in agency mortgage-backed securities because they have attractive yields and are high quality, since they are backed by the federal government. He can also trade across different maturities and coupons. In addition, spreads are wider than investment-grade corporate spreads, which means there is more value to be had, he noted. Pimco Income Fund has a 36% allocation to agency MBS, as of July 31. The fund's exposure to U.S. corporate bonds is near the lowest end of its historical range since spreads are tight — which means they are expensive, according to Ivascyn. There are also opportunities in high-grade structured credit, such as non-agency mortgages and some asset-backed securities, Ivascyn said. ""We really like lending to the consumer, so we own a lot of consumer-oriented-mortgage and asset-backed risks that don't have government guarantees,"" he said. ""The great news is you don't need a government guarantee,"" he added. ""A lot of these deals have additional credit support, but they also take advantage of the fact that … the household balance sheet has de-levered a lot. While there has been some weakening in fundamentals in the lower-income cohort, overall ""the household balance sheet is very, very strong,"" he said. Ivascyn is also investing in short-dated U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPs. He likes them for their attractive pricing, not necessarily because he has significant inflation concerns. ""The inflation rate probably trends a bit higher the next couple of quarters, but in general, we think we're living in a world now where inflation likely settles down in the mid-2%-ish type range,"" he said. Within U.S. Treasurys, he's staying with shorter maturities. Globally, Ivascyn believes markets like Australia and the U.K. have a stronger fiscal picture than the U.S., so he has sovereign bond exposure in those countries. ""What we're really trying to do is just be diversified and take advantage of good value in the higher-quality areas of the market, protect client downside in the process [and] generate returns that we think are quite attractive relative to where they've been much in the last couple of decades,"" he said.",a3101f817087b5e4755139e45cedc3f2,trafilatura,4612,0

As part of a potential deal, the government is also considering converting some or all of Intel's grants from the 2022 U.S. CHIPS and Science Act into equity in the company, the report said, citing a White House official and other people familiar with the matter.
At the embattled chipmaker's current market value, a 10% stake would be worth roughly $10.4 billion. Meanwhile, Intel has been awarded about $10.9 billion in CHIPS Act grants, including $7.9 billion to support its domestic investment plans and $3 billion to further its semiconductor manufacturing for national security.
The report noted, however, that it remains unclear if the idea has gained traction broadly within the administration or whether officials have broached the possibility with affected companies.
It added that the exact size of the stake remains in flux, and it remains unclear whether the White House will actually proceed with the plan. Intel and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries regarding the report.
Intel, once a dominant force in the U.S. chip industry, has fallen behind global competitors in advanced chip manufacturing. Reviving the former U.S. chip champion has become a national priority in Washington, with reports about a potential government stake in the company first circulating last week.
The company has been the largest recipient of the 2022 CHIPS Act, passed with bipartisan support under the Biden administration, as part of efforts by Washington to revitalize U.S. leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.
The bill allocated $39 billion in grants for American semiconductor projects, with funding committed to many of the world's chipmakers such as TSMC and Samsung, as well as American chip companies such as Nvidia, Micron and GlobalFoundries.
U.S. President Donald Trump, though supporting the general goals of the CHIPS Act, has been a vocal critic of the bill and even called for its repeal earlier this year. While republican lawmakers in Washington have been reluctant to act on that call, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in June that the administration was renegotiating some of the bill's grants.
If Intel's CHIPS Act funds were to be converted into a potential government stake in the company, it could decrease the total amount of capital infused into the company as part of any deal by Washington.
However, it would serve as the latest example of the Trump administration's interest in building government-backed national champions in strategic industries.
Intel has struggled to gain an advantage in the artificial intelligence boom and has yet to capture a significant customer for its manufacturing business despite spending heavily on it.
Some analysts have argued that government intervention is essential for the struggling chipmaker and for the sake of U.S. national security. Others contend that Intel's problems are deeper than funding, and that it's unclear if the government can steer it in the right direction.
Analysts have also noted that Trump may be able to use the threat of tariffs and regulation to sway companies to buy Intel chips or provide indirect assistance.
On Tuesday, SoftBank announced a $2 billion investment in Intel, which, according to LSEG, would make it the fifth-largest shareholder. Masayoshi Son, Chairman & CEO of SoftBank Group, said: ""This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role.""
Intel investors had initially welcomed news of a potential government investment, which resulted in a share rally of nearly 9% on Aug. 14. Shares of Intel fell over 3% on Monday on the Bloomberg report, but rebounded by more than 5% in overnight trading on the trading platform Robinhood following news of the Softbank investment.
Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who was appointed in March 2025, met with Trump at the White House last week, after the U.S. president had called for his ousting due to his past ties to China.
After the meeting, Trump had changed his tune on the Intel chief, saying he had ""an amazing story."" It's unclear if a potential government stake in the company had been discussed at the time.

Intel — Shares of the chipmaker jumped almost 7% after it was announced that SoftBank will make a roughly $2 billion investment in the company, paying $23 per share for Intel's common stock. This comes as the U.S. government reportedly has been considering taking a stake in Intel. Palo Alto Networks — The cybersecurity stock gained 3% after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street's expectations. Palo Alto also posted better-than-expected guidance for the first quarter and full year and announced that its founder and chief technology officer, Nir Zuk, is retiring. Fabrinet — The electronic manufacturing services company dropped 12.8%.

There's a bubble forming in the artificial intelligence industry, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
""Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,"" Altman said, according to a report by The Verge.
Altman's AI company is currently in talks to sell about $6 billion in stock that would value OpenAI at around $500 billion, CNBC confirmed Friday.
In another context, Altman warned that the U.S. may be underestimating the progress that China is making in AI.
Given the above premises, should investors be more cautious about OpenAI? Altman was not posed this question, but one wonders whether his opinion would also be ""yes.""
Outside pure-play AI companies, the money is, likewise, still flowing. Intel is receiving a $2 billion injection of cash from Japan's SoftBank.
It's a much-needed boost to the beleaguered U.S. chipmaker. Intel has fallen behind foreign rivals such as TSMC and Samsung in manufacturing semiconductors that serve as the brains for AI models.
But going by Altman's views, the investment in Intel might not be a good bet by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.
Not everyone agrees with Altman, of course. Ray Wang, research director for semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at Futurum Group, pointed out that the AI industry is not heterogeneous. There are market leaders, and then there are companies that are still developing.
In the real world, bubbles delight because they reflect their surroundings in a play of light. But the bubble Altman described could be one doesn't show the face of its observer.

The new tariffs, which took effect Monday, expand the scope of the levies that President Donald Trump previously announced on the valuable commodities. The tariff list now covers products such as fire extinguishers, machinery, construction materials and specialty chemicals that either contain, or are contained in, aluminum or steel.
""Auto parts, chemicals, plastics, furniture components—basically, if it's shiny, metallic, or remotely related to steel or aluminum, it's probably on the list,"" Brian Baldwin, vice president of customs at Kuehne + Nagel International AG wrote on LinkedIn of the expanded list.
""This isn't just another tariff—it's a strategic shift in how steel and aluminum derivatives are regulated,"" he wrote.
The levies extend to 407 new product categories, the Department of Commerce said Tuesday.
""Today's action expands the reach of the steel and aluminum tariffs and shuts down avenues for circumvention – supporting the continued revitalization of the American steel and aluminum industries,"" Jeffrey Kessler, the Commerce Department's under secretary for industry and security, said in a statement.
The release from the agency links out to a list that identifies the newly included product types only by the specific customs codes that apply to them, not by what the products are actually called.
For example, the Commerce Department identifies the product category of fire extinguishers only as ""8424.10.0000,"" a 10-digit code buried among hundreds of other 10-digit codes.
This format makes it very difficult for the public to get a full picture of all the products that are affected by Monday's expanded tariffs.
But experts say the impact will be enormous.
""By my count, the steel and aluminum tariffs now affect at least $320 billion of imports based on 2024's general customs value of imports,"" Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, wrote on LinkedIn. That is a substantial increase from his prior estimate of roughly $190 billion.
""This will add more inflationary cost-push pressures to already climbing prices that domestic producers are charging as picked up by July's PPI data,"" he continued.
Trump has repeatedly relied on sector-specific tariffs to enact his sweeping trade agenda.
In June, Trump announced that he was doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50% for most countries, creating widespread uncertainty for businesses and U.S. trading partners reliant on the valuable commodities.
The White House said that the tariffs on additional products should ""not come as a surprise.""
""The President called for a new steel and aluminum product inclusions process in February,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.
""[The Bureau of Industry and Security] established the new product inclusions process in April, and companies submitted requests for product inclusions in mid-May,"" he said.
""Thus, it has been clear for many months that new products could be treated as steel and aluminum derivatives.""",0f091d80e599536340b0c0c913e8b2e1,trafilatura,3225,0

But there are still compelling reasons to stay in the market, even at all-time highs. Here’s why — and how you can do it.
The Market Consistently Makes New ‘All-Time’ Highs
Markets don’t go up in a straight line, but history shows the S&P 500 has always gone on to make new highs, no matter how severe a bear market it endures. The fact that the index is at an all-time high as of July 2025 means that by definition, all of its past bad days and bad years are now in the rear-view mirror. Investors who have held on — or even added to their positions — during prior downturns have been handsomely rewarded with the highest price in the index’s history.

Market Technicians Love New Highs
Technical research interprets past trading patterns to predict future market movements. Many technicians view a new market high as a “breakout,” indicating future upside to come. Numerous other factors can help support this prediction, such as rising trading volume and increasing market breadth, but in its most simplistic form, technical analysis usually views a fresh market high as an indication that prices will continue to go higher.
Timing the Market Leads To Underperformance
If you could always buy at the stock market’s low and sell at its high, yes, you’d have a great trading record that would significantly outperform the overall market. But history, along with the shattered portfolios of numerous traders before you, shows that doing that consistently is all but impossible.
A more likely scenario is that you emotionally panic and sell your positions when the market is crashing and then start investing again after the market has made significant gains — right before the next bear market.
Another common scenario is that you fear the S&P 500 is “overvalued” and you sell all your positions as the market goes higher and higher. Missing out on even a few of the best days in the market is enough to keep your portfolio in a perpetual state of underperformance, but it’s a relatively common occurrence among those trying to time the market.
What Can You Do?
Investing at market highs is something of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it’s a great time to be invested in the S&P 500, because it means your portfolio should also be at all-time highs. However, it can also be a bit nerve-wracking because valuations are stretched to their limit, and the market is “priced for perfection” — meaning everything has to continue doing well to support those lofty prices. As fear of losing money is generally greater for investors than the joy from profiting, it’s natural to feel a bit queasy when market prices are high.",7b3853403650164302c3d7c33ef1193e,trafilatura,3094,0

Salesforce (CRM) stock fell as much as 5% after hours after the company reported results in line or slightly better than estimates that failed to wow investors looking for big AI gains.
For the quarter, Wall Street was looking for Salesforce's artificial intelligence efforts to show broader adoption — and monetization. Year to date, the stock has underperformed with a 23% loss.
Salesforce did beat Wall Street estimates and show steady growth: Revenue climbed 9.7% year over year to $10.24 billion, slightly above analyst expectations for $10.13 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 were also above estimates for earnings of $2.78 per share.
For the 2026 fiscal year, Salesforce initiated revenue guidance of $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion and raised the low end of its full-year revenue guidance, which now stands in a range of $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion. Both of those outlooks represent single-digit growth, which lags in comparison to other large-cap tech and AI players.

Nvidia ended the session marginally lower, while Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom each lost around 1%. Shares of Palantir declined about 1%, and Intel dropped about 7%. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms also declined.
""It's not a surprise to see some investors taking profits in tech stocks, which have had an incredibly strong run – with some up over 80% since the early April lows. Market volume in general is typically quite sparse in late August leading to wider swings than fundamentals would warrant,"" said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth.
On the earnings front, Target shares dropped 6% after the retailer reported another decline in sales and announced a new CEO who will step into the role on Feb. 1. Lowe's, meanwhile, edged higher after the home improvement retailer's earnings beat expectations.
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting released Wednesday showed that central bankers expressed concerns about the state of the labor market and inflation, though most agreed that it was too soon to lower interest rates. At the time, policymakers once more held steady on interest rates, but Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman dissented, marking the first time two voting Fed officials have done so since 1993.
""Participants generally pointed to risks to both sides of the Committee's dual mandate, emphasizing upside risk to inflation and downside risk to employment,"" the minutes noted. While ""a majority of participants judged the upside risk to inflation as the greater of these two risks"" a couple saw ""downside risk to employment the more salient risk.""
The release of the minutes come ahead of remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, which investors will monitor for insights into the path of interest rates. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 80% likelihood of the central bank cutting interest rates at its next policy gathering in September, according to CME's FedWatch tool.
""If Powell's language is more hawkish, that could pressure tech stocks even further, as a continuation of these elevated interest rates is generally a headwind for the tech sector,"" Schleif said.",3edaedad9436e8929fbd380b0c3b64a4,trafilatura,2945,0

The six-day poll, which concluded on Monday, showed 71% of respondents said they were concerned that AI will be ""putting too many people out of work permanently.""
The new technology burst into the national conversation in late 2022 when OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot launched and became the fastest-growing application of all time, with tech heavyweights like Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Google owner Alphabet and Microsoft offering their own AI products.
While at present there are few signs of mass unemployment - the U.S. jobless rate was just 4.2% in July - artificial intelligence is stirring concerns as it reshapes jobs, industries and day-to-day life.
Some 77% of respondents to the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they worried the technology could be used to stir up political chaos, a sign of unease over the now-common use of AI technology to create realistic videos of imaginary events.
President Donald Trump last month posted on social media an AI-generated video of former Democratic president Barack Obama being arrested, an event that never happened.
Americans are also leery about military applications for AI, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. Some 48% of respondents said the government should never use AI to determine the target of a military strike, compared with 24% who said the government should allow that sort of use of the technology. Another 28% said they were not sure.
The general enthusiasm for AI shown by many people and companies has fueled further investments, such as Foxconn and SoftBank's planned data center equipment factory in Ohio. It has also upended national security policies as the United States and China vie for AI dominance.
More than half of Americans - some 61% - said they were concerned about the amount of electricity needed to power the fast-growing technology.
Google said earlier this month it had signed agreements with two U.S. electric utilities to reduce its AI data center power consumption during times of surging demand on the grid, as energy-intensive AI use outpaces power supplies.
The new technology has also come under criticism for applications that have let AI bots hold romantic conversations with children, generate false medical information and help people make racist arguments.
Two-thirds of respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they worried that people would ditch relationships with other people in favor of AI companions.
People were split on whether AI technology will improve education. Some 36% of respondents thought it would help, while 40% disagreed and the rest were not sure.
The Reuters/Ipsos survey gathered responses online from 4,446 U.S. adults nationwide and had a margin of error of about 2 percentage points.",03090c1f187c09ae34ddd34f256aa040,trafilatura,2884,0

Chainlink has quietly introduced what could be one of the most significant developments in decentralized finance infrastructure: the Chainlink Reserve, a strategic onchain reserve designed to accumulate LINK tokens with no planned withdrawals for multiple years.
The oracle network giant announced this new mechanism as part of its long-term sustainability strategy, marking a shift toward building what industry veterans are calling a “treasury-like approach” to token economics. The Reserve has already accumulated over $1 million worth of LINK tokens in its early phase, with transparent tracking available through a public contract address and analytics dashboard.

The Revenue Engine Behind The Reserve
What makes the Chainlink Reserve particularly intriguing is its funding mechanism called Payment Abstraction. This infrastructure converts both offchain enterprise payments and onchain revenue streams directly into LINK tokens, creating consistent buying pressure regardless of market conditions.
Payment Abstraction allows users to pay for Chainlink services in their preferred currencies—whether gas tokens or stablecoins—which are then automatically converted to LINK through decentralized exchanges like Uniswap V3. This removes friction for enterprises while simultaneously building the strategic reserve.
The system leverages multiple Chainlink services working in concert: Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol for consolidating fees across different blockchains, Automation for triggering conversions, and Price Feeds for accurate token pricing during exchanges.

Enterprise Adoption Driving Real Revenue
Unlike many cryptocurrency projects that rely primarily on speculation, Chainlink generates substantial revenue from actual enterprise usage. The platform has secured over $80 billion in Total Value Secured across more than 60 blockchains, establishing itself as the industry standard for decentralized oracles.
Revenue streams feeding into the Reserve include enterprise integrations and maintenance fees, usage-based payments from subscription services, and revenue-sharing agreements with major protocols. Notable partnerships include GMX, which shares 1.2% of total fees for Data Streams, and Aave, which contributes 35% of recaptured liquidation MEV.",8735a9bc4a483c9d83588e86b0acf863,trafilatura,2860,0

The agreement, which was first disclosed in February 2025, includes certain services for mid-sized enterprises, as well as audit and advisory offerings for municipalities and regional authorities.
KPMG Sweden partner and CEO Mathias Arvidsson said: “We are focusing our presence in Sweden on 12 locations to build a stronger KPMG.
“This will give us the strength to accelerate our offering and continue creating value for customers, employees, and society. The transaction, in collaboration with Azets, has been carried out with great professionalism and expertise.
“We wish Azets Sweden, along with the employees and clients who are now joining their operations, all the best and look forward to continued successful cooperation.”
As a result of this acquisition, Azets has integrated 300 new employees, including 14 partners, enhancing its operational reach to over 30 cities in Sweden and raising its annual revenue in the country to Skr1bn ($104.9m).
This development represents Azets' first entry into the audit services market within the Nordic region and aligns with the group's strategic objective of establishing a £1bn business by 2027.
The acquired services will be organised into a new division within Azets Sweden, focusing specifically on audit and advisory functions, the company said.
With operations in Norway, Denmark, and Finland, Azets aims to leverage this acquisition to further its expansion in the Nordic audit and advisory landscape, thereby enhancing its offerings for SMEs and public sector entities in the region.
Azets Group CEO Chris Horne said: “This is a significant and symbolic step forward for Azets, as we lay the foundations for long-term growth across the Nordics.
“Sweden is our launchpad – but our sights are firmly set on building a leading audit, tax and advisory capability across the region, combining deep local knowledge with the scale and strength of our Group.
“The Nordic market is a key pillar of our Group strategy. We’re committed to investing in talent, expanding our services, and supporting clients with the trusted, technology-enabled expertise they need to move forward with confidence.”

This marks the completion of WH Smith's transformation into a “pure play global travel retailer”, aimed at capitalising on growth opportunities and enhancing shareholder value.
Card Factory CEO Darcy Willson-Rymer stated: ""This acquisition represents a key milestone in delivering our strategic ambition to build a scaled and competitive digital presence in the celebration occasions market.
“We welcome our new Funky Pigeon colleagues into the group and look forward to working together to accelerate our growth in the direct-to-recipient card and gifting segment, bringing together Funky Pigeon's high-quality technology platform and digital expertise with our strong store estate and broader celebrations offer"".
The sale is based on an enterprise value of £26m, with WH Smith expecting to net £21m in cash after deducting transaction expenses. These proceeds will contribute to reducing the company's debt.
Card Factory anticipates the acquisition to be earnings-enhancing in the financial year ending 31 January 2027, with synergy benefits projected to surpass £5m.
The benefits are expected to stem from improved manufacturing and fulfilment processes, technology platforms and product offerings.
Funky Pigeon's established online presence, backed by its teams in Bristol and Guernsey, has reported annual revenues of £32m and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation of £5m for the previous two financial years.
Card Factory's strategy includes leveraging Funky Pigeon's digital platform to enhance its omnichannel capabilities and attract its 24 million unique in-store customers to a stronger online market presence in celebration occasions.
Card Factory's digital strategy also involves improving the online customer experience and expanding the in-store party and celebrations range through an integrated omnichannel approach.

How deep those divisions run should become clearer Wednesday when the central bank releases minutes from its July meeting. The July 29-30 meeting saw the Federal Open Market Committee vote to keep its key interest rate steady in a target range of 4.25%-4.5%. However, that decision came with two dissents from Board of Governors members, the first time that has happened in more than 30 years. Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller voted against the final statement, saying later that they wanted the committee to cut by a quarter percentage point. Since the meeting, public statements from Fed officials have fallen in various levels around the notion of cuts, with most still expressing caution about the unknown tariff impacts. However, many of the 11 or so candidates thought to be in the running to succeed Chair Jerome Powell have spoken out forcefully in favor of cuts. That raises the stakes for the minutes. Because the FOMC meetings do not take place in public, the minutes are the only chance for investors to get a glimpse at what happens there. Even then, transcripts don't come out until five years later. The minutes ""could fill in some blanks about how dug in the doves were and how intransigent the inflation hawks might've been in late July,"" wrote market veteran Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research. Some things have changed since then: The July nonfarm payrolls count pointed to a further slowdown in the labor market, while inflation reports presented a mixed bag of moderating consumer prices but escalating pipeline pressures as producer costs rose . In the meantime, Trump officials have kept up the pressure for cuts. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that the hot producer price index came largely from rising portfolio costs due to stock market gains. All the heat from the White House means that ""the risk that economic policy decisions will be swayed by political pressure is increasing,"" wrote Komal Sri-Kumar, head of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies. Fed officials assiduously avoid commenting on political matters, insisting that they make their decisions based solely on their policy goals of full employment and stable prices. However, with the high-profile sweepstakes happening for the Fed chair slot, maintaining that veneer could be more difficult, and investors likely will pore through the minutes for any appearance that politicking is exacting a toll on policy. ""The Fed's independence has always relied less on legal safeguards than on the shared norm that monetary policy is insulated from partisan interference,"" Sri-Kumar added. ""That norm is under siege.""",a89fa7c543374427ea4f68aabe0e5a4f,trafilatura,2774,0

Soho House, a hotel and private club chain, is a public company “nomo.” It’s going private in an acquisition by MCR Hotels, and is also adding some new names to its leadership team.

The company first went public in 2021. Along with Monday’s announcement of the deal with MCR Hotels, the company said Neil Thomson will become the new CFO, and MCR’s chairman and CEO Tyler Morse will join its Board of Directors, as will Ashton Kutcher, an actor who’s gone on to become a prominent investor.
The deal has reportedly been brewing since December, and values Soho House at about $2.7 billion. Shareholders will receive $9 per share, which is a premium of 18% over Friday’s closing price.
On Monday, Soho House stock rose 16% to $8.83 after news of the deal.
MCR Hotels operates 150 hotels in 37 states, including the TWA Hotel, Gramercy Park Hotel, Pasadena Hotel & Pool, and High Line Hotels in New York City, where Soho House New York is located. Soho House’s global network comprises 46 “Houses,” which will be added to the mix.
“Since our IPO in 2021, we’ve focused on building a stronger, more resilient business,” Andrew Carnie, Soho House’s CEO, said in a statement. “Against a backdrop of challenging economic conditions and global uncertainty, from 2022-2024 we delivered consistent, disciplined growth with revenue increasing at an average annual rate of double digit growth.”
“Returning to private ownership enables us to build on this momentum, with the support of world class hospitality and investment partners,” Carnie continued.
Morse said that “MCR’s investment in Soho House represents a strategic opportunity to combine our operational expertise with one of the most distinctive brands in hospitality. Our shared goal is to safeguard the member experience, drive sustainable international growth for House members, and protect and expand the cultural and creative foundation that has made Soho House a global industry leader.”
In recent months, Soho House has put up solid numbers. Its latest earnings report, which came out earlier this month, showed total revenue for the second quarter of 2025 growing nearly 9% year-over-year to roughly $330 million. However, since the company went public, its shares are down almost 30%.

The updated filing, which was initially submitted in June, still does not include details such as a fee or ticker symbol. Some say the fund, which will directly track the price of bitcoin, might struggle to differentiate itself. “Bitcoin is effectively digital gold. [It’s] not really being used for transactions the way you know currencies are,” said Jeff DeMaso, founder of the newsletter The Independent Vanguard Advisor. “How much appetite is there for different flavors of digital gold?”

The Bit(coin) Of Your Own Drum
Trump’s bitcoin ETF is one of three filings from Trump Media, which owns his social media platform Truth Social, the other two being the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF and the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. Josh Barone, wealth manager at Savvy Advisors, said that having both a bitcoin fund and a more diversified crypto index fund taps into two distinct markets: the “ideological retail investor” who wants a Trump-approved product, and the “broader, crypto-curious crowd.” He added that “fixed supply dynamics, increasing institutional adoption, and a maturing ETF market” have lowered bitcoin’s barriers to entry for investors who wouldn’t otherwise get into crypto. Still, DeMaso says the fund is likely to blend into the background compared to other, more established funds. “I would fully expect the iShares, the Fidelitys of the world to kind of continue to take the bulk of the assets,” he said. “The ETF space is really winner-takes-all, and that race has already started.”
The biggest players in the bitcoin ETF space are:
-
The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which has over $88 billion in assets;
-
Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which has $23 billion in assets;
-
And Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC), which has $21 billion in assets.
Crypto-Curious. At least in the short run, the product will be successful because of Trump’s political base, the fund’s media attention and pro-crypto policy tailwinds, Barone said. Long-term viability, however, will depend on the success of its “initial adoption phase, followed by consistent execution, transparency, and competitive pricing,” he said. “The branding alone will attract a segment of the market that might otherwise avoid crypto entirely.”

HYDERABAD, India/GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (Reuters) -On India's southern coast, V. Srinivas thrived for two decades by farming shrimp, as the country became the top supplier of the delicacy to the United States. Now, Donald Trump's 50% tariff threat is forcing many to consider other ways of making money.
Andhra Pradesh state sends the most shrimp from India to the U.S. and farmers there have spent millions of rupees (hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars) over the years to cultivate high-quality shrimp in saline ponds.
Now they are being hit hard as Indian exporters have slashed rates they offer farmers by almost 20% after the tariff shock, wiping out most of their profits.
""I am contemplating if I should do fish farming,"" said the 46-year-old from Veeravasaram village who has already mortgaged his family property and has $45,800 in outstanding loans.
""These prices will not help me get any profits and I will not be able to pay off my loan.""
The United States is the biggest market for India's shrimp farmers and exporters, with clients including U.S. supermarket chains such as Walmart and Kroger. Last year, total seafood exports from India globally stood at $7.4 billion, with shrimp accounting for 40%.
But the industry is now in troubled waters with President Trump's 25% tariff on imports from India already in place - the highest among major economies, and another 25% levy to kick in from August 27 to penalize New Delhi for buying Russian oil.
By comparison, Ecuador, India's main rival for shrimp exports to the U.S., faces a much lower 15% tariff, heightening its competitive edge.
In Andhra, there are around 300,000 farmers engaged in shrimp farming, selling products to dozens of exporters who ship to America.
Pawan Kumar, head of the Seafood Exporters Association of India, said orders from U.S. clients have been paused in recent weeks as buyers aren't willing to absorb the tariff, and neither can exporters, forcing the latter to cut prices they pay to farmers.
Although India also sells shrimp to other countries such as China, Japan and the UK, and likely will look to expand sales there and diversify into new markets, ""that's not going to happen overnight,"" Kumar said.
The impact is yet another example of how Trump's tariff threats are causing business disruptions across the world, especially in India, given it faces one of the steepest levies that have soured its relations with Washington.
In Andhra, six of 12 farmers Reuters interviewed said they were considering putting shrimp farming on hold and looking at fish farming, vegetable retailing or other local businesses to tide over the crisis. The other six are choosing to wait it out a bit. Each round of shrimp cultivation takes about 2 months or more.",23549cc79c2a9b0c8d07a8105302e4c3,trafilatura,2761,0

Here are the accounts rewarding savers today
Consumer spending remains strong in the U.S., even as inflation holds at 2.7% and checking and savings balances decline. So, where’s the money coming from?
New research from JPMorgan Chase's Household Finances Pulse analysis may offer an answer.
Analyzing data from 4.7 million households, the study found that while traditional bank balances have stagnated, total cash reserves — including money market funds, brokerage accounts, and certificates of deposit (CDs) — are growing 3% to 5% annually in 2025.
The biggest gains are among lower-income households, with those in the lowest income quartile seeing 5% to 6% growth in total cash reserves.
This shift toward higher-yield accounts may help explain why consumer spending remains resilient, despite economic headwinds.

Where are Americans putting their money?
Instead of parking funds in checking or standard savings accounts, many households are turning to investment-style options with higher returns. If you're considering a similar move, here are a few of the most popular alternatives:
High-yield savings accounts (HYSAs): These work like traditional savings accounts but offer higher interest rates — often between 4% and 5% APY as of mid-2025 — often offered by online banks with lower overhead.
Certificates of deposit (CDs): CDs lock your money in for a fixed term in exchange for a guaranteed return. Rates vary by term but can exceed 4% for longer durations.
Money market accounts (MMAs): Offered by banks, MMAs combine savings features with limited check-writing abilities, FDIC insurance, and competitive yields — though often slightly below HYSAs.
Money market funds (MMFs): These are investment products, not bank accounts. While not FDIC-insured, they invest in low-risk, short-term securities and are considered a stable alternative to cash.
Brokerage accounts: These accounts allow you to invest in stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds. While more volatile, they offer higher long-term growth potential.
Retirement accounts (401(k)s, IRAs): Though designed for long-term saving, increased contributions to these tax-advantaged accounts suggest many households are focused on future financial security.",d06a36a9ce988ba359aaaf112fcc2d3e,trafilatura,2756,0

""NVDA is now the most under-owned large-cap tech stock,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note.
Though the chipmaker has grown into the world's most valuable company, investors don't hold it in line with its S&P 500 (^GSPC) weight. According to Woodring, Nvidia's market value accounts for 7.37% of the index, but its share in the average active institutional portfolio is 4.2%, an adjusted underweight of 2.41 percentage points. The gap is the largest of any of the 15 major tech companies Morgan Stanley's team tracks.
The disconnect highlights Nvidia's unique position. Its stock has been one of the best-performing names — up nearly 1,300% in the past five years — thanks to the AI boom. But its rapid rise and ongoing risks tied to geopolitics and supply chains have made some investors hesitant to load up.
History shows that underowned stocks often get pulled higher over time as investors gradually increase their holdings to match the stock's weight in the index.
""There is a statistically significant relationship between low active ownership ... and future stock performance,"" Morgan Stanley wrote.
By comparison, Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) are also underowned, but not to Nvidia's extent. Microsoft was underweight by 2.39%, Apple by 1.66%, and Amazon by 1.40%.
In contrast, the most overowned tech stocks include Intuit (INTU) at +0.83%, Oracle (ORCL) at +0.32%, and Dell (DELL) at +0.25%.
Despite the underweighting, Nvidia's fundamentals remain solid.
""Leading indicators of compute demand remain exceptionally strong with no signs of slowing,"" the firm's analysts wrote. ""As supply chain constraints around rack-scale solutions ease and the U.S. government advances export license approvals for China, we continue to view Nvidia as a premier asset in the current era of AI dominance.""
Nvidia's stock has been up 33% in 2025, outperforming the S&P 500's 10% advance. Much of the optimism stems from demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), used for AI and cloud-based enterprise applications.
Still, not everyone is on board with the bullish sentiment surrounding megacap stocks.
Torsten Sløk, Apollo Management's chief economist, previously told Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid that the current valuations in megacap tech stocks, and the index as a whole, may not be sustainable. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) At the time, he pointed to internal data showing that the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of the 10 largest S&P 500 companies, including AI stocks like Meta (META) and Nvidia, had surpassed levels seen during the dot-com bubble in 1999.",a49ea0a3c4ad6c27f27a54a979b9b613,trafilatura,2742,0

In January, Allied Blenders and Distillers announced plans to acquire up to a 51% equity stake in Good Barrel, contingent on business milestones, with an option to purchase the entire paid-up share capital.
However, the proposed acquisition will no longer happen.
In a stock exchange filing, Allied Blenders and Distillers said as part of the due diligence process to buy the stake in Good Barrel “certain commercial considerations emerged, which required renegotiation of specific terms”.
It added: “Despite best efforts, the parties could not reach mutually acceptable terms and hence the board has decided not to proceed with the proposed acquisition.""
Good Barrel, established in 2021, is known for manufacturing alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, with Rock Paper Rum as its flagship brand.
Allied Blenders and Distillers said the withdrawal of the transaction will not have a material or financial impact, as the deal was still in the preliminary stages.
The company added it “will continue to explore both organic and inorganic growth opportunities”.
Two months ago, Allied Blenders and Distillers acquired UTO Asia, a subsidiary of Dutch spirits group Herman Jansen, for €1.2m ($1.4m).
The acquisition aimed to offer Allied Blenders and Distillers “worldwide rights” and “title interest” in brandy and whisky brands Mansion House and Savoy Club, excluding ten markets.
However, the Bombay High Court has prohibited the company from selling these brands in India due to an ongoing commercial suit.
The legal suit dates back to 2009, involving Herman Jansen and Indian distiller Tilaknagar Industries over brand rights.
Herman Jansen sought a temporary injunction against Tilaknagar to prevent the use of the brands 'Mansion House' and 'Savoy Club'.
Allied Blenders and Distillers listed on the Indian stock exchanges last year.
Financially, Allied Blenders and Distillers reported its “highest ever” profit after tax (PAT) in its 2025 fiscal year, which ended on 31 March.
Total income rose to Rs80.94bn ($929m), a 5.5% increase from FY24.
PAT reached Rs1.95bn compared with Rs20m in the previous year.
Commenting on the results released on 15 May, Alok Gupta, managing director of Allied Blenders and Distillers, said: “We are pleased to report third consecutive quarter of robust performance following our IPO.
""The consistent positive outcome of our four-point transformation agenda – premiumisation, supply chain security, margin enhancement, and enhance governance framework – is demonstrated in these results, validating both our strategic direction and its effective execution.”",b28d3294ef1e3715056aa9999d97025e,trafilatura,2733,0

LONDON (Reuters) - What matters in U.S. and global markets today
By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Finance and Markets
Subdued world markets eyed proposals for a Ukraine-Russia summit with caution, while updates on the shaky U.S. housing market on Tuesday and this week's Federal Reserve conference in Jackson Hole dominated thinking.
European stock benchmarks nudged higher and the defence sector slipped after U.S. President Donald Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy that Washington would help guarantee Ukraine's security in any peace deal to end Russia's war. Germany said Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin would meet within the next two weeks. In response, the euro firmed against the dollar, crude oil ticked lower and gold edged up.
* U.S. Treasuries have been on the backfoot since the alarming U.S. producer price report last week, with 30-year bond yields holding just shy of 4.95% on Tuesday and the two-to-30 year yield curve gap firming above 117 basis points for the first time since January 2022. With July housing starts on the diary later, along with a retail update from Home Depot, Fed futures currently price just over an 80% chance of a quarter point rate cut next month. Fed Chair Jerome Powell gives his keynote Jackson Hole speech on Friday.
* S&P Global on Monday affirmed its 'AA+' U.S. sovereign credit rating and assigned it a stable outlook, saying the revenue from Trump's tariffs will offset the deficit hit from his recent fiscal bill and the budget gap would average 6% of GDP during the 2025-2028 period - down from 7.5% in 2024. Wall Street stock futures were flat ahead of Tuesday's bell after ending little changed yesterday, with Chinese and Japanese stocks in the red earlier.
* Palo Alto Networks forecast revenue and profit above estimates on Monday, betting on growing demand for its artificial intelligence-powered cybersecurity solutions - sending its shares up 5% in extended trading.

President Lu Weibing shed more light on the company’s expansion plans after reporting a 31% rise in quarterly revenue, riding the successful launch of its second EV over the summer. That helped counter slowing demand for smartphones.

Xiaomi has previously described ambitions to go global, though it’s never specified a target market. While Europe is a common destination for Chinese EV makers seeking to tap a more lucrative arena, considering they can often sell their cars with higher margins there, they do face punitive tariffs.
Were Xiaomi to export its EVs to Europe, it would likely be subject to tariffs of up to 48%, including a base 10% import duty and additional countervailing levies of around 35% to 38%. Those measures were imposed by the European Union in response to what it deems unfair state subsidies provided to Chinese EV makers, which the bloc argues distorts market competition and threatens local manufacturers.
Chinese EV makers also face tariffs of 100% if they want to sell their cars in the US. That’s effectively shut them entirely out of the market.

Regardless, strong demand for the YU7 sport utility vehicle, which co-founder Lei Jun released at the end of June, is propelling Xiaomi’s $10 billion gamble on the increasingly crowded EV arena. The company aims to become one of the world’s top five carmakers within 15 to 20 years, despite a production crunch that’s testing its ability to scale up. Wait times for the SUV have stretched to more than a year.
“The business model we have developed in China can also apply in overseas market when we get into Europe,” Lu told analysts on a call. “We’re doing the research and preparation. So far we have not got the specific product plan yet.”
Revenue climbed to 116 billion yuan ($16.2 billion) in the June quarter, just edging past average analyst estimates. The tech giant delivered 81,302 cars, taking the total to more than 157,000 in the first half — on track to surpass 2024’s haul. But smartphones — its original and largest business — slid 2.1% and missed the average projection by about 5%.",be93894f6caf289180e193bc2995c9a9,trafilatura,2727,0

Realty Income owns a high-quality portfolio of income-generating real estate.
-
The REIT has a strong financial profile.
-
It has delivered reliable and resilient growth that should continue.
Many retirees face a shortfall between their Social Security benefits, savings, and actual income needs. One study found this gap to be as high as 33% for the average U.S. household. As a result, current and future retirees must find additional income sources to live comfortably.
Realty Income (NYSE: O) is an excellent choice for those seeking additional income. The real estate investment trust (REIT) owns a reliable and high-quality real estate portfolio that generates stable rental income. This enables the REIT to pay a steadily rising monthly dividend currently yielding 5.5%. Here's why Realty Income is a safe way to supplement your retirement income.
A high-quality portfolio
Realty Income's foundation is its high-quality real estate portfolio. The REIT owns over 15,600 properties in the U.S. and parts of Europe. Its portfolio includes retail (approximately 80% of its rent), industrial (15%), gaming (3%), and other properties, such as data centers (2%), net leased to over 1,600 tenants across 90+ industries. About 90% of rent comes from tenants in recession-resistant industries and those less affected by e-commerce, such as grocery stores, home improvement centers, and convenience stores.
The company invests in properties secured by long-term net leases that provide predictable rental income because tenants cover all property operating costs, including routine maintenance, real estate taxes, and building insurance. Most leases raise rents at a low single-digit rate each year. As a result, Realty Income's existing portfolio delivers steadily rising rental income.
A fortress financial profile
Realty Income pairs its strong real estate portfolio with a robust financial profile. The REIT pays about 75% of its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) in dividends each year. This cushion will enable it to retain over $750 million of excess free cash flow in 2025 to fund new investments.
The company also has a strong A3/A- bond rating (its credit rating is in the top 10 within the REIT sector) backed by a low leverage ratio, and it has ample liquidity. This financial strength enhances Realty Income's ability to continue expanding its real estate portfolio.
Resilient and consistent growth
Realty Income's portfolio has demonstrated its durability over the decades. Since completing its public market listing in 1994, the REIT had only one year (2009) when it failed to grow its adjusted FFO per share. Overall, it has grown adjusted FFO per share at a more than 5% compound annual rate.",8c7b4b67e9ac654f235a78e6cb84e9fd,trafilatura,2721,0

The new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) will be the only choice, apart from the standard repayment plan, for new borrowers as well as existing borrowers who reconsolidate or take out new loans.

In this case, however, having fewer options may be a good thing for borrowers. “By streamlining options down to just RAP and the standard plan for new borrowers, the government is addressing the confusion that’s historically made it difficult for borrowers to make informed decisions,” said Ken Ruggiero, CEO of Ascent Funding.
Also see what to do if you’re falling behind on federal student loan payments, according to Suze Orman.
RAP Loan Terms Borrowers Should Understand
Borrowers who choose RAP will make payments ranging from 1% to 10% of their income, with a minimum monthly payment of $10. Ruggiero called the plan “notably flexible.” There are also built-in principal subsidies of up to $50 per month and built-in interest subsidies to prevent rising balances, which has been an issue with past IDR plans.
Loans will be forgiven after 30 years of qualifying payments. Payments through RAP may also qualify for Public Student Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) after 10 years of payments for workers who qualify.

Should You Choose RAP?
Although RAP offers some advantages, “that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better for every borrower,” per Ruggiero.
Younger borrowers with lower income may find lower monthly payments with RAP. As their capacity to pay increases, payments will increase. “Borrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) should know that RAP-qualifying payments count toward forgiveness, which is a big plus,” Ruggiero said.
If you already have a high income or if you have a smaller loan balance and just want to pay it off as fast as possible, a standard plan might be more cost-effective in the long run.
“Factors like age, income trajectory, loan size and how long someone’s been repaying all matter in this decision,” Ruggiero said.
Consult With a Professional
If you’re facing student loan debt now or planning to take out loans to finance your education, you still have nearly a year before making any decisions about RAP or the standard repayment plan. However, “it’s smart to start evaluating your options now,” Ruggiero said.",edd321d03d10ffdcf09621ad87e80182,trafilatura,2708,0

Economic data releases and earnings
Despite the Federal Reserve restricting the economy; a new, protectionist trade regime; and seemingly never-ending uncertainty, the American consumer is still powering through it.
At several key moments over the past year, as sentiment flagged and talk of a coming slowdown grew louder, spending data acted like a jolt of energy, a slap in the face of pessimistic readings of the economic outlook.
But viewing the resilience of the American consumer through the lens of a K-shaped economy, observing the sharp divergence between top earners and the rest of the population, helps explain why those things can be happening at the same time.
This week will deliver more insight into the strength of the consumer via scouting reports from the other side of the cash register.
Retail giants Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Target (TGT), and Walmart (WMT) are reporting earnings and outlooks, helping shed light on the impacts of tariffs and how households are coping with pricing pressures. Areas of growth or stagnation will also hold importance, as the shopping dynamics of putting off purchases, bargain hunting, and trading down can signal how consumers are interpreting and reacting to their own financial standing.
Even when spending in aggregate increases, drilling down into who and where the boosts are coming from and going to can be revealing. Total credit and debit card spending per household increased nearly 2% in July, compared to a year ago, according to a new report from the Bank of America Institute. But, while that figure looks encouraging, the report noted that a widening gap has opened up between lower-income households and higher-income cohorts and ""is the largest since February 2021.""
Results in other sectors have already shown elements of unbothered consumption on the one hand and more cautious spending on the other. Airlines, for instance, showcased a tidy contrast between affluent consumers and everyone else. At Delta (DAL), premium ticket sales rose 5%, while main cabin revenue fell 5% last quarter, underscoring the economic split.
A paper published last week by the Boston Fed, examining the resilience of consumer spending since 2022, supports the K-shaped framing.
""Credit card data indicate that since 2022, spending by higher-income consumers has remained resilient and has been driving growth in aggregate spending,"" the paper found. ""By contrast, spending growth of low-income consumers has not been as strong.""",3006c28bb2bcba4fbc9e0641b192c64f,trafilatura,2678,0

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) crossed a historic milestone in the second quarter of 2025, reporting its first-ever billion-dollar quarter. Revenue surged nearly 48% year-over-year to approximately $1.004 billion, easily beating Wall Street’s expectations of roughly $937–940 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.16, topping consensus forecasts of $0.14, while adjusted operating margins climbed to an impressive 46%.
Free cash flow soared to $569 million, representing a margin of 57%, and the company posted GAAP net income of about $327 million, or a 33% net margin. Palantir’s Rule of 40 score — a key measure of growth and profitability — hit a remarkable 94%, underlining its rare balance of aggressive expansion and strong operational efficiency. The company’s balance sheet remains robust, with a cash and short-term investment reserve of approximately $6 billion.
More News from Barchart
A closer look at the numbers reveals that Palantir’s U.S. business is powering much of the momentum. Domestic revenue surged 68% to $733 million, with U.S. commercial revenue skyrocketing 93% to $306 million and U.S. government revenue climbing 53% to $426 million. Internationally, Palantir continues to serve a growing base of major commercial clients in Europe and high-value government partners outside the United States, though CEO Alex Karp made clear that the company’s most transformative work is occurring in its home market.
Total Contract Value (TCV) rose 140% year-over-year to $2.3 billion, driven in part by a 222% jump in U.S. commercial TCV to $843 million. Off the back of these results, Palantir raised its full-year guidance to $4.14-4.15 billion, with U.S. commercial revenues now expected to surpass $1.3 billion — an increase of over 85% from the prior year.
On the company’s earnings call, Karp delivered one of his most emphatic visions to date, framing Palantir’s success not just as a business story, but as part of a broader national transformation. He pointed to key offerings such as Ontology, Foundry, and Maven as being “on the front line” of what he called “a perfect time for Palantir” and “a revolution in The United States of America.” While acknowledging the importance of Palantir’s international partnerships, Karp cast the company’s mission as fundamentally American, fueled by advances in AI, semiconductors, and large language models. He described Palantir as “anomalously bullish” on every facet of U.S. life, with a particular focus on the country’s blue-collar workforce.",96cf6ebc69e824d39277546937149e4a,trafilatura,2662,0

The legislation comes after thousands of homeowners lost their residences in January's historic wildfires in Southern California. Following such a loss, insurers send checks typically made out jointly to both the homeowner and the mortgage lender or servicer. The lender will then deposit the funds into an escrow account, where it earns interest that the lender could keep.
California Assemblymember John Harabedian, D-Pasadena, the author of the bill, said he is fighting to change that after hearing from his constituents about their struggles getting insurance payouts released from their lenders.
""If the homeowners are not given their money right away, the interest on that money, which the banks and the mortgage lenders are holding onto and earning [interest on], should be paid to the homeowner, not the banks,"" Harabedian told CNBC. ""The more we looked into this, the more we realized that this was a huge problem across the board.""
The bill will now head to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk to be signed into law.
After a disaster, insurance settlement checks can often be held in an escrow account by the mortgage servicing company until rebuilding is complete, which can take months or even years. During this time, the funds can accrue significant interest that the servicing company could keep.
Now, the homeowner will be guaranteed at least 2% interest on those funds.
The bill will apply to both existing insurance payouts that are still being held in escrow accounts and to any new escrow accounts that are opened following a catastrophic event. For any funds already in an escrow account, interest at 2% simple per annum will begin accruing on the bill's effective date.
Newsom, who sponsored the state legislation, said homeowners rebuilding after a disaster need all the support they can get.
""This is a commonsense solution that ensures that [homeowners] receive every resource available to help them recover and rebuild,"" Newsom said in a statement in February when the bill was first introduced.
California law had already required lenders to pay homeowners interest on escrowed funds for property taxes and insurance, but it didn't explicitly include insurance payments. The bill aims to close that loophole.
""It's sad that we have to introduce a bill to make the banks and the mortgage lenders do the right thing, but this is about homeowners getting all the financial help that they can throughout this difficult period,"" Harabedian said.",7410ff4b312ec2ca9fca56eef4699ed8,trafilatura,2661,0

The initiative positions the Dominican Republic as an emerging hub for advanced manufacturing and integration into the global semiconductor supply chain.
The ENFIS1 strategy is a robust roadmap, backed by a coalition of national and international key actors. It was developed with the support of the Dominican Association of Free Zones (ADOZONA), the Association of Foreign Investment Companies (ASIEX), and the Instituto Tecnologico de Santo Domingo (INTEC). International expertise also played a decisive role, with contributions from mySilicon Compass - a consulting firm founded by architects of the U.S. CHIPS Act - led by Ian Steff, former U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce, Auffant Global Advisory, led by Dr. Marino Auffant, the Industrial Performance Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), through Dr. Timothy Sturgeon, Purdue University and its Purdue Applied Research Institute (PARI), as well as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Together, these actors provided strategic, technical, and institutional input, ensuring the strategy’s credibility and long-term sustainability.
The strategy responds to global shifts in semiconductor supply chains, nearshoring trends, and the need for resilient, diversified production networks. With over US$ 417 million in FDI in free zones and more than US$ 8.6 billion in exports in 2024, the Dominican Republic is leveraging its proven manufacturing base and strategic location to enter key segments of the semiconductor value chain.
The strategy is built on five interconnected pillars designed to create a robust ecosystem for semiconductor investment:
-
Industrial Development
Upgrading infrastructure, clustering industries, and attracting suppliers in ATP, PCB, and passive components. -
Governance and Policy
Streamlining regulations, creating a National Advanced Manufacturing Cabinet, and aligning national strategies. -
Workforce and Human Capital
Expanding STEM education, technical training, and international partnerships (e.g., Purdue University). -
Country Promotion
Rebranding the DR as a high-tech destination, increasing global visibility, and hosting a Global Semiconductor Summit. -
Strategic Partnerships
Engaging semiconductor firms, industry associations (SEMI, SIA), and academic institutions to drive innovation and integration.",9a011adf5bdcb324557c9baeef88c5bb,trafilatura,2659,0

The claim was filed with the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal on 14 August 2025.
ACSO, a UK body dedicated to consumer rights, alleges that from August 2019 to August 2025, customers who bought items from third-party sellers on Amazon's platform were overcharged due to the company's price-parity policies.
The group contends that Amazon's price parity policies restrict third-party sellers from setting lower prices for their products on alternative online platforms.
According to ACSO, this practice shields Amazon from competitive pricing with other e-commerce entities, resulting in increased costs for UK consumers.
ACSO asserts these consumers may be entitled to reimbursement for the excess amounts paid.
ACSO founder and executive director Matthew Maxwell-Scott stated: “Millions of people in the UK make purchases on Amazon every day. Despite the company’s assurances that it is above all else 'customer-obsessed', we consider there are strong grounds to argue that UK consumers have paid higher prices because of Amazon's pricing policies.
“ACSO is therefore bringing collective proceedings against Amazon to ensure that consumers can obtain redress for the considerable losses they have suffered. Collective actions such as these are an excellent way for consumers to exercise their rights and for anti-competitive corporate behaviour to be challenged.”
Amazon's pricing strategies have previously been scrutinised by competition authorities worldwide.
The international law firm Stephenson Harwood, led by partner Genevieve Quierin, is representing ACSO. The legal team includes Tim Knight, Alex Athanasopoulos, Katelyn Iacono, Mikaela Hristova and Jay Kim.
Genevieve Quierin stated: “Amazon appears to have circumvented previous regulatory interventions targeting its pricing policies and is now implementing policies which we contend are anti-competitive, to the detriment of UK consumers. We are grateful that ACSO has instructed Stephenson Harwood, and we look forward to securing compensation for the millions of consumers who have been affected by Amazon's alleged anti-competitive conduct.”
Ben Lask KC, Luke Kelly and Jenn Lawrence of Monckton Chambers, along with The Brattle Group, have also been instructed by ACSO to support the collective proceedings.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
On ""The Ramsey Show,"" Janelle from Raleigh, North Carolina, said she and her ex are four months behind on a $465,000 mortgage. She explained that she had built up $25,000 in debt and now faces possible foreclosure.
The loan, still in both names, has become the centerpiece of a financial and legal standoff. In June, co-hosts George Kamel and Ken Coleman heard Janelle describe the fallout and ask what to do next.
Mortgage Still Standing After Breakup
Janelle said she and her ex bought the property together, but they split about a year later. She moved out and began renting elsewhere, while both names remained listed on the mortgage and deed.

""We're four months behind,"" she told Kamel and Coleman, adding that they had tried to sell the home but still have not found a buyer. The outstanding balance remains at $465,000.
Coleman noted the legal stakes, saying, ""You are legally obligated to pay that [mortgage], whether you've moved out or not. Her ex had initially covered payments but eventually stopped after she left. Janelle also halted contributions, explaining that rent and other expenses left her strapped.
Considering A Short Sale
""We're in the process of asking the mortgage company for a short sale to see if that's even possible,"" Janelle said, noting $12,000 in missed payments and no offers on the table.
Meanwhile, Kamel warned that catching up on payments is critical to avoiding foreclosure. He advised halting 401(k) contributions and unnecessary spending, using all available funds to cover the arrears.
""You need to act like everything is on fire,"" he said, adding that either a quick sale — even at a lower price — or additional income could be the best path forward.

A Citigroup Inc. index that tracks the relative number of US earnings-per-share estimate upgrades versus downgrades is at its highest since December 2021. And the trend is just as strong among companies that recently issued their own outlooks. A gauge of forward guidance that compares corporate forecasts with the Wall Street consensus is hovering at its second-highest level in nearly four years, Bloomberg Intelligence data show.

Princeton Plans New Budget Cuts as Pressure From Trump Builds
The brighter outlook marks a dramatic turnaround from earlier in the year, when anxiety over President Donald Trump’s trade policies reached a peak and sent that same gauge of corporate guidance to the lowest in a decade.
There is one caveat to all the rosiness, however: It may take months before Corporate America begins to feel the full hit from Trump’s trade wars on its supply chains and profit margins.
“The sheer number of ‘what ifs’ caused analysts to reduce earnings estimates months ago on tariff fears,” said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group. “Now there’s more belief that this won’t be a crushing blow to the economy as once feared. But the catch is everyone is waiting to see what happens with tariffs in the coming months.”
That may help explain why the full-year outlook still hasn’t completely recovered to what it was. Analysts’ earnings estimates imply growth for all of 2025 will be 9.2%, down from nearly 13% at the start of the year. Wall Street sees companies in the S&P 500 earning around $269 per share in 2025 — below the $273 seen at the start of the year and a projection of $279 a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.
And there’s no guarantee the upward momentum will continue. Sell-side analysts and companies could guide forecasts lower in coming months, according to Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management.
Such a scenario played out during Trump’s first term: Though the US trade war with China heated up early in 2018, the hit to corporate profits only showed up about a year later. And Giacoumakis noted that the economy had the tailwind of big corporate tax cuts during that period.",1066e9f62648847873c841dc95e2c310,trafilatura,2625,0

And some strategists see this rotation as an early sign that an even healthier market dynamic could be emerging.
Scott Chronert, managing director of US equity strategy at Citi, sees this broader participation as framing out ""two parallel paths"" for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) — one led by the AI-fueled growth giants and the other driven by more traditional sectors tied to the economy.
""The simple answer is that we see ongoing Mega Cap Growth participation, if not leadership, but with fundamental and performance broadening creating a more durable structural setup,"" he said in a note on Friday.
""The healthiest path to higher index levels is a combination of Growth/Tech leadership persisting but with other areas of the market additive more so than has been the case this past year.""
Data from Bespoke Investment Group published Friday noted investors last week showed signs of moving out of 2025’s biggest winners and into less-loved pockets of the market.
Over the middle three trading days last week, Bespoke's work found stocks in the worst-performing decile this year among S&P 1500 companies were up an average of 6.7%; the best performers were up less than 1% over the same period.
""When momentum names stall or sell-off, it can really hit the major indices hard if no other areas of the market are there to pick up the slack,"" Bespoke said. ""But [last] week, the year’s worst performers finally saw some buying interest as investors rotated across the market instead of out of it.""
Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research added that rising expectations for a September Fed rate cut helped fuel the shift, sparking a rotation from growth to value and from large caps to small- and mid-cap stocks.
""We certainly welcome such a broadening,"" he wrote in a Sunday note to clients.
'Significant headwinds' remain
Sean Simonds, US equities strategist at UBS, described the current broadening setup as ""a mixed bag"" on Monday, noting that AI-driven momentum is starting to spill into other adjacent areas like software, power, and re-shoring.
Simonds added that after a wave of downward earnings revisions earlier this year, earnings breadth has also shown signs of improving. However, areas such as consumer and healthcare remain weaker, even if the outlook there has turned ""less negative.""",4feccacc4e91df32c20ca8fbdab20ecc,trafilatura,2623,0

Below are major AI investments SoftBank has announced so far.
INTEL
On August 18, SoftBank announced a $2 billion equity investment in Intel, saying the deal reflected its belief that chip manufacturing and supply would expand further in the U.S., and the U.S. company would play a critical role.
STARGATE
Stargate is a joint venture between SoftBank, ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, and Oracle. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the project in January, saying that the companies would invest up to $500 billion.
On August 7, SoftBank CFO Yoshimitsu Goto said the project, for which SoftBank is leading financing, had been delayed by longer than expected negotiations with other parties and decisions on sites.
Goto said at the time SoftBank remained committed to its target of building $500 billion worth of data centres over four years and the banks involved in the project financing, including Japan's ""megabanks"" and major U.S. lenders, had shown positive interest in the scheme.
SoftBank has yet to release details on what kinds of returns its financing of the Stargate project could generate. The extent of third-party investment will determine what other financing tools, such as bank loans and debt issuance, it may have to deploy.
On August 18, Taiwan's Foxconn said that it planned to manufacture data centre equipment with SoftBank at the Taiwanese firm's former electric vehicle factory in Ohio as part of the Stargate project.
OPENAI
SoftBank is leading a $40 billion funding round for OpenAI. It has until the end of 2025 to fund its $22.5 billion portion, although the remainder has been subscribed, according to a source familiar with the matter.
PERPLEXITY AI
The three-year-old startup that operates an AI-powered search engine has raised about $1 billion in funding so far from investors including Nvidia and SoftBank. It was last valued at $14 billion.
AMPERE COMPUTING
SoftBank announced a $6.5 billion deal in March to acquire Ampere Computing, a U.S. chip designer startup founded by the former president of Intel.
Ampere makes data centre central processing unit chips based on computing architecture from SoftBank's majority-owned Arm Holdings that are used by firms such as Oracle in their cloud computing infrastructure.
GRAPHCORE
In 2024, SoftBank bought the British AI chipmaker for an undisclosed sum.

What Analysts Are Saying
Altcoin Sherpa described LINK as “one of the best coins right now,” pointing to chart strength that could carry toward $30. He explained that round-number levels like $30 often act as psychological barriers where sellers take profits, so traders should be cautious about chasing the move too late.
Zach Humphries, another analyst, argued that LINK remains “very undervalued” at current prices. He emphasized that Chainlink underpins much of decentralized finance by delivering the price feeds and cross-chain services many protocols rely on. From his perspective, the token should be treated as a bet on critical infrastructure rather than just another speculative asset.
Milk Road highlighted the strong trading backdrop. The publication noted a 66% surge in 24-hour trading volume and said LINK’s clean breakout above $24.50 added conviction for momentum traders. They tied the bullish tone back to two key August developments: the launch of Chainlink’s new onchain reserve and its data partnership with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
Chainlink Reserve
On Aug. 7, Chainlink introduced the Chainlink Reserve, a smart contract treasury designed to steadily accumulate LINK over time. The mechanism works by converting the project’s revenue — paid in stablecoins, gas tokens, or fiat — into LINK and then locking those tokens onchain for multiple years.
The conversion process, called Payment Abstraction, automates this workflow. It uses Chainlink’s own services — price feeds for fair conversion rates, automation to trigger transactions, and CCIP to consolidate fees from different chains — before swapping into LINK via decentralized exchanges.
Chainlink says the Reserve has already accumulated more than $1 million worth of LINK, with no withdrawals planned for several years. It also earmarks 50% of fees from staking-secured services such as Smart Value Recapture to feed the Reserve, creating a recurring stream of inflows.
The initiative serves two strategic purposes.
First, it strengthens the link between adoption and token demand by ensuring usage revenues convert directly into LINK.
Second, it provides transparency: anyone can view inflows, balances, and the timelock at reserve.chain.link.
Chainlink has framed the Reserve as one piece of a broader economic design that includes user-fee growth and cost reductions via the Chainlink Runtime Environment.",479517705414e8961b7ad086956bc4f4,trafilatura,2610,0

The car is the first to have been developed for a new AUDI-branded intelligent electric family of models under a strategic partnership between Audi and its Chinese partner SAIC.
AUDI (all characters capitalised) is Audi’s new China-only brand. Audi said last year that the new brand AUDI – without the four rings logo but spelled in four capital letters – signals both the connection to and differentiation from the sister brand. Gernot Döllner, Audi CEO said: “By launching this new brand for electric and intelligent models in China, Audi is breaking new ground to tap into new and more tech-savvy customer segments.”
Buyers in China can now preorder the AUDI E5 Sportback model, with the first vehicles planned to be delivered in September.
Fermín Soneira, CEO of the China-dedicated AUDI brand, said: “Every vehicle from the AUDI brand embodies the best of both worlds: iconic design, premium quality, technical precision, emotional driving dynamics, combined with China’s cutting-edge technology, innovation and digital ecosystem. With pre-sales now launched alongside production, the E5 Sportback enters the market fully equipped to deliver an uncompromising experience for Chinese customers. This milestone marks the beginning of a new era of ICVs.”
Dedicated production facility for AUDI models
To manufacture AUDI models, the two partners have established a dedicated production facility on the existing SAIC Volkswagen site in Anting, Shanghai. Initially, around 700 employees will produce the AUDI E5 Sportback there. Two additional AUDI models are scheduled to follow within the next two years. The manufacturing operations in Anting are defined by a high degree of automation, state-of-the-art technologies – including machine learning for quality monitoring – and a fully digitalized production management system.
The four-door AUDI E5 Sportback, is described as a fully electric fastback, combining dynamic proportions, power outputs of up to 579 kW and a maximum range of 770km. Four distinct powertrains offer rear-wheel or quattro drive for a ‘dynamic driving experience’, accelerating from 0-100km/h in up to 3.4 seconds.
The car is built on a new Advanced Digitized Platform (ADP) and offers ‘next-generation connected vehicle functionality and full-car over the air updates’.

The S&P 500 fell 0.6% for a third straight loss, though it remains near its all-time high set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite slumped 1.5%.
The heaviest weight on the market was Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI. It sank 3.5%.
Another AI darling, Palantir Technologies, dropped 9.4% for the largest loss in the S&P 500. It’s seen bets build up sharply that its stock price will drop, according to S3 Partners. Only Meta Platforms has seen a bigger increase this year in what’s called “short interest,” where traders essentially bet a stock’s price will fall. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, sank 2.1%.
Criticism has been rising that stock prices across Wall Street have shot too high, too fast since hitting a bottom in April and have become too expensive. Palantir’s stock came into Tuesday with a tremendous gain of 130% for the year so far.
One way companies can make their stock prices look less expensive is to deliver growth in profits. Palo Alto Networks rose 3.1% after reporting earnings and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations. The cybersecurity company also gave forecasts for profit and revenue in its upcoming fiscal year that were above Wall Street’s.
Home Depot’s gain of 3.2%, meanwhile, was the biggest reason the Dow did better than other indexes.

The S&P 500 fell 0.6% for a third straight loss, though it remains near its all-time high set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 10 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite slumped 1.5%.
The heaviest weight on the market was Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI. It sank 3.5%.
Another AI darling, Palantir Technologies, dropped 9.4% for the largest loss in the S&P 500. It’s seen bets build up sharply that its stock price will drop, according to S3 Partners. Only Meta Platforms has seen a bigger increase this year in what’s called “short interest,” where traders essentially bet a stock’s price will fall. Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, sank 2.1%.
Criticism has been rising that stock prices across Wall Street have shot too high, too fast since hitting a bottom in April and have become too expensive. Palantir’s stock came into Tuesday with a tremendous gain of 130% for the year so far.
One way companies can make their stock prices look less expensive is to deliver growth in profits. Palo Alto Networks rose 3.1% after reporting earnings and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations. The cybersecurity company also gave forecasts for profit and revenue in its upcoming fiscal year that were above Wall Street’s.
Home Depot’s gain of 3.2%, meanwhile, was the biggest reason the Dow did better than other indexes. The retailer reported results for the latest quarter that were a bit short of what analysts expected, but it delivered growth in revenue and stood by its prior forecasts for revenue and profit over the full year.

Warren Buffett, widely regarded as one of the most successful investors of all time, is well-known not only for his extraordinary financial acumen but also for his straightforward and insightful commentary on management practices. His observation that managers often discard performance metrics when results falter, rather than addressing managerial shortcomings, remains especially relevant in contemporary business and investment circles. Companies often push the boundary between hyping themselves up and remaining compliant with SEC regulations, but this can distort the actual reality of the business.
In his 1982 shareholders' letter, Buffett famously pointed out how the goal post can constantly shift depending on the performance of the business. Buffett explained this by saying, “Yardsticks seldom are discarded while yielding favorable readings. But when results deteriorate, most managers favor disposition of the yardstick rather than disposition of the manager.”

Some managers might focus on net income, while others focus on EBITA or even revenue growth. Buffett is saying that whichever metric managers choose to focus on often depends on which one is doing the best. He further clarified that point, saying, “Managers faced with deterioration often prefer a more flexible measurement system: just shoot the arrow of business performance into a blank canvas and then carefully draw the bullseye around the implanted arrow.”
Buffett, born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska, began his investment career early, famously purchasing his first stock at the age of 11. Over the decades, he transformed Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) (BRK.A) from a struggling textile manufacturer into a global conglomerate valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars, earning him the nickname ""Oracle of Omaha."" His disciplined investment strategy and ethical approach to management have solidified his authority on topics concerning corporate governance and managerial practices.
Buffett’s insight into managerial tendencies to change performance metrics resonates deeply because it reflects a common, yet problematic, practice within many companies. By altering or even discarding yardsticks of evaluation, managers might temporarily conceal performance deficiencies. However, Buffett argues that this action delays necessary managerial changes, allowing underlying issues to persist and ultimately impacting long-term organizational performance.",e9377b3ea0c3274b7a0b13ee1ef1538a,trafilatura,2589,0

See on the daily bar chart for November soybean futures that prices have rallied from the August low and last week hit a six-week high. See, too, at the bottom of the chart that the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator is in a bullish posture as the blue MACD line is above the red trigger line and both lines are trending higher.

Fundamentally, the soybean futures market last week got a friendly USDA monthly supply and demand report, a bullish monthly crush report, and it appears traders have already factored into present prices a bumper U.S. soybean crop to be harvested this fall. Icing on the cake for the bean bulls in the coming weeks would be better U.S.-China trade relations that would likely mean better Chinese demand for U.S. soybeans.
A move in November soybean futures above chart resistance at last week’s high of $10.49 1/4 would give the bulls fresh power and it would also become a buying opportunity. The upside price objective would be $11.25, or above. Technical support, for which to place a protective sell stop just below, is located at $10.20.

Here is what the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has said about futures trading (and I agree 100%):
Trading commodity futures and options is not for everyone. IT IS A VOLATILE, COMPLEX AND RISKY BUSINESS. Before you invest any money in futures or options contracts, you should consider your financial experience, goals and financial resources, and know how much you can afford to lose above and beyond your initial payment to a broker. You should understand commodity futures and options contracts and your obligations in entering into those contracts. You should understand your exposure to risk and other aspects of trading by thoroughly reviewing the risk disclosure documents your broker is required to give you.

PricewaterhouseCoopers is acquiring “substantially all the assets” of Bay Area–based fintech consultancy Kunai, a move the Big Four firm says will help banks quickly test its technology modernization solutions, giving CFOs early evidence of return on investment to present to internal decision makers. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Kunai specializes in AI, automation, cloud engineering and core banking systems, with a team that includes mid- to senior-level engineers, Sandeep Sood, the company’s founder, told CFO Dive. Through the acquisition, PwC is angling to offer faster delivery of tech solutions, giving decision makers tangible evidence of results before committing full budgets to transformations.
CFOs are at the forefront of “approving large-scale change for their financial institutions,” amid a rising urgency to upgrade legacy infrastructure and in the face of talent shortages, said Sean Viergutz, a partner at PwC who leads its banking and capital markets advisory business. “A CFO will care, because we can be outcome based and say, ‘We’ve done this before. We know we can deliver this for you.’”
Many of the systems behind transformation efforts, including general ledgers, core banking and loan accounting platforms, can fall within a CFO’s scope, Viergutz said.
Financial institutions are also moving critical functions to the cloud, modernizing payment platforms and embedding AI into workflows.
The rush to upgrade legacy infrastructure often hinges on quick board approvals, and Kunai’s rapid-prototyping approach can give CFOs the early evidence they need to secure the green light, he added.
“We’re going to see much more often, much more frequently, CFOs demand[ing] to see a prototype…[and] doing so in a way where they have not committed millions and millions of dollars [in] spend ahead of time,” Sood said.
Rolling out tech faster
While small- to mid-sized financial institutions are rushing to update old infrastructure, PwC also sees Kunai’s capabilities as valuable to larger financial institutions. In particular, many are hobbled by lengthy request for proposal (RFP) processes for digital transformation, and Kunai’s model could help modernize them, challenging outdated assumptions and helping firms execute faster, Sood said.
“We can do this work with a much smaller army of people in less time,” he said. “We’re challenging the parameters of the RFPs… built for an older era of offshore outsourcing.”",0c396b0b31fc83eaefc3cab60111eccd,trafilatura,2584,0

He proposed two ways investors can tap into that equity, using financing offered by Prosper. Even those only scratch the surface of how creative real estate investors can tap their equity.
Home Equity Loan
Often referred to as a second mortgage, home equity loans (HELs) let you take out a new mortgage loan. Technically these could be a first mortgage if you’ve already paid off your original mortgage loan.
Kimball noted that investors can use these loans to upgrade their homes. That could include adding an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). Homeowners could then rent out that extra unit to cover some or even all of their mortgage payments.
Alternatively, investors could use the money as a down payment for a flip or rental property.
“The interest rate is fixed, as is the monthly payment,” explained Michael Micheletti of home equity lender Unlock Technologies. “But it puts up your home as collateral, so if you can’t keep up with payments, you face foreclosure.”

Home Equity Line of Credit
Unlike HELs, which are fixed installment loans, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is rotating credit more similar to a credit card. Borrowers can draw on it as needed and pay it back at their own pace — at least until it enters the repayment phase of the loan.
Kimball pointed to the flexibility of HELOCs, the ability for investors to tap them or repay them as they like.
That flexibility could prove useful to flippers, for example, who might tap their HELOC to pull out a down payment for a flip and then pay the entire balance off as soon as they sell it. Rental investors could take a similar approach, funneling every spare dollar to pay off the HELOC balance. Then they could do it all over again to add another rental to their portfolio.
The current high interest rates could make HELOCs more attractive than refinancing. “Many homeowners right now have rates below 5% on their primary mortgage,” said Mason Whitehead of Churchill Mortgage. “For them to do a HELOC at 8% or 9% still carries a blended rate below what a new refinance mortgage rate would be.”
Just beware that HELOC rates float with current interest rates. If interest rates rise, so too would your HELOC rate.",3754c27d38ba8b9a97f5605c6e84e3b2,trafilatura,2573,0

-
GLD ETF is trading near record highs. Check live prices here.
Back in late February 2022, right as the war broke out, prices for everything from oil to wheat exploded.
The Invesco DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (NYSE:DBC)—which tracks 14 key physical commodities—rallied 15.1% in just one week, its biggest move since launching in 2006.
From December 2021 through June 2022, it beat the U.S. stock market – tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) – every month, racking up a 65% outperformance.
That surge came as the global economy exited the pandemic with pent-up demand, massive stimulus, and limited supply, particularly across energy and agricultural sectors.
The war in Ukraine only worsened supply constraints and added a geopolitical premium that traders rushed to price in.
But in commodities, high prices often cure high prices.
Energy Panic Of 2022 Is Over
Crude oil, tracked by the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO), hit $130 a barrel in March 2022—levels unseen since just before the 2008 financial crash.
U.S. natural gas prices tripled between January and August 2022, soaring from $3 to nearly $9 per million British thermal units, as Europe scrambled to replace Russian pipeline supplies.
By August 2025, those fears have faded. Oil now trades around $62, and U.S. natural gas is below $3.
Supply chains have normalized, new production has come online, and the energy panic is largely history.
Wheat, Corn And The Grain Reset
The war's impact wasn’t limited to fossil fuels. Ukraine and Russia together account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports.
When ports closed and shipping routes froze, wheat futures jumped to $13.60 per bushel in March 2022, well above the pre-war average of $7.
That spike proved temporary. Wheat, corn and soybeans are now back below their February 2022 levels. Demand adjusted, supply was rebuilt, and the war risk premium vanished.
Gold And Silver Aren't Playing Along
But not every commodity has followed the script.
Gold – tracked by SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) – is now trading around $3,330 per ounce, an 85% surge from its February 2022 price near $1,800. Silver has climbed over 60%, rising from $23 to more than $38 per ounce.
These precious metals have shrugged off the typical boom-and-bust pattern seen in other commodities. A key reason? Unlike energy or agricultural products, precious metals – and gold in particular – aren't consumed—they are stored.",a60149726805984052c20491bf724625,trafilatura,2571,0

Bitcoin's (BTC) 30-day implied volatility, as measured by Volmex's BVIV and Deribit's DVOL index, has declined sharply in recent months, hovering near two-year lows of around 36% last week, according to TradingView data.
Similarly, the CME Gold Volatility Index (GVZ), which estimates the expected 30-day volatility of returns for the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), has more than halved over the past four months, dropping to 15.22%—its lowest level since January.
The MOVE index, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of Treasury notes, has also declined in recent months, reaching a 3.5-year low of 76%.
Meanwhile, the VIX, widely regarded as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" fell below 14% last week, down substantially from its early April highs near 45%. A similar vol compression is seen in FX majors such as the EUR/USD.
Rates are 'still high'
The pronounced slide in volatility across major assets comes as central banks, particularly the Fed, are expected to deliver rate cuts from restrictive territory, rather than amid a crisis.
""Most major economies are not easing from ultra-low or emergency levels like we saw after the financial crisis or during COVID. They’re cutting from restrictive territory, meaning rates are still high enough to slow growth, and in many cases, real rates, adjusted for inflation, are still positive. That’s a big shift from the last easing cycles, and it changes how the next phase plays out,"" pseudonymous observer Endgame Macro noted on X, explaining the bull run in all assets, including cryptocurrencies and stock markets.
According to the CME's FedWatch tool, the Fed is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in September, resuming the easing cycle after an eight-month pause. Investment banking giant JPMorgan expects the benchmark borrowing cost to drop to 3.25%-3.5% by the end of the first quarter of 2026, a 100-basis-point decrease from the current 4.25%.
Per some observers, Powell could lay the groundwork for fresh easing during this Jackson Hole speech.
""The path to rate cuts may be uneven, as we have seen over the last two years, where markets have been eager for rate cuts and sometimes disappointed that the Fed has not delivered them. But we believe the direction of travel for rates is likely to remain lower,"" Angelo Kourkafas, a senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones, said in a blog post on Friday.",7a76ad632642b8917bdf7a0307f926bc,trafilatura,2570,0

(NASDAQ:CRWV) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV), the AI computing infrastructure provider, saw its shares fall by a whopping 33% in August after the firm’s second quarter earnings report saw it post a 27-cent loss, which was higher than the 21-cents analysts were expecting. The massive dip, which came just as CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)’s lockup period expired, indicated just how jittery Wall Street is about AI, as the firm had beaten analyst revenue and revenue guidance estimates. Cramer commented on an “undercurrent” driving CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)’s shares:
“And by the way we have not mentioned the undercurrent of what’s really happening on here today, which is the CoreWeave lockup. The expiration of CoreWeave, CoreWeave has absolutely been crushed. And that comes after today. Michael Entrator talking about competitive. But be aware that there’s an undercurrent there and a lot of people were in that stock and they’ve been pulling away. . . I believe that there’s going to be a lot of selling there.”
Previously, Cramer called CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) one of the biggest winners out there:
“How about big winners? Take CoreWeave, one of the biggest winners this year, gigantically from its $40 price in March. Ben Stoto and I told you to buy this one. It had the misfortune of reporting on the eve of Mr. Bullish’s deal. The numbers were nicely better than expected, befitting the boom in data centers. Unfortunately, the stock plummeted more than 20% today. Why? Because the lockup on insider selling expires tomorrow night. Although there are a bunch of short stories out there, trying to say it was a problem with demand. That’s wrong. Demand is on fire. Totally wrong narrative.

What does matter, though, is a ton of stock coming at you. Remember when I said that the underwriters are only bringing small slivers of stock to the market? Tomorrow, a huge chunk of supply loses the restraints and can start selling, and I think that CoreWeave will go lower. And if you want to buy it, buy it after that.”
While we acknowledge the potential of CRWV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Wall Street and European shares ended flat to modestly lower on Monday ahead of a key central bank gathering later in the week that likely will determine the future path of U.S. interest rate policy.
Investors also focused on the meeting between Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy and President Donald Trump. The U.S. leader said on Monday the United States would help Europe in providing security for Ukraine as part of any deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine. Both heads of state are also pushing for a trilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Financial markets, however, reacted little to news out of the Ukraine talks.
""I don't really see anything big in this or anything new or tangible,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Forex in New York.
""For Ukraine and the EU, their argument is basically Russia took Crimea and it wasn't good enough for them. Now they're trying to take more of Ukraine. And even now with all these negotiations going on, Russia is trying to make a bigger offensive push.""
The Zelenskiy meeting followed the Alaska summit with Putin, which did not result in an agreement. Trump after the Alaska talks with Putin appeared more aligned with Moscow on seeking a full peace deal instead of a ceasefire first.
The S&P 500 closed little changed on Monday, but remained within striking distance of its all-time high hit on Friday.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day slightly higher after reaching its strongest level since March last week, which left the MSCI All Country World Index also slightly lower, but not far from its record high touched on Friday.
Earlier in the Asian session, indexes in Japan and Taiwan hit record peaks, while a gauge of Chinese stocks reached its highest level in a decade.
Another key focus for the week is the Federal Reserve's August 21-23 Jackson Hole symposium, where Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak on the economic outlook and the central bank's policy framework.
U.S. rate futures market has priced in an 85% chance of a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's meeting on September 17, and is pricing further easing by December.
""Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely signal Friday that risks to employment and inflation are becoming more balanced, which would imply lowering policy rates toward neutral,"" wrote Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citi in a research note.
""But he will stop short of committing to a cut next month, awaiting jobs and inflation data for August.""",5a054aff08fbc86ffd464b1cb73d8225,trafilatura,2562,0

That era could be coming to an end.
""History would suggest there is more to go in cap-weighted dominance,"" Bank of America's head of US equity and quantitative strategy, Savita Subramanian, wrote in a note to clients.
""But if the Fed's next move is a rate cut, and if the Regime indicator is shifting to a Recovery, we think the run may be closer to done.""
Work from Subramanian's team found that the largest 50 stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) have outperformed the benchmark index by 73 percentage points since 2015. BofA noted that the last notable run of similar outperformance for the 50 largest stocks in the index came in the late 1990s, leading into the bursting of the dot-com bubble.
Following the bust, the market saw a large shift from megacap growth, leading to value and small-cap stocks outperforming during the early 2000s.
Subramanian thinks a similar tide shift might be coming to markets now.
BofA's ""regime indicator"" breaks market cycles into four parts: Recovery, Mid Cycle, Late Cycle, and Downturn.
The firm looks at a variety of factors such as corporate earnings revisions, inflation data, and economic growth projections. Currently, its work suggests markets moving from the Downturn phase — which is positive for megacaps with the most earnings power and strongest market position — to the Recovery phase.
""[Federal Reserve] easing has been accompanied by Mega caps lagging more than leading, and higher inflation should support a broadening of the S&P 500 beyond defensives/secular growth,"" Subramanian wrote.
Subramanian's call would mark a massive shift in the dominant market narrative.
Since the start of the current bull market in October 2022, large-cap technology has been the clear winner in the stock market as the artificial intelligence boom has taken hold. For much of both 2023 and 2024, a small group of technology stocks, once dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven,"" have been pulling the stock market higher.
This had also been the case since the most recent market bottom in April.

MONTREAL/TORONTO (Reuters) -Air Canada's unionized flight attendants reached an agreement with the country's largest carrier on Tuesday, ending the first strike by its cabin crew in 40 years that had upended travel plans for hundreds of thousands of passengers.
The strike that lasted nearly four days led the airline that serves about 130,000 people daily to withdraw its third-quarter and full-year earnings guidance.
The carrier said it would gradually resume operations later on Tuesday, and a full restoration may require a week or more. The union said it has completed mediation with the airline and its low-cost affiliate Air Canada Rouge.
""The Strike has ended. We have a tentative agreement we will bring forward to you,"" the Canadian Union of Public Employees said in a Facebook post.
Air Canada said some flights will be canceled over the next seven to 10 days until the schedule is stabilized, and that customers with canceled flights can choose between a refund, travel credit, or rebooking on another airline.
Mark Nasr, Air Canada's executive vice president and chief operations officer, told CBC that 5,000 employees are working to rebook customers on Air Canada and 120 other airlines.
The flight attendants walked off the job on Saturday after contract talks with the carrier failed. They had sought pay for tasks such as boarding passengers.
While details of the negotiations were not immediately released, the union said unpaid work was over.
Air Canada's flight attendants had for months argued new contracts should include pay for work done on the ground, such as boarding passengers.
""Ground pay is settled. Our flight attendants will be compensated for their time on the ground,"" Nasr told CBC.
CUPE, which represents Air Canada's 10,400 flight attendants, wanted to make gains on unpaid work that go beyond recent advances secured by their counterparts at U.S. carriers like American Airlines.
In a rare act of defiance, the union remained on strike even after the Canada Industrial Relations Board declared its action unlawful.
Their refusal to follow a federal labor board order for the flight attendants to return to work had created a three-way standoff between the company, workers, and the government.
Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu had urged both sides to consider government mediation and raised pressure on Air Canada on Monday, promising to investigate allegations of unpaid work in the airline sector.
A spokesperson for Hajdu said the probe would take six to eight weeks and then be made public.",45b30b23e65c90667920e55f57a152a3,trafilatura,2558,0

TOKYO (Reuters) -When Lip-Bu Tan stepped down from the SoftBank Group board in 2022 at a time when the Japanese company was grappling with soured investments, his parting message offered advice on how Masayoshi Son's conglomerate could strengthen its business.
Three years later, a resurgent SoftBank has made a show of support by taking a $2 billion stake in Intel as Tan, now the storied American company's CEO, seeks to turn around the embattled chipmaker.
Tan took Intel's top job in March and is driving restructuring at the company, which lost out to Nvidia in artificial intelligence chips and whose foundry business is struggling.
""This is really a vote of confidence of Masa in the turnaround materialising over the coming years,"" said Rolf Bulk, an analyst at New Street Research.
""For Intel, the investment makes it more likely that SoftBank could be a potential client to Intel in the future.""
The two men have a long-standing relationship.
""Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,"" Tan said in a statement.
In addition to his time on SoftBank's board, Tan became chairman of chip startup SambaNova, which received backing from SoftBank's Vision Fund.
""Masa is brilliant; he's a visionary. But he still needs people to provide safeguards, give him advice, and make him even more successful,"" Tan wrote in his statement on leaving the SoftBank board.
Son, 68, is known as a savvy political operator, appearing publicly with U.S. President Donald Trump twice in the months following the presidential election.
He has close relationships with leading tech entrepreneurs such as Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, in which SoftBank has a stake.
Last week Tan, 65, met with Trump, who days earlier had called on him to resign due to his ties to Chinese firms. Washington is in talks to take a 10% stake in Intel, Bloomberg has reported.
""SoftBank's investment helps but it is not what is going to move the dial for Intel,"" said Amir Anvarzadeh of Asymmetric Advisors.
""It's more to maintain this very good relationship he has with Trump,"" he said.
BACK ON THE OFFENSIVE
Son is making splashy investments again after some underperforming tech bets forced a period of retrenchment, with the conglomerate pursuing a $500 billion U.S. data centre venture with OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.
SoftBank has acquired a former electric vehicle factory from Foxconn in Ohio as it looks to advance its Stargate data center project.",31960577689666b4fa1b236618a01451,trafilatura,2555,0

Dive Brief:

Lax review by the IRS opened the way for swindlers to file bogus Forms 941 and bag tax refund checks even after agency managers were informed of the risk from such business fraud, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said.
-
TIGTA last year alerted the IRS that investigators found that the agency provided more than $93 million in fraudulent refund checks to 20 businesses, TIGTA said in a report. IRS staff failed to properly authenticate callers and enabled the wrongdoing by providing fraudsters with account, deposit and other tax information.
-
“IRS management was aware of the risk of erroneous refunds being issued,” TIGTA said, adding that “the agency did not take action to prevent the scheme.”
Dive Insight:
The report, criticizing staff who handle queries from callers to Business Security Tax and Practitioner Priority Service telephone lines, identifies errors that preceded a historic agency shakeup this year under the Trump administration.
The White House during the first half of 2025 slashed the IRS work force from 102,000 to less than 76,000, with Taxpayer Service staff shrunk by 22%, National Taxpayer Advocate Erin M. Collins said in June. The tally includes employees who accepted an early resignation offer and will stay on payroll through Sept. 30.
Roughly 26% of revenue agents and 27% of tax examiners have left the agency or intend to do so, TIGTA said in July.
“With the IRS workforce reduced by 26% and significant tax law changes on the horizon, there are risks to next year’s filing season,” Collins said in a June report.
The Trump administration, in its 2026 budget request, flagged the risks from mass cuts in taxpayer services and requested the hiring of 11,000 customer service employees.
At current staff levels, “most taxpayers would be unable to reach the IRS by phone or receive answers to questions related to tax compliance,” the IRS said. “Taxpayers that do get through will face long wait times.”
Meanwhile, the Trump administration has triggered unprecedented turnover in the agency’s top spot. During the past eight months, the administration has cycled through seven commissioners, a position with a five-year tenure.
Dozens of top career civil servants have left the IRS, with many resigning after the announcement of a memorandum of understanding on the use of tax data between the IRS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",591685580966eb91e0d85ad165ac781f,trafilatura,2543,0

Its business spans four segments: Medsurg; Dental Solutions; Health Information Systems; and Purification and Filtration, serving healthcare providers through direct sales, distribution, and digital platforms.
Shares of the Maplewood, Minnesota-based company have outperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. SOLV stock has increased 21.4% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained 16.4%. However, shares of the company have risen 8.1% on a YTD basis, lagging behind SPX's 9.7% return.
More News from Barchart
Looking closer, Solventum stock has also outpaced the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLV) 10.8% decrease over the past 52 weeks.
Shares of Solventum rose 2% on Aug. 7 after the company reported Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $1.69 and revenue of $2.2 billion, above Wall Street forecasts. Growth was driven largely by its MedSurg segment, where sales rose 4.8% to $1.2 billion, reflecting robust demand for wound care and surgical sterilization products, alongside lower expenses. Additionally, management raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $5.80 - $5.95, as easing U.S.-China tariff risks reduced expected headwinds.
For the fiscal year ending in December 2025, analysts expect SOLV’s adjusted EPS to decline 11.9% year-over-year to $5.90. The company's earnings surprise history is mixed. It topped the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters while missing on another occasion.
Among the 13 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on four “Strong Buy” ratings, eight “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.”
This configuration is more bullish than three months ago, with one “Strong Buy” rating on the stock.
On Aug. 8, Piper Sandler increased its price target on Solventum to $94 while maintaining an “Overweight” rating.
As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $87.12. The Street-high price target of $103 implies a modest potential upside of 44.2% from the current price levels.

Brown
(Reuters) -Home Depot kept its annual forecasts intact despite posting muted quarterly results on Tuesday, but said some products may see small price hikes due to tariffs after previously suggesting they would generally not change.
The top U.S. home-improvement chain is betting that customers will continue to spend on smaller-scale maintenance projects, and that demand from professional contractors will stay strong in the second half of the year.
Less clear is when the stalled U.S. housing market - and major home renovations that require financing - will start to pick up.
Home Depot, which sources more than 50% of its products from the U.S., said there would be modest price hikes in some imported goods that currently face higher tariff rates than what it had anticipated in May, when the company said it would ""generally maintain"" pricing but that some items could disappear from shelves.
""There will be modest price movement in some categories, but it won't be broad-based,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said on a Tuesday conference call.
Shares of Home Depot were up nearly 3% in afternoon trading, lifting the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. Lowe's, which is set to report quarterly results on Wednesday, rose about 2%.
MUDDY HOUSING OUTLOOK
Home Depot results kick off a keenly watched earnings week for big-box retailers, including Walmart and Target, that will show how consumers are dealing with rising costs and sour economic sentiment.
A key headwind for Home Depot is a U.S. housing market seeing historic lows in turnover, which CEO Ted Decker said could begin to resolve as the federal deficit shrinks. But the outlook remains muddy.
A gauge of U.S. homebuilder sentiment fell unexpectedly in August to its lowest level in over two-and-a-half years. Single-family housing starts, which account for the bulk of homebuilding, rose in July.
Economic uncertainty is also discouraging consumers from splurging on big projects that require financing, but executives voiced optimism that lower interest rates - expected to come later this year - could start to unlock that work.
""We survey our [professional contractor] customers every quarter, and they say their customers tell them they are deferring projects, not canceling projects,"" said McPhail. ""Home improvement demand persists.""

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
August has been an interesting month for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), as after the firm received the Trump administration’s approval to sell China the H20 GPUs, reports started to flow about potential security vulnerabilities or tracking software in the chips. While NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) asserted that no such vulnerabilities are present, more reports came to light and suggested that the Chinese government was advising firms not to buy its products. Cramer commented on yet another report about the firm:
“But we’re seeing a lot of crazy stuff. I mean yesterday NVIDIA was down all day. I said why? Well it turns out that there was a short story out there that NVIDIA’s gonna get late with the next chip which is the Vera Rubin, and therefore the MI450 by AMD is going to be in ascendance. The story was, I’ll just use a word that I think is really kind of indicative of where we are. It was a lie. It was a lie. . .it was untrue. And it caused a lot of people to buy AMD up nine and sell NVIDIA. Now there’s probably a new story about why NVIDIA’s down today. Because NVIDIA is so easy to known down right now because they’re an honest company. They don’t come in and they’re not a hyped company. They’re like, okay, they don’t come in and say what do we have to refute today? The fact is that the most major story about NVIDIA is a positive one. Which is that DeepSeek can’t make it so called [inaudible] chips that it needs and they need the H20.

“18,888 BTC. Onward and upward,” Metaplanet President Simon Gerovich tweeted, sharing the announcement.

Metaplanet’s Bitcoin treasury strategy
Metaplanet's transformation represents one of the most dramatic corporate pivots in recent history. Founded in 2010 as Red Planet Japan, the company operated a pan-Asian budget hotel chain, but the COVID-19 pandemic broke its business model, forcing property closures and resulting in six consecutive years of losses.
By early 2024, the company's stock languished around $1.32 (¥190), before its adoption of the corporate Bitcoin acquisition playbook originated by Michael Saylor’s Strategy.
Yet the same dynamic isn't something peculiar to Japan, according to Hank Huang, CEO of Asia-focused quantitative trading firm Kronos Research.
“Metaplanet’s latest buy shows corporate Bitcoin treasuries growing globally, with firms increasingly using BTC as a strategic reserve.” Huang told Decrypt. “At this scale, near-term liquidity could tighten, adding short-term volatility, while also serving as a hedge against fiat currencies. “
Rewards and risks
Huang noted that the primary risk to Metaplanet’s ambitions is volatility, with equity dilution as a secondary factor.
“The biggest risk for corporate Bitcoin treasuries is price volatility, with sharp BTC drops straining balance sheets and confidence,” Huang explained. “Equity dilution is a secondary concern if share-funded purchases don’t see bullish moves in both BTC and stock.”
Equity dilution happens when a company issues new shares, reducing each holder’s stake and weighing on the stock. Despite it, Metaplanet continuously amassed Bitcoin for its balance sheet, announcing plans for a $3.7 billion stock raise earlier this month to buy more.",945a1a196a2d258cad2fb11191fdba27,trafilatura,2520,0

Valued at $25.4 billion by market cap, the company sells and constructs homes, and purchases, develops, and sells residential land and develops active adult communities. PHM also provides mortgage financing, title insurance, and other services to home buyers.
Shares of this homebuilding giant have underperformed the broader market over the past year. PHM has gained 5% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 16.4%. However, in 2025, PHM stock is up 18.2%, surpassing the SPX’s 9.7% rise on a YTD basis.

Narrowing the focus, PHM’s underperformance is also apparent compared to the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB). The exchange-traded fund has gained about 2.1% over the past year. However, PHM’s double-digit gains on a YTD basis outshine the ETF’s 8.5% returns over the same time frame.
PulteGroup is underperforming amid challenges in the housing industry, including high interest rates and unaffordable home prices. Despite strong demand for homeownership, sales have slumped due to economic uncertainty and rising borrowing costs.
On Jul. 22, PHM shares closed up more than 11% after reporting its Q2 results. Its EPS of $3.03 surpassed Wall Street expectations of $2.92. The company’s revenue was $4.40 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $4.37 billion.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect PHM’s EPS to decline 14.6% to $11.34 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.
Among the 16 analysts covering PHM stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on nine “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” five “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.”
This configuration is more bullish than a month ago, with eight analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy.”
On Jul. 23, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) analyst Michael Rehaut maintained a “Buy” rating on PHM and set a price target of $123.
The mean price target of $135.85 represents a 5.6% premium to PHM’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $163 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 26.7%.

The bank kept its end of 2025 target at $3,500 per ounce, up from the current spot rate of around $3,340. For next year, it lifted its benchmark targets to $3,600 from $3,500 by the end of March, and to $3,700 from $3,500 by the end of June. It also announced a new forecast of $3,700 by the end of September. The upgraded forecast comes after a choppy few months for gold, with a first-half rally stuttering as a Trump tariff-induced flight into safe haven assets eased. In August, investors have been monitoring the potential for the introduction of U.S. tariffs on gold bars — later dismissed as ""misinformation"" by the White House — along with hopes of a breakthrough in the Russia-Ukraine war . An end to the long-running conflict could also reduce some of the global demand for safe havens. XAU= 1Y line U.S. spot gold. However, UBS strategists see plenty of momentum to carry gold for another year — much of it stemming from the U.S. In a Monday note, they said that a cocktail of sticky U.S. inflation — as the impact of tariffs and immigration curbs take effect — below-trend economic growth, the Federal Reserve resuming policy easing and further weakness in the U.S. dollar would all support prices. ""In particular, due to the metal's non-interest-bearing nature, gold prices should rise as the first two factors push down real yields in the US (lower real yields reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold),"" they said. The strategists added that investors would continue to be concerned about the U.S.'s fiscal position amid its growing deficit , and ""questions over Fed independence"" with the end of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term looming next May , both of which could drive gold demand. UBS also raised its gold forecast in April , citing the continuation of strong central bank demand. Strategists at the bank on Monday said that this trend ""should stay strong, albeit slightly below last year's near-record purchases."" Global central banks have been snapping up gold at a rapid pace in recent years, seeking to hedge against inflation and diversify their portfolios away from policy-sensitive assets. China, India and Turkey have been major buyers, helping gold overtake the euro as the world's second-biggest reserve asset next to the U.S. dollar last year. — CNBC's Michael Bloom and Chloe Taylor contributed to this story.",97923feff7e6e492407ed8c44856a3ba,trafilatura,2511,0

Builders’ sentiment in the market fell in August from the month before. Sentiment was glum as builders face weak demand as well as challenges associated with developing land and building homes.

My wife and I are in our 50s and have $11 million. We’re not leaving it to our kids. Is that wrong?
The National Association of Home Builders’ monthly confidence index fell in August to 32, the industry group said. A year ago, the index stood at 39.
Builder sentiment has been in negative territory for the last 16 months in a row, the NAHB noted.
Big picture: Persistently high mortgage rates and home prices are keeping buyers away from the market.
The pace of home sales remains depressed, as many buyers can’t afford to enter the market. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate was 6.58% as of Aug. 14, according to Freddie Mac. The median price of a new home was $401,800.
Concerns over the future of the U.S. economy, with reports of a weakening labor market, are behind the reluctance to buy homes right now.
“Affordability continues to be the top challenge for the housing market and buyers are waiting for mortgage rates to drop to move forward,” Buddy Hughes, a home builder and developer from Lexington, N.C., and chair of the NAHB, said in a statement.
On top of the demand-side weakness, “builders are also grappling with supply-side headwinds,” he added, “including ongoing frustrations with regulatory policies connected to developing land and building homes.”
Despite the pessimism, investors — including Warren Buffett — have been buying home-builder stocks, as MarketWatch has reported. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B BRK.A recently bought shares in D.R. Horton DHI and in Lennar LEN, the two biggest builders in America.

Key details: In August, 37% of builders cut home prices, down from a recent high of 38%. The average price reduction was 5% in August, unchanged from the previous month.
The use of sales incentives, on the other hand, grew to 66% in August from 62% the previous month. The share of builders offering incentives reached the highest level since May 2020, the NAHB said.",f45ccb8c90e99e1f75982da64d49de9f,trafilatura,2504,0

Dive Brief:
-
A group of investors led by New York-based MCR Hotels and its CEO and chairman, Tyler Morse, will take membership club Soho House private in a $2.7 billion deal, Soho House & Co. announced Monday.
-
The investor group will acquire outstanding shares of Soho House & Co. as Executive Chairman Ron Burkle and the investment firm Yucaipa Companies roll their controlling equity interests into the membership club company, retaining majority control of the business.
-
MCR, which claims it is the third-largest hotel owner-operator in the U.S., will make a “meaningful new money investment” into Soho House as a shareholder, per the announcement. Morse will join the company’s board of directors as vice chairman.
Dive Insight:
Affiliates of asset management business Apollo are supporting the $2.7 billion transaction through additional capital in the form of debt and common equity, according to Soho House.
Additional investors — including Goldman Sachs Alternatives and actor-turned-investor Ashton Kutcher, who will also join Soho House’s board of directors — will provide further capital. The company’s existing shareholders will also roll the majority of their shares of the company’s stock.
“This transaction reflects the strong confidence our existing and incoming shareholders have in the future of Soho House & Co., and the transformation we’ve led since becoming a public company,” said Soho House CEO Andrew Carnie in a statement.
The company held its initial public offering in 2021. Since then, Carnie added, the firm “delivered consistent, disciplined growth with revenue increasing at an average annual rate of double digit growth” despite “challenging economic conditions and global uncertainty.”
Soho House, which first opened in 1995, has expanded globally since going public, adding locations in Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Paris and Nashville, Tennessee, in recent years. According to Carnie, going private “enables us to build on this momentum.”
Morse said MCR’s investment “represents a strategic opportunity to combine our operational expertise with one of the most distinctive brands in hospitality.”
The 2006-founded hotel investment firm currently commands a $5 billion portfolio of 150 premium-branded hotels, including Sheraton New York Times Square, The High Line Hotel and The Gramercy Park Hotel in New York.",a63ad65ee68ba04e4e9d96ecaaa72c99,trafilatura,2485,0

The world's largest cryptocurrency sank 2%, hovering just above $115,000 in early trading after surging past $123,500 last Thursday.
Expectations of Fed rate cuts, coupled with heavy purchases from corporate treasuries, have driven the price of bitcoin up 23% year to date.
Ether (ETH-USD), the second-largest crypto by market cap, also declined 3% to hover near $4,350 per token following a surge last week to its highest level of the year and approaching its record high just below $4,900.
""The sharp pullback in cryptocurrencies comes as the market is getting deleveraged following the peaks recorded last week,"" said Samer Hasn, senior market analyst at foreign exchange trading platform XS.com, pointing to ""an erosion of bullish momentum.""
Hasn pointed out that since last Thursday, more than $1.7 billion in long crypto futures positions have been liquidated, according to CoinGlass data.
The sell-off comes as the broader market rally has paused, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hovering near record levels.
Late last week, bitcoin and other digital assets slipped from highs as hopes of a 0.5% interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve in September fizzled on the heels of a hotter-than-expected wholesale inflation print.

""A breakdown could expose $112,000, while holding above could allow another test of the $118,000–$120,000 resistance band.""
Crypto-related stocks like Strategy (MSTR), Robinhood (HOOD), and Coinbase (COIN) slipped at the opening bell on Monday but recovered a chunk of losses through the first hour of trading.

In a CNBC ""Squawk Box"" interview, Bessent confirmed the race to replace current Chair Jerome Powell is between 11 candidates, an array that includes past and present central bank officials as well as economists, a White House advisor and a few Wall Street market experts.
""In terms of the interview process, we've announced 11 very strong candidates. I'm going to be meeting with them probably right after Labor Day, and to start bringing down the list to present to President Trump,"" he said. ""It's an incredible group.""
That list is believed to contain current Governors Michelle Bowman, Philip Jefferson and Christopher Waller, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, White House economist Kevin Hassett and former Governor Kevin Warsh. Strategists Rick Rieder of BlackRock and David Zervos of Jefferies also are part of the group, as well as economist Marc Sumerlin, former Governor Larry Lindsey and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
Though Powell's term does not end until May 2026, the White House is keen to get the process moving as it pushes an urgent need for interest rate cuts.
Bessent repeated the administration's desire for easing, saying it would help the moribund U.S. housing market. Sales and new building have been weak, with low inventory pushing prices higher.
""If we keep constraining home building, then what kind of inflation does that create one or two years out?"" he said. ""So a big cut here could facilitate a boom or a pickup in home building, which will keep prices down one two years down the road.""
The Fed does not have a policy meeting again until Sept. 16-17, where it is widely expected to approve its first quarter percentage point reduction since December 2024. Bessent said he was not concerned about a producer price index reading for July that showed the largest monthly increase in three years, as he attributed much it to a rise in portfolio fees tied to higher stock market values.
Before then, Powell on Friday will give what is likely his final keynote address at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. That speech could focus on a review the central bank does every five years of its policy, but Powell also may choose to tip the Fed's hand on the September vote.",be7fa07b3a792936f15223ec7f47031f,trafilatura,2424,0

The Black Sheep and Purity brands owner has added the Hove-based business to its roster of licence contracts. Keystone has similar deals with brands including Hofmeister and Big Drop.
People’s Captain, set up in 2020 by former professional rugby player Greg Bateman, has in the past used contract brewers including Magic Rock.
Earlier this year, Keystone bought UK brewer Magic Rock, acquiring an “exclusive license” to produce its beers. The Magic Rock brewery in West Yorkshire had halted its brewing operations several weeks before the deal was finalised, citing problems with cash flow.
Keystone will produce People’s Captain’s beer at its Purity site in the West Midlands. It will also handle distribution to on- and off-trade customers in the UK. The south of England is People’s Captain’s “heartland” but the business has “national ambitions”, Bateman told Just Drinks.
“Keystone sees clear commercial and strategic benefits in bringing People’s Captain into its portfolio,” he said. “The brand blends strong growth potential with a purpose-driven ethos, appealing to consumers who increasingly prioritise values such as mental wellbeing and social impact.”
Keystone is looking to double its revenue over the next 12 months.
The business, formed last year after private-equity firm Breal acquired a series of UK brewers, took in £20m ($26.9m) in revenue in the 12 months ending May. By 2028, it is targeting £100m.
In a statement, Keystone CEO Steve Cox said: “People’s Captain is exactly the kind of brand we want in the portfolio – bold, values-driven, and with a genuine story at its heart. This partnership isn’t just about more beer in more places. It’s about championing a message that clearly resonates and giving it the platform and support it deserves.”

Looking closer, the medical device manufacturer stock has also lagged behind the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLV) 10.5% drop over the past 52 weeks.
Shares of Becton Dickinson climbed 8.9% on Aug. 7 after the company reported stronger-than-expected Q3 2025 results, with adjusted EPS of $3.68 and revenue of $5.5 billion. Growth was driven by a 14.4% increase in sales from its medical unit to $2.93 billion, slightly topping forecasts, as demand for drug-delivery devices remained strong. Additionally, BD raised its 2025 adjusted profit forecast to a range of $14.30 per share - $14.45 per share.
For the fiscal year ending in September 2025, analysts expect BDX's adjusted EPS to grow 9.1% year-over-year to $14.33. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 18 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on seven “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” and 10 “Holds.”
This configuration is slightly less bullish than three months ago, with eight “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.

As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $216.21. The Street-high price target of $285 implies a potential upside of 45.4% from the current price levels.

(NYSE:PLTR) deepened its partnership with Fujitsu Ltd. (OTC:FJTSY) through a new licensing deal signed Aug. 5, 2025, granting Fujitsu the rights to offer the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in Japan. The arrangement expands Fujitsu’s access to Palantir’s generative AI technology, with plans to extend globally later this fiscal year.
Fujitsu said it will incorporate Palantir AIP into its Uvance framework, designed to tackle business and social challenges with digital solutions. The platform will accelerate enterprise transformation by embedding generative AI into operations.
The two companies began collaborating in 2020 and signed a global agreement in 2023 to distribute Palantir Foundry, a platform for large-scale data management.
Pairing Foundry with AIP enables corporations to use preferred large language models within secure environments, supporting applications in finance, defense, and manufacturing. Palantir AIP is built to speed up data analysis, supply chain optimization, and workflow automation.
Palantir’s AIP will also connect with Fujitsu’s AI services, including Takane and Kozuchi, to strengthen Japanese-language functionality and industry-specific tools. This integration is expected to broaden the adoption of agentic AI while maintaining human oversight in decision-making. Fujitsu tested the platform internally, citing improvements in staffing allocation, workload reduction, and risk prediction.
Through this partnership, Fujitsu projects $100 million in sales linked to AIP offerings by fiscal 2029. Palantir will provide continuous upgrades and technical support as enterprises expand use cases for generative AI. The move underscores Palantir’s strategy to secure high-value partnerships while scaling its AI-driven products internationally.
The licensing deal follows heightened investor attention on Palantir’s stock, as traders debate what’s going on with Palantir Technologies stock amid rising demand for enterprise AI solutions. Analysts have pointed to the company’s government contracts and global partnerships as key growth drivers.

Valued at $49.4 billion by market cap, the company refines, supplies, markets, and transports petroleum products.
Shares of this refining giant have underperformed the broader market over the past year. MPC has declined 10.2% over this time frame, while the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has rallied nearly 16.4%. However, in 2025, MPC stock is up 16.4%, surpassing the SPX’s 9.7% rise on a YTD basis.

Narrowing the focus, MPC’s underperformance is also apparent compared to the VanEck Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK). The exchange-traded fund has declined about 3.1% over the past year. Moreover, the ETF’s 24.2% returns on a YTD basis outshine the stock’s gains over the same time frame.
MPC’s weak performance can be attributed to a decline in refining throughput volumes and renewable diesel sales volumes.
On Aug. 5, MPC reported its Q2 results, and its shares closed down by 3.8% in the following trading session. Its EPS of $3.96 exceeded Wall Street expectations of $3.22. The company’s revenue stood at $34.1 billion, down 11.1% year over year.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect MPC’s EPS to decline 22.4% to $7.54 on a diluted basis. The company’s earnings surprise history is impressive. It beat the consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters.
Among the 19 analysts covering MPC stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on nine “Strong Buy” ratings, two “Moderate Buys,” and eight “Holds.”
This configuration is less bullish than two months ago, with 11 analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy,” and one recommending a “Moderate Buy.”

My wife and I are in our 50s and have $11 million. We’re not leaving it to our kids. Is that wrong?
In 2033, the reserves in the trust fund will be exhausted and retirement benefits will be cut by 23% to match incoming revenues, according to the latest Social Security Trustees Report. To avoid such a large and abrupt benefit cut, Congress must enact a package that eliminates the program’s shortfall. And Congress should act sooner rather than later to relieve the anxiety of many older Americans and to distribute the burden in an equitable fashion among different cohorts.
On the other hand, the U.S., unlike Denmark, is not in a position to enact an across-the-board increase in the retirement age, because we have a much more unequal society than Denmark. According to the OECD, the poverty rate in the U.S. is nearly three times higher than in Denmark, and a more comprehensive measure of inequality — the Gini coefficient — shows a much more unequal distribution of household income overall (see Figure 1). (A Gini coefficient of zero indicates that income is distributed equally among all households and a value of 1 indicates that one household receives all the income.)
The inequality in income translates directly into inequality in life expectancy. Remember, the argument for a higher retirement age is based on the premise that people are living longer, so why not have them work longer. Yes, on average we have experienced gains in life expectancy, but those gains have been primarily enjoyed by the top half of the earnings distribution.
A recent study by the Social Security actuaries, which supports an extensive body of evidence, drives this point home in spades. For the record, the actuaries’ numbers probably understate the relationship between earnings and life expectancy for two reasons.",5f4c853cae51a37112d9bf9ef58e72f5,trafilatura,2349,0

The publicly listed business has named McGrathNicol partners Rob Smith and Matthew Hutton as joint administrators.
In a statement, Top Shelf said control of the business “now rests with the administrators"". The Ned whisky maker said the administrators ""intend to continue to trade on a business as usual basis while options for a going concern sale or recapitalisation are explored”.
The news follows shareholder approval last week for a convertible note issue tied to a planned A$10m ($6.5m) capital raise, part of a July restructuring plan that also included a co-packing deal with Idyll Wine.
In May, Idyll Wine completed the purchase of Top Shelf's Campbellfield production facility for A$8m.
Shortly after the disposal, it was announced that CEO Trent Fraser would step down by the end of the year.
The July restructuring update also highlighted a sales, distribution and marketing partnership with Amber Bev, aiming for a transition to third-party sales by August.
Top Shelf also owns the Grainshaker vodka brands. Its shares have been suspended from trading since September due to the failure to file audited financial results for FY24.
“It is expected that the shares in Top Shelf will continue to be suspended until further notice,” the group said, adding “the administrators intend to shortly commence a sale and recapitalisation process” for the company.
In February, Top Shelf reported an underlying EBITDA loss of A$2m for its 2025 fiscal second quarter, a period that ended on 31 December.
The A$10m capital raise was intended to fund the next steps of the business restructure and aimed for a relisting on the ASX by delivering its FY24 annual report by 30 September.

The retailer is seeking to patent a system for “supply chain modeling and prediction,” relying on machine learning to keep track of all the moving parts within its sprawling and complex logistics operations. Walmart’s tech seeks to predict and adapt to real-time changes that may impact the entire operation, addressing limitations in available tools.

“Existing simulation tools are all limited to some specific sub-tasks in supply chain operations, are not adaptive to real-time data and lack the ability to capture the dynamic nature of supply chain operations,” Walmart said in the filing.
When Walmart’s model receives a query, such as “what happens if a distribution center is shut down for two days,” the model will use historical data to build a graph representing the different factors within the supply chain that may be impacted, including suppliers, warehouses and transportation routes.
The model, taking into account the interdependencies of the operation, will use that to generate predictions like inventory impacts, delivery time changes, bottlenecks and costs. This could allow Walmart to consider the domino effects of different incidents from warehouse to delivery to store.
This isn’t the first time that Walmart has displayed an interest in AI. The company has spent the past few years bolstering its tech portfolio, with patent applications including recommendation engines, AI analytics and churn prediction. And the retailer’s tech overhaul is one indicator of a broader trend: Traditionally brick-and-mortar institutions, both in retail and food service, have started to work towards adding AI into their tech stacks.
For Walmart in particular, the shift makes sense. Its biggest competitor has long been Amazon. And while it’d be hard pressed to compete with the tech giant’s AI prowess, developing and adopting its own models – and claiming IP as it does so – couldn’t hurt.

Should You Avoid Buying RGTI Stock on the Post-Earnings Decline?
According to Subodh Kulkarni, the chief executive of Rigetti Computing, quantum technology could evolve into a trillion-dollar-per-year market in the long term.
In the next four to five years, however, “our view is still very much in the R&D stage,” he told Barron’s in a recent interview.

Rigetti Computing raised some $350 million via a stock offering in its second financial quarter, effectively wiping its balance sheet of all debt.

More importantly, Rigetti Computing is trading at a price-sales (P/S) ratio of more than 480x at writing, which indicates gross overvaluation.
Investors should also note that RGTI has not yet achieved quantum supremacy, which theoretically makes peer D-Wave (QBTS) a better investment than Rigetti Computing stock for exposure to quantum technology.

(Reuters) -Palo Alto Networks (PANW) forecast fiscal 2026 revenue and profit above analysts' estimates on Monday, betting on growing demand for its artificial intelligence-powered cybersecurity solutions, sending its shares up 5% in premarket trading on Tuesday.
The company has been benefiting from an AI-driven upgrade cycle as enterprises accelerate their cloud adoption and modernize security operations amid rising data breach incidents.
A wave of high-profile cyberattacks has hit global companies including Microsoft (MSFT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Walt Disney (DIS) and Oracle, (ORCL) prompting the need for robust security solutions.
Palo Alto's new launches such as cloud security platform 'Cortex Cloud' and security platform to protect AI apps 'Prisma AIRS', together with its planned $25 billion CyberArk acquisition, deepen its cybersecurity offerings.
""The company benefits from both net new AI spending as well as a reallocation from services to products (via automation),"" said Morningstar analyst Malik Ahmed Khan.
""We think the CyberArk Software acquisition gets them access to more customers to cross-sell identity over to existing Palo Alto customers and the other way around as well.""
Palo Alto also announced on Monday that founder and Chief Technology Officer Nir Zuk has retired after being with the company for over 20 years. Long-time product leader Lee Klarich has been named as its CTO and board member.
Klarich will also chair the board's security committee in a bid to bolster the company's AI-driven platform strategy.
The company projected annual revenue between $10.48 billion and $10.53 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $10.43 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
It expects adjusted profit per share of $3.75 to $3.85, above estimates of $3.67 for the fiscal year.
The company's first-quarter revenue forecast of $2.45 billion to $2.47 billion came in above expectations of $2.43 billion. Its adjusted quarterly earnings per share of 88 cents to 90 cents was also above estimates of 85 cents.
Palo Alto's fourth-quarter revenue grew 16% to $2.54 billion from a year ago. It reported adjusted EPS of 95 cents for the quarter ended July 31, beating estimates of 88 cents.

Apple CEO Tim Cook used part of the company’s fiscal Q3 2025 earnings call to address a growing cost pressure that has little to do with supply chains or raw materials, and everything to do with geopolitics: tariffs.
Cook disclosed that Apple (AAPL) absorbed roughly $800 million in tariff-related costs during the June quarter and expects that figure to climb to $1.1 billion in the September quarter, assuming no changes to current global tariff policies.
More News from Barchart
“Finally, the situation around tariffs is evolving, so let me provide some color there,” Cook told investors. “For the June quarter, we incurred approximately $800 million of tariff-related costs. For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs.”
Trade Tensions Pressure Margins
The acknowledgment of higher tariff costs highlights the headwinds Apple faces from ongoing trade disputes and shifting policy environments. With global supply chains deeply intertwined — especially in China, where much of Apple’s manufacturing still occurs — tariffs can significantly squeeze operating margins.
Cook stopped short of detailing which product lines or geographies are most affected, but warned that projecting beyond the September quarter is difficult. “This estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates,” he clarified.
Investor Concerns: Impact on Pricing and Profitability
For investors, the tariff discussion raises immediate questions: Will Apple absorb the increased costs and take the hit to margins, or will it pass some of the burden on to consumers through higher prices?
Historically, Apple has attempted to shield its customers from sudden price jumps on flagship products, instead optimizing its supply chain or adjusting regional pricing strategies to offset trade friction. However, a $1.1 billion quarterly cost increase is significant enough to potentially influence gross margin guidance in upcoming quarters.",26caf9c957a9bd6f773e4b3ecbd871b4,trafilatura,2310,0

""We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow,"" the company told CNBC in a statement. ""Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use.""
Shares of Nvidia slipped more than 3% Tuesday along with the broader market.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and said he wouldn't be surprised if Huang wants to sell a new chip to China.
""I'm sure he's pitching the president all the time,"" Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I've listened to him pitch the president, and the president listens to our great technology companies, and he'll decide how he wants to play it.""
Earlier this month, Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales in China, in exchange for permission to resume selling chips in the region.
The Trump administration halted the sale of advanced computer chips to China in April over national security concerns. Nvidia built its China-specific H20 chip after the Biden administration implemented export controls on AI chips in 2023, while AMD developed the MI308 chip for the Chinese market.
President Donald Trump said last week that he originally requested a 20% cut of Nvidia's sales, but that Huang negotiated the number down to 15%.
Trump suggested at the time that he would be open to Nvidia selling a significantly scaled-down version of its advanced Blackwell chip in China.
""It's possible I'd make a deal"" on a ""somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell"" processor, Trump said. ""In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.""

Ether (ETH) was the standout, rallying 48% as another 24 companies added the asset to their balance sheets, lifting corporate holdings by 128% to 2.7 million ETH. That's nearly half the number held by ETFs. Binance attributed the trend to staking yield, ETH’s deflationary supply and growing comfort among companies to hold cryptocurrencies directly .
Bitcoin (BTC) dominance fell 5.2 percentage points to 60.6%, driven by expectations of Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts and U.S. regulatory clarity from the passage of three major crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act on fully reserved stablecoins .
Stablecoin transfer volumes held near $2.1 trillion, outpacing Visa again, as they have done since late 2024. JPMorgan expanded its deposit-token pilot, Citi explored tokenized deposits for cross-border settlements and Visa reaffirmed stablecoins as complementary to its network .
The report also highlights a 220% month-on-month jump in the market cap of widely traded tokenized stocks such as Tesla (TSLA). The company excluded Exodus Movement (EXOD) shares issued via Securitize from its calculations, saying they skewed the calculation.
Tokenization is the process of representing real-world assets (RWAs) such as stocks as digital equivalents that can be traded on blockchains. As of June this year, the RWA tokenization market reached $24 billion in value.
Active on-chain addresses for tokenized stocks soared to 90,000 from 1,600, while centralized exchanges facilitated over 70 times more volume than on-chain venues. Binance likened the growth of the sector to DeFi’s 2020-2021 boom and estimated that tokenizing just 1% of global equities could create a $1.3 trillion market.
NFT sales rebounded nearly 50% in July, led by a 393% jump in CryptoPunks transactions, while Bitcoin NFTs saw a 28% rise. Still, volumes remain below prior-cycle peaks.
The report suggests that if macroeconomic tailwinds hold, the capital rotation into altcoins, coupled with the regulatory green light for stablecoins and tokenized assets, could accelerate crypto’s integration into mainstream finance.",01220bc38e1774f933200ffefbb39f1e,trafilatura,2273,0

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) ended the session just above the flat line, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped about 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 1.5%, extending a muted start to the week for the major gauges. Losses in tech were led by a 9% plunge in Palantir (PLTR) and a more than 5% slide in AMD (AMD). Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) also dropped about 3.5%.
After months of concentration in a handful of growth giants, leadership has begun to broaden out, with more economically sensitive sectors like Health Care (XLV), Homebuilders (XHB), and small- and mid-cap stocks playing a larger role in powering this summer’s move to record highs.
On Tuesday, the gains were concentrated in more defensive corners of the market, with Real Estate (XLRE), Consumer Staples (XLP), Utilities (XLU), and Health Care among the standouts.
Earlier in the session, a steady march of earnings reports from retail giants began with Home Depot's (HD) second quarter results before the bell, slightly missing Wall Street's estimates. But shares of the company closed up 3% as Tuesday's report marked its return to consistent same-store sales growth in the US amid signs that a prolonged slump in the US housing market is starting to thaw.
Target (TGT) will post its earnings results on Wednesday, followed by Walmart (WMT) on Thursday. Taken together, the group's results will provide insight into how companies and consumers are faring as Trump's tariffs kick in.

In the tech world, Intel (INTC) stock got a boost after SoftBank said it will take a $2 billion stake in the chipmaker, which is in the middle of a turnaround bid. That lifeline followed a Bloomberg report that the Trump administration is looking to take a 10% stake in the struggling company.
Meanwhile, President Trump continued to press for further Ukraine talks, reportedly asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet with Volodymyr Zelensky. European leaders rallied around the Ukrainian president at his meeting with Trump on Monday, but markets hit pause as uncertainty loomed over his country's fate.

On Jun. 20, CarMax’s shares surged 6.6% following its better-than-expected Q1 earnings release.

Moreover, this solid top-line performance, along with a 70-basis-point expansion in gross profit margin, contributed to a notable 42.3% year-over-year increase in its net income to $1.38 per share, which topped the consensus estimates by an impressive margin of 16.9%.
For the current fiscal year, ending in February 2026, analysts expect KMX’s EPS to grow 19.3% year over year to $3.90. The company’s earnings surprise history is mixed. It met or exceeded the consensus estimates in three of the last four quarters, while missing on another occasion.

The sale is currently in the preliminary stages.
The deal is not yet certain, and the final price may vary based on market dynamics, according to sources who requested anonymity due to the confidentiality of the process.
Raisa Energy is a private investment firm established in 2014. The company, which has its key technology hub in Cairo, has developed a distinct investment platform for the energy sector, overseeing more than $2bn in investments at this moment.
The investment banking division of Perella Weinberg Partners, TPH, which is focused in energy sector, is providing advisory services for the sale.
Assets on offer are categorised within the industry as non-operating interests.
Owners of such assets contribute to drilling costs and additional expenses, receiving a share of the revenue from hydrocarbon sales, while another operator manages the day-to-day activities.
This type of investment is particularly appealing to energy producers and financial investors looking for consistent returns without the requirement for operational expertise.
Sources indicate that nearly half of the output from Raisa's assets is natural gas, with the total net production estimated at about 63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).
Raisa is also enhancing its technology platform, incorporating automation, AI, and big data to support its energy experts in decision-making processes.

On Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite was down more than 1%, weighed down by declines in Nvidia and other tech heavyweights.
The crypto market tends to be vulnerable to moves in tech stocks due to their growth-oriented investor base, narrative-driven price action, speculative nature and tendency to thrive in low interest rate environments.

Snowflake, one of Databricks' top rivals, is expected to generate $4.5 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that ends in January, representing annual growth of 25%, according to LSEG. Snowflake currently has a market cap of about $65 billion. Other competitors include cloud providers such as Amazon and Microsoft, which are also Databricks partners.
Ghodsi said he heard from a lot of interested investors following Figma's IPO late last month. Shares of the design software company more than tripled in their New York Stock Exchange debut, a sign that public investors are seeking out tech offerings after in extended lull in the IPO market.
""My phone was blowing up,"" Ghodsi said on Tuesday. ""So yes, there's definitely been a big push from outside.""
Figma shares have since retreated from their initial $115.50 closing price. The stock is trading at about $70, still more than double the $33 IPO price.
Ghodsi said the round will help Databricks invest in products that clients can tap when using artificial intelligence models.
Founded in 2013 and based in San Francisco, Databricks ranked third on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list. As of June, the company employed 8,000 people. Existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners Thrive Capital and WCM Investment Management are buying shares, a spokesperson said.

The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index closed 2.58% lower, with Italy's Leonardo down 10.1%, Germany's Hensoldt down 9.5%, and tank parts manufacturer Renk down 8.2%.
At the closely watched talks on Monday, Trump said peace negotiations can take place while both countries are still fighting, dropping his earlier calls for a ceasefire. He also said that a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy is being planned, to be followed by a trilateral meeting which will include Trump.
Zelenskyy said a package of coveted security guarantees for Ukraine — expected to include a massive purchase of American weapons — would be ""formalized on paper within the next week to 10 days.""
European markets climb
It was a positive day overall for European markets, with the regional Stoxx 600 index gaining 0.73% as the U.K.'s FTSE 100 notched a record closing high of 9189.22 points. Retailer JD Sports led gains, up 7%, after analysts at Deutsche Bank raised their target price on the stock to £1 ($1.35) from 85p.
Investors are gearing up for the U.K.'s July inflation print on Wednesday morning, where economists polled by Reuters see the annual rate of price rises hitting 3.7%, up from 3.6% in June.

Gabbard issued the statement on X, saying she had worked for months with Britain, along with President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance to arrive at a deal.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was in Washington on Monday along with other European leaders to meet Trump and discuss Russia's war in Ukraine.
The U.K. government and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Gabbard's statement.
U.S. lawmakers said in May that the U.K.'s order to Apple to create a backdoor to its encrypted user data could be exploited by cybercriminals and authoritarian governments.
Apple, which has said it would never build a so-called back door into its encrypted services or devices, had challenged the order at the U.K.'s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT).
The iPhone maker withdrew its Advanced Data Protection feature for U.K. users in February following the U.K. order. Users of Apple's iPhones, Macs and other devices can enable the feature to ensure that only they — and not even Apple — can unlock data stored on its cloud.
U.S. officials said earlier this year they were examining whether the U.K. broke a bilateral agreement by demanding that Apple build a backdoor allowing the British government to access backups of data in the company's encrypted cloud storage systems.
In a letter dated February 25 to U.S. lawmakers, Gabbard said the U.S. was examining whether the U.K. government had violated the CLOUD Act, which bars it from issuing demands for the data of U.S. citizens and vice versa.
Cybersecurity experts told Reuters that if Apple chose to build a backdoor for a government, that backdoor would eventually be found and exploited by hackers.
Apple has sparred with regulators over encryption as far back as 2016 when the U.S. government tried to compel it to build a tool to unlock the iPhone of a suspected extremist.",1f3ca57e34819393fb6c247f1916e060,trafilatura,2098,0

He’ll be accompanied by leaders from several European countries, with all parties focused on how to bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to an end. But Zelensky reportedly isn’t happy with the territory exchange that Russian President Vladimir Putin is proposing. Many outside observers also say it would make Ukraine vulnerable to a future Russian invasion.

(AMD) Is Good But The Stock Shouldn’t Have Risen Recently, Says Jim Cramer
We recently published 12 Latest Stocks Jim Cramer Discussed. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s AI accelerators are the only ones in the market that can cater to AI demand on a massive scale, except for NVIDIA’s products. Consequently, the firm’s shares have gained 47% year-to-date as Wall Street remains bullish on the long-term prospects of AI and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s ability to cater to the demand. The ability of the firm to profit from AI demand was evident from the report that Cramer discussed:
“. . .there was a short story out there that NVIDIA’s gonna get late with the next chip which is the Vera Rubin, and therefore the MI450 by AMD is going to be in ascendance. The story was, I’ll just use a word that I think is really kind of indicative of where we are. It was a lie. It was a lie. . .it was untrue. And it caused a lot of people to buy AMD up nine and sell NVIDIA.
Here are his previous thoughts about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD):
“I think this is the pause that refreshes. I like the pullback. I’m surprised we’re even getting it. I think that Lisa Su has got something big going on with this MI400, that’s a competitor to NVIDIA. There’s room for them even if they do billions and billions of dollars in that category. They’ll get their fair share. I want you to buy some.”
While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.
Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) is the struggling alcoholic beverages firm whose shares have lost 18% year-to-date on the back of a massive 17.9% dip in June. The shares fell after the firm’s quarterly report saw its $894 million in revenue miss $967 million in analyst estimates and its $0.31 EPS miss estimates of $0.34.

Because this is a mocktail era. People are, I mean it really is temperance. And there are a lot of people who feel that even red wine, they finally got rid of that canard. So be careful in the liquor story because its just not getting better, it’s getting worse.”
Here’s what Cramer said about Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) after the earnings report:
“But the worst one, Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel’s, which reported a truly terrible quarter. Although if you read the press release propaganda, you might have thought everything’s fabulous.

The company has already been operating a version of the token—also named JPYC—but will now bring it under the country’s stablecoin framework, with broader sales to individuals, corporations and institutional investors expected to begin once its registration as a money transfer business is completed.
JPYC aims to issue nearly $7 billion worth of the token within three years, according to a report by Nikkei.
Stablecoins around the world
Global hype around stablecoins has pushed their combined market capitalization to roughly $250 billion, attracting the attention of regulators and investors alike.
With the likes of Hong Kong and the U.S. rolling out stablecoin regulation over the last couple of months, regulators around the world are scrambling to catch up with surging interest.
That said, Japan’s stablecoin legislation came into effect in June 2023 under its Payment Services Act, with additional amendments broadening its scope submitted to the Diet in March this year.
Uptake has been slow. In March, Circle partnered with local exchange SBI Holdings to launch the first regulated dollar-pegged stablecoin in Japan.

And if its approval comes through, JPYC will be the only yen-backed regulated stablecoin in the country.
Aimed at being used for payments, including cross-border transfers, JPYC’s CEO, Noritaka Okabe, has been noticeably careful to distance the project from the cryptocurrency label, stressing in multiple posts on X that the token is an ""electronic payment method"" rather than a speculative crypto asset.
The JPYC stablecoin is ""not a cryptocurrency,"" he tweeted on Sunday.

(Reuters) -Novo Nordisk said on Monday it was offering its diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to eligible cash-paying patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. via its own pharmacy, a tie-up with telehealth service GoodRx and other platforms.
U.S.-listed shares of the Danish drugmaker were up 5.3%, while shares of GoodRx rose 34.2%.
Novo and rival Eli Lilly have expanded into direct-to-consumer sales for the highly effective and sought-after medicines, in part due to competition from online telehealth companies and pharmacies that sell cheaper compounded versions.
Novo already sells Wegovy, the weight-loss version of Ozempic, through its NovoCare pharmacy for $499. The latest offer is aimed at patients who do not have insurance coverage.
Its shares were also trading higher after Wegovy secured U.S. FDA approval for the liver disease metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, on Friday.
GoodRx will sell Wegovy and Ozempic at $499 monthly to eligible self-paying patients.
A spokesperson for Novo said it expected Ozempic cash sales to account for about 10% of total prescriptions - the same level of market penetration the company has experienced with Wegovy.
Novo said earlier this month it expects continued competition from copycat versions and rising pressure from Lilly. List prices for each drug in the United States are about $1,000 per month or more, but insured patients pay far less.
Eli Lilly offers single-dose vials of its weight-loss drug Zepbound on its website, LillyDirect, for $499 per month or less, regardless of insurance status. Lilly does not sell its diabetes drug Mounjaro on LillyDirect.
Novo said the new offer for Ozempic was part of ongoing efforts to explore new collaborations and approaches towards improving access to authentic semaglutide medicines.
In April, it said it was working with telehealth firms Ro and LifeMD to sell Wegovy to expand access to cash-paying patients.

Net profit of 396.5% and a 204.4% jump in revenues exceeded numbers flagged in an earnings preview last month forecasting revenue growth of 200% in the first half of 2025 and a recurring net profit increase of at least 350% on the year.
Shares in Pop Mart have risen more than 200% year-to-date, making the Chinese toy company more valuable than traditional industry giants like Barbie-maker Mattel and Hello Kitty parent company Sanrio.
Pop Mart often sells its collectable figurines in so-called ""blind boxes"" with buyers not knowing the exact design they will receive until they open the packaging.
One of the major drivers of the toothy-grinned Labubu's success has been its popularity with celebrity fans, who include Lisa of K-pop group Blackpink, singer Rihanna and ex-soccer star David Beckham.
Pop Mart is pledging to increase supply of the dolls, which have sold out in stores around the world.
Its CEO Wang Ning, in an interview with Chinese state media last month, said sales of Labubu will surpass 10 million units per day from September this year.
Pop Mart classifies Labubu under its ""The Monsters"" intellectual property (IP) characters. It said on Tuesday that ""The Monsters"" raked in 4.81 billion yuan ($669.88 million) in the first half, accounting for 34.7% of total revenue.
Four other IPs earned over 1 billion yuan during the period, including ""Molly"" and ""Crybaby"", it added.

The new plan, called ChatGPT Go, provides expanded access to the latest model GPT‑5, and other features at a lower cost, the Microsoft-backed firm said in a statement on its website.
Nick Turley, who leads ChatGPT, said in a social media post that the plan provides 10 times more message limits, image generations and file uploads, plus double the memory compared to the free tier.
""Making ChatGPT more affordable has been a key ask from users! We're rolling out Go in India first and will learn from feedback before expanding to other countries,"" Turley added.
OpenAI currently has two other paid plans: ChatGPT Plus, which costs 1,999 rupees a month in India or $20 internationally, and its top-tier ChatGPT Pro, priced at 19,900 rupees a month in India or $200 internationally.

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is one of the largest retailers in America, whose shares have lost 24% year-to-date. Cramer isn’t a fan of the stock as he has asserted several times in his previous remarks that the firm needs to reduce prices to increase foot traffic in its stores. However, the CNBC TV host prefers Costco and TJX instead, despite believing that Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) has a good balance sheet. This time, he commented on the end of the firm’s partnership with Ulta Beauty:
“I thought that was very significant because that had been something over and over again, Brian Cornell, CEO of Target, had been telling as a great relationship. I think that Ulta has been, if you look at the chart, incredibly strong stock.

Here are Cramer’s previous thoughts about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT):
“It’s easy to spot housing wins extended to beaten-down stocks like the Target or Kohl’s. I’m not a fan of Kohl’s, but I am a fan of Target. And the new buyers, the people who aren’t trapped by Fed dogma, know that there’s fundamental worth to Target, and it’s probably higher than here. You don’t need to worry about what that… worth truly is yet because we’re nowhere near when Target reports.”

The report said that Shein had gone so far as to consult lawyers about setting up a parent company in mainland China, citing people familiar with the matter. However, it added that there was no guarantee that Shein would act upon the preliminary discussions.
Shein, which sources a significant amount of its goods from China, confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong last month, according to a Financial Times report.
That comes after delays in Shein's plans to publicly list in London. The company confidentially filed there over a year ago but has struggled to secure regulatory approval.
Shein did not respond to a request for comment from CNBC.
A London listing had been seen as a potential boon for the Chinese-founded company, providing it more legitimacy for its international business and access to a deep and mature pool of Western investors.
The company, which was founded in Nanjing, China, in October 2008, has long focused on global expansion. Shein registered its headquarters in Singapore in 2019 and has been based there since 2021.
However, the e-commerce platform specializing in fast-fashion has faced mounting policy headwinds in Western markets this year, with U.S. President Donald Trump removing a valuable tariff exemption that had helped it maintain low prices on small shipments from China. Lawmakers in some other Western markets are also considering similar moves.
Even before London, Shein had failed to list in the U.S., where it faced backlash tied to allegations of forced labor in its supply chain.

While calling for ""constructive dialogue,"" the Brazilian government stated that it does not recognize Washington's authority to launch the unilateral investigation.
The probe, initiated in July under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, aims to determine whether Brazil's policies on digital trade and tariffs are ""unreasonable or discriminatory and burden or restrict"" U.S. commerce, according to U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.
This action adds to growing friction between the two countries, including 50% tariffs imposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on imports of Brazilian goods and U.S. sanctions targeting a Brazilian Supreme Court justice.
In its 91-page response, Brazil refuted U.S. arguments concerning its trade practices, including its ethanol market and the popular digital payment system, Pix. The government argued Brazil's acts, policies and practices are not unreasonable, discriminatory or burdensome to U.S. commerce.
Brasilia also objected to the investigation taking place outside the legal framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The government has already requested consultations at the WTO over the U.S. tariffs.
The office of the USTR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""Brazil reiterates its long-standing position that Section 301 is a unilateral instrument inconsistent with the principles and rules of the multilateral trading system,"" Latin America's largest economy said.

Cost of revenue more than doubled to $142.8 million from $74.8 million a year earlier, reflecting higher depreciation for new rigs and increased expenses on SEALMINER production, which compressed gross profit to $12.8 million versus $24.4 million in Q2 2024.
The company recorded a net loss of $147.7 million, compared with a $17.7 million loss in Q2 2024, as non-cash fair-value adjustments on convertible notes and warrants added $108.5 million to other net loss. Adjusted EBITDA fell to $17.3 million from $23.5 million in the prior year.
Bitdeer’s total hash rate under management rose to 30.6 EH/s from 22.3 EH/s, with proprietary capacity at 16.7 EH/s and self-mining hashrate at 16.5 EH/s—up 126% year-over-year—putting the company on track to surpass its 40 EH/s target by year-end.
On Bitdeer’s balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents totaled $299.8 million, while the crypto asset balance stood at $169.3 million as of June 30. Year-to-date capital expenditures energized 361 MW of datacenter capacity, bringing available power to approximately 1.3 GW, with over 1.6 GW expected by December.
Looking ahead, Bitdeer said wafer supply improvements should enable it to exceed the 40 EH/s self-mining goal, and it has entered advanced negotiations with a development partner for its Clarington, Ohio site for future HPC and AI hosting opportunities.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese startup JPYC said it will issue the first stablecoin pegged to the yen later in the year after receiving a licence this week.
The stablecoin, which will be called ""JPYC"", will be fully convertible to the yen and backed by domestic savings and Japanese government bonds (JGBs), the company's CEO Noritaka Okabe told a news conference.
""Initially, we expect demand to come from institutional investors, hedge funds and family offices in Japan,"" he said.
""Eventually, we aim to have JPYC used overseas as digital yen and delivered to people across the world.""
JPYC, which plans to issue the stablecoin around autumn, said it would not charge transaction fees. Instead, the more stablecoins it issues, the more JGBs it will hold, and it would earn money from the interest on those holdings.
Blockchain-based stablecoins - which are typically pegged to a fiat currency and offer faster and cheaper transactions - are gaining much momentum worldwide.
In the U.S., President Donald Trump in July signed into law federal rules and guidelines for stablecoins to facilitate their usage in everyday payments and settlements.
Financial companies from Bank of America to Fiserv are preparing to launch their own dollar-backed crypto tokens, although experts warn the path forward may not be simple.
In contrast, in mainland China, where crypto trading is banned, Chinese regulators have asked big local brokers to halt publication of research endorsing stablecoins in a bid to curb a surge in interest among domestic investors.

""We are looking into carrying out directly on site individual processing steps at the end of the value chain, such as the final cleaning and packaging of commercial knives,"" CEO Carl Elsener said in an interview published on Tuesday.
""That would reduce the value of the goods on which we have to pay customs duty by 10% to 15%,"" he added.
Switzerland has been particularly hard hit by Washington's trade policy under President Donald Trump, who earlier this month ratcheted up U.S. tariffs on Swiss imports to 39%.
The U.S. is an important market for Swiss machinery, watches and chocolate.
Victorinox, which makes commercial knives as well as its well-known pocket knives, generates some 13% of its revenue in the country.
Elsener told WirtschaftsWoche the customs duties were coming at an already difficult time. ""The strong Swiss franc has put our competitiveness and our margins under considerable pressure,"" Elsener said.
Still, high inventories in the U.S. meant the tariffs would not affect Victorinox until early next year, he added. For now, the firm would wait and see how things develop, he said.
Economic uncertainty caused by Trump's trade policies has fueled demand for the safe haven Swiss franc, boosting the currency and making Swiss-made goods dearer abroad.

Intel, a producer of semiconductors, or chips, which are critical for powering AI, saw its stock surge on Friday after Bloomberg reported the US government was considering taking a stake in the company.

Jefferies said MARA's energized hashrate remains the largest of the sector, at 58.9 EH/s at the end of July, with CleanSpark (CLSK) second with 50 EH/s.
Revenue per exahash/second also increased. ""A hypothetical one EH/s fleet of BTC miners would have generated ~$57k/day in revenue during July, vs ~$56k/day in June and ~$50k a year ago,"" the analyst wrote.

-
Dayforce is reportedly discussing a sale to private equity firm Thoma Bravo.
-
Bloomberg said a deal could be announced within a few weeks.
-
Shares of Dayforce took off on the news, but they remain lower year-to-date.
Dayforce (DAY) shares soared more than 20% on indications that private equity firm Thoma Bravo is in talks to purchase the human resources software provider.
Bloomberg reported that people familiar with the matter indicated that an agreement could be reached in as soon as a few weeks. They added that while the discussions are in the advanced stage, they could be delayed or stumble, and another suitor might emerge.
In a note to investors, analysts at Jefferies noted that considering Dayforce's stock had lost 28% year-to-date as of Friday's close and the depressed valuation, ""we are not surprised by PE interest.”
The analysts added they also wouldn’t be surprised to see Dayforce trying to sell because of the weakness in the stock price. They explained that it has been “tough sledding” for the company since the shares’ post-COVID highs, and they have underperformed the entire HR software group since the firm’s April 2018 initial public offering.
Investopedia has reached out to Dayforce and Thoma Bravo for comment.
Even with today’s gains, shares of Dayforce remain down 9% this year.

Fintech company JPYC will register as a money transfer business with the FSA, paving the way for the approval of the first yen stablecoin. JPYC's stablecoin is built to maintain a 1:1 peg with the currency and is backed by liquid assets such as bank deposits and government bonds.
Stablecoins are digital assets that track the value of a traditional financial asset such as a fiat currency. The largest stablecoins such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC are pegged to the dollar, but there are a growing number of tokens that track other currencies such as the euro.
Stablecoins have been at the forefront of regulatory advancements of digital assets this year, with major jurisdictions such as the U.S. and Hong Kong introducing regimes for their licensing and oversight.
