Motley Fool money starts now.\nI'm Travis Hoium I'm joined by Lou Whiteman and Jon Quast. Today, we're going to cover earnings from the. Trade Desk and Crocs get our pulse on the economy. But first, autonomous vehicles have reached something of an inflection point. We've heard from nearly all of the mobility companies over the past two weeks, and the theme is autonomous driving. It's not just Tesla that's talking about autonomy. Uber and Lyft made it a central piece of their earnings releases and conference calls. Mobileye seems to be gaining some traction with Volkswagen. Zoosk got an approval. It needed to roll out its mini bus design to more places. Jon, it seems we're at an inflection for autonomy. Is that really the case today?\nJon Quast: Listen, Travis, is it OK for me to say that I don't really like the idea of autonomous vehicles?\nTravis Hoium: Of course, that it's on brand for you, John.\nJon Quast: I'm going to be behind the wheel of a car with the open road ahead, but I do want to be really fair to your point here about the industry reaching an inflection point. There is, indeed, concrete data that supports that statement. If you look at Waymo, for example, the driverless car division of Tech Giant Alphabet. In late 2020, Waymo launched driverless rides to the general public. By the end of last year, it had completed five million rides. But in May of this year, it announced it had already completed 10 million. It took four years to get the five million rides, then five months to get to another five million. That seems like an inflection point. I like the fact that you mentioned Uber and Lyft here, Travis, because I think that these companies are just looking ahead, seeing the future for what it is, and trying to position themselves accordingly. I like Lyft's vision approach here in particular with fleet management. It's fleet management business flex drive. I think that if ride-hailing truly moves more and more autonomous, I think it's likely that there's going to be large fleets of vehicles, businesses that run fleets of these autonomous vehicles. If you're going to do that, if you're going to put your fleet on a ride-hailing app, you're still going to need fleet management. You're still going to need somebody who's cleaning the cars, making sure the tires are inflated, things like that. Lyft Flex Drive business addresses that potential need in the future, and so that's one of the reasons I do like Lyft here.\nTravis Hoium: It's interesting, all these companies are trying to figure out the business model. Even Waymo has a different business model in Atlanta than it does in Austin than it does in San Francisco, for example. We're really in this testing phase. But speaking of testing, the Chinese automakers seem to be pulling ahead in a lot of different ways. They're going to launch partnerships, at least with companies like Lyft in Europe. Volkswagen is partnering with Mobileye, they've got over 100 vehicles on the road. You have May mobility. Well, the names that we haven't brought up here are the names like General Motors, Ford, Stellantis, the US Detroit Auto Companies. Lou, are they getting left in the dust, or are they waiting in the wings with some brilliant strategy that we just haven't seen yet?\nLou Whiteman: For better or worse, Detroit is sitting on the sidelines, that let in this play out. To be clear, this could be for the worse. I don't think anyone has a real sense of where things will be a decade from now. It could be they are way behind. But I'm inclined to give the benefit of the doubt here. For one, these companies know better than we do, the cost and what goes into autonomous. It isn't like they've had their head in the sand. Ford with Argo, GM with Cruz. They looked at the costs. They looked at the benefits, and they made a choice. I think their calculus here is that, their manufacturing footprint makes them relevant. We will still need vehicles, whether they have steering wheels or not. Look, automakers for the last century have done a good job incorporating new technologies from third-parties into their vehicles. They know how to do this. Travis, all of these players, all these potential options, I think there's at least a chance the actual tech will be somewhat commoditized, that bet will pay off. Just like they used to add cruise control or add all things from other vendors, one day, they'll just add autonomy.\nTravis Hoium: It does seem like everyone is at least trying to lay the groundworks. Lou, you mentioned that it isn't like GM and Ford have been completely asleep at the wheel. They did have acquisitions that they made. They just decided to go a different direction than companies like Tesla have. But look, Elon Musk has been thinking that we could fall asleep in LA and wake up in New York City for over a decade at this point, and we aren't there yet. As we think about this potentially being an inflection point, Uber launched in 2010, and it was unheard of to get into a stranger's car at that point for a ride. A decade later, 110 million people were using Uber. The company was doing seven billion trips a year five years from now, will we be seeing a similar explosion in adoption for autonomy, Jon?\nJon Quast: No, I don't think that we're going to see that same level of explosion and adoption. I think that Uber was addressing something with a wider use case personally. A couple of weeks ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said, I think we'll probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the US by the end of the year. Personally, I would be surprised if it got to half of the US population in five years. The reason being and Musk did allude to this, there's red tape involved here, and for better or for worse, there needs to be consensus on the regulatory front, and in a polarized political environment, sometimes that can be hard to come by. I think where we're going to see autonomy taking off most is where we see ride-hailing thriving right now. The denser the city, the better it is for this kind of adoption.\nLou Whiteman: I'm not going to be [inaudible] here, because I'm in Atlanta. Waymo is all over Atlanta. I was downtown not too long ago early in the morning, and it was just me and a bunch of Waymo's driving positioning themselves for the day, really freaky. You know what? I'm starting to get used to it. I'm starting to get be a believer. Travis, I do think yes, we are going to see an explosion and adoption in the coming years. But I think Jon's right. It's not going to be everywhere. It's not going to be ubiquitous. I think the use case will remain limited or at least not unlimited, if that makes sense. I don't think we're just going the way of everybody right now. We're still a long way from riding around with vehicles without steering wheels. But I think just looking at what's going on in Atlanta, I think that, that can be transferred to other cities, and I think we are going to see just these numbers go up big time very quickly from.\nTravis Hoium: I'm in Minnesota and I saw May mobility vehicle driving around last week. That was a shock to me because this is not usually the place where we're going to be adopting autonomous vehicles first with the winters that we have here. It sounds like there's an opportunity, especially Lou, if you're seeing this, they've only been in Atlanta for a few weeks now. If you're already getting used to it, I think that shows how quickly our attitudes can change about technology. Look, this is an investing podcast. As we're looking at autonomous vehicles stocks and what people may want to be putting on their watch list, what stacks are you looking at, and what metrics are you looking at for success over the next decade, Lou?\nLou Whiteman: This is boring. I'll give you two, though. For me, the big winner here, the one I'm interested in is Alphabet, partially because seeing is believing and what Waymo is doing is really remarkable, so I'm biased by that. Partially because, look, I don't know what's going to happen. I am not convinced, I know what the future is, with how we get around. With Alphabet, you have so many non-transportation ways to win. It feels that Waymo is just the icing on the cake of a good stock, and it feels like cheating. I like that. Second for me is Uber, because, again, as I said before, I do think the actual tech could end up commoditized, just like with Apple and their control of the consumer and what that gives them with the phone space. Having the customer already. The customer might be what everyone fights over, and Uber has it already.\nJon Quast: Travis, for me, I don't know which direction this space is going to go, so I do like something that's a little bit more automaker agnostic, platform agnostic. I do like businesses that have large first party data sets. For me, Mobileye does check a lot of boxes in that regard. In 2022, it said it had over 200 petabytes of driving data. I'm not sure exactly where that number is today, but that's a lot of data that it can use to train these models that are so needed for really widespread adoption in the space.\nTravis Hoium: The companies that are talking about collecting a lot of data, the Tesla's, the Rivian's of the world, Mobileye is just hiding there in plain sight. They are on millions of vehicles today, their technology may be on the vehicle that you're driving if you have something like Smart Cruise Control or lenses. That probably comes from mobilize. It'll be interesting. The other one that we brought up here that I think on that demand side is going to be interesting to watch, if I can just add one is Lyft, I think Uber and Lyft aggregating that demand and trying to commoditize those supply. Uber is investing a lot of money in partnerships to effectively make sure there's a dozen suppliers for autonomous vehicles and autonomous technology. This will be fascinating to see playout, but don't be surprised if this is bigger than we all think a decade from now. When we come back, GPT-5 is here. This is Motley Fool Money.\nJon Quast: I would love to answer with a simple yes or no here, but I think that an answer requires a little bit more nuance than that. In the GPT-5 demo, one of the things that the presenters did was have it explain the Bernoulli effect. That's something important for aerodynamics. In GPT-5 answer, it wasn't completely accurate. Now, the parts that were inaccurate weren't necessarily GPT-5 fault. It's a common repeated wrong answer out there. AI can only do as well as the input that it's been trained with. If you get a wrong input, you're going to have a wrong output. That would seem to be the case there, just minor thing. But I don't want to undersell this tech, either. While they were doing this demo, they created a language learning app for French, on the fly, made a little game, and Duolingo stock actually took a hit during this demonstration because it was so fast. It was so effective. In some regards, I would say that GPT is a step forward here, but it's not necessarily a game changer.\nLou Whiteman: Travis, I chuckle, too at Altman's comparison because I do think it's telling that we're using vague other product comparisons, and that's what we're gunning at, because look, he's marketing the product. He's trying to capture the imagination as he should be. Do I believe it? I believe it's better than what came before, and I believe the next iteration will be better than this. The important thing is, is that do customers believe it? Because OpenAI needs customers. As a consumer, I personally have found models that I like better. As an investor, I can't buy and OpenAI even if I want to, so I'm not going to waste too much of my personal processing power trying to figure out the rate of progress. I think everybody's making progress here, and we're all just racing toward the unknown. It's better, and it will continue to get better, end of story.\nTravis Hoium: There are a dozen companies or more that this is relevant too. One that we've talked about recently is Alphabet. Google Cloud grew 32% in the most recent quarter. They're actually running some of ChatGPT now. Gemini, which is their competing app is up to 450 million monthly active users. ChatGPT said they were at 700 million weekly active users, so we can't never have Apples to Apples numbers. But is this the improvement that is going to stop a product like Gemini or maybe make impact on Microsoft's productivity tools as they make their way into enterprise, Lou?\nLou Whiteman: First of all, I don't know what to make of these user numbers. I have to be honest. For OpenAI or anyone, I am constantly getting nagging pop ups when I'm in Excel telling me to use Copilot. Does that make me an active user? Every Gmail I get, I get a summary that I basically ignore. Am I an active Gemini user because of that? These numbers, I believe, again, are made for effect.\nLou Whiteman: That said, there's definitely stuff going on here. What I would say is, I know we are very early in this race. There is no winner yet. I don't think anything OpenAI did this week makes them a winner. Yes, ChatGPT has some really impressive numbers, but Microsoft and Alphabet have what OpenAI can only dream of: reliable conduits to the end users. All those things that I said are annoying today. They can get a lot better, and they are sitting there right in front of me. They don't have to market that. It is already right there. I'm not going to predict the doom of Copilot or Gemini, even if this is as amazing as Altman says it is. We're still early in the race, and Microsoft and Alphabet have advantages that OpenAI just don't.\nJon Quast: I agree with Lou here. Look, even if GPT-5 is an order of magnitude superior than everything else out there, these big tech giants aren't just going to take that lying down. They've already invested so much in their AI products that they're going to keep doing that. It's not going to derail the other tech companies as far as their own roadmaps, including Elon Musk's xAI. I'm not sure in the end which platform is going to demand the most users, which one's going to make the most money. I think right now everyone's still just trying to build and push the envelope as far as they can.\nTravis Hoium: The reports are that the next Gemini, which would be three, is waiting in the wings for OpenAI to release this. Well, the other piece that we heard this week is that OpenAI's employees in a secondary offering are potentially going to be able to sell their stock at a $500 billion valuation. Now, we don't have all the financial information that you would get from an S one that is pre IPO, but based on what we know, John, are you a buyer at that price?\nJon Quast: Absolutely not, Travis. Mostly because I'm not 100% sure that it can deliver 500 billion in shareholder value. You think about these AI models. Do all of these AI models out there reach the same capabilities for the end user? If they do, then there is a somewhat of a commoditization risk and consequently, a lower profit margin risk over the long term. OpenAI, congrats on everything you've done so far. I'll use GPT-5 for things here and there, but I'll invest my money other places.\nLou Whiteman: What he said. I know, harping on valuation. Many of fortunes have missed because you're too caught up in valuation, but I want to see more results and more what the meat is here before I can look past valuation. I believe in AI. I believe in the future. I believe there are so many ways to ride the coattails of AI and benefit from its continued process. Like what we said about mobility, there are so many better diversified bets. I'm not going to pay up and pay a high valuation for a concentrated bet on one system. It's just too early for that.\nTravis Hoium: Let's get to an early look at earnings before our next break. As we've gone through earnings season, we haven't gotten a lot of warning signs about the consumer, but Crocs reported earnings, and the stock dropped 29%. Tariffs were part of the story. Crocs' inventory was part of the story. But what was the takeaway that we need to take from Crocs' big drop this week, John?\nJon Quast: Well, Travis, I think the story here is really specific to Crocs. I don't think it's so much of a tariff issue. In reality, management had laid out previously a worst-case scenario for tariffs for the business. Based on where the policy is at right now, the business isn't facing the worst-case scenario, so that's good. Inventory is a little bit high for Crocs, but they were basically trying to get the inventory in before some of the tariffs took place. It's not really a big concern. I think the big story here is that Crocs acquired a company called HEYDUDE, a shoe brand called HEYDUDE, back in early 2022 for 2.5 billion. It still really isn't living up to expectations. Profits haven't improved as they've hoped, and now Crocs had to take a goodwill impairment charge of $737 million. That stinks for shareholders because it means that Crocs overpaid for HEYDUDE back in 2022. The silver lining here is that it's a non-cash charge. It does impact the second quarter headline numbers, and I think that investors were a little bit spooked by that. But in reality, it didn't really make any money changes to the business. There's at least a little bit of consolation in that.\nTravis Hoium: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

Next up, we are going to get to The Trade Desk, which is down almost 40% on Friday, and we're going to play buy, sell, or hold. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nThe biggest news to end the week was the trade desk. As we're recording early on Friday, shares are down 38%. They reported a 19% increase in revenue from a year ago, guided to 14% growth for the third quarter. There's a lot going on and a tough comp to 2024, which included political ad spending. But the market obviously didn't like what it saw. Why is that, John?\nJon Quast: I've got a hot take for you, Travis. I believe that investors are starting to question whether The Trade Desk can compete in the age of artificial intelligence. I'm not saying it can't. I'm saying that the investing community is starting to question it. For years, this business has consistently delivered red-hot growth above expectations, and it was consequently rewarded with one of the highest valuations ever for an advertising technology stock. Fast forward to now, the company is transitioning to its AI platform called Kokai. Now, CEO Jeff Green says that three-quarters of its clients ' spending is already on the Kokai platform and that it's delivering way better results for its customers. Green went on to talk about how much everybody loves it, but here's the problem. Revenue growth is slowing down big time. Meanwhile, there are other companies using AI in advertising, such as AppRaven or Reddit, where the growth is still red hot. I think that investors are starting to wonder, is The Trade Desks AI really as good as management says, and so that ding in the confidence is bringing down the valuation.\nLou Whiteman: I'm one investor that is not ready to hit the panic button, not by a long shot. I still think The Trade Desk is set up really, really well to be a winner in this space. But look, not all as well. Clearly, I think we knew this was not going to be a winner-take-all category. The competition looks fierce. A little company called Amazon, I think we've heard of it. They're involved in making deals with some big Trade Desk partners. History shows Amazon isn't really that fun to compete with. Suddenly, we're looking at a company in a highly competitive market, growing revenue at 19%. That's fine. Nineteen percent is good. But given the factors, is 19% growth worth 50 times forward earnings, which is where they were before today? That's a tough question. I think that's the question investors are asking themselves post-earnings. As an investor, me personally, I'm holding on, but given the valuation, given the risks, given the uncertainty about how many people will be in this market and how tough it'll be, I'm not in any rush to add to my position even down 30%. I'm still watching and waiting.\nTravis Hoium: They reported that dreaded word deceleration in growth. That's one of the things when you look at stocks that are going out of favor with the market, it's often coincides with their revenue growth. Maybe it's still being positive, but going down compared to what it was, and their compound revenue growth was almost 50% over the past decade. Definitely a little lower than that now. We do like to have some fun in this segment, and after a massive earnings week and some huge stock moves, I wanted to get an idea of where you're at with some of these companies. We're going to just play buy, sell, or hold. Let's start with a company that we've already talked about here. John, where are you at with Crocs?\nJon Quast: I think that Crocs stock is a buy if you're playing the long game, which I think you should be if you're an investor. The shoes are still very popular. The profit margins are down, but they're still quite good for a shoe company, and the stock is absolutely cheap. The company's paying down debt. It's buying back stock at these cheap stock levels. It's stagnating sales. There are stagnating sales. This does point to maybe over the near term, over the medium term, the stock might not do much, but those strong profits, the cheap stock price, bode well for holders who are willing to be patient.\nLou Whiteman: I'm a sell, or really, I'm more, I would never have bought. I own pairs of Crocs. I like Crocs, but consumer retail is so hard. I'm not good at spotting trends. I have nothing bad to say about the shoes. I think John makes a good point on the companies, but there's some games that I just rather sit out. For me, Crocs is one I'd rather just not get involved with.\nTravis Hoium: Price of free cash flow for Crocs now is at five. This is about as cheap as stocks get, you would think, but maybe that's a value trap in the making. Let's talk about a company that I've had on my watch list for a long time, but never actually bought. Shift4, Lou, what do you think?\nLou Whiteman: I'm going to sell here, too, Travis, and I can't figure out how any of these companies in this space can differentiate themselves. I get that they're sticky once they're installed because who wants to rip out one system and put in another? But a lot of their core customers these are businesses with pretty high failure rates, so you still get churn, even if they are sticky products. I feel like this could end up being one of these sectors and Shift4 one of these companies where it always has potential and never quite lives up to it. Again, I hate to be boring here, but I'm just sitting this one out, too.\nJon Quast: Wow. Our second stock and my second disagreement with my friend Lou. But I'm going to rate Shift4 as a buy here, down over 30% from its 52-week highs. I think that it's down right now because investors are a little bit spooked by some of the things that they saw. It just made a 2.5 billion dollar acquisition of an international fintech company called Global Blue. It seems that the recent quarterly numbers were impacted by that. Investors also seem spooked that the chief financial officer abruptly resigned. That can be something to watch. Sometimes that is a warning signal. But I think if you look at the quarter, if you look at the guidance, things actually looked great with its customers.\nJon Quast: I don't really see that high failure rate, especially with the ones that are very large venues. It really has focused in on those very large venues. Many of the NFL teams now are partners with Shift4, trading at just two times sales in spite of its very robust growth. I think this is a buy-and-hold.\nTravis Hoium: Next, let's go to one of the more controversial stocks in the market. Hims & Hers down about 20% this week after reporting earnings. Novo Nordisk, which was a former partner, filed a bunch of lawsuits, although not against Hims & Hers that we know of right now. Lou, what do you think of this?\nLou Whiteman: I'd really like to buy this at some point, but to be honest, down 20% is not enough for me. I am going to wait until we work out this GLP drama. Compounding pharmacies come with a lot of risk, but there really is an opportunity here to be part of a much-needed transformation in healthcare. I get the appeal. I think Hims & Hers, if they do it right, can be part of the answer. But between valuation and the potential for long, drawn-out legal battles, I'm punting for now, and it's on my radar list for one day.\nTravis Hoium: John, what about you?\nJon Quast: The fear of missing out is strong with this one, but at the end of the day, Hims & Hers is a company that I don't really feel like I understand. I don't really follow the drug companies. I know you have an opinion here, so I'd really be interested in what you have to say.\nTravis Hoium: This is one of the interesting earnings reports from the week because if you're a short-term investor or a bear, there's something to like. If you're a long-term investor and maybe a bull or a bear, there's something to grab onto there, as well. The results weren't great. I think that goes without saying because their core business essentially dropped slightly in the quarter, but the long-term story here, the disruption that Lou mentioned is, I think, stronger than ever, they're adding more and more products. They're bringing lab testing in. They brought up memberships, bringing in longevity next year. I think this is the kind of healthcare platform that's going to be very disruptive, and the opportunity is just too big to ignore. Very high risk. That, I think, goes without saying because Lou is right, compounding businesses tend to fall by the wayside every now and again. But the fact that Novo Nordisk has not sued Hims & Hers despite all the things that they have said about the company and their partnership and their operations, I think tells us that maybe that's not a battle they actually want to fight. I'm a hold, but this is a stock that I have a pretty big holding in, so I would love to actually see it drop more and buy more. But speaking of expensive and popular stocks, let's get to Palantir. This one just always amazes me. I thought 100 price to sales multiple was going to be high, but we're well over that. Lou, what do you think about Palantir today?\nLou Whiteman: Sell reluctantly because I love the technology. I'm fascinated by the company, but the stock is up more than 500% in a year. Palantir is still about 50% government revenue. Look, government revenue just doesn't grow fast enough to justify that valuation. It just needs to be commercial. That's going to take a while. If they can sustain this pace, if they can keep doing what they're doing at this valuation, they will be in rare company. Again, I feel like such a Debbie Downer. But if you have these gains, sell and maybe get in later, I just can't be a type to chases this high valuation.\nJon Quast: It's up 1,500% in the last three years. I agree with Lou. This is a opportunity to sell, in my opinion. You look at the valuation over the last year, I was already high, and now it's up another 400% over just the past year. The thing for me, really with Palantir is it's valued at 430 billion right now. You got to figure that the company needs to return 12%, 15% a year to outperform the S&P 500 over the next five years. I don't know if it has enough growth to do that over the medium term here, so for me, it's a sale.\nTravis Hoium: Palantir trading for 124 times sales. They have a five-year compound annual growth rate of 31% right now. Those are backward-looking numbers, and we're expecting strong growth in the future. But let's go to another expensive stock trading for 29 times sales, but a higher growth rate of 32.3%. That's Exxon Enterprise. This has been a phenomenal winner for a lot of Fools. John, where are you at with this?\nJon Quast: It's going to sound like I'm talking out of both sides of my mouth here. I said sell for Palantir and that's mostly valuation. Here it's a high valuation, but I'm going to say buy Exxon. There is valuation risk. As you mentioned, maybe the highest valuation multiple it's traded at in over a decade. The difference here is that it's valued at 70 billion. Its backlog is growing faster than revenue. Its addressable market is expanding with government contracts, with international markets, with just even new opportunities such as drones and it has really few true competitors, so I say that Exxon's stock remains a buy at the high valuation. Just be aware that that is a risk.\nLou Whiteman: I echo everything John says. I'm a buyer here, too, despite my better judgment. Just to emphasize a couple of things, their ability to not only continue to reach out to new customers, and there's a ton of every law enforcement agency in the world as a potential customer, so a huge number, but also to layer on products that used to be tasers then tasers and bodycam. Then adding software and now street cameras, just their ability to not only find new customers, but to sell more to each customer. It's a great business. It's highly valued, but I'm a buyer.\nTravis Hoium: Their growth has just astounded me, and it's one of those lessons in not selling your winners. I think I thought the stock was expensive at $100 per share. Right now, we're almost at $900 per share. Just hang on to those winners as long as they're performing well. I want to go to a company that didn't report earnings this week, but we got a recent IPO. The stock is up over 100% since its IPO, at least the IPO price, but the drawdown, so since its peak as a publicly traded company down about 36%. Lou, where's your head at with Figma? Is this a buy, sell, or hold?\nLou Whiteman: I'm happy to say, as a policy, I do not buy IPOs for at least six months, so I can punt that way, but I'm very intrigued by this. The funny thing is Figma is right now, we call it adobe competitor Figma. My gut is five years from now, they will be highly successful, and that part of the business, I don't know if it would be an afterthought, but it would be so many other things. I like the optionality here. This is another Peter Thiel. Like Palantir, Peter Thiel incubated company. They've already said, \"We're going to use the proceeds to do whatever we think is best.\" It's like just handing a pile of cash to smart people and seeing what becomes of it. I'm very intrigued.\nJon Quast: I'm going to call this a sell, and I'm reluctant to do that here because Figma, to me, does have some really good numbers. Seventy-eight percent of the Forbes 2000 use its services, revenue is growing at 48%. Its gross margin is over 90%. Those are fantastic. But what I can't do here is fully account for the risk that artificial intelligence presents to a platform like this as an investor. Circling back to what we talked about with GPT-5, it just created something out of just some prompts. Is AI going to disrupt this kind of a business? I'm simply not tech savvy enough to know for sure, and so that uncertainty with the AI risk, I'm just inclined to stay away.\nTravis Hoium: Let's go over to social media. We heard from Reddit this week, and the stock has jumped. John, are you at a buy, sell, or hold with Reddit today?\nJon Quast: I'm surprisingly in the buy camp right now, Travis. This is one that I didn't expect to be here, but I was just looking into this company here recently again. One of the interesting things is it's one of the few social media platforms out there right now where pricing on its advertisements is going up. It has over 100 million people visiting its site every single day. That's already a huge base of users that very high potential. If you look at its average revenue per visitor to the site, I would say that the platform is quite under-monetized. The demand for its ad slots are going up, as evidenced by the higher pricing in the most recent quarter, that can sustain a strong growth rate for a long time and also strong profitability, so I'm calling Reddit a buy.\nLou Whiteman: I agree with you it's under-monetized, but this strikes me. We saw it with Twitter. We saw it even with Pinterest. I feel like solving the under-monetization problem is harder than I think it is. I'm probably a sell here. Love the platform, love what they're doing, but I don't know if they'll be able to solve that problem.\nTravis Hoium: This continues to be a key piece of data for a lot of the AI companies. If you look at the source data, whether you're looking at Gemini or ChatGPT, it always comes from Reddit, so it seems like there is a sustainable business there, but I agree, this is a hard one. Next up, we are going to get an idea what stocks Lou and John have on their radar. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.\nWe like to end the show with stocks on our radar. John, you're up first. What's on your radar this week?\nJon Quast: On my radar is a company called Universal Display, ticker symbol OLED. This company is really high up on my watchlist right now. It holds a ton of patents in the OLED display space. That gives it somewhat of a competitive mote. It has very strong profit margins because it does have a monopoly on this technology. Right now, what makes it interesting is that it's developing the next generation of OLED products. That should make everything better looking, more energy efficient. The device space is somewhat cyclical, but eventually there should be a major upgrade cycle that should benefit Universal Display's business and consequently OLED stock. I'm not sure when that's going to happen, though, so investors do need to be patient here. But here's the thing. It's a mid-sized company, and it has a great balance sheet with over 500 million in cash, doesn't have any debt, and it does pay a modest dividend. So there's plenty of reason that you can be patient with this one.\nTravis Hoium: John, what does OLED stand for?\nJon Quast: Organic light-emitting diode.\nTravis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about Universal Display?\nDan Boyd: John, quick question for you. Does this company actually make anything, or are they really just a patent-holding company?\nJon Quast: They're basically licensing the technology and selling the supplies needed to make the stuff.\nDan Boyd: Interesting. Thank you.\nTravis Hoium: Lou, what's on your radar this week?\nLou Whiteman: I'm looking at a company called Montrose Environmental, ticker MEG. This is a roll-up of small local environmental cleanup and monitoring companies. Stock is down 20% over the past year, in part due to some company-specific operational issues, and in part, look, the political climate right now, guys, it's not perceived to be more stringent toward environmental regulations. But here's the deal. The company reported this week a big top and bottom line beat. They said full-year guidance at a range well above the consensus estimate. They have a ton of patents here, including patents to take microplastics out of water, so they have a lot of ways to win. Honestly, a national company, instead of [inaudible] companies, when you're dealing with big national corporations that have environmental monitoring needs all over the country, I think there's a real appeal there. Sub-billion dollars, got to get it right, but I think this could be a big winner and a growth opportunity.\nTravis Hoium: Dan, what do you think?\nDan Boyd: You made a good point in there, Lou. Environmental regulations aren't exactly on the upswing these days. It seems like we're about to go weapons free on water. Do you really think in the next five years, this is going to return on anyone's investment?\nLou Whiteman: Dan, let me give you the other side of that. The stripping away and the federal government being active in trying to set environmental regulations actually could remove a lot of the uncertainty of every little small town trying to set their own hurdles, so it actually could speed the process, maybe not in ways that environmentalists want, but if anything, it could work out in their favor.\nTravis Hoium: Dan, which one is going on your watch list?\nDan Boyd: As much as I think that environmental stuff is important and a good investment in the future, I just don't know about it in the next few years, so we're going to go OLED, baby.\nTravis Hoium: Lou Whiteman, Jon Quast, Dan Boyd behind the glass in the entire Motley Fool team.

This is Motley Fool Money. This is Motley Fool Money. Thanks for listening. I'm Tyler Crowe, joined by longtime Fools, Matt Frankel and Jon Quast. We got a pretty busy slate today. We're going to cover big earnings from Sea Limited Circle Internet Group and DLocal, and we're going to tackle some of the most significant developments in space investing in quite some time. But first, we're going to talk about animal spirits and take a pulse of the market because I think it's something really on people's minds lately. Now, Gens, you and I have been writing about companies in the market for several years now, and one thing our editors love is when there's gigantic numbers in the headlines. Now, Jon, when we were doing a little show prep, showed us, going in that said there were some rather large headline numbers that made you, your eyes pop out a little bit. What did you see?\nJon Quast: Well, it regards money on the sideline, Tyler, and the most recent number that I've seen here is that there's $7.4 trillion in money market funds, which is far and away a record high. This is money that could be invested in stocks. But right now, it's just sitting there and passively earning interest. I think the knee jerk reaction to a number like this is that maybe stocks could soar if investors decide to suddenly move that money out of money market funds and into stocks. Maybe when the Fed lowers the rates, that will be incentive enough for people to change up their strategies, and then stocks will moon, as the kids say.\nTyler Crowe: As the kids say, certainly not the three of us are saying that because that's way beyond our age category. But, Matt, when it comes to big headlines and getting back to our editors, we actually got to deliver on what those numbers mean. When we hear 7.4 trillion, it sounds like a lot, but, in context, is that really a lot compared to what, the market is?\nMatt Frankel: It is. Just to run down some of the numbers, there is roughly $60 trillion in US stock market valuations combined. That means more than 12% of it is in potentially investable money sitting on the sidelines. As long as interest rates remain relatively high, I don't see a big rotation into the stock market, and it is likely to be gradual over time. You get a quarter point rate cut, some of it would come into stocks. It wouldn't be seven trillion dollars jumping into the market at once. But if risk free interest rates come down, which a money market fund is a risk free interest rate, it could be another story altogether. There's only so much money that would ever rotate out. Investors always keep some cash. That wouldn't go from 7.4 trillion to zero. But it could have a big impact. It's also worth mentioning that's just money market funds. That doesn't include people who put money in, high yield savings, CD accounts, short term treasuries, and all these other, risk free investments just because rates are high.\nTyler Crowe: Look, we're not going to accuse anyone of clickbait here, but, let's be real. Investors being completely reasonable and holding 12% of their portfolio in cash, it's really not going to get a lot of people, looking at the top of the news site for that sort of information. But that said, beyond the $7.4 trillion, there's an important lesson here for investors when it comes to signal and noise, don't you think, Jon?\nJon Quast: I was being facetious earlier. There's totally a lesson here that we can learn. The headlines are what they're trying to get you to read. It's always better to have a good unprecedented record number in the headline to get your attention, but it's always good to keep an open mind and say, what is there more to this headline that maybe I'm not being told? Here's another unprecedented thing that's out there right now. If you've ever heard of the so called Buffett indicator, named after famous investor Warren Buffett. This is a measure of market valuations compared to the GDP. It just hit 212%, whereas Warren Buffett says 100% is a more fairly valued market. Essentially, what this is saying is that the market is two times or more overvalued. On the same token, a Bank of America just had a survey that said a record number of fund managers, 91% say that stocks are overvalued, 91% of these people who make a living by investing money, they're sitting there waving the warning flag. Stocks are overvalued. But again, maybe that's only half the story in both of these cases. Take the Buffett indicator. The economy wasn't globalized back when it first came out. We're a much more global economy. Comparing US stock markets to US GDP isn't as good of an indicator as it used to be. Then you take the Bank of America survey, 91% are saying it's overvalued, but at the same time, fund managers cash levels are dropping and are below four percent right now, so they're saying overvalued, but at the same time, they're still investing their money.\nTyler Crowe: It's throwing up a lot of, different signals here. You're talking about survey saying things are overvalued. The case Schiller cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio stands at 37.5. That's like the third highest reading after the.com bubble and the 2021 boom. Similarly, the potential growth indicator, which is a metric actually developed here at the Motley Fool, and something that's used to inform decisions about the hidden gems portfolio is also signaling similar market signals that things are a little overvalued right now. When you hear these things of, like, you know, overvalued, all these survey numbers, things like that. I'm going to start with you, Matt. Sorry. How does this inform or influence your investing decisions?\nMatt Frankel: Well, it does, but it's important to mention what these valuation metrics are all talking about. When you hear the Buffett indicator says the stock market is overvalued. That essentially is talking about the S&P 500. That makes up over 80% of the stock market. You're talking about the big companies, and that's really what's been driving the growth. If you apply that same indicator to say just the Russell 2000 or just emerging markets or any of these other smaller indices, it tells a completely different story. But, yes, I absolutely use these valuation metrics to inform my decisions, especially in regards to deciding what parts of the market to invest in. Tyler, I know both you and I see a lot of opportunities in international stocks right now because they're not nearly as frothy looking as US large caps. That's just one example of how I use this in my thought process.\nTyler Crowe: Jon, same question to you. Do numbers about the market conditions that we just talked about actually change your approach to buying stocks?\nJon Quast: No, market conditions don't really change my approach. If I've learned anything over the last decade of investing, I've learned that it's really important to put new money to work regularly. This is a core part of the Motley Fool investing approach. It really works. I don't know what the market can do, and information can change on a dime. If you remember the banking crisis just a couple of years ago, that started with just a post on social media and quickly spiraled out of control. Nobody could have predicted that that would have been what happened. Why bother trying to predict something if it is futile at the outset? Especially when you consider every single year, every three years, over a five year span, there are always some stocks that have rewarded shareholders quite well. My job is not to find out what the market is going to do tomorrow. My job is to find those investment opportunities that are going to be good over the next 3-5 years.\nTyler Crowe: Letting businesses do the heavy lifting for you is always a great approach. Coming up next, we're going to look at space, the final frontier of investing.\nADVERTISEMENT: Hello, podcast fans. I'm Bradley Simpson. When I think about the stories that stayed with me, one that immediately comes to mind is router. A talented router who just wants to cook and honestly, I was glued to my screen straightaway. Now I'm hooked on FX's The Bear on Disney Plus. I love everything about it. I love the styling, attention, the drama. It's the best thing I've watched in ages. Only the great stories stay with you for a lifetime. Honestly, it's true. What would be your next great story on Disney Plus?\nFEMALE_1: Copyright, 2025 Disney and it's related entities, 18 plus subscription required.\nTyler Crowe: We're back, and I'm glad that this is an audio podcast because the looks of exasperation from that really cringy transition from Jon and Matt would make for not so good video. But let's talk space investing because it has been a very busy week for the industry. We won't be able to cover all of it. I want to focus on three stories from the past week. One, the Trump administration has issued an executive order to loosen regulations on commercial space companies, especially around licensing and permitting or launches. The United Launch Alliance, the Boeing and Lockheed Joint Venture, that's been the backbone of commercial space for decades. Just launched its new Vulcan rocket for its first commercial mission and kind of trying to compete again with SpaceX. Then we also have Firefly Aerospace, which is another orbital launch company with its own, set of bona fides in terms of what it's capable of. Had a rather successful IPO last week where its shares popped 38% on its debut. Now, Matt, you follow Hidden Gems darling Rocket Lab very much in this space area. Now, when you see this trio of stories, you've got, looser regulations and then two competitors kind of showing bona fides again. Do you see this as a net positive or a net negative for Rocket lab?\nMatt Frankel: Well, the Loser regulations are definitely a net positive, but when it comes to the competitors, the space economy, for one thing, it's so massive that there are terms for several big winners, especially in terms of future potential. I'm not terribly worried about the others. Rocket lab next to SpaceX is the most successful launcher ever and has done 64 successful launches. There's a lot of future need for, the simple way to say it is launching things into space. There's room for a lot of growth for a lot of companies here. Rocket labs also uses a lot more of a razor and blades model. They're more of an integrated provider of space. They not only manufacture and launch rockets, they manufacture components for rockets. They provide servicing. As the business grows and as the space economy evolves, there's a lot of different ways they could take that, which could give them a nice little competitive edge.\nTyler Crowe: I read the prospectus for Firefly Aerospace, and to be honest, knee jerk reaction is that this business model looks an awful lot like Rocket lab. Now, Jon, you recently studied up on and wrote about the Firefly Aerospace IPO. Did anything in particular stand out to you?\nJon Quast: I think the thing that stood out most to me was that this company really wants you to know that it landed on the moon. It feels like every answer to every question and every interview was that Firefly Aerospace has landed on the moon, and look, I get it. Landing on the moon is a really cool thing. I'm happy for the company. I'm fascinated by space exploration personally. I love the idea of a permanent moon base. The company has talked about maybe it can be involved in getting a nuclear reactor on the moon. That's something that the current administration wants to make happen. Look, I get it. The moon landing is reason for optimism when it comes to the long-term prospects of this business. Now, I will say that according to Firefly's own filings, it's targeting markets that could be worth $40 billion one day. It's not targeting the entire space economy. As of this taping, it's valued at more than seven billion. That's actually a pretty steep valuation in relation to the size of the market it's going after. It's also what stood out to me is it's still operating at a gross loss, and that's probably going to continue for a little while. Now, it is going to try to make reusable rockets. It's working in collaboration with Northrop Grumman, so that should be able to get some cost down eventually. But for now, the financials look pretty rough. It doesn't really have a predictable revenue stream. SpaceX has Starlink. That's a predictable thing I can count on. Firefly Aerospace is going to be a little bit choppier. It's going to depend on its launches. It's going to depend on its moon landings. I think there's still a little bit of risk here. The valuation is high. I'm on the sidelines personally, but very interesting company.\nTyler Crowe: I think my biggest thing from reading all of this, especially with the Firefly Aerospace IPOs, both for Rocket lab, Firefly, the biggest question I actually I have right now is how much success will they have building relationships with clients that basically aren't NASA, the DOD and Space Force, and basically government contracts? Those are great clients to have and customers, but, they can only spend so much money. This industry is becoming more competitive by the day. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a few more orbital launch companies go public in a year or two. I think it's something we certainly want to keep an eye on. Coming up next, the best of last week's earnings.\nWe're mostly through earning season, and the postmortem of the second quarter is starting to come out. According to FactSet Data aggregator, 81% of companies that have reported so far this quarter have reported earnings per share results actually above Wall Street analyst estimates. Now, if it holds for the entire quarter, we're only about 90% of companies reporting, it'll be the most companies to report above estimates in two years and well above the 10 year average for beating markets. Now, I'm tempted to rant about analysts giving easy hurdles to clear, but, this is a family show, so we'll keep that for another time. Well, what we know is that a lot of companies have beat earnings, but there were some recent results that, have really stood out in the past week or so. Jon, I want you to go first, and which one did you see?\nJon Quast: Thanks, Tyler. I was quite surprised with results from dLocal, symbol DLO. Stock is up nicely here after earnings. This is a small Uruguayan Fintech company that specializes in cross-border payments. It's led by former MercadoLibre Executive Pedo Arndt, so it does have some experience management, but investors have historically been really nervous with this one. Basically, dLocal is building some payment rails on its own that help cross-border payments. Over time, it's been taking a smaller and smaller cut of transactions. This is called its take rate. The gross profit margin has been going down over time, even though revenue growth has been quite substantial. You can see this in its most recent guidance here for 2025. It expects total payment volume growth of 40%-50%. That's red hot, but it only expects revenue growth of 30%-40%. A smaller cut of that payment volume to actually be its revenue. The fear here is that it's going to keep deteriorating more and more over time. The profit margins are going to go down. That said, even with that long-term concern, I think that at some point, there's a really interesting business here that could be worth earning. It's really focusing on these emerging market economies. That's where the growth is happening. Think Africa, think South America. Revenue has doubled over the last three years. It's getting approval to operate in more countries. Its net revenue retention rate of 145% says its customers are using it more over time. It's free cash flow positive. The share count is down. There's a lot of things to like here. If we can start getting clarity on how low is that gross profit margin going to go and stabilize, once it does stabilize, this could be a rewarding investment.\nTyler Crowe: It's interesting. There's a lot of growth because cross-border payments is one of those things that people can be very frustrated with. Somebody who spent some time overseas can very much attest to that. But also, like the discussion about space, there seems to be a lot of companies coming out of the woodwork to fix cross-border payments, which actually explains the declining take rate you alluded to here. Since we're talking about cross-border payments, Matt, I'm going to kind of interject and do mine first, but, it's the stablecoin Company Circle Internet Group, which is CRCL. Now, it didn't report an earnings beat because it actually doesn't have any earnings yet. It went public a couple of weeks ago, and as a result, it had a lot of one time expenses related to its IPO. Some of those things can be hard to sparse out of what precisely it was and wasn't a one time cost, which can be a challenge for a lot of investors. No matter what management says, sometimes, those one times become a little more recurring. What was impressive, though, was that 58% year over year increase in revenue for this company. There's a lot of buzz around stable coins and their ability to handle cross-border payments and transactions and things like that after the Trump administration passed the Genius Act, which sets some regulatory frameworks for stable coins, I would say legitimized in the space a little bit more for institutional investors and things like that. There's clearly an appetite for stable coins that Circle is serving with its USDC coin and its EURC stable coins, basically matching US dollars and Euros.\nNow, here's what I find fascinating about this business, and it's a weird quick is that even though it is in the abyss of minting and redeeming stable coins in US dollar and Euros, the vast majority of its revenue actually comes from the interest earned on the cash of dollars and Euros that it holds, while, people own their stable coins. I am genuinely curious how circles business will perform in a declining interest rate environment, which is something that the Federal Reserve has been hinting at least certain governors and other players in government have been asking for for a while, if your entire business is making interest rates spread, that, might hit revenue, Matt, I know you're chomping at the bit to discuss Sea limited because I think we've seen it a couple times in some slack group channels and things like that. You have the floor.\nMatt Frankel: First of all, I love Circle. I'm glad to see them having success. I've known their leaders since the early days. I had dinner with them at a 2014 conference when they were valued at something like five million dollars, so I'm so thrilled to see them having the success they are. Sea Limited was the best performing stock in my portfolio last year. Of course, I'm going to talk about it. It was up 162% last year, and it's up another 65% this year, including a 20% post earnings pop just last week. There's good reason because just a few years ago, the company was losing money hand over fist. In 2022, it reported a net loss of $1.7 billion and had just single digit really just agonizingly slow revenue growth. One of its segments was declining. Last year, it grew revenue by 28% and was nicely profitable. It really turned things around. This year, it's looking even better. In the most recent quarterly report, C increased its revenue by 38% year-over-year, and all three of its business segments were doing really well. For example, the SHAPE, which is their e-commerce platform grew sales by 34%. The digital entertainment platform, which was left for dead by investors a couple years ago, is a declining business is guiding for 30% bookings growth year-over-year. Not only that, but gross profit in the company grew by 50% year-over-year. Net income was roughly 5X what it was a year ago, so the margins are improving very quickly. The stock still trades for about 45 times forward earnings. It has large market opportunities. It's not cheap, but with the growth numbers it's putting up, it's not that expensive either.\nTyler Crowe: I would love to get into these numbers a little bit deeper, but unfortunately, that's actually all the time we have for today. We're going to have to, leave it at that and maybe a discussion we can have a little bit later on our next show. Matt, Jon, thanks for sharing your thoughts with us.

After a nearly 10% drop on Tuesday, Palantir (PLTR) fell another 1% in afternoon trade after slipping as much as 9% earlier in the day.\nThe tech-led sell-off has put markets on edge, as investors rotate out of riskier stocks into previously lagging sectors amid concerns about the AI boom's staying power.\nMeanwhile, Wednesday's release of minutes from the Fed's July meeting showed the two policymakers who voted against the decision to leave rates unchanged appeared largely alone in that opinion. Investors are eager for a sense of where policymakers stand on interest rate cuts after economic data this month revealed they face a tricky dilemma between a weakening labor market and stubborn inflation.\nAttention is also on the latest batch of big retail earnings, with Target's (TGT) results the highlight on Wednesday. Target eked out a profit beat and held to its guidance, but pressures from tariffs and a squeezed consumer added up to another downbeat quarter — and will pose challenges for newly announced CEO Michael Fiddelke. Its shares sank 6%.\nNext up are Walmart (WMT) earnings on Thursday, watched for further signs of how companies and consumers are handing President Trump's tariffs.\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\nThe main event for Wall Street lands on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will deliver remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium in Wyoming.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 23 updates- Josh Schafer\nTech, chip stock sell-off continues as AI bubble fears mount\nYahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports:\nTech stocks fell for a second day on Wednesday as investors sold off a slew of tech names amid concerns over the sustainability of the AI boom and a recent market rotation away from some of this year's biggest winners.\nAmong the Magnificent Seven Big Tech stocks, Nvidia (NVDA) was down about 0.3%, and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) stock fell more than 1%. Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), shares fell over 1%.\nChip stocks Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) both fell less than 1%; Micron (MU) shares plummeted nearly 4%.\n- Allie Canal\nRetail traders double down on Palantir despite recent stock slide\nPalantir (PLTR) shares dropped another 1% on Wednesday following a sharp 9% slide on Tuesday. But retail investors saw the drop as a buying opportunity.\nAccording to data provided to Yahoo Finance from Vanda Research, small investors poured over $59 million into Palantir during Tuesday’s sell-off, marking the biggest single-day retail inflow in a week. That came on top of another $40 million in inflows the day before.\nThe surge in retail demand highlights a classic “buy the dip” mentality that has dominated markets since the April bottom. In the days leading up to the sell-off, retail flows had been steady but more modest, averaging in the $20 to $30 million range, according to Vanda. The jump in activity suggests everyday traders were not scared off by the stock’s sudden slide. Instead, they leaned in.\nBut even with retail piling in, the stock still fell hard. That divergence underscores a familiar market reality: while retail can be a powerful force, institutional selling pressure often sets the tone.\n\"Retail has gotten to be such a huge percentage of the market in terms of day-to-day trading,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. \"But if a series of institutions decide to reallocate their portfolio holdings, you’re standing in the way of a much larger piece of momentum.\"\n\"Collectively, a whole lot of small traders can push back, but if [institutions] are relentless about the selling, that’s going to move the market lower.”\nSosnick called Palantir’s 9% plunge a “shocking move down,” but also pointed out that the stock’s meteoric rise has left it trading at \"about as expensive of a stock as we’ve seen.\"\n- Josh Schafer\nJames Hardie stock collapses 35% as US housing slump hits building materials\nYahoo Finance's Ines Ferre reports:\nJames Hardie (JHX) stock tumbled 35% on Wednesday as the maker of high-end home siding pointed to a weak US housing market and homeowners reluctant to spend on big projects.\nThe stock, listed in the US and Australia, saw its biggest one-day drop since 1973, according to Bloomberg data. The company's profit declined 28% year over year during its fiscal first quarter. Net sales tumbled 9% over the same period.\n\"Uncertainty is a common thread throughout conversations with customer and contractor partners,\" CEO Aaron Erter said during the company's earnings call.\nJames Hardie pointed to \"softer demand,\" citing a slowdown in single-family construction activity, especially in the southern part of the US.\n- Josh Schafer\nFed minutes show majority of officials more concerned about inflation than employment\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting showed the \"majority\" of officials were more concerned about the upside risk to inflation than downside risks to the Fed's mandate for maximum employment.\n\"Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants pointed to the uncertain effects of tariffs and the possibility of inflation expectations becoming unanchored,\" the minutes read. \"In addition to tariff-induced risks, potential downside risks to employment mentioned by participants included a possible tightening of financial conditions due to a rise in risk premiums, a more substantial deterioration in the housing market, and the risk that the increased use of AI in the workplace may lower employment.\"\n- Josh Schafer\nEight sectors are outperforming the S&P 500 on Wednesday\nCiti head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser noted on Tuesday that the recent pain the stock market has \"remained localized.\"\nAnd that's holding true on Wednesday too despite a roughly 1% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. The pain is mostly in technology and other related areas of the market with eight of 11 sectors in the S&P 500 (^GSPC)outperforming the benchmark index.\nWhile the size of tech in the index is pulling down the overall S&P 500 there are actually still 265 stocks in positive territory with a little over two hours left in the trading session.\nFor now the rotation in the market isn't shaking a bullish stance from Kaiser who remains positive on US equities with a \"quality preference.\"\nBelow is a look at the sector action thus far in Wednesday's trade.\n- Josh Schafer\nGoogle unveils latest Pixel phones, including foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) announced its latest line of Pixel smartphones on Wednesday as part of its Made By Google event in New York City on Wednesday.\nThe Pixel 10 lineup includes four phones: the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The company also showed off its newest smartwatch, the Pixel Watch 4.\nThe devices get Google’s latest Gemini AI capabilities, including the company’s new Magic Cue for its smartphones and enhanced smart replies for the watch.\nStarting at $799, the entry-level Pixel 10 now comes with three rear cameras, up from two. That includes a 5x telephoto camera. Inside, the 6.3-inch phone gets Google’s latest Tensor G5 processor, 12GB of RAM, and upwards of 256GB of storage.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro starts at $999 and gets a sharper 6.3-inch display and more-advanced triple-camera setup. And while the phone packs the same Tensor G5 processor as the standard Pixel 10, the Pro sports 16GB of RAM rather than 12GB and offers up to 512GB of storage.\n- Josh Schafer\nHertz stock jumps on deal to sell its used cars on Amazon\nYahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:\nRental car firm Hertz (HTZ) struck a deal with Amazon Autos (AMZN) on Wednesday to sell some of its used car inventory. The company said this will make it easier for customers to purchase cars from its fleet.\nStarting today, customers can search Amazon Autos to browse, finance, and purchase from thousands of used Hertz fleet vehicles from brands like Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Nissan, and others. Hertz Car Sales, the rental car firm's used car sales arm, will be the first fleet dealer on Amazon Autos.\nHertz said sales will begin in the Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle metro areas, with plans to expand to Hertz Car Sales' 45 locations nationwide. After customers complete their purchase online, they can pick up the vehicles at Hertz locations in those cities.\n- Josh Schafer\nKeyBanc warns China headwinds could prompt an Nvidia earnings miss\nYahoo Finance's Francisco Velasquez reports:\n- Josh Schafer\nBig Tech is getting hammered again\nTuesday's market action was all about isolated selling in some of the market's biggest winners.\nWednesday's early session has brought more of the same, as Big Tech is clearly leading the selling action once more.\nAfter a nearly 10% drop on Tuesday, Palantir (PLTR) fell another 7% in early trade. Meanwhile, AI chip leaders Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) each dropped more than 3%.\n- Josh Schafer\nTrump says Fed governor Cook 'must resign' as pressure campaign on central bank continues\nPresident Trump on Wednesday called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign as the public pressure on the central bank continues to build.\n\"Cook must resign, now!!!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social Wednesday morning with a link to a Bloomberg report on a letter sent by Bill Pulte. The Federal Housing Finance Agency head has reportedly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Cook over a pair of mortgages.\nPulte wrote in a letter dated Aug. 15 that Cook “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute.”\nThe President's call for Cook to resign comes as pressure on the Fed continues amid ongoing changes on the Fed's Board of Governors.\n- Josh Schafer\nNasdaq leads indexes lower again at the open\nUS stocks were mixed on Wednesday after a bruising day for tech stocks, as investors weighed the latest retail earnings and waited for Federal Reserve minutes to provide clues to interest rate cuts.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped about 0.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 0.4%, after weakness in the likes of Palantir (PLTR) and Nvidia (NVDA) dragged on the broader market on Tuesday.\n- Grace O'Donnell\nPost-earnings market movers: Target and La-Z-Boy stocks dive, Lowe's rises\nHere's a look at how Wall Street is reacting to a burst of earnings reports ahead of the opening bell on Wednesday:\nTarget (TGT) stock dived more than 10%, facing its worst sell-off since early April. The retailer cleared a low bar of earnings expectations, but comparable sales continued to fall during the quarter.\nLowe's (LOW) stock rose 2.5%. The home improvement retailer reported a return to same-store sales growth, echoing positive results from Home Depot (HD) on Tuesday. Home Depot stock fell 1.3% before the bell.\nEstée Lauder (EL) shares fell 5%. The beauty company's annual profit forecast disappointed and executives said they expect a $100 million headwind from tariffs.\nBaidu (BIDU) shares edged 0.2% lower. The Chinese search engine company reported a drop in second quarter revenue as strong growth in cloud services was offset by weakness in its core advertising business.\nToll Brothers (TOL) stock added 0.45%. The homebuilder reported an earnings and revenue beat on Tuesday afternoon, though new orders were less than analysts' expected.\nLa-Z-Boy (LZB) stock tanked 20% after the company missed estimates amid soft demand. Sales for its Joybird furniture brand declined 14%.\n- Grace O'Donnell\nHertz to sell used cars on Amazon, stock jumps\nHertz (HTZ) stock rose over 10% after the car rental company announced it is teaming up with Amazon (AMZN) to sell pre-owned vehicles.\nCustomers will be able to browse Hertz used car sales on Amazon, purchase vehicles online, and then pick them up at select Hertz locations. It will initially be offered in Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle, with plans to expand to 45 locations nationwide.\nHertz sells pre-owned cars in addition to renting them out.

Cornell, who has been CEO of Target since August 2014, will slide into the executive chair position for an undetermined period of time. Fiddelke joined Target in 2003 as an intern and rose through the ranks to CFO and then COO.\n\"I've had this conversation with the board for a number of years, and I've been in the role for 11 years. I'm going into my 12th now. I will actually turn 67 early next year, and I think it's time for me to step back, recharge, spend a lot more time with my family, a lot fewer nights in hotels, and be a great supporter of Michael and the team for the rest of my life,\" Cornell told me by video call while sitting next to Fiddelke at the company's Minneapolis headquarters.\nFiddelke added, \"I bleed Target red after 20 years here, and there's nothing more important to me than working with the incredible team that we have to chart the next chapter for Target. I mean, I've seen us in that 20 years at our best. I've seen us not at our best. When we're at our best, we are pretty darn tough to beat.\"\nTo students of Target history such as myself, this decision isn't a surprise. For one, Fiddelke has been Cornell's right-hand man for several years now. It has become quite apparent over the past year that he was grooming Fiddelke to take over while also working behind the scenes to get board buy-in. I have gotten to know Fiddelke in recent years. He is a nice fella and has indeed earned the opportunity to sit in the CEO seat.\nIf this was any other time for Target, the decision would probably be celebrated. It's not often an intern at a company becomes its CEO. The only comparable story I can think of is Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon going from truck loader at the retailer to CEO.\nBut Fiddelke will unlikely have a honeymoon period, seeing as he has been there at Target during its past 24 months of struggles (which includes a weak second quarter). People I have talked to wanted an outsider as Target's next CEO, fresh eyes to come in and fix what is wrong (not unlike when Cornell was brought in back in 2014 — his career was mostly spent at Walmart and PepsiCo (PEP)). Fiddelke will be seen as a continuation of a strategy that hasn't been working.\nI asked him on the call how candid he plans to be in the early going on the strategy review, which is what all new leaders do. He sounded like he was ready to divert from Cornell's playbook and shake things up. He will have to do just that, and quickly, to win over a likely skeptical Wall Street.\n- Karen Friar\nUS tech stocks hit by concerns over future of AI boom\nWall Street is digging into the factors behind this week's selloff in tech stocks, with many seeing it as a timely rotation out of riskier names.

So getting your application rejected might feel like an opportunity has just been ripped away from you. But while a rejection can feel stressful, it doesn't necessarily mean your path to a college education has ended.\nStudent loans can be denied for a variety of reasons — a low credit score, income, or even something as simple as incomplete paperwork. So don't worry just yet. If a student loan is standing between you and your education, there are still a few options at your disposal.\nOffers in this section are from affiliate partners and selected based on a combination of engagement, product relevance, compensation, and consistent availability.\nUndergraduate and graduate students, parents, health professionals\n$5,000 minimum (or up to state); maximum up to cost of attendance\n5, 7, 10, 15, years; up to 20 years for refinancing loans\nTerms apply\nUndergraduate and graduate students, parents, international students with U.S. co-signer\n$1,000 up to the cost of attendance ($180,000 lifelong maximum)\n5, 8, 10, 15 years for undergraduate loans, up to 20 years for graduate loans\nTerms apply\nWhy was my student loan application denied?\nIf your federal student loan application was denied, there are a few common reasons why that might've happened.\n- Your application was missing information. Maybe you forgot to add information for your parents if you're a dependent student. Or perhaps you missed a signature. It's important to be thorough and submit a complete application when you apply for a student loan.\n- You provided inaccurate information. Mistakes happen — you accidentally type in the wrong social security number or the wrong birth date, or you misspell your own name. Always triple check your application for errors before submitting.\n- You aren't a U.S. citizen. Only U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens can qualify for federal student aid. Eligible non-citizens include permanent residents, U.S. nationals and those designated as a refugee, conditional entrant, victim of human trafficking, parolee or someone who has had asylum granted.\nIf you applied for a private student loan and got denied, here are some likely reasons.\n- Your application was missing information. Just like with federal student loans, incomplete applications are a recipe for rejection. Triple check everything.\n- You don't meet the income requirements. Some private lenders have minimum income requirements to qualify for a loan to make sure you have the means to pay back what you borrow.\n- Your credit score is low. Your credit score is one of the most important factors in approval for a loan because lenders use it to determine your creditworthiness (how likely are you to repay the loan?).\n- You don't meet enrollment requirements. Some lenders will only provide you with a loan if you're a full-time student. So if you're under-enrolled, they might reject your application.\n- You have a high debt-to-income ratio (DTI). If you're already on the hook for a large amount of debt compared to the income you earn, lenders may view you as a high-risk borrower and deny your application.\nWhat to do if your student loan is denied\nWhether you got denied for a federal or private loan, you can contact the lender to find out why your application was rejected. This gives you a great starting point for appealing their decision or exploring other options.\nIf the reason for the denial was because of missing or inaccurate information, this should be a pretty easy fix. Once you make any necessary changes you should follow-up to ask about any additional instructions.\nIf you were denied for a different reason, you might be able to appeal the decision. You'll want to lean on your school's financial aid office to get through this process, but putting together an appeal might involve writing a letter to explain your circumstances and why you need financial aid and including relevant documentation to support your situation.\nIf you were denied for a private student loan, again, find out the reason why. Inaccurate or incomplete information is simple enough to get around. But if you were denied due to a low credit score, high DTI or low income, it could be trickier to address. Look for lenders that make it easier for students with low or no credit to be approved.\nHow to improve your chances next time\nPrivate student loan lenders don't typically offer an appeal process if you don't like your outcome, but it doesn't hurt to check with your lender's specific rules and take a chance for yourself. The simplest thing to do might be to reapply with a co-signer who meets the lender's credit, income and DTI requirements. Or, you can apply for a loan from a different lender with requirements that are a better fit for your circumstances.\nAscent Funding considers applicants with no credit history, plus it offers terms that are co-signer-friendly.

Variable annual percentage rates (APR) range from 6.13% APR to 10.24% APR (5.88% - 9.99% with .25% auto pay discount). Earnest variable interest rate student loan refinance loans are based on a publicly available index, the 30-day Average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The variable rate is based on the rate published on the 25th day, or the next business day, of the preceding calendar month, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a percent. The rate will not increase more than once a month, but there is no limit on the amount that the rate could increase at one time. Please note, we are not able to offer variable rate loans in AK, IL, MN, NH, OH, TN, and TX. Our lowest rates are only available for our most credit qualified borrowers and require selection of our shortest term offered (5 years) and enrollment in our .25% auto pay discount from a checking or savings account. Enrolling in autopay is not required as a condition for approval.\nIf you still can't get a loan right now, there are some things you can do to be a more qualified applicant for next time.\nImprove your credit score by continuing to make on time payments for your existing debts. Also be wary of opening up any new credit accounts since applying for new lines of credit can temporarily lower your score due to the hard inquiry.\nOther options\nConsider asking about institutional aid at your school. Many schools offer merit-based scholarships and other types of scholarships that you might you qualify for. It may not always be enough to cover your entire balance but it certainly goes a long way.\nAlso consider external scholarships from nonprofits and private companies. They usually offer small amounts and they can be very competitive but it can be well worth the effort if you win one.\nSome students consider working part-time while they do their schoolwork to pay tuition. Many colleges offer on-campus student jobs or you can try looking outside of campus.\nFAQs\nCan I appeal a student loan denial?\nYou can generally appeal a federal student loan denial. Reach out to the financial aid office at your school to discuss next steps.\nWhat credit score do I need to get a student loan?\nIf you're applying for federal student loans, your credit score isn't taken into account. But if you're applying for private student loans, some lenders require a credit score of at least 640. Others might require a minimum of 580.\nHow long should I wait before reapplying for a student loan?\nYou may want to wait at least six months before reapplying for a student loan to give your credit score some time to rebound after the first hard inquiry.\nWho can I talk to for help if I'm denied a student loan?\nTalk to your school's financial aid office if you hit any snags. They can help you come up with your next move and even help explain what you might need to do to get a better decision next time. If you applied for federal loans, also communicate with the federal student aid office.\nMoney matters — so make the most of it.

Ltd. (\"Hotel101 Global\"), the Singapore-headquartered subsidiary of Hotel101 Global Holdings Corp. (ticker NASDAQ:HBNB), a leading asset-light, prop-tech hospitality platform listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange entered into definitive agreements with Canopy Sands Development Co., Ltd. (“Canopy Sands Development”), one of Cambodia’s leading real estate developers, to develop two Hotel101 projects in Cambodia, which are expected to be among the largest hotels in the country by number of rooms upon completion.\nCanopy Sands Group, being one of the largest local developers in Cambodia, has enabled Hotel101 build on to their prime land in Cambodia. In addition, the arrangement with Canopy Sands Development will also enable Hotel101 to navigate well the local landscape and utilize their existing local sales network in Cambodia.\nThese landmark developments, the first to be located in Phnom Penh, the capital and commercial hub of Cambodia, and the second to be located at Bay of Lights in Sihanoukville, a burgeoning financial and tourism beacon, mark a pivotal step in Hotel101 Global’s long-term vision to operate 1 million hotel rooms across 100 countries.\nHotel101–Phnom Penh, is set to rise on a 2,033 square meters of prime commercial land, is located in the Tonlé Bassac district of Phnom Penh, a vibrant riverfront economic and cultural hub. With a capacity of approx 700 rooms, this hotel is expected to be one of Cambodia’s largest hotels by number of rooms. Nearby is the popular upscale district of Boeung Keng Kang (BKK), a premier expatriate and business enclave. Hotel101–Phnom Penh is expected to feature Hotel101’s standardized 21-square-meter “HappyRoom” units, equipped with kitchenettes, alongside a range of Hotel101’s signature amenities such as a swimming pool, fitness gym, all-day dining, a business center, function rooms, and commercial spaces. This prime location, close to landmarks such as Aeon Mall 1 and the Independence Monument, positions the hotel to capture Phnom Penh’s growing demand for business and leisure accommodation. Cambodia reported to have received 6.7 million international visitors in 2024, and is expected to further grow with the upcoming Techo International Airport (KTI) slated to open on September 9, 2025. The project is expected to enhance the current hospitality offering that are already operating in Phnom Penh, Cambodia which include global brands such as Hyatt, Rosewood, Shangri-La and Raffles.\nHotel101–Sihanoukville, is set to rise on a 4,623 square meters of prime commercial land within the Bay of Lights, a groundbreaking US$16 Billion, 934-hectare master-planned coastal development led by Canopy Sands Development in Sihanoukville, a key growing tourism hub with stunning beaches. Hotel101–Sihanoukville, with approx 680 rooms, is expected to be the largest hotel in Sihanoukville in terms of number of rooms and is expected to feature the same standardized Hotel101 “HappyRoom” units and amenities as other Hotel101 properties globally. Hotel101–Sihanoukville is strategically positioned right beside the proposed international convention and exhibition center in the Bay of Lights development. Hotel101–Sihanoukville is further enhanced by its proximity, a mere 5 minute drive to the Sihanoukville airport, the third largest international airport in Cambodia, and is expected to complement Sihanoukville’s array of hotel offerings which include global brands such as Accor’s Novotel and Wyndham. In 2024, Canopy Sands Development signed a dual property agreement with Ascott Limited to operate two properties in Bay of Lights, Sihanoukville namely Oakwood Bay of Lights Sihanoukville and Summer Bay Beach Club.\nThese two Hotel101 projects in Cambodia are expected to generate US$109.55 Million in sales revenue once fully sold, form part of Hotel101 Global’s global expansion strategy, which includes its first three overseas projects under development in Niseko, Japan (482 rooms), Madrid, Spain (680 rooms), and Los Angeles, USA (approx 622 rooms) as well as affiliate Hotel101 hotels in the Philippines. The two Cambodian projects are targeted to be completed by 2028 and are expected to contribute to Cambodia’s economic growth through job creation, foreign investment, and increased tourism, while attracting both local and international buyers under Hotel101’s hassle-free hotel unit ownership model.\n(Perspective and site location of Hotel101-Phnom Penh, Cambodia set to have approx. 700 rooms and 30 floors)\n(Perspective and site location of Hotel101-Sihanoukville, Bay of Lights, Cambodia set to have approx. 680 rooms)\nIn photo during the signing of the binding definitive agreement today August 20, 2025 at Hotel101 Global Corporate Office in Singapore are; Carlos Agana – Hotel101 Global Legal Services Director, Catherine Chan – Hotel101 Global Chief Development Officer, Hannah Yulo-Luccini – Hotel101 Global CEO, Jimmy He – Canopy Sands Development Managing Director, David Dobson – Canopy Sands Development Country Head UAE and Senior Investment Director, with other Canopy Sands Group Officers and Hotel101 Global Officers\nForwardLookingStatements\nThis document includes certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of securities laws of certain jurisdictions, including Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Each Wednesday, Ian King brings you expert insights on the most important business stories from the U.K. and other key developments you won't want to miss. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\nThe dispatch\nEpisodes in which the mighty KKR receives a bloody nose are collector's items — but we had one in the U.K. last week.\nThe private equity giant was thwarted in an attempt to buy Assura, a property company that owns more than 600 doctor's surgeries and medical centers.\nShareholders instead accepted a £1.8 billion ($2.4 billion) rival offer in cash and shares from Primary Health Properties (PHP), a peer of Assura, which now becomes the U.K.'s biggest publicly traded healthcare landlord.\nApart from the novelty of KKR — which had teamed up with Stonepeak, the infrastructure investor — losing this David and Goliath battle, there were several striking elements to the contest, not least that PHP's takeover still faces scrutiny by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), the U.K.'s competition watchdog.\nThere was also the fact that by making most of its offer in its shares, whose price fell toward the end of the takeover battle, PHP was actually offering slightly less than KKR and Stonepeak when investors had to decide.\nAnd, most striking in a market tormenting itself for years over de-equitization after scores of take-private deals, is that investors were happy to maintain a shareholding in the enlarged PHP, accepting the execution risk that comes with this takeover, rather than just take KKR and Stonepeak's cash.\nThat speaks to a bigger story — which is that U.K. stock market investors have concluded valuations in the country's REIT (real estate investment trust) sector had become ridiculously low.\nThere was a sense that KKR and Stonepeak were getting an outrageous bargain and also that PHP, founded 30 years ago by the property entrepreneur Harry Hyman, who remains the company's chairman, deserved backing following years of consistent performance.\nOn the face of it, Assura — and, for that matter, PHP — should be a very sound investment.\nAs Britain's National Health Service pivots to preventative treatment and delivering care to patients in their communities, rather than in city center hospitals, it is exposed to what should be a rapidly expanding sector when the population is ageing and where more patients have complex long-term medical needs.\nThat also means a growing reliance on private medicine — a huge opportunity for the business. Moreover, Assura — again, like PHP — enjoys highly predictable cashflows.\nAs Jonathan Murphy, the chief executive, noted in last month's annual report and accounts: \"Our total contracted rental income, which is a combination of our passing rent roll and lease length, stands at £2.5 billion, our weighted average unexpired lease term is 12.7 years and 97% of our income now comes from GPs, the NHS, the HSE (Health & Safety Executive), pharmacies and established independent sector healthcare operators.\"\nAnd yet, despite all that, Assura's shares were still changing hands at a 21% discount to their net asset value (NAV) when KKR's interest was first disclosed in February. That is remarkable given the majority of its rents, paid by the NHS, are effectively underwritten by the government.\nThe discount helps explain KKR's interest, but Assura is just one example. The U.K.'s REIT sector has seen a wave of mergers and acquisitions over the last few years as private equity and trade buyers alike have sought to scoop up bargains.\nAmong the most active has been Tritax Big Box REIT, a £3.4 billion landlord specializing in the logistics sector with a portfolio of large warehouses, but which is now moving into data centers. It caught the eye when, in February last year, it acquired the smaller U.K. Commercial Property REIT for £924 million.\nIt is seeking to follow this with the acquisition of Warehouse REIT although, like PHP with Assura, faces competition from another U.S. private equity house in the form of Blackstone, which has offered £489 million for the business, itself still a significant discount to Warehouse REIT's NAV.\nA wave of consolidation\nIn the same part of the commercial property jungle, another player making waves is LondonMetric Property, which has come seemingly from nowhere to become the U.K.'s second-largest quoted property company and a FTSE-100 constituent.\nIt bought CT Property Trust for £199 million in late 2003, following it last year with the £1.9 billion acquisition of LXI, owner of the land occupied by the famous Thorpe Park and Alton Towers amusement parks.\nAndrew Jones, its ambitious co-founder and chief executive, is now acquiring Urban Logistics REIT for £700 million and the smaller Highcroft Investments, another REIT, for £44 million.\nJones told Estates Gazette, the industry bible, in November last year that many smaller REITS — there were 19 listed in London at the time with a market capitalization of less than £1 billion — were mispriced and that it was \"beholden upon those who can afford it, and have got the right rating, to do something about it.\"\nHe added: \"You have to wonder what the purpose of the small cap is. \"If you're less than £1 billion and you're externally managed then I don't see where your future lies in the listed space.\"\nThat opinion appears to be shared by a growing number of quoted company investors prepared to back the likes of Jones and Hyman.\nOthers driving consolidation include NewRiver REIT, an owner of retail parks and centers, which at the end of last year bought the smaller Capital & Regional for £147 million, again in a mixture of cash and shares, while last week saw Unite Group, the U.K.'s biggest student landlord and another FTSE-100 constituent, announce it is buying Empiric Student Property, a smaller rival, for £723 million.\nWhat all these deals have in common — aside from the fact that all the acquired businesses had been trading at a discount to NAV — is that investors are increasingly looking at REITs capable of building scale in niche areas such as healthcare and student housing and whose stock also offers greater liquidity.\nThis raises questions of how the traditional big two of U.K. commercial property — Land Securities (Landsec) and British Land — react. Both operate in a number of different parts of the property market and arguably have something of a conglomerate discount.\nBoth are led by energetic CEOs in Mark Allan and Simon Carter and, in British Land's case, it also has a well-known banker — the former Lazard chair Will Rucker — as chairman and that can often be a portent for M&A.\nWith the number of quoted REITs in London having halved since 2019, investors are clearly rewarding scale and focus, but this may be storing up problems when the market properly rebounds and they have fewer options from which to choose.\nYet there is an impetus for action — especially now there are indications of a revival even in the most unloved of property sectors.\nSentiment toward offices has been depressed since the Covid pandemic unleashed a wave of home-working but it emerged last week that Canary Wharf — which is owned by the Canadian investment giant Brookfield and the Qatar Investment Authority and a landlord to the likes of Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Citi and JP Morgan — has enjoyed the first increase in the valuation of its offices in three years.\nOffices have not really featured in the consolidation sweeping U.K. REITs in recent years.\nIt would be a surprise were that to remain the case.\nTop TV picks on CNBC\nPrivate money is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in European soccer, as private equity and VC firms build up their stakes in several major clubs. PitchBook's Senior EMEA Private Capital Analyst at PitchBook Nicolas Moura joins \"Squawk Box Europe\" to discuss the phenomenon.\nCNBC's Ritika Gupta reports from Canary Wharf on London's return to the office following the Covid-19 pandemic.\nDr. Kavita Patel, NBC News & MSNBC medical contributor, joins \"Fast Money\" to talk Eli Lilly raising Mounjaro prices.\n— Holly Ellyatt\nNeed to know\nHere are the UK's top-paid FTSE 100 CEOs — as report finds exec salaries at record high. Bosses of FTSE 100 firms took home 122 times that of the average U.K. worker in the lastest financial year, according to think tank High Pay Centre.\nUK economy grows by better-than-expected 0.3% in second quarter. Economists said it was unlikely that the positive momentum would continue into the third quarter.\nAmerican money pours into Europe's soccer giants as club valuations soar. European soccer is a bigger business than ever — and American investors have been eyeing a piece of that pie.\n— Holly Ellyatt\nQuote of the week\nI think the people trying to read across from Donald Trump's shifting of taxation and setting a different set of rules and people falling in line, the idea that other mid-sized countries can replicate that, is for the birds.\n— Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum\nIn the markets\nThe FTSE 100 has regained some upward momentum over the last week, gaining around 0.4%. That took the index to a record closing high on Tuesday of 9,189.22 points, with top performers including retailers JD Sports and Burberry.\nSterling has meanwhile ticked slightly higher against both the U.S. dollar and the euro, as traders pared back their bets on the pace of Bank of England rate cuts. As of Tuesday, just ahead of the July inflation print, money market pricing suggested a less than 50% likelihood of a further reduction from the current 4% this year. A move to 3.75% was previously fully priced in.\nExpectations for the BOE to remain hawkish put pressure on U.K. government bonds. Despite a dip on Tuesday, the 10-year gilt yield nonetheless rose from 4.585% to 4.72% over the week, while the 2-year yield rose from 3.897% to 3.958%.\n— Jenni Reid\nComing Up\nAug. 20: U.K. inflation data for July\nAug. 21: UK flash PMIs for August\nAug. 22: GfK consumer confidence data\n— Holly Ellyatt","content_hash":"e9eb550dc448e4008f50fec5613e4ba6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":10037,"method_rank":0}

In my column today I ask whether U.S. consumer spending can be sustained, which would keep the economy growing and steer it away from recession. Much will depend on how the rich feel about their finances.\nIf you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.\n1.

Brent crudefutures settle at $66.60\/bbl, WTI crude at $63.42\/bbl.\nToday's Talking Points:\n* Europe goes to Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump's intense, hastily-arranged summitry continued on Monday as he welcomed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to the White House to discuss how to end the Ukraine-Russia war. This follows Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, which was a success for the Russian president but yielded little for Trump.\nAnd that meant little for Ukraine or Europe, which explains the extraordinary sight of Zelenskiy being backed in Washington on Monday by many of Europe's most powerful leaders, including Germany's Friedrich Merz, France's Emmanuel Macron, Britain's Keir Starmer and NATO's Mark Rutte.\nTrump's appearance with Zelenskiy before the cameras was cordial and even friendly, in stark contrast to their acrimonious meeting in February. Trump said the U.S. would help Europe in providing security for Ukraine as part of any deal, but also suggested to reporters that he no longer believed a ceasefire was a necessary prerequisite for striking a peace agreement.\n* Jackson Hole. Attention is now turning to the annual Kansas City Fed's symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which gathers Fed officials, central bankers and leading economists from around the world to discuss the challenges facing the global economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday is the keynote event.\nLeaving aside any possible long-term policy steers, such as changes to QT or tolerating slightly higher inflation, the main focus is whether he leans toward a rate cut in September or not.\nRates traders still think he will, but their conviction is ebbing by the day. They are now attaching an 82% probability of a quarter-point cut next month, the lowest likelihood since the unexpectedly weak employment data on August 1.\n* Long-end bond blues. Yields on 30-year sovereign bonds in major countries around the world continue to rise. In some cases, like that of Germany, they are now the highest in many years as investors begin to fret again about inflation and fiscal spending plans.\nMany investors are also questioning the wisdom of the Fed resuming its easing cycle next month, which is what's currently priced into rates futures markets, with inflation above target, unemployment at a historical low, stocks at record highs and financial conditions the loosest in years.\nEven the long end of China's bond market is feeling the squeeze. The 30-year yield spiked 8 basis points to 2.12% on Monday, the highest in five months and biggest one-day rise since October. And this is in China, where the deflationary pressures of the last few years are showing no sign of lifting.\nCan the rich continue to prop up US consumer spending?\nU.S. consumer spending's surprising resilience is the main reason the economy has not only avoided recession, but continued to grow at a solid clip. The big question now is whether American households can keep that going, especially with higher, tariff-fueled prices coming down the pike.\nIn the U.S., \"the consumer\" is king. Consumer spending accounts for around 70% of total economic output, so changes in people's propensity to spend have a direct, outsized influence on the health of the economy.\nBut \"the consumer\" is, of course, actually millions of people. And when you split them into groups based on income and wealth, it becomes clear that total spending disproportionately comes from the rich.\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said earlier this year that the richest 10% of Americans, those earning at least $250,000 a year, now account for half of all consumer spending. That's a record. Thirty years ago, the richest 10% accounted for 36% of all consumer spending.\nA Boston Fed paper last week backed up Zandi's findings, concluding that the strength of aggregate consumer spending in the last three years is due to high-income earners. But the authors suggest high-income consumers have a reasonable cushion because they haven't maxed out their credit cards.\nWhile the lower-income and middle-income cohorts both saw their credit card debt soar past pre-pandemic totals in the last few years, wealthier Americans' credit card debt remains below the 2019 high and well below the level implied by the pre-pandemic trend. So, if necessary, they still have room to borrow to fund their spending.\nEARNING POWER\nSpending across the income deciles could also be supported by enhanced earning power.\nWhile some indicators show that the U.S. labor market may be softening, annual average earnings growth still rose in July to 3.9%, meaning real wage growth is running at a 1.3% annual pace, depending on what slice of inflation you use. Real annual wage growth has been between 1.0% and 1.8% for over two years, above the average for the decade leading into the COVID-19 health crisis.\nAnd overall workers' income may be growing at an even faster rate, according to economists at Bank of America. They calculate that aggregate labor income – number of jobs multiplied by wages multiplied by number of hours worked - increased 5.5% in July on a six-month annualized basis. Most of that growth was driven by higher wages.\nWith household delinquency rates, excluding student loans, cooling off this year, strength in labor income should continue to support consumer spending, they argue. This, in turn, should help the U.S. avoid the recessionary spiral of lower spending begetting layoffs, begetting even lower spending, begetting more job cuts.\nThis is one of the reasons BofA economists retain their out-of-consensus call that the Federal Reserve won't cut interest rates at all this year.\nFLASHING AMBER?\nOthers are less confident.\nZandi at Moody's Analytics warns that a correction on Wall Street would hit the rich hard via the negative wealth effects, \"and, given how weak the economy is, push it into recession.\"\nThe concentration of equity ownership at the top of the U.S. wealth ladder is extreme - the richest 1% in the country owns 50% of stock market assets and the top 10% holds around 90%.\nSome measures of household spending are already flashing amber. Inflation-adjusted spending as measured by personal consumption expenditures flat lined in the first half of this year.\nYet figures on Friday showed that retail sales rose 0.5% in July after an upwardly revised 0.9% gain in June.\nBut then there are tariffs. Companies, not consumers, have borne the brunt of these levies so far. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that consumers absorbed only 22% of tariff costs through June, but they reckon that figure could rise to 67% in the months ahead if the Trump administration's expected tariffs are implemented.\nSo there are grounds for both caution and optimism. Much will depend on whether the rich draw in their horns.\nWhat could move markets tomorrow?\n* Australia consumer sentiment (August) * Euro zone current account (June) * Canada inflation (July) * Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowmanspeaks * U.S. earnings - Home Depot, Palo Alto Networks\nWant to receive Trading Day in your inbox every weekday morning?

Not long after she was sponsored by Anglo Platinum to work on a tailings-focused sustainability project funded by the Australian Mining Industry Research Association.\nThe role brought Mpofu to Australia, now her home, and where she went on to complete a PhD in mineral processing. It was only then, she says, that she realised mining’s unequivocal impact on “planet and people – including myself”.\nMpofu was hooked by the potential to create a positive impact, even if she was often intimidated by being the only woman in the lab or field. “The overalls never fit properly and there were never any women’s toilets onsite,” she says.\nInspired by these early roles – and subsequent senior ones at Anglo American, Lonmin (now Sibanye Stillwater) and South32 – Mpofu’s focus nowadays is on championing sustainability and supporting women in climbing the ranks. Among the many positions she now holds, Mpofu is the CEO and founder of Insight Mining Experts, which supports miners with their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals and conducts sustainability research.\n“I was reflecting on my career, and I realised I had been working more on sustainability than anything else,” muses Mpofu. It is not just about the environment but also understanding communities’ needs, she explains.\n“Even at Lonmin [as senior manager for businesses development and strategy], I was doing transactions, but it was also about sustainability because we decided to give equity to employees and support local communities. When you start thinking, how do we ensure our communities are part of what we are doing? That is sustainability.”\nThat role was a ‘learning curve’ for Mpofu – and where she decided this was an area she wanted to focus on. Later, at mining and metals company South 32, she was promoted to vice-president of corporate affairs and sustainability.\nToday, through her consultancy, Mpofu focuses on promoting circularity within the industry. “If we start at the beginning where we hit the rock, then I think we can change the narrative about the mining industry; we need to start thinking about how we are designing the mine of the future and make sure we close the loop,” she says.\nMpofu says many of the issues the mining industry faces are tied to the fact it is still dumping waste.\n“People see that waste; we are not leveraging all the ways we can to create value, employment and empowered communities,” Mpofu says.\nInsight Mining Experts was recently involved in an UpLink innovation challenge on circularity in the mining sector where start-ups could showcase their work. The consultancy participated because, Mpofu says: “I am passionate about using innovation to change the industry – the projects are phenomenal. That is the next stage for us, to showcase what these people are doing and how mining companies can really embrace or support them.”\nFor tailings management, where she had an early focus, does she think the industry has made progress? “Absolutely,” she says, “particularly in Australia.” Last year, Insight Mining Experts completed a report on Australia ESG performance of which she says it is a leader “in certain areas”.\nWhile there has been notable progress in areas such as dewatered tailings and processing plants, Mpofu caveats this optimism by adding: “Is it enough? No, we need to do more.”\nA huge challenge is legacy tailings that are \"just sitting there\". “I was in Zambia recently working on an EU circularity project, mining has been [stopped] for decades, and the tailings are still there; they are huge. When people say mining is dirty it is because that is what they see.”\nAnother key challenge – and passion – for Mpofu is getting more woman into the mining industry. She has had her fill of “being the only one in the room to look like me”.\n“It is difficult when you probably don’t laugh at the same jokes as your peers, superiors or subordinates. You want your sisters in there.”\n“It has changed a bit, but not as much as we move upwards. It can be lonely. Sometimes you are misunderstood, sometimes you feel you are not enough,” she adds.\nIn her career, Mpofu says she has never tried to hide her femininity. At times those qualities helped her to rise up the ranks. Her empathetic leadership style saw her promoted at Lonmin. She became a senior manager there when the company was negotiating with unions after the Marikana massacre, where 34 miners were killed by the South African Police Service.\n“We had to negotiate with the same communities that were not happy, but I think coming in with an empathetic leadership style took me to the next level, including being vice-president,” she says.\nLuck has also played a role. When Mpofu joined Anglo Platinum, the organisation had a terrible safety record and changed its senior leadership team. This included eventually hiring the company’s first and only female CEO, Cynthia Carroll, who \"fundamentally changed everything\".\n“I was lucky that we went through a very strong cultural change in a very short space of time. I was at the peak of my career, and I worked for an organisation that was very good. In general, I was lucky I had some of the most amazing bosses in my early careers,” Mpofu reflects.\nHowever, there were times when she felt \"excluded from certain conversations\" and considered moving out of the sector.\n“In hindsight I realised it takes two. Some people think ‘my work will do the talking’, and that was me, but the lesson was realising you also need to speak to people and say, ‘this is what I want’. It is never just about what you deliver; there are people who never delivered, but they had senior roles.”\nShe stresses the point: “If senior leadership is sitting with talent management and they don't know you; it becomes difficult for them to advocate for you – I was lucky enough to have mentors, champions of female leadership and sponsors.”\nHowever, more needs to be done to attract women to the mining sector and make the workplace more inclusive. This is something Mpofu has made a personal mission.\nDuring lockdown Mpofu wrote the Amazon best-selling book Unleashing My Superpowers, a memoir and manual for women working in male-dominated industries. Today, she offers CEOs and executives leadership coaching and diversity and inclusion workshops.\n“Many people ask me, ‘if I want to move into the mining industry, what can I actually do?’ And I say ‘it depends’, but I always encourage women to go into STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] because if you are in STEM, it is easier for you to rise because there are not many women there,” she advises.\nMpofu also suggests looking at careers that are becoming more prominent, such as a sustainability analyst or practitioner or working with AI. \"Those are the careers of the future,” she says.\nAdditionally, join groups (such as Women in Mining NSW\/WA), try to understand what the industry is and find a mentor, then a sponsor, and as you rise, a coach, she advises.\nMpofu also has a son and knows it can be a struggle for mothers in the mining industry. “Sometimes I had to travel far, and then my son, who was going to pick him up? It was really hard.” This is possibly a reason why she moved into corporate when she did, she says. “At least now there is work from home, maternity and paternity leave, it is getting better, but I think more can still be done.”\nMpofu, who is a non-executive director at Orion Minerals, says some of the challenges that exist within the mining industry today include the fact that it has lost some of its stock exchange value to Big Tech; squeezed margins; high capital costs and long lead times have put investors off.\n“But we can be clever and more innovative, we can take the mining industry to the next level,” she says.\nMpofu believes technology will be the gamechanger. “Going forward, innovation will be so critical,\" she says. \"There are opportunities with AI; look at what KoBold Metals is doing. Exploration is one area where it is absolutely transformational, then companies are going back into tailings to mine – all possible because of technology.\n“There are legacies of the mining sector, but we need to start looking futuristically, harnessing innovation and technology, and saying it is for everybody.\n“We cannot leave women and girls behind when the mining sector is making strides and it is changing the world,\" she concludes. \"Let's make our environment inclusive for everybody.”\n\"Inspiring women in mining: Patience Mpofu, Insight Mining Experts – Australia\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are down -0.34%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are down -1.06%.\nStock indexes are mixed today, with the Dow Jones Industrials posting a new all-time high and the Nasdaq 100 falling to a 1-week low. Weaknesses in chip makers and in the Magnificent Seven stocks today are weighing on the overall market.\nOn the positive side, Home Depot recovered from early losses and is up more than +4% to lead the Dow Jones industrials to a new record high after it reported a +3% jump in July comparable same-store sales. Lowes and Target will report their earnings on Wednesday, and Walmart will report on Thursday.\nLower bond yields today are supportive of stocks, with the 10-year T-note yield down -2 bp to 4.31%. US government debt garnered support today after S&P Global Ratings affirmed its AA+ long-term rating and A-1+ short-term rating on US debt and said the US can maintain its credit strength despite the fiscal hit of its recent spending bill because tariff revenues will \"generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes.\"\nToday's US housing news was mixed. US Jul housing starts unexpectedly rose +5.2% m\/m to a 5-month high of 1.428 million, stronger than expectations of a decline to 1.297 million. However, Jul building permits, a proxy for future construction, fell -2.8% m\/m to a 5-year low of 1.354 million, weaker than expectations of -0.5% m\/m to 1.386 million.\nDiplomatic talks over the war in Ukraine continue to make headway. Ukrainian President Zelenskiy said he came away with a commitment from President Trump late Monday to join security guarantees for any peace deal and reserve discussion on territorial swaps with Russia for later. The outcome of the talks could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security.\nThe focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal, with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy and European leaders continuing their meeting with President Trump in Washington. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000 and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July. Also, the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 49.8. In addition, Jul existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m\/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, \"I'll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we'll be setting sometime next week, week after.\" Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India's purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced \"within the next week or so.\" According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 84% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 92% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 rose to a 4.75-month high and is up +0.92%. China's Shanghai Composite fell from a 10-year high and closed down -0.02%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 retreated from a new record high and closed down -0.38%.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are up +6 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -2.5 bp to 4.308%. Sep T-notes are moving higher today after S&P Global Ratings said that higher revenues from tariffs will help soften the blow to the US's fiscal health from the president's tax cuts, enabling the country to maintain its AA+ long-term credit rating. The weakness in stocks today is also supporting safe-haven demand for T-notes. Gains in T-notes are limited due to concerns that last week's bearish US July CPI and PPI reports could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month's FOMC meeting.\nEuropean government bond yields today are moving lower. The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.4 bp to 2.749%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell from a 2.5-month high of 4.756% and is down by -2.2 bp to 4.716%.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 6% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nThe weakness in the Magnificent Seven stocks is a drag on the overall market.

Mining stocks outperformed on Tuesday. Limiting gains, defense stocks slumped, weighed down by news of a potential Ukraine-Russia summit, as hopes for de-escalation dampened demand for military-related assets. Data from the European Central Bank released on Tuesday showed that the Eurozone’s adjusted current account surplus widened slightly in June as primary income gains offset a decline in the trade surplus. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday for talks, which Zelenskyy described as positive. President Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart that the U.S. would help guarantee Ukraine’s security under any peace agreement to end Russia’s war. Mr. Trump also noted that he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin and was working to set up a direct meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, followed by a potential trilateral summit involving all three leaders.

Technology and energy stocks slumped on Tuesday. At the same time, liquor and rare-earth stocks outperformed. Chinese shares staged a historic rally in recent months, driven by easing trade tensions with the U.S., stimulus hopes, and investors rotating funds from bonds and bank deposits into equities. Analysts noted that part of the 160 trillion yuan ($22.3 trillion) in household savings accumulated since the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to flow into stocks as deposit rates decline and property prices remain in a downturn. Meanwhile, China’s central bank injected a large amount of liquidity into the financial system on Tuesday, a move seen as helping to stabilize bonds that have faced pressure from investors shifting into equities. The People’s Bank of China added a net 465.7 billion yuan ($65 billion) of short-term cash through reverse repurchase agreements, marking the largest daily net injection since July 25th and the third largest this year. In other news, China eased its regulations on drama production to boost content supply, a move that analysts say will benefit producers and long-video streaming platforms.

Wall Street’s muted overnight finish also weighed on the benchmark index. GCI Asset Management’s senior portfolio manager, Takamasa Ikeda, said, “Almost everyone in the market thinks that the market is overheated, so there is a sell-off even from a small negative cue.” Financial and video game stocks led the declines on Tuesday.

Sales fell again from the year-ago period. Customer traffic declined. And shoppers spent less on average during their trips to Target's website and stores than a year ago.\nFiddelke, announced Wednesday as Target CEO Brian Cornell's successor, will soon lead the retailer's comeback efforts and will have to show he can revitalize a company where he has spent about two decades. On an earnings call Wednesday, he acknowledged Target is falling short, but described his long run with the retailer as \"an asset\" and said he knows what Target can be at its best.\n\"I know we're not realizing our full potential right now, and so I'm stepping into the role with a clear and urgent commitment to build new momentum in the business and get back to profitable growth,\" he said.\nThough Fiddelke is not yet in the role, he said Target isn't waiting until his starting date in February to make changes.\nHe pledged to move with urgency to get the company back to sales growth. And he laid out his top three priorities, saying he would focus on winning back Target's reputation as a strong merchant, enhancing the customer experience at stores and using technology to improve its business.\nOn Wednesday, Target said it had fresh evidence that its turnaround efforts are already bearing fruit. The company's sales improved from the first quarter to the the second quarter, Fiddelke said, even though they were negative year over year. Sales trends in all six of Target's key merchandise categories improved from the previous quarter, he said. And the retailer got better at fighting out-of-stocks, with the best on-shelf availability of items that it has had in years, he said.\nIt appears it will take more change to appease Wall Street, though. The second-quarter results extended a rocky several years for Target, which has tested the faith of many investors. Target's market value has fallen from a high of $129 billion in 2021 to about $45 billion on Wednesday.\nThe 49-year-old Fiddelke rose through the Target ranks after starting as an intern. He has held positions across merchandising, finance, operations and human resources, including a recent stint as chief financial officer and his current role of chief operating officer. He also got tapped to lead the Enterprise Acceleration Office, a new effort that Target announced in May to kickstart its turnaround.\nYet Targets decision to hire the insider Fiddelke, instead of an external candidate, got a chilly reception. Investors responded to the pick with a stock selloff on Wednesday.\nShares fell more than 6% on Wednesday, bringing its losses so far this calendar year to about 27%. That trails well behind the more than 8% gains of the S&P 500 during the same period.\nWall Street had favored an outsider for the job, according to a June survey of 51 investors by Mizuho Securities, an equity research firm. About 96% of investors polled favored an external hire for Target's next CEO, it found.\nManny Chirico, the former CEO of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger parent PVH, said investors were hungry for a bigger change.\n\"I think the market is questioning whether the internal candidate, with Brian [Cornell] staying on as executive chair, is that a bold enough move going forward?\" he said in an interview Wednesday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\nFrom 'top of the world' to stagnant sales\nOne of Fiddelke's first major challenges will be convincing investors and shoppers that Target can recapture the magic that turned it into a company that other retailers emulated and poached for talent.\nCustomers and former employees told CNBC the retailer had lost some of its best-known traits, including its clean and well-stocked stores, friendly staff and attention-grabbing merchandise. Some customers also decided to shop elsewhere in response as they protested its Pride collection, its subsequent move to pull some items from that line and its decision to roll back key diversity, equity and inclusion efforts\nTarget became known as \"Tarzhay,\" a French-sounding nickname, because of its strength in offering trendy and often exclusive clothing, home decor and more at lower prices. It turned its stores into a mall-like experience by adding Starbucks and small shops from Ulta Beauty.\nThe company's ability to nudge shoppers to splurge sparked jokes and social media memes about walking into the store for one item, yet walking out with dozens.\n\"There was a time when Target was on top of the world,\" said David Bellinger, retail analyst for Mizuho Securities, on Wednesday.\nTarget's sales rose more than $15 billion in the fiscal year following the start of the Covid pandemic, fueled in part by stimulus dollars. Its shares soared to an all-time closing high of $266.39 in 2021. On Wednesday afternoon, its stock was trading more than 60% below that level, closing the day at $98.69.\nTarget's annual sales have been roughly flat for the past four years. Target said it expects total sales to fall by a low-single-digit percentage this fiscal year.\nOther factors hurt Target after the pandemic. Customers shelled out on dining, concerts and vacations and faced decades-high inflation. And the retail supply chain faced new tests, most recently in the form of President Donald Trump's tariff hikes.\nTarget also lost ground with competitors. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on Target's earnings call in May that the retailer held or gained market share in 15 of its 35 merchandise divisions in the first quarter. Put another way, it lost ground in the majority of categories that it sells.\nWhile Target faced problems out of its power, many of its issues were self-inflicted, Stacey Widlitz, president of SW Retail Advisors, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday.\n\"It's used to be clean and exciting and fresh brands,\" she said. \"That has just all changed in the past two years, and we've heard them talk about how they're going to fix it, and we haven't seen it.\"\nBellinger said he has seen the changes on trips to his nearby Target store. Curbside pickup is quick and convenient. But inside of the store, he said a lot of merchandise is locked up to prevent theft, customers wait in long lines to check out and the cashier area is short-staffed.\n\"It's just not an easy shopping experience,\" he said.\nIn one of the new challenges Fiddelke will have to face, Target and Ulta next August will end their partnership, which had helped to drive beauty sales for Target.\nWooing back customers and Wall Street\nEven before the CEO announcement, Target touted its plan to get back to its Tarzhay image. Its leaders have pointed to signs that strategy is working.\nTarget's limited-time collection with Kate Spade, which launched in mid-April and included colorful dresses, accessories and more, was its strongest designer partnership in a decade.\nGomez described its new line of Champion activewear and sporting goods, which debuted this month, as \"really the epitome of Tarzhay.\"\nThe work to make merchandise more appealing will continue, Fiddelke said Wednesday. For example, he said it's overhauling its hardlines category, which includes items like TVs, laptops, toys and trading cards.\nTarget also wants to turn around weaker sales in its home goods category. Its new Disney and Marvel-themed bedding and decor in its kids' home line, Pillowfort, and new colors, patterns and fabrics in Casaluna, its premium bedding line, have been popular, Fiddelke said.\n\"Now, what the team needs to do is say 'Okay, we need to do more of that, more consistently, more frequently, across bigger parts of the business,'\" he said.\nIt plans to make changes next year to Threshold, its largest home goods brand, he said.\nBeyond fixing its brands and launching new merchandise, Fiddelke's ability to turn around the company may hinge on one critical task: restoring the identity of a retailer that loyal customers knew and loved.\n\"If Target went away tomorrow, you'd have a lot of disappointed consumers, millions of consumers,\" Bellinger said. \"There is a true core customer who loves Target, and there's a ton of upside here, if they can figure it out.\"","content_hash":"8c444392cd6b0fdaded3396a0661813f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":8360,"method_rank":0}

The retailer’s shares have taken a heavy beating this year, and it’s not hard to see why. While retail giants like Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST) continue to benefit from essential goods, Target built its empire on trendy-yet-affordable discretionary merchandise, exactly what consumers are cutting when money gets tight.\nMounting inflation concerns, potential tariff impacts, and overall economic uncertainty have pushed shoppers to prioritize necessities over Target’s signature offerings. The retailer is watching its sales in its key discretionary categories, such as home decor, struggle as customers become increasingly selective with their spending.\nAs a result of having a higher percentage of discretionary merchandise than its peers, Target is losing market share to rivals like Walmart and Costco, which have proven more resilient during economic uncertainties due to their greater focus on everyday necessities. So, amid this ongoing decline in consumer confidence, here’s a fresh look at the retail giant as it gears up to lift the curtains on its second-quarter earnings on Aug. 20.\nAbout Target Stock\nMinneapolis-based Target is a leading general merchandise retailer offering a wide range of products and services across various categories, including apparel, home goods, electronics, beauty, groceries, and everyday essentials. Beyond products, Target emphasizes convenience through services such as the Target app, Target Circle loyalty program, same-day delivery with Shipt, order pickup, drive-up, and free 2-day shipping.\nWith 1,981 stores nationwide, supported by 66 supply chain facilities and 29 global office locations, Target employs over 400,000 team members who drive its operations and guest experience. Notably, more than 75% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Target store, underscoring its strong community presence and accessibility. But despite its strong presence, the company has been struggling.\nIn addition to macroeconomic challenges weighing on consumer sentiment, Target’s stock also faced pressure earlier this year after the retailer dialed back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. While other companies have taken similar steps in the wake of President Donald Trump’s reelection, Target’s reversal drew sharper backlash given its reputation as an early leader in such initiatives.\nThe move has alienated some of its core shoppers, adding to the headwinds facing the stock. The company’s market capitalization presently stands at about $47.7 billion. So far this year, shares of the retail giant have declined a notable 21.6%, significantly underperforming the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which is up a modest 9.3% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.\nAfter months of lackluster trading, Target’s stock is starting to look like a bargain opportunity. Shares currently trade at just 13.78 times forward earnings and 0.44 times sales, which is well below the sector medians of 16.58 times and 1.19 times, respectively. In addition to its compelling valuation, Target continues to stand tall as a reliable income play.\nWith a remarkable 54 consecutive years of dividend growth, the retailer holds the elite status of a Dividend King. In June, the company lifted its payout once again, up 1.8% to $1.14 per share, payable on Sept. 1, underscoring its commitment to shareholders even as the business navigates headwinds. On a forward basis, the annual dividend of $4.56 per share translates to a generous yield of 4.3%. And with Target remaining solidly profitable even amid its recent struggles, its dividend looks well-covered.\nTarget’s Q1 Earnings Snapshot\nTarget opened fiscal 2025 on a challenging note, with first-quarter results released on May 21 underscoring the strain on consumer spending. Net sales slipped 2.8% year-over-year (YOY) to $23.8 billion, falling short of Wall Street’s $24.4 billion forecast. Comparable sales declined 3.8%, dragged by a 5.7% drop in store traffic, though digital sales stood out with a 4.7% gain, powered by a robust 36% surge in same-day services such as Drive Up and Target Circle 360.\nEarnings told a mixed story. GAAP EPS rose to $2.27 from $2.03 a year earlier, boosted by a $593 million legal settlement tied to credit card interchange fees. However, stripping out that one-time gain, adjusted EPS fell to $1.30, well below last year’s $2.03 and missing analyst expectations by nearly 20%.\nCategory trends highlighted consumer caution, with sales falling across most discretionary areas, while Food and Beverage edged slightly higher to $5.9 billion.\nEven so, the retail giant stayed true to its shareholder-friendly stance, returning capital through an impressive $510 million in dividends and $251 million in share buybacks during the quarter, demonstrating a commitment to investors despite a challenging backdrop.\nTarget Investors, Mark Your Calendars for August 20\nTarget’s soft first-quarter results underscored the retailer’s ongoing struggle to reignite growth and reclaim its once-iconic “cheap chic” appeal. CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged that while the company’s fundamentals remain sound, management isn’t content with the current pace of progress. To speed things up, Cornell unveiled the creation of a new multi-year Enterprise Acceleration Office, to be led by Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, along with several leadership changes aimed at boosting execution.\nAccording to Cornell, these moves are designed to bring more speed and agility into Target’s operations while sharpening its core capabilities to fuel long-term, profitable growth. Still, the near-term outlook has dimmed. The company now projects a low-single-digit sales decline for the current fiscal year, a reversal from its earlier forecast of roughly 1% growth. On the earnings front, Target expects adjusted EPS, excluding litigation settlement gains, to land between $7 and $9 for the year, down from its prior range of $8.80 to $9.80.\nThe company is scheduled to release its second-quarter earnings report before the market opens on Wednesday, Aug. 20, and Wall Street isn’t expecting much cheer. Analysts project the retailer’s bottom line to fall 19.8% YOY, with EPS estimated at $2.09. Apart from giving insights about its financial health, the upcoming results will also serve as a gauge for broader retail sector resilience.\nTarget’s upcoming report is expected to offer a window into changing consumer behavior, its ability to manage inventory efficiently, and how well it’s holding onto pricing power in the face of inflation and labor market pressures. More importantly, the report will act as a pulse check on discretionary spending and the financial health of middle-income consumers, key drivers of Target’s growth story.\nWhat Do Analysts Think About Target Stock?\nWith second-quarter earnings approaching, Wall Street appears cautious on TGT stock, maintaining a consensus “Hold” rating overall. Among 35 analysts, only eight are backing the stock with a “Strong Buy” and three with a “Moderate Buy,” while a majority of 18 analysts sit on the sidelines with a “Hold.” On the bearish side, one analyst recommends a “Moderate Sell,” while five go further with a “Strong Sell,” underscoring the uncertainty ahead of the report.\nTGT’s average analyst price target of $108.10 signals only 3% potential upside from current levels, while the Street-high target of $135 indicates that the stock can rally as much as 28% from here.\nOn the date of publication, Anushka Mukherji did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.03%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -0.02%.\nStock indexes on Monday settled little changed, pressured by higher bond yields. Last Thursday’s bearish July PPI reported dampened speculation that the Fed could cut interest rates as soon as next month’s FOMC meeting. The 10-year T-note yield rose to a 2-week high Monday at 4.35% and finished up +2 bp to 4.34%.\nStocks were also weighed down by uncertainty regarding Monday’s meeting between European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelenskiy with President Trump in Washington to discuss potential terms to end the Russian-Ukrainian war. The outcome could have macroeconomic implications regarding tariffs and oil prices, and could, of course, have significant consequences for European security. In addition, concerns about how consumers are holding up in the early days of President Trump’s tariffs also weighed on stocks ahead of earnings results this week from some of the biggest US retailers, including Walmart, Target, and Home Depot.\nMonday’s US economic news was negative for stocks after the Aug NAHB housing market index unexpectedly fell -1 to 32, weaker than expectations of an increase to 34.\nThe focus of the markets this week will be on any new tariff news and signs of progress toward a Ukraine peace deal, with Ukrainian President Zelenskiy and European leaders meeting President Trump in Washington on Monday. On Tuesday, Jul housing starts are expected to fall -1.6% m\/m to 1.300 million, and Jul building permits are expected to fall -0.4% m\/m to 1.388 million. On Wednesday, the minutes of the July 29-30 FOMC meeting will be released. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +1,000 to 225,000 and the Aug Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to fall to 6.7 from 15.9 in July. Also, the Aug S&P manufacturing PMI is expected to remain unchanged at 49.8. In addition, Jul existing home sales are expected to fall -0.3% m\/m to 3.92 million. On Friday, Fed Chair Powell speaks on the economic outlook at the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\nRegarding tariffs, President Trump said last Friday, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.\nIn other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 84% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 51% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\nEarnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y\/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y\/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 92% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 82% of companies exceeded profit estimates.\nOverseas stock markets on Monday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.26%. China’s Shanghai Composite rallied to a 10-year high and closed up +0.85%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 rallied to a new record high and closed up +0.77%.\nInterest Rates\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) Monday closed down -2.5 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield rose +2.0 bp to 4.336%. Sep T-notes fell to a 2-week low on Monday, and the 10-year T-note yield rose to a 2-week high of 4.351%. T-notes are under pressure on concern that last week’s bearish US July CPI and PPI reports could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates at next month’s FOMC meeting.\nLosses in T-notes were limited after Monday’s news showed the Aug NAHB housing market index unexpectedly declined. T-notes are also supported by an increase in safe-haven demand after there was no breakthrough in the Trump-Putin summit last Friday to end the war in Ukraine.\nEuropean government bond yields on Monday were mixed. The 10-year German bund yield fell -2.5 bp to 2.763%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rose to a 2.5-month high of 4.748% and finished up by +4.2 bp to 4.738%.\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 5% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\nUS Stock Movers\nNatural gas producing stocks retreated Monday after Roth Capital Partners downgraded the sector on concerns that oversupply will keep prices depressed.

The stock market is now closed.\nHere are the latest updates from the market:\nUpdate: 4:01 p.m. ET\nAfter Market Round-Up: Stocks Down\nThe Dow (+0.024%) was roughly flat at day-end after setting an intraday high of 45,207.39 in early trading. Its intraday high reignited hopes that the index could soon eclipse its all-time high. Its last record close was in December.\nThe other indexes were not so lucky. The S&P 500 (-0.59%), the Russell 2000 (-0.86%), and the Nasdaq Composite (-1.46%) all declined as megacaps struggled.\nAI plays like Palantir (-9.3%), Oracle (-5.93%), Broadcom (-3.75%), AMD (-5.48%), and Nvidia (-3.47%) were among the worst-situated.\nAmong other megacaps: Netflix (-2.48%), Meta (-2.1%), Tesla (-1.75%), and Amazon (-1.5%) also saw declines.\nZooming out and taking a look at the Russell 3000, which includes most of the U.S. stock market, you can see the big names really struggled.\nOutside of tech services and electronic technology, most sectors seemed to perform fairly well today.\nAmong larger firms in the S&P 500, 8 of the 11 SPDR Sector funds were in the green, led by Real Estate (XLRE) (+1.64%).\nIn macro land, the 10Y Treasury fell 0.035% to 4.304%. Gold fell 0.52% to 3,360.50.\nIt's not going to be a very exciting after hours this Tuesday. There's just a handful of earnings coming out, mostly from companies that aren't on most investors' radar.\nThere's electronics company Keysight Technologies KEYS, Chinese logistics company ZTO Express (ZTO) , and homebuilder Toll Brothers (TOL) .\nAside from that, there's not a lot else. In fact, here is every AH report from companies with a market cap >$1 billion:\nUpdate: 2:32 p.m. ET\nTop Mover: Watching WW International\nIn May, WeightWatchers International filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, encumbered by over a billion dollars in debt and a weight-loss drug revolution. It pivoted too late, but after emerging from bankruptcy in late June, the stock is up 25%.\nAdding fuel to the fire, the company's new focus on GLP-1 drugs and women's health has it on new footing. It now boasts a partnership with Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk (NVO) and new leadership. Last week, it lifted its FY 2025 guidance.\nWelcome back, WW International (WW) , today's top stock. Here's its 52-week performance:\nUpdate: 12:45 p.m. ET\nNYT Reports Meta Restructuring AI Division\nPer The New York Times, Meta Platforms (META) (-2.1%) is reportedly planning to embark on a restructuring of its AI division.\nThe restructuring will plan to break the expansive Meta Superintelligence Labs into four separate teams: one dedicated to AI research, the company's superintelligence efforts, products, and infrastructure\/data centers\/hardware.\nDespite the breakup, NYT adds that some executives will depart the company and some roles could be eliminated at the thousands-strong division.\nWe're now over the mid-day hump. The Dow's impressive intraday rally has melted away, with all four indexes — the Nasdaq (-1.05%), the Russell 2000 (-0.45%), the S&P 500 (-0.42%), and the Dow (-0.04%) — now down. Here are today's mid-day movers and losers:\nHome Depot\nHome improvement store Home Depot (HD) (+3.2%) is up despite a relatively tepid quarterly showing, which saw comparable sales rise 1%. However, the company told investors that it would stick to its guns on its annual guidance — and raise prices because of tariffs (something it said it wouldn't do last quarter). Both have been taken as bullish, making it the best-performing component of the Dow today (and one of the standout players in the S&P 500).\nIntel\nIntel (INTC) (+8%) has been gyrating in recent days on reports that the U.S. Government will convert its CHIPS Act grant into equity, giving it a 10% stake in the chipmaker. It seems to be moving in that direction, with SoftBank announcing it will invest $2 billion in the company. Guess nothing says \"America First\" more than Japan's largest bank investing billions in U.S. infrastructure.\nPalo Alto Networks\nCybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) (+4.6%) is up after reporting earnings yesterday after the bell. Revenues rose 16% year-over-year, but the real standout was its remaining performance obligations (RPOs), which rose 24%. The company issued better-than-expected guidance, with the RPOs seen pointing to a future increase in revenue.\nXPeng\nChinese EV company XPeng (XPEV) (+4.7%) saw its revenue more than double in its latest quarterly report, delivering 103,181 vehicles in the quarter, a 241% year-over-year increase from the comparable period in 2024. Demand continued to rise, while margins improved. At the same time, the company's net loss narrowed.\nViking Therapeutics\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) (-41.7%) plummeted after releasing data from a trial of its new weight loss pill, revealing that 28% of patients discontinued treatment because of side effects. Most side effects were mild. And to that end, patients lost 12.2% of their body weight after taking the drug for 13 weeks. However, the dropout rate and data were seen as inferior to results from Eli Lilly's (LLY) orforglipron, which released data earlier this month.\nUpdate: 10:38 a.m. ET\nDow hits intraday record high\nWhile other stock indexes are sagging — the Nasdaq (-0.94%), Russell 2000 (-0.26%), and S&P 500 (-0.25%) — the Dow has ascended to new heights. Minutes ago, the index was up 0.56%, setting an intraday record high of 45,207.39. That's the highest reported price that the index has ever seen.\nThe strong showing today comes courtesy of Home Depot (+3.3%), which seems to be lifting sector peers like Sherwin-Williams (SHW) (+2.3%) and Caterpillar (CAT) (+1.5%). All three are atop the Dow today.\nUpdate: 10:05 a.m. ET\nOpening Stat Line\nThe stock market has now been open for about 30 minutes. During that time, the Nasdaq (-0.29%) and Russell 2000 (-0.06%) have fallen; the S&P 500 (+0.10%) and Dow (+0.49%) have grown to the upside. The 10-yr is 0.031% lower to 4.308%, while gold and the VIX are up. Check back shortly for mid-day movers.\nUpdate: 8:35 a.m. ET\nEconomic Data: Starts surprise, Permits plummet\nIn the last five minutes, we've gotten today's biggest economic prints: housing starts and building permits. Directionally, they couldn't be anymore different.\nPrelim Building Permits (Jul): 1,354,000 (-2.8% MoM) [Exp: 1,386,000; -0.5%]\nWhere housing starts impressed, building permits remained tepid in the face of plummeting building demand. That would suggest that construction will remain robust, at least until current builds are complete. Those permits create concerns about the future pipeline.\nLater this morning, we'll tackle how that's affecting the price of lumber (and what that says about the broader economy.)\nUpdate: 8:08 a.m. ET\nEarnings Today: Home Depot, Medtronic, Viking Holdings\nToday is set to be a quiet day, with just 45 earnings reports slated for today, per data from Nasdaq.

The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2% over the last two days, the worst two-day fall since August 1st.\nThe semiconductor index was down 1.4% , while the information technology sector was the second biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding 1% on Wednesday.\nMarket participants attributed the selloff to a range of factors including a technical pullback after driving much of the stock market's recovery in the weeks after the April 2nd \"Liberation Day.\"\nAside from AI concerns, analysts also cited deepening fears of government interference with companies, as the Trump administration looked into taking equity stakes in chip companies such as Intel in exchange for grants under the CHIPS Act.\nCOMMENTS:\nCHRISTOPHER MURPHY, CO-HEAD OF DERIVATIVES STRATEGY, SUSQUEHANNA, PENNSYLVANIA:\n\"I think it's more likely this is an overstretched pause than the beginning of a new rotation. The most notable trade midday was a seller of 20k+ Dec 100 puts as SPX rebounded sharply, suggesting investors are taking advantage of the pullback via selling puts rather than signaling a wholesale shift. For now, flows point to taking advantage of the sell-off as opposed to a clear reallocation of capital into new sectors.\"\nCHRISTOPHER VECCHIO, HEAD OF FUTURES & FOREX, TASTYLIVE, NEW YORK:\n\"Tech stocks are sliding as investors pare back risk ahead of the Fed's Jackson Hole meeting, with traders reluctant to chase valuations higher into a Powell speech that will likely fall short of promising a September rate cut.\"\n\"Fresh concerns over the durability of the AI boom, after an MIT study highlighted weak corporate returns and comments from OpenAI's Sam Altman cited excess buildout in the space, have added to the pressure.\"\n\"If it's the start of a rotation, it's less of a 'growth shifting to value' or 'smalls caps over mega caps' shift and more of a 'classic defensive' posturing around economic weakness: bonds, gold, healthcare, and consumer staples are leading the way. If there was a time of the year for a pullback, it's now: over the past 10- and 20-years, the S&P 500 has averaged losses of -1.7% and -1.2%, respectively, during the August to October window.\"\nART HOGAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, B. RILEY WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BOSTON:\n\"Technology in general is up 40% from its April lows, and the group clearly got ahead of itself. Also, if there's anything to the market consensus that we'll see a Fed rate cut, then there will be room for other things to work as well – and there are 493 other stocks in the S&P 500 that are lagging the Mag 7 right now. So I think there's a bit of a rotation.\"\n\"I don't know how long it will last, but if it does keep going, well, August and September (are) the weak period seasonally in which it could do so. Also, there are some people who are beginning to question the pace at which we need to be chasing AI capital spending. If you put all this together: when technology stocks take a breather, this is what it looks like. Nvidia and other blue chips in the group are seeing relatively steady drawdowns, but things on the speculative edge are clearly seeing more selling pressure. Palantir has gone from trading at 200 times sales to 150 times its sales, for instance.\"\nMICHAEL ASHLEY SCHULMAN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, RUNNING POINT, EL SEGUNDO, CALIFORNIA:\n\"Tuesday' s U.S. technology stock swoon and its continuation today looks like multiple compression meeting a little margin math, but the timing makes it hard to ignore the new elephant in the server room. Names that had been sprinting on AI dreams pulled back hard, with Nvidia, AMD, and Palantir Technologies among the drags.\"\n\"DeepSeek's update landed on Tuesday represents a serious cocktail of capability and availability and traders well remember the original harsh tech-market pullback DeepSeek caused when it was first broadly recognized in January of this year.\"\nBRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, BROOKFIELD, WISCONSIN:\n\"When you go from rally to rout, it shows how vulnerable the names were to even a scent of bad news. It could have been (Sam)Altman's valuation warning and then Meta restructuring its AI division threw fuel on the fire.\"\n\"I think we are starting to see a little bit of rotation. It's always healthy to see a little bit of a pullback to that way, the markets can kind of get re-oriented.\"\n\"To me, tech was overbought. Maybe it was justified, but it could have been kind of a buy on the rumor, sell it on the news type of thing where we had tech runup into earnings. We had really good earnings, and now it's kind of natural for the market just to sell some of that good news.\"\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if we see a little bit of rotation into some smaller cap or into healthcare names, or consumer staples. And to me, that's kind of a healthy rotation. But honestly, I don't believe it will be a longer-term trend. It'll probably be a shorter-term trend. I think we'll see money flow back into tech in the next couple months.\"\nPHIL BLANCATO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, LADENBURG THALMANN ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK:\n\"It's much more about profit-taking and temporary rebalancing here. If you get a Federal Reserve cut or a mention of it on Friday, this will reverse pretty quickly, but this is a lot to do with names pushed up to really lofty levels and profit taking across the board.\"\nSTEVE SOSNICK, CHIEF STRATEGIST, INTERACTIVE BROKERS, CONNECTICUT:\n\"The tech-led selloff that we saw yesterday resumed this morning. That said, dip buyers stepped in around 11am EDT and we've now recovered about half our losses. It's somewhat inevitable to expect them to arrive promptly, though it did take a bit longer than usual.\"\n\"I believe that some of the early declines are related to profit-taking and risk squaring ahead of (Fed Chair Jerome)Powell's speech on Friday. That is merely rotation and relatively benign, though it gets magnified because of megacap tech stocks' heavy weighting in key indices. But some of the ferocity of the early drop was related to the President's calls for Lisa Cook's resignation.\"\n\"Note that futures broke through their pre-market lows shortly after he posted on Truth Social. Markets were not perturbed that there are inquiries into the propriety of her personal mortgage applications. She gets a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, like any other person. But when the President weighed in even before the process began, then it raised the specter of politicization. That put markets on the wrong foot early, and negative momentum ruled again – at least for a couple of hours.\"\nADAM SARHAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, 50 PARK INVESTMENTS, NEW YORK:\n\"To see a little pullback here after a big move up is perfectly normal and healthy. If the selling gets worse then you'll see a rotation out of tech and into undervalued areas of the market like biotech stocks or healthcare stocks or small cap stocks because those areas have not participated this year.\"\n(Reporting by Carolina Mandl, Johann Cherian, Laura Matthews, Suzanne McGee, and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss)","content_hash":"505a35371ce70f36c3a73c583fb22c32","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":7139,"method_rank":0}

Palestinians and rights groups have warned the move could destroy plans for a future Palestinian state.\nCeasefire talks uncertain\nKatz, who replaced Yoav Gallant as defense minister last year, was on Tuesday holding a discussion to approve \"strike plans in Gaza\" with Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, Lt.

LaSalle St. Securities, Osaic and Purshe Kaplan Sterling Investments also saw movers in that time frame.\nLPL Financial said it had finalized offers to Commonwealth advisors during an August earnings call. On that call, CEO Rich Steinmeier said the results have the firm well on track for its goal of keeping 90% of the roughly 3,000 advisors slated to come over via an acquisition of the Waltham, Mass-based broker\/dealer announced in March.\nSteinmeier also said reports in trade outlets of advisors moving were overblown, and that attrition of Commonwealth advisors was as expected.\nEven so, several more teams decided to move ahead of next year’s planned integration of Commonwealth advisors onto LPL platforms, according to the data and regulatory filings. None of the broker\/dealers or individual advisors responded to requests for comment.\nShelby Nicholl, founder of recruitment and consulting firm Muriel Consulting, who did not work on these specific moves, said the advisors were likely sure they wanted to exit shortly after the deal was announced, while more are either preparing to move or still on the fence.\n“I look at the Commonwealth exits as a marathon, not a sprint,” Nicholl said. “It’s a safe bet that we will see another big wave of departures this fall as advisors race to finish transitions before the holidays and year-end.”\nNicholl said these first wave of departures likely “had zero interest in the LPL deal.” Meanwhile, others signed the retention package while still planning to move later this year or early next. And still some will see how things play out.\n“LPL will need to play the long game and keep the servicing high for the existing Commonwealth advisors in order to retain them,” she wrote.\nKestra’s largest get in recent months was Dynasty Advisors, a team based in Freehold, N.J., with 17 employees and 11 advisors, according to its website. According to BrokerCheck, managing directors Ronald Lomangino and William Grundig moved the firm to Commonwealth in 2016.\nThe Benjamin Group, an advisory firm based in Vestavia Hills, Ala., also moved to Kestra. Father-and-son advisors Stuart and Zack Benjamin, along with four staff members, had been with Commonwealth for over 18 years.\nThe Monarch Retirement Group, a six-person team based in Fallbrook, Calif., and two advisors who run Udall Financial in Mesa, Ariz., also made the move.\nOn Monday, it announced the latest of three recent moves by Commonwealth advisor teams who had worked with a combined $687 million in client assets. Jeremy Lobo, Chris Pascale and Michael “Mike” Mendillo brought their Lobo & Pascale Wealth Management firm to Raymond James to be based in Wallingford, Conn. Lobo and Pascale, who had been managing $300 million in client assets, had been with Commonwealth for 24 years.\nAccording to ISS Market Intelligence data, FlahertyColvin, a Westerville, Ohio-based team of five, left Commonwealth for Raymond James in early March after 12 years with the broker\/dealer.\nHinkson Wealth Management, another six-person midwestern team, also shifted its Troy, Mich.-based practice to Raymond James. That firm’s CEO and President, Greg Hinkson, had been with Commonwealth for over 20 years, according to BrokerCheck.\nData also showed that three-person firm Planning Strategies, based in Dallas, Texas, and run by father-and-son Mike and Spencer Williams, left Commonwealth after founder Mike had been with the broker\/dealer for 11 years.\nFrank LaRosa, CEO of Elite Consulting Partners, agreed that many Commonwealth advisors are still assessing their options of whether to stay or go to the larger LPL. He noted that even if advisors accept the retention package, which LPL said would range from 10 to 50 basis points, it is not binding and can be paid back within seven to 10 years.\n“I think that advisors that weren’t sure, or even had a knee-jerk reaction that they weren’t going to LPL, are still doing their due diligence and are making sure that whatever decision they make is the right one,” LaRosa said.\nHe said teams that have already moved likely had things in motion shortly after the announcement. That makes it hard to gauge yet whether LPL is on track to hit its 90% attrition goal.\n“If you just look at the timing of everything since the announcement, I think there are a lot of teams, or even just groups of advisors, who are still looking to find the right place,” he said. “Getting a group of advisors together can be a bit like herding cats .… it takes time to find the right solution.”\nLPL CEO Steinmeier had said during earnings earlier this month that the firm had been doing “fever-pitched engagement” with Commonwealth advisors, and that “as we’ve stated continually, we are committed to preserving that unique culture, the advisor experience, the brand, and in fact, we’ll only enhance what they already receive with the combination of the LPL capabilities with that Commonwealth experience.”\nAfter the deal was announced, LaRosa had expected broker\/dealers such as Kestra, Raymond James, and potentially Cetera to win out in the recruiting push for Commonwealth advisors as they looked for cultural or service fit. Larger RIAs may also be winners, while some advisors may start their own shops.\nLaRosa also said some may prioritize the ability to stick with Fidelity as a custodian, which Kestra provides access to, and which Cetera has said will be available to advisors in October. For his part, LaRosa tries to coach advisors that clients are not likely to leave due to the custodian, and to focus more on the service aspect for the advisor and their clients.\nRecruiter Shelby also noted that Cambridge Investments is “picking up teams” from Commonwealth. She said the deals “aren’t as rich, but the ethos of the firm is similar to Commonwealth.\"\nMeanwhile, Kestra and Raymond James benefitted from going out quickly with “aggressive deals” and “a capabilities suite that matches Commonwealth advisors’ needs.”","content_hash":"5677d1f670f8030003abc69671743dd7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6335,"method_rank":0}

This time it’s Christine Hunsicker of CaaStle, indicted on July 18 for allegedly falsifying financial records, misrepresenting profits, and continuing fraud even after her removal by the board. According to reports, before meeting with an audit firm, she searched online for the terms “fraud,” “created an audit firm fake,” and “JP morgan 4m records faked”—an apparent reference to fraud charges related to yet another disgraced founder, Charlie Javice of Frank. These incidents are no longer outliers. They’re becoming a pattern, and the startup world has yet to confront what that the pattern reveals:\nThe startup ecosystem is designedto encourage deception.\nRisk-taking and self-confidence\nWe all know that most founders share a penchant for risk-taking and a healthy sense of self-confidence. But couple these characteristics with the relentless assault of pressures that constitute daily startup life, and you have a recipe for trouble. Risk-taking slips into recklessness, and confidence metastasizes into outright narcissism. Lying is the norm.\nParticularly during the early stages, a “Growth at All Costs” imperative means that startups feel obliged to pursue aggressive growth to secure high valuations and attract continuous investment rounds. This pressure can lead founders to inflate metrics, fabricate success, or conceal failures to maintain investor confidence. Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX secretly transferred customer funds to his trading firm, Alameda Research, concealing these movements and misleading stakeholders.\nFrom optimism to deception\nA “Fake It Till You Make It” culture means that what starts as harmless optimism can easily escalate into deliberate deception. Founders initially omit negative details, then progressively falsify data to uphold illusions of success. Nikola founder Trevor Milton exaggerated product capabilities, even staging videos of a nonoperational electric truck rolling down a hill.\nThe brutal demands of fundraising result in constant pressure to secure funding and maintain operational cash flow, which often pushes founders to compromise ethically. The necessity to present a highly favorable narrative to investors encourages fraudulent embellishments. Combined with a lack of oversight and governance, especially in early-stage startups, this leaves founders unchecked, increasing opportunities for fraud. Early investors and boards often fail to provide rigorous oversight due to limited motivation or expertise.\nA gradual process\nWhite-collar fraud is always a gradual process. No one jumps straight into the deep end of the criminality pool. Law enforcement officials have a “10:10:80” rule of thumb when it comes to white-collar fraud: 10% of people would never commit fraud, 10% of people are actively seeking out opportunities to commit fraud, and 80% of people have the potential to commit fraud if the timing and circumstances are right. The vast majority of these founders probably started in the 80%, along with most of the rest of us. It often begins with minor embellishments aimed at securing initial investment. Successful deception attracts further funding, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.\nBut as the discrepancies between reality and claims widen, founders face intensified pressure to maintain their narratives, resorting to increasingly severe fraud to conceal earlier lies. Witness Christine Hunsicker’s continued deception even after her board had essentially kicked her out of her company.\nSeismic consequences\nThe consequences of all this founder misbehavior can be cataclysmic. They extend well beyond the direct financial losses to investors. Broader investor confidence deteriorates, leading to reduced funding availability for legitimate startups. Employees suffer job losses, reputational damage, and psychological distress. Customers can experience direct harm, as in Theranos’s false medical test results. The broader innovation ecosystem becomes risk-averse, slowing innovation due to increased regulatory scrutiny and cautious investment behaviors.\nPotential time bombs\nTo mitigate this deadly cocktail of ego and pressure, we first need to understand that all founders are potential time bombs: the same traits that help them secure money, talent, and press are the ones that can eventually lead to their undoing. The old method was pretty straightforward: fire the founder, and replace them with a manager. But that only leads to zombie companies that stifle innovation in the crib.\nStartup founders are constantly being gaslit. They’re being flattered as geniuses and world-changers on a daily basis. Many of their direct reports are sharp, canny careerists who only want to share good news. It’s easy to see how people can lose perspective and start believing their own hype within the “emperor’s new clothes” environment of a startup.\nThese people need perspective in order to curb the worst tendencies of startup culture. Every founder should cultivate a “star chamber” of mentors who are removed from the everyday persecutions of the startup in question (perhaps an older CEO, or a colleague from an accelerator program, or a startup blogger you admire). They need advice from people whom I call “models of values”: transparency, accountability, and ethical leadership. Many boards are sadly hopeless at this, because they’re complicit in the success (at all costs) of the startup.\nOversight and accountability\nOn the stick side of the carrot and stick approach, however, these people also need oversight and accountability. Their boards and investors must actively engage in governance roles, monitoring company practices and demanding transparency. They need to ensure financial transparency and operational integrity through audits and detailed reference checks.\nTo prevent the next Hunsicker, Javice, Bankman-Fried, or Holmes, we need to confront the cultural rot at the core of startup life. We still need ambitious entrepreneurs to drive innovation, but not within a system that rewards deception and punishes transparency. Unless we change the rules of the game—by rethinking incentives, strengthening oversight, and investing in founder development—we’ll keep producing brilliant visionaries who become cautionary tales.","content_hash":"348008eec75b0dd18d5d81b6259f5d91","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":6274,"method_rank":0}

A massive number of cryptocurrencies exist -- over 15 million, according to CoinMarketCap data. Because of how easy it is to launch a new cryptocurrency, the number is only growing.\nBut most of them have little to offer for investors. Crypto is a top-heavy market, and it's full of scams and projects with no legitimate use or value.\nSo, which cryptocurrencies are worth your time? Start with these three to better understand the use cases for crypto and the top investment opportunities.\n1. Bitcoin\nLaunched in 2009, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is the first cryptocurrency and the most successful. Remember how I said that the crypto market is top heavy? Well, with a market cap of $2.4 trillion (as of Aug. 14), Bitcoin makes up 56% of the entire market.\nBitcoin's purpose was to be a decentralized currency, meaning one that wasn't beholden to banks or any governing body. To accomplish that, it uses a blockchain -- a digital transaction ledger that's maintained and updated by a network of computers. Anyone who wants to participate in the Bitcoin mining process can become part of this computer network and help verify transactions.\nWhile Bitcoin was originally intended as a currency, most people don't actually use it that way. It's too volatile, and transactions are slow and expensive compared to newer cryptocurrencies.\nBitcoin has instead become a digital store of value. There's a limited number of Bitcoin available, as it has a maximum supply of 21 million. Bitcoin proponents believe that the built-in scarcity will lead to continued growth.\n2. Ethereum\nEarly cryptocurrencies used blockchains solely to record transactions. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) changed that when it launched in 2015. Ethereum was unique because it could run smart contracts, which are programs built into a blockchain.\nThe introduction of smart contracts significantly expanded what could be done with blockchain technology. Smart contract blockchains aren't just transaction ledgers; they're platforms where developers can build decentralized apps (dApps) and launch projects.\nOne of the notable use cases for smart contract blockchains is decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi refers to financial systems built on blockchain technology, such as crypto borrowing and lending protocols. For example, Aave is a peer-to-peer crypto loan service that was originally built on the Ethereum blockchain (it's also now available on other blockchains). The Aave protocol is able to facilitate crypto loans entirely with smart contracts.\nMany blockchains now have smart contract capabilities, but Ethereum was the first and has the most activity. There's $154 billion of total value locked into DeFi protocols across the entire crypto market, according to DeFiLlama. Over 60% of that value is locked into the Ethereum blockchain.\n3. Tether\nTether (CRYPTO: USDT) is the largest stablecoin by market cap. A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to stay pegged to another asset, meaning it mimics that asset's value. Tether is a U.S. dollar stablecoin, so 1 USDT should ideally maintain a value of $1 at all times.\nEven though stablecoins aren't an investment, they play a crucial role in the crypto market. Most cryptocurrencies are volatile, which poses a problem when you want to use them as a currency. The value can change quite a bit between the time you purchase a cryptocurrency and when you're ready to use it.\nSince they aren't volatile, stablecoins are better for this role. They haven't reached widespread adoption yet, but it could be a matter of time. The U.S. passed the Genius Act last month, a landmark piece of legislation that regulates stablecoins. In addition, several top financial companies are developing or considering their own stablecoins, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and PayPal.\nTether is one of many stablecoins, but since it's the biggest, it serves as a good starting point. It also demonstrates the potential risks involved. The issuer, Tether Limited, paid a $41 million fine in 2021 for misleading statements about the reserves backing its USDT tokens. Even though stablecoins are supposed to be stable, they're really only as safe as the issuer and the reserves backing them.\nManaging risk as a crypto investor\nWhile exciting, cryptocurrency is an extremely risky asset class. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most other top coins have gone through periods where they've lost 50% or more of their value.\nIf you're going to invest in crypto, it should ideally be a small portion of your portfolio. A good rule of thumb is to have anywhere from 1% to 5% of your portfolio in cryptocurrency and the rest in more established investments, including stocks and bonds. Also, only invest money you can afford to lose so you're not tempted to sell if the crypto market drops.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

But like all maturing themes, investors are craving a new wave of opportunity.\nEnter quantum computing, an emerging technology that is projected to have over $1 trillion in economic value by next decade, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\nUnlike traditional AI applications, investors seem infatuated with speculative opportunities when it comes to investing in quantum computing stocks. Rather than traditional power players such as Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft, or Amazon, one of the most talked-about names in the quantum era is Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT), or QCi for short.\nQuantum Computing (the company) just reported earnings for the second calendar quarter of 2025 -- and let me tell you, there is a lot to unpack. Is Quantum Computing stock a buy after its Q2 report?\nAnalyzing Quantum Computing's business results\nQCi's second-quarter earnings report highlighted several updates -- including mentions of a partnership with NASA, its addition to the Russell 2000 index, and incremental progress on its photonic qubit technology.\nWhile these details make for exciting headline content, how have they translated into measurable business results?\nIn Q2, the company generated just $61,000 in sales while posting a net loss of $36.5 million. In other words, QCi essentially remains a pre-revenue business with no proven path to a turnaround or sustained positive unit economics.\nDistinguishing narrative from reality\nWhile quantum computing (the technology) is increasingly hailed as the next frontier of AI, prudent investors should remain cautious. At present, the field is still dominated by research and development (R&D) rather than practical utility.\nQuantum Computing (the company) is not signing Fortune 500 clients at a record pace because of any groundbreaking innovations it has achieved -- far from it.\nFrankly, I see QCi more as a hype-driven branding story -- perhaps deliberately spinning an exciting narrative while the core business fundamentals tell a very different story.\nIs Quantum Computing stock a buy?\nWith such minimal traction and mounting losses, Quantum Computing looks more aspirational than investable -- focused on conceptual breakthroughs rather than tangible applications adopted by enterprise customers at scale.\nWhere bullish investors might push back is on the company's balance sheet. Despite QCi's tiny revenue base and recurring burn, the company ended Q2 with $349 million of cash and equivalents.\nInvestors should not be fooled by this. Quantum Computing's balance sheet strength comes from stock issuances as opposed to organic cash generation. This brings up the heart of the bear storyline: valuation.\nAs of market close on Aug. 15, QCi boasted a market cap of $2.4 billion -- equating to a price-to-sales (P\/S) multiple of more than 7,000. For perspective, this is orders of magnitude higher than established AI leaders with proven disruption.\nI think it's clear that Quantum Computing's management understands the disconnect between the company's valuation and business fundamentals. Issuing shares during a frothy stock market environment suggests that the company is capitalizing on enthusiasm driven largely by speculation and unsuspecting buyers before a valuation reset could -- and likely will -- occur.\nThe key takeaway here is that QCi stock may look like a bargain for \"just $15\" per share, but smart investors understand that the absolute share price does not solely determine the value of a business.\nQuantum Computing (the company) is historically pricey and trading at levels reminiscent of the stock market bubble of the late 1990s driven by euphoria around the internet. With nearly no revenue, widening losses, and a dependence on equity raises, I think QCi is facing a looming liquidity crunch.\nAt best, QCi is a moonshot gamble. Unless you are an investor comfortable with extreme volatility and abnormally outsize risk, Quantum Computing stock is best avoided for the time being.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Quantum Computing right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Quantum Computing, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Quantum Computing wasn’t one of them.

With a market cap of $2.5 trillion, Alphabet is a tech giant with dominance across search, advertising, video, and cloud computing. Now, the company is also reinventing itself at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.\nGOOGL stock is up 7.3% year-to-date, underperforming the tech-led Nasdaq Composite Index’s ($NASX) gain of 11.8%.\nIn the second quarter, total revenue hit $96.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Earnings rose 22% year-over-year to $2.31 per share. Search remains Alphabet’s most important business and its largest revenue driver, and it is thriving in the AI era. Search revenue jumped 11.7% to $54.2 billion. Another highlight of Q2 was Google Cloud's performance driven by AI. Cloud revenue jumped 32% year-over-year to $13.6 billion, with the backlog reaching $106 billion, up 38% year-over-year. Both new customers and existing enterprises are trusting Google’s differentiated AI-first cloud offering. Additionally, YouTube's revenue increased by 13% year over year, fueled by both brand advertising and direct response.\nAlphabet is increasing capital expenditures to $85 billion in 2025, mostly in servers and data centers, to meet the rapidly increasing demand for cloud and AI. Despite significant investments in technical infrastructure, free cash flow over the past 12 months totalled $66.7 billion. Alphabet returned $13.6 billion through share repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividends in Q2 alone, rewarding investors while maintaining $100 billion in cash and equivalents. Thanks to this financial firepower, it can continue to make significant investments in AI and provide value to shareholders.\nOverall, on Wall Street, GOOGL stock is a “Strong Buy.” Of the 54 analysts covering the stock, 41 rate it a “Strong Buy,” four say it is a “Moderate Buy,” and nine rate it a “Hold.” The average target price of $220.92 implies the stock can climb by 8.4% from current levels. Plus, its high price estimate of $250 suggests the stock has an upside potential of 24% over the next 12 months.\nAlphabet has strong moats thanks to its double-digit growth in Search, accelerating momentum in YouTube, and a thriving Google Cloud business. Furthermore, new growth bets on autonomous driving and a full-stack AI strategy position the company as one of the most attractive opportunities in big tech right now.\nWhy Eli Lilly Stock Deserves a Spot in Your Portfolio\nThe second stock on my list is Eli Lilly, a global pharmaceutical powerhouse, valued at $663 billion. Aside from its leadership in the booming market for weight-loss and diabetes therapies, the company is developing ground-breaking treatments in oncology, neuroscience, and autoimmune diseases, among other areas.\nLLY stock has fallen 9.3% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) gain of 9.6%.\nLilly’s current blockbuster products are already driving record sales. Mounjaro, which is used to treat both type-2 diabetes and obesity, has risen to the top of the total incretin prescription market in the U.S., according to management. Meanwhile, Zepbound maintains its dominance in the branded obesity drug market, accounting for two-thirds of all patients in this category. Mounjaro generated $5.2 billion in global sales in the second quarter alone, while Zepbound contributed $3.4 billion.\nTotal revenue increased 38% year over year, gross margin rose to 85%, and earnings per share increased 61% to $6.31. These results were driven by significant volume growth in its flagship products. While incretin-based therapies dominate headlines, Lilly’s portfolio is diverse and extensive. In oncology, the company is developing drugs such as Jaypirca and Verzenio. In neuroscience, Kisunla, a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, is gaining traction. Furthermore, Lilly is expanding into next-generation cardiovascular and genetic therapies through acquisitions such as Verve Therapeutics and SiteOne Therapeutics.\nImportantly, Lilly is aggressively reinvesting to ensure its long-term growth prospects. R&D spending increased by 23%, boosting both late-stage trials and early stage research in oncology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular health. Eli Lilly not only reinvests in growth, but it also rewards shareholders along the way. In Q2, the company paid out $1.3 billion in dividends and repurchased $700 million of stock.\nOn Wall Street, Eli Lilly has earned an overall “Strong Buy” rating. Of the 27 analysts who cover the stock, 20 rate it a “Strong Buy,” two a “Moderate Buy,” and five recommend a “Hold.” The average analyst price target of $922.67 suggests a 32% increase from current levels. Furthermore, the Street-high estimate of $1,190 implies that the stock could rally by up to 70% over the next year.\nEli Lilly offers a great combination of explosive short-term growth and durable long-term potential. Its dominance in obesity and diabetes, breakthrough results in oral GLP-1 therapy, expanding oncology and neuroscience portfolio, and disciplined financial strategy all point toward sustained outperformance.\nOn the date of publication, Sushree Mohanty did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Cornell, who has been CEO of Target since August 2014, will slide into the executive chair position for an undetermined period of time. Fiddelke joined Target in 2003 as an intern and rose through the ranks to CFO and then COO.\n\"I've had this conversation with the board for a number of years, and I've been in the role for 11 years. I'm going into my 12th now. I will actually turn 67 early next year, and I think it's time for me to step back, recharge, spend a lot more time with my family, a lot fewer nights in hotels, and be a great supporter of Michael and the team for the rest of my life,\" Cornell told me by video call while sitting next to Fiddelke at the company's Minneapolis headquarters.\nFiddelke added, \"I bleed Target red after 20 years here, and there's nothing more important to me than working with the incredible team that we have to chart the next chapter for Target. I mean, I've seen us in that 20 years at our best. I've seen us not at our best. When we're at our best, we are pretty darn tough to beat.\"\nShares fell 9% in premarket trading after second quarter earnings on Wednesday, which beat estimates but plunged 20.2% from the prior year. Comparable sales fell 1.9%.\n\"The market had anticipated a CEO change, though we believe was hoping for an external CEO given the troubles Target has had driving sales and profits in recent yrs,\" Citi analyst Paul Lejuez said.\nThe Target backstory\nSomewhat lost in the retailer's brutal first quarter results in May was the announcement of a new \"multi-year Enterprise Acceleration Office\" led by Fiddelke.\nFiddelke, who displays the same calm demeanor as Cornell, was tasked with improving operating efficiencies throughout the company, saving billions of dollars and driving faster decision making at the top. His appointment to this key position put him in the lead to succeed Cornell.\nSpeed is of the essence.\nTarget has struggled post-pandemic as shoppers lean into everyday value at Walmart (WMT), especially in food. The company has also dealt with shopper backlash to its Pride Month assortments and then revisions to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.\nTarget has frequently been forced to adjust its guidance lower amid challenging quarterly sales and profits. The retailer badly missed Wall Street estimates for first quarter earnings and slashed its full-year outlook.\n\"While we're not pleased with the results, we're encouraged by the improved performance as we go into the third quarter of the year,\" Cornell told me.\nSome on the Street have told me an outside CEO with fresh eyes would be better for Target. The company wasted no time trying to counter the narrative that Fiddelke wouldn't be a change agent.\nChristine Leahy, lead independent director of Target's board, said in a statement that the board selected Fiddelke after a years-long process that included an \"extensive external search.\"\n\"But what sets him apart is how he combines those strengths with a 'fresh eyes' mindset, challenging the status quo to evolve how the business operates, differentiates, and delivers long-term value,\" Leahy said.\nTarget's stock was down 23% year to date ahead of the news today.\nFiddelke said he will offer up his own candid assessment of the business. Expect an early focus on better store operations, including online order fulfillment, and stronger, more surprising merchandise assortments — a Target hallmark.\n\"One of Brian's favorite phrases is that a pep talk starts with straight talk. I believe that too. And so we need to be focused on what it's going to take to do better,\" Fiddelke said.\nThe veteran retail lion bows out\nIn September 2022, Target scrapped its CEO retirement age of 65. Cornell signed on for three more years, making 2025 the year when a successor could be announced.\n\"One of the things that I spend a lot of time on and have for years is investing in talent development,\" Cornell said. \"It's one of my most important responsibilities is to make sure we're constantly developing talent to lead the company going forward.\"\nCornell has left quite a mark during his tenure.\nHis first official day at Target was on Aug. 12, 2014, after he spent time leading Walmart's Sam's Club division and crafts retailer Michaels.\nAs the first outsider to lead Target as CEO, Cornell came into a retailer that often missed the mark. The company had been taking heat from a data breach that impacted an estimated 40 million debit and credit cards. And prior management's dreadful foray into Canada was hemorrhaging money.\nIn early January 2015, Cornell announced the closure of 133 stores in Canada, less than two years after the company opened its first location in the country. Target incurred a $5.4 billion quarterly loss and laid off 17,000 workers.\nCornell went on to acquire same-day delivery service Shipt, ink deals with Disney (DIS) and Ulta (ULTA) for shops inside its stores, and remodel the chain. The company expanded its private-label offerings, food assortment, and online offerings. It also launched a paid membership program.\nDespite the roller coaster of the past few years, Target's stock is still up 75% since Cornell's first day as CEO.\nNow he can sit back and see if he taught his protégé enough to reawaken the retailer — just as he did more than a decade ago.\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

You can do much better than that with Medtronic(NYSE: MDT), currently yielding 3%, or if you're really income-hungry, Alexandria Real Estate Equities(NYSE: ARE), now at 6.9%.\nHere's why these two high-yield healthcare stocks could be buy-and-hold candidates for your income portfolio right now.\nMedtronic is moving in the right direction\nA $1,000 investment in Medtronic will get you around 10 shares of the medical device giant. It has operations in the cardiovascular, neuroscience, medical-surgical, and diabetes arenas, and is a major player in every niche in which it operates. It also has a long history of success that's highlighted by the company's 48-year streak of annual dividend increases, which puts it just two years away from Dividend King status.\nThat dividend streak is really important because it shows that Medtronic knows how to survive through both good and bad times. Indeed, a company can't create a record like that without having successfully muddled through a few rough patches. The 3% dividend yield is historically high today, which signals that Medtronic is going through another rough patch. What's happening right now, however, isn't unusual.\nMedtronic's business is heavily dependent on research and development. R&D is notoriously lumpy, and recent years haven't been great for new product launches. But new products are starting to get introduced, which should help boost growth.\nMeanwhile, costs have become an issue. It's normal for a large company to experience bloat, and Medtronic is looking to slim down and refocus around its most profitable businesses; the next big move is the spinoff of its diabetes business in 2026. The move is expected to be accretive in the first year, highlighting management's focus on profitability.\nIn other words, Medtronic is doing what it should be doing -- and that is what it has long done as a business. If you have a buy-and-hold mentality, putting $1,000 to work in Medtronic today could be a great long-term investment choice.\nAlexandria is an industry-leading healthcare landlord\nYou can buy around 12 shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities with $1,000. It's a real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on owning medical offices. But that description doesn't do it justice, because those medical offices are highly specialized around medical research. They're vastly different from doctors' offices, given the technology needed to support healthcare research and development.\nAlexandria has long focused on building clusters -- a number of buildings located near each other -- in areas where medical research is a major industry. That helps with costs, and also helped to solidify the REIT as a leading property owner in its chosen niche.\nThat said, Alexandria is in a bit of a transition period right now, as it looks to slim down to its best assets amid a broader slowdown in the medical-office space. A few large move-outs have also hampered results, with occupancy down to roughly 91% at the end of the second quarter of 2025, from about 95% at the end of 2024.\nInvestors are worried, which isn't unreasonable, since adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share fell slightly year over year in the second quarter. Still, the $2.33 per share in adjusted FFO is more than enough to cover the $1.32 per share in quarterly dividends.\nWhile it's true that office space requires more cash investment than many other property types, there is material leeway for adversity for Alexandria. And given that the dividend has been increased annually for 15 straight years, it seems highly likely that the board will look to support the dividend through this weak patch.\nNote, too, that the balance sheet is in very strong shape and the company doesn't have any material near-term debt maturities on the horizon. If you don't mind buying when others are fearful, this REIT looks like an attractive income opportunity.\nThe right time to buy is often the hard time to buy\nIt's easy to buy stocks that everybody loves, but just following the crowd can lead to bad investment choices.

Stop wasting money on overpriced car insurance\nCar insurance is likely taking a big chunk out of your monthly budget, but it could be keeping you safe for less. Insurance companies tend to pile on confusing add-ons and lingo, which leads you to pay more than necessary.\nOfficialCarInsurance.com lets you compare quotes from trusted brands, such as Progressive, Allstate and GEICO to make sure you're getting the best deal.\nYou can switch to a more affordable auto insurance option in 2 minutes by providing some information about yourself and your vehicle and choosing from their tailor-made results.\nNew investing platforms are making it easier than ever to tap into the real estate market.\nFor accredited investors, Homeshares gives access to the $36 trillion U.S. home equity market, which has historically been the exclusive playground of institutional investors.\nWith a minimum investment of $25,000, investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.\n3. Diversify your retirement portfolio with a gold IRA\nGold has long been touted as a safe-haven asset — and it can go a long way toward building your retirement portfolio. The precious yellow metal offers more stable returns than stocks, especially during market volatility and recession.\nOne way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of American Hartford Gold.\nGold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account — combining the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.\nEven better, you can often roll over existing 401(k) or IRA accounts into a gold IRA without tax-related penalties.

You can typically cancel a term life policy without incurring any penalties.\nWith Ethos, you can get term life insurance in 5 minutes, with no medical exams or blood tests.\nWith home values higher than ever, you can make your home work harder for you by making the most of your equity. The average homeowner sits on roughly $311,000 in equity as of the third quarter of 2024, according to CoreLogic.\nWith a home equity loan, you can fund any major expense — home renovations, paying off substantial debt, or even funding investments for your retirement nest egg. Rates on a home equity loan are typically lower than APRs on credit cards and personal loans, making it an appealing option for homeowners with substantial equity.\nUnlock the lowest possible rates in minutes by shopping around. You can compare real loan rates offered by different lenders side-by-side through LendingTree.\nWith a minimum portfolio size of $50,000, this service is best for clients who already have a nest egg built and would like to try to grow their wealth with a variety of different investments.

The country banned cryptocurrency trading and mining in 2021 due to concerns about the stability of the financial system.\nChina has long aspired for the yuan to achieve global currency status, akin to the dollar or euro, reflecting its weight as the world's second-biggest economy. However, its tight capital controls and its trillion-dollar annual trade surpluses have worked against that aim.\nThose restrictions are likely to be a key hurdle to the development of stablecoins as well, market participants have said.\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a constant value. They are usually pegged to a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar and are commonly used by crypto traders to move funds between tokens.\nThe yuan's share as a global payment currency fell to 2.88% in June, its lowest in two years, according to payment platform SWIFT. In contrast, the U.S. dollar commanded a 47.19% market share.\nChina places strong capital controls to manage flows in and out of the border, with a few connect schemes permitting capital to be deployed in some key offshore market such as Hong Kong.\nIn the U.S., President Donald Trump backed stablecoins days after his inauguration in January and is establishing a regulatory framework that helps legitimise dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies.\nTheir underlying blockchain technology enables instant, borderless and round-the-clock transfer of funds at low cost, giving stablecoins the potential to disrupt traditional daily money moves and cross-border payment systems.\nFinancial innovation, specifically stablecoins, is viewed by Beijing as a promising tool for yuan internationalisation amid the growing influence of U.S. dollar-linked cryptocurrencies in global finance, said the sources.\nDetails of the plan are expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks, with Chinese regulators, including the central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), being assigned implementation duties, said the sources.\nThe sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\nThe State Council Information Office (SCIO) and the PBOC did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.\nMainland China stocks advanced on Thursday, driven by gains in fintech and stablecoin-concept shares after the Reuters report, which was published after market close on Wednesday.\nIn Hong Kong, ZhongAn Online was up 11.5%, leading gains in Hong Kong-listed stablecoin concept stocks. Other such stocks also rose, with Bright Smart Securities jumping 9.9% and Guotai Junan International up 8.6%.\nMAJOR SHIFT\nStablecoins backed by the U.S. dollar currently dominate the market, accounting for over 99% of the global stablecoin supply, according to the Bank for International Settlements.\nIn Asia, South Korea has pledged to allow companies to introduce won-based stablecoins and develop the necessary infrastructure, while similar initiatives are underway in Japan.\nBeijing's latest push comes amid mounting geopolitical tensions with Washington, and the growing use of dollar-backed stablecoins by Chinese exporters.\nThe latest plans follow an announcement from a Shanghai regulator last month that it had held a meeting for local government officials to consider strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies.\nIn a recent interview, PBOC advisor Huang Yiping told local media that an offshore yuan stablecoin in Hong Kong is \"a possibility\".\nSeparately, Hong Kong's long-awaited stablecoin ordinance took effect on August 1 and positions the Chinese-controlled territory as one of the first markets globally to regulate fiat-backed stablecoin issuers.\nChina's commercial hub Shanghai is also establishing an international operation centre for the digital yuan.\nAccording to the sources, Hong Kong and Shanghai will be the main cities to fast-track local implementation of the latest plan.\nChina is expected to discuss expanding the use of yuan and possibly stablecoins for cross-border trade and payments with some countries at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit to be held Aug. 31-Sep. 1 in Tianjin, said the sources.\nThe global stablecoin market is currently small at about $247 billion, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. However, Standard Chartered Bank estimates it could grow to $2 trillion by 2028.\n(Reporting by Reuters Staff; Editing by Kim Coghill)","content_hash":"3cc3b1d95c75da7919e83b9d60bd0258","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5590,"method_rank":0}

Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who has also served as Target's CFO, will step into the role on Feb. 1. He will succeed CEO Brian Cornell, 66, who will become executive chair of Target's board of directors. Fiddelke is a 20-year Target veteran.\nThe company's shares fell more than 6% on Wednesday following the results and CEO announcement.\nOn a call with reporters, Fiddelke, 49, described his two decades with the company as \"an asset.\" He said he knows what the big-box retailer can be at its best – and what it must recapture – and isn't waiting until February to make changes.\nHe laid out three priorities: Reestablishing Target's reputation as a retailer with stylish and unique items, providing a more consistent customer experience, and using technology more effectively to operate an efficient business.\nBeyond the CEO announcement, Target topped Wall Street's expectations for sales and earnings during the fiscal second quarter. It reiterated its full-year forecast, which it had cut back in May. Target said it expects a low single-digit percentage decline in sales and adjusted earnings per share, excluding gains from litigation settlements, to be about $7 to $9.\nHere's what Target reported for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 compared with Wall Street's expectations, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $2.05 vs. $2.03 expected\n- Revenue: $25.21 billion vs. $24.93 billion expected\nTarget's annual sales have been roughly stagnant for the past four years, and its inconsistent performance has tested the loyalty of shoppers and shaken the confidence of Wall Street. Store traffic at the big-box retailer has fallen almost every week since late January, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate overall visits to locations. And shares of the company have tumbled about 60% from their all-time high in late 2021.\nRead more\nCustomers and former employees told CNBC that Target has lost some of the unique traits that set it apart from competitors, such as its eye-catching merchandise, well-kept stores and attentive customer service. Higher tariffs have compounded Target's challenges because it imports about half of what it sells.\nIt also faced backlash from shoppers over its Pride collection and its rollback of key diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.\nAnd last week, Ulta Beauty and Target announced they are ending a deal that opened mini beauty shops in nearly a third of Target's stores. The partnership, which also added Ulta's beauty brands to Target's website, will end in August 2026. Target had spoken about the addition of Ulta shops as a traffic driver and a boost to its beauty category.\nFiddelke told reporters that the company is \"always assessing our partnerships.\" He said Target has posted annual sales growth in its beauty category, excluding Ulta Beauty items, every year since 2010, and it's confident that can continue.\nTarget's latest quarter reflected its ongoing struggles. Its net income fell to $935 million, or $2.05 per share, from $1.19 billion, or $2.57 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue declined from $25.45 billion in the prior-year period.\nComparable sales decreased by 1.9% year over year. That metric, also known as same-store sales, includes sales on its website and stores open at least 13 months.\nCustomer transactions dropped 1.3% and the average amount customers spent during those transactions declined 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.\nIts profit margins were pressured by higher markdown rates, cancellation costs for purchase orders and customers buying more merchandise in lower-profit categories like hardlines. Hardlines, a category that includes electronics and toys, tends to have lower margins than other parts of the store like apparel.\nDigital sales were a bright spot, rising 4.3% year over year.\nTarget also posted gains in parts of its business that are outside of retail. Its nonmerchandise sales grew 14.2% compared with the year-ago period, as it drew more revenue from its advertising business Roundel, its membership programs and its third-party marketplace.\nTarget's retail sales trends improved from the first quarter to the second quarter – even though they were still negative, Fiddelke told reporters on a call. He said sales trends in all six of Target's key merchandise categories improved from the previous quarter.\nAs leader of the Enterprise Acceleration Office, a unit Target created in May to accelerate its turnaround, Fiddelke said he's gotten a chance to take a closer look at the business and where it has underperformed. For example, he said, the retailer lost ground with home goods, a category it was known for and one that exploded in popularity during the Covid pandemic. He said Target focused too much on \"core\" items and \"lost some of our fashion and design leadership that's so important in a category like that.\"\nBut, Fiddelke said, it has made some progress, such as by adding Disney and Marvel-themed bedding and decor to Pillowfort, Target's brand for kids' home goods.\n\"Now, we need more of those examples across the category, but they give me a ton of confidence that we're on the right path there,\" Fiddelke said.","content_hash":"5a2b84df9798761397786c560ad0c06c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5555,"method_rank":0}

Per the investment research platform, the screener shows the difference between the current volume and the average volume over the past month, highlighting unusual activity. In practical terms, it may signal how the smart money may be positioning its funds.\nWhile the derivatives market has skyrocketed in popularity since the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s still an opaque arena. That often works in favor of institutional and professional players, who may want to initiate a position without setting off alarm bells in the open market. With options, it’s easier to hide intent as these specialized financial products could be acquired for myriad reasons, including hedged bets and multi-leg transactions.\nStill, when activity is especially heightened, as it was for beverage maker Constellation Brands (STZ) on Friday, it warrants further investigation.\nConstellation is an interesting animal. Currently, STZ stock carries a Strong Sell rating from the Barchart Technical Opinion indicator and for good reason. Since the start of the year, STZ has dropped nearly 24%, making it one of the worst performers among large-capitalization enterprises. Further, the fundamentals aren’t exactly enticing amid the Trump administration’s tariff policies.\nSTZ stock ticked down roughly 1% heading into the weekend. But in the derivatives market, total options volume reached 10,958 contracts, representing a 122.09% lift over the trailing one-month average. Further, call volume of 6,638 contracts outpaced put volume at 4,320 contracts, generating a put\/call ratio of 0.651.\nBarchart’s options flow screener — which focuses exclusively on big block transactions likely placed by institutional investors — showed that net trade sentiment stood $206,900 above parity. With total gross bullish volume at $267,800, the overall sentiment appears to favor the bulls.\nThat may be an encouraging sign but it’s arguably not the most important.\nQuant Signal Points to Possible Upside in STZ Stock\nWhile unusual options activity can provide important color and context, it’s not always a reliable predictor of where the target security may end up. That’s especially the case for STZ stock. The challenge is that overwhelmingly, options flow data showed that the most bullish transaction by dollar volume was for sold puts. In other words, for the credit seller, they could win by STZ moving up or sideways.\nInstead, I prefer to look for quantitative signals under the framework of discrete-event analysis. Essentially, I force epistemological continuity by ensuring that both the input (price action) and output (my opinion) are discrete, bounded objects. To achieve this directive, I need to convert the stock price’s continuous scalar signal into a binary up\/down state.\nIt looks something like this. In the past 10 weeks, the market voted to buy STZ stock three times and sell seven times. During this period, the security incurred a downward trajectory. For brevity, I’m going to call the sequence 3-7-D.\nAt first glance, it might seem odd to compress STZ’s magnitude dynamism into a simple binary code. But with this compression, I now have a falsifiable signal. Using past analogs, I can determine how the market responded to this signal, extracting a potential forward trajectory.\nAs it turns out, in 62.96% of cases when the 3-7-D sequence flashes, the following week’s price action results in upside, with a median return of 1.13%. In science, this probabilistic performance expectation would be called the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis would be the assumption of no mispricing or the chance that a long position in STZ stock will rise on any given week.\nThose odds are 51.16%. Therefore, the 3-7-D provides an incentive for bullish speculators to consider a debit-based options strategy. Further, if the optimists can maintain control of the market for a few more weeks, there appears to be a legitimate path toward $174, maybe even $175 based on psychological factors.\nFormulating an Aggressive Strategy\nBased on the market intelligence above, aggressive speculators may consider the 170\/175 bull call spread expiring Sep. 19. This transaction involves buying the $170 call and simultaneously selling the $175 call, for a net debit paid of $240 (the most that can be lost in the trade). Should STZ stock rise through the short strike price ($175) at expiration, the maximum profit is $260, a payout of over 108%.\nNotably, the breakeven price is $172.40. So, even if STZ stock doesn’t quite reach $175 on Sep. 19, anything above the breakeven point should be a partial win.\nUltimately, much of the trade hinges on the empirical viability of the 3-7-D sequence. Running a one-tailed binomial test reveals a p-value of 0.1503. This indicates that there’s a 15.03% chance that the implications of the sequence could materialize randomly as opposed to intentionally.\nNo, it’s not the strongest metric ever. However, given the stock market’s open and entropic system, there’s a decent chance that we’re dealing with a legitimate signal as opposed to white noise.\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The artificial intelligence (AI) leader more than doubled in 2025 through mid-August, on top of a stunning 340% gain in 2024. That kind of back-to-back performance is almost unheard of, and it's no accident.\nThe company is growing at a blistering pace, landing massive new contracts and rapidly expanding the reach of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). With momentum this strong, it's worth looking at exactly what's driving the surge, what could slow it down, and why the long-term opportunity remains enormous.\nWhat Palantir does\nPalantir made a name for itself in the years after 9\/11, providing advanced data analytics to U.S. intelligence agencies. It built a reputation for solving complex, high-stakes problems, with the government using it to fight terrorism and later track COVID cases. The U.S. federal government remains Palantir's largest customer, but its biggest growth engine is now the commercial sector.\nPalantir's secret sauce is AIP. The solution collects data from a multitude of sources, organizes it into what it calls an \"ontology,\" and connects it to real-world assets and processes. This gives AI models the clean source of data they need to help solve real-world problems.\nPalantir is not building large language models (LLMs), instead it is providing the system that gives organizations the tools to make AI actually work. In essence, AIP is like an AI operating system.\nStrong growth\nPalantir's results speak for themselves. The company has seen its revenue growth accelerate for eight straight quarters.\nIn Q2, its revenue soared 48% year over year to $1 billion. U.S. commercial revenue jumped 93% to $306 million, with customer count up 43% from a year ago. Remaining deal value in that segment more than doubled to $2.79 billion, showing just how quickly adoption is growing. Existing customers are also expanding quickly, with net dollar retention climbing to 128%. (Any number north of 100% means a company saw growth from existing customers, net of any churn.)\nThe government side is equally strong. U.S. government revenue surged 53% to $426 million in Q2, and Palantir landed a 10-year, $10 billion Army contract consolidating 75 agreements into one. International government sales grew 37%.\nRisks\nNo stock is risk-free, and the most obvious risk for Palantir is its valuation. The stock trades at a forward price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of nearly triple digits, and its price-to-earnings (P\/E) multiple is nearing 275. Even if the stock were cut in half, it would still be far from cheap.\nThat means expectations for the stock are sky high, and any slowdown in growth or hiccup in execution could send shares tumbling. International commercial adoption remains a weak spot, with revenue in that segment down slightly last quarter, so the company still has work to do in proving it can scale globally outside its government and U.S. commercial strongholds. And while the company hasn't felt an impact from U.S. government spending cuts, other defense contractors have, so it is still something to at least keep an eye on.\nThe massive opportunity ahead\nDespite those risks, Palantir's opportunity is hard to ignore. AIP appears to be a game-changing platform for Palantir, capable of providing real-world analysis across seemingly any industry. The breadth of use cases for AIP is just incredible; it's being used for everything from monitoring sepsis at hospitals to helping insurance companies with their underwriting to helping companies with their supply chains.\nMany customers are still in the early stages of deployment, which means the opportunity for increased usage and more use cases within these customers is a huge opportunity. The company is also rolling out AI agents that can take even more direct action and handle specific automated tasks, which could further increase the platform's stickiness and impact. And with European commercial markets largely untapped, Palantir has another major growth lever.\nPalantir's stock is pricey, although great companies rarely trade at bargain prices. If it can maintain its AI leadership position and continue expanding its reach, the stock has the potential to be one of the defining AI investments of the next decade.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

She’s also the co-founder of Mayfair Properties, an international firm that buys, sells and manages properties across the world.\nMuch of Kheir’s wealth and money expertise comes from savvy stock investing. “Today, my net worth stands at a substantial figure of around $50 million, a testament to the effectiveness of my investment strategies,” she said. “Prudent investment decisions require a careful consideration of both opportunities and risks. By staying informed and adaptable, investors can navigate the complexities of the market with confidence and precision.”\nKnowing the right stocks to buy at the right time is half the battle. The other half is making sure you don’t hold on to winners for too long until they become losers.\n“True success in investing isn’t solely about what you acquire, but also about what and when you’re willing to sell,” Kheir said. “In light of the current market conditions, I would advise divesting from the following five stocks.”\nHere are some stocks you might want to shake loose from your portfolio to better focus on building wealth and money management, along with how each stock is performing as of Aug. 15, 2025.\nPrincipal Financial Group (PFG)\nStock price: $77.64\nMarket cap: $17.3 billion\nDividend yield: 3.89%\nPrincipal Financial Group is a global insurance corporation that has served people and businesses for more than 140 years.\nIn advising investors to part with the stock, Kheir cites industry professionals like Credit Suisse alum Andrew Kligerman, who she said feels the company faces “fundamental hurdles,” like lower performance fees and higher expenses, while rating the company’s shares as “Underweight.”\n“It’s the equivalent of a ‘Sell’ rating,” Kheir said.\nDefense World reported that giants like Raymond James & Associates and Allworth Financial recently downsized their positions in Principal Financial Group.\nFranklin Resources (BEN)\nStock price: $25.33\nMarket cap: $13.15 billion\nDividend yield: 5.05%\nFranklin Resources, better known as Franklin Templeton, is one of the world’s largest investment managers. Based on ratings from multiple Wall Street analysts, Franklin Resources currently holds a consensus rating of “Hold” or “Reduce,” which aligns with Kheir’s assessment of whether or not this stock is worth keeping, or even a buy to begin with.\n“Given stagnant growth prospects and increased competition, investors should consider selling their positions in BEN,” she said.\nClorox (CLX)\nStock price: $122.17\nMarket cap: $14.94 billion\nDividend yield: 4.06%\nClorox is one of the biggest names in consumer and professional products, selling everything from its famous bleach to grilling supplies and cat litter. Yet, despite its brand-name popularity, it has most analysts pointing toward it not being a buy, with a majority suggesting holding altogether.\nKheir doesn’t need any more convincing.\n“Given changing consumer preferences and heightened competition, investors may want to sell their shares in CLX,” she said.\nExpeditors International of Washington (EXPD)\nStock price: $119.86\nMarket cap: $16.2 billion\nDividend yield: 1.28%\nExpeditors International is a global logistics company headquartered in Seattle that deals with air and ocean freight, customs clearance, marine insurance and vendor consolidation. It also has a consensus rating of “Moderate Sell,” which is based on 1 buy rating, 5 hold ratings and 5 sell ratings.\nKheir is turned off not just by the company but by the entire industry’s current prospects, despite a small rally recently.\n“Given the challenges in the transportation and logistics sector, investors should consider divesting from EXPD to explore more promising opportunities,” she said.\nSotera Health (SHC)\nStock price: $15.74\nMarket cap: $4.47 billion\nSotera Health is an integrated global health solutions firm that provides lab testing, sterilization and advisory services in the U.S. and internationally through its three businesses: Sterigenics, Nordion and Nelson Labs.\nThough many analysts generally have a positive view of SHC stock with some sources indicating a “Buy” or even “Strong Buy” consensus rating, it’s important to note that the company’s stock is still down nearly 18% both year to date and over the past year — and Kheir doesn’t see better days on the horizon.\n“There are several reasons to sell this stock, like rising interest rates and an increasingly competitive industry landscape,” she said. “Also, the announcement of offering 25 million secondary shares could dilute the existing shareholder value, especially if the stock price dips.”\nFinal Take To GO: Reaching Your Financial Goals Like a Millionaire\nKheir’s successful real estate company is just one element in her sprawling and diversified portfolio. “My journey to wealth began with a strong foundation in banking, specializing in wealth management and mortgages,” Kheir said. “Leveraging this expertise, I ventured into the realm of investments, where I meticulously built my portfolio across diverse sectors like real estate.”","content_hash":"4232b453802223545f5dc0e09f8fc4ab","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5377,"method_rank":0}

Once a fan of heavy money printing, Asahi Noguchi has also turned more neutral and voted for raising rates in January.\nSuch shifts in the board's policy bias put Ueda and his career central banker-turned deputy Shinichi Uchida in the more dovish camp, as their comments continue to focus on downside risks to Japan's fragile economy.\nTheir caution reflects the BOJ's preference to await more data to gauge whether the global economy, including Japan's, will withstand the hit from U.S. tariffs, say sources familiar with the bank's thinking.\nIt also reflects lingering worries within the BOJ that the damage to exports and capital expenditure will intensify in coming months - as predicted by the bank's economists.\nIn analyses included in the July quarterly outlook, BOJ economists warned company profits are likely to fall this year because of U.S. tariffs, hurting capital expenditure.\nThere is good reason to worry. While Japan's trade deal with the U.S. agreed to cut tariffs for its mainstay auto exports, Washington has not made clear the timing of the reduction.\nMany analysts expect exports, which lifted Japan's second-quarter GDP, to lose momentum later this year as the hit from U.S. tariffs deepens.\nEven hawkish board members warn such risks could warrant caution on rate hikes.\n\"We need to scrutinise whether any negative impact from U.S. tariffs could appear,\" board member Takata said in a speech on July 3.\nDespite the board's hawkish tilt, Ueda's cautious stance may prevail given the influence the governor holds over BOJ decision making.\nWith support from staff of key divisions, the governor prepares proposals on policy and interest rates for a vote by the board. Most have been approved unanimously or by a majority, including the BOJ's exit from a decade-long stimulus last year.\nThe governor's proposal has never been voted down since the current board framework took shape in 1998.\n\"I don't see any tough negotiator in the current board who could stage a revolt. It's hard to imagine the hawks proposing a rate hike against the governor's will,\" said former BOJ official Nobuyasu Atago, who used to be staff for hawkish ex-board member Miyako Suda.\n\"Governor Ueda's leadership within the board appears to be fairly strong.\"\n(Reporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Sam Holmes)","content_hash":"82a13015d2572be49579512a2a5a089f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5350,"method_rank":0}

That’s the crypto treasury blueprint — but some investors don’t seem to like that third step, or even the idea of it.\nRetail traders, who make up much of the investor base in these companies, have begun selling off their shares after crypto accumulators register equity offerings, sending those stocks tumbling from their sky high valuations.\nOn Thursday, 180 Life Sciences Corp., which does business as ETHZilla, saw its shares slide 29% after announcing an agreement to sell as much as $500 million of its stock. Two days earlier, the stock soared 200% in a single day as the biotechnology firm turned Ethereum treasury declared its Ether holdings, worth about $350 million at the time.\nOther crypto treasuries have seen a similar fate. SharpLink Gaming Inc.’s stock plunged 72% on June 13, when it filed a statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission allowing a group of investors to sell shares. In July, BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. dropped 40% after filing to sell up to $2 billion in securities.\nMany retail investors see these actions as a signal to sell. They’re taking profits on fears of dilution and expecting that the shares being offered in the filings will all be sold, which isn’t a guarantee. They also worry that the stocks may be overpriced, with valuations sometimes at a multiple of a company’s crypto assets. It’s a challenge for the gaggle of firms getting into the business of buying and holding digital tokens, trying to mimic the success of Michael Saylor’s Strategy, a Bitcoin behemoth.\nWhen crypto treasuries register shares, some holders fear a flood of sales soon after, Lowenstein Sandler LLP partner Daniel Forman said in an interview.\n“In many cases, that’s not the case, and an investor couldn’t even sell at that point in time because there isn’t an effective registration statement,” Forman said.\nSharpLink Chairman Joe Lubin — also a co-founder of Ethereum — tried to assuage investors’ worries when the company’s shares fell after a filing in June. The company holds more than $3 billion in Ether, and has a market cap of about $3.5 billion.\n“This is standard post-PIPE procedure in tradfi, not an indication of actual sales,” he wrote in an evening post on X. “Neither Consensys nor I have sold any shares,” he added, referring to a major investor. Still, shares lost more than two-thirds of their value the next day, and haven’t fully recovered since.\nAt ETHZilla, Chairman McAndrew Rudisill is taking the recent losses in stride. He sees them as a normalization of the company’s valuation compared to the value of its Ether holdings after the shares skyrocketed.\n“It’s probably a sweet spot of normalization between like two and three times market net asset value, and we’re in that band now, so it kind of makes sense,” Rudisill said in an interview.\nEven with the sharp drops, the crypto treasury strategy has paid off for a number of firms. ETHZilla is up 136% since revealing its plan at the end of July. SharpLink, which used to focus on sports betting technology, is up about 210% since its pivot in late May.\nRetail Jitters\nRetail trader Reza Ibrahim said he has invested in several crypto treasury companies, but sees the top coming soon. He already sold his position in SharpLink after making a 150% return on his investment, and plans to fully exit the sector by the fourth quarter of this year, when he expects cryptocurrency prices to decline.\n“It’s due for a major correction,” Ibrahim, 26, said in an interview.\nJuan Plasencia, a 56-year-old retail investor, says he sold half of his SharpLink position to take a profit, and held onto the rest because of its lower valuation compared to other crypto accumulators. But he says he sold all his BitMine shares after the company filed to offer up to 80.2 million shares in July. He didn’t expect that private investors would keep holding onto the stock at its high valuation. Even after sharp declines, BitMine’s market cap is almost $10 billion, about a 45% premium over its crypto pile.\n“Whenever their lockout period ends is when they start selling,” he said in an interview. Their “value is secured.”\nPlasencia knows that a company may not actually sell all of the shares listed in a filing, but the uncertainty gives him pause.\n“The hard part is knowing how much cash has been raised and shares issued,” he said. “So I always assume 100% of approved equity sale.”\nSome investors make their decisions to sell based on discussions on X or Reddit, but Forman at Lowenstein Sandler said these filings are more nuanced than a headline, especially if small-time investors don’t really understand these types of deals.\n“It’s just, I think, a new segment of the population is looking at them and kind of becoming familiar with how this works,” Forman said about the filings.\nWith the sector getting more crowded, it isn’t surprising to see investors sell, said Gregory Sichenzia, a founding partner at Sichenzia Ross Ference Carmel.\n“90% of these companies will not survive. The bubble will burst, the stock will crash, their access to capital will dry up, and there’ll be a few left that really did execute.”\n(Corrects name of law firm in the penultimate paragraph.)","content_hash":"4c957f5ed88cf1cb428e06b64dcee372","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5346,"method_rank":0}

In a recent Bloomberg Television interview, Mallers revealed a fundamentally different approach to measuring corporate performance that could reshape how Bitcoin-native companies think about shareholder value.\nThe ‘Bitcoin Per Share’ Revolution\nWhile traditional companies obsess over earnings per share, Twenty One has introduced what Mallers calls “Bitcoin per share” as their primary performance metric. The reasoning is both simple and profound: measuring success in dollars is meaningless when fiat currencies are constantly debased.\n“Everything goes up in dollar terms,” Mallers told Bloomberg. “The objective is for shareholders to get wealthier in Bitcoin terms by growing the Bitcoin per share.”\nThis isn’t just accounting innovation—it’s a philosophical shift that treats Bitcoin as the ultimate unit of account. Twenty One expects to complete its public listing in the third quarter following Securities and Exchange Commission review, with over $5 billion in Bitcoin at launch, giving investors direct exposure to this new performance framework.\nMallers’ confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory stems from what he calls “definitive scarcity.” Unlike traditional commodities where increased demand can stimulate additional supply, Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million coin limit means new buyers must compete for existing holdings.\n“If you want more bitcoin, you don’t go to the bitcoin factory. You have to go up in price,” Mallers told Bloomberg, predicting Bitcoin could reach $150,000 as institutional and sovereign buyers compete for limited supply.\nThis supply constraint is already creating upward pressure. MicroStrategy holds the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, while MARA ranks second with over 46,000 BTC. Twenty One’s goal to surpass both reflects Mallers’ belief that corporate adoption is still in its infancy.\nBeyond Treasury: The Dual Strategy\nTwenty One isn’t just another Bitcoin treasury play. With backing from heavyweights including Tether and SoftBank on its board, the company plans to build Bitcoin products, technology, and tools—essentially competing with both treasury companies like MicroStrategy and product-focused firms like Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN).\n“Why not both?” appears to be Mallers’ philosophy. His track record supports this ambition: Strike, his previous company, became a major Bitcoin financial services platform, and his involvement with El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption demonstrated his ability to execute complex, high-stakes initiatives.\nPerhaps most telling is Twenty One’s unwavering focus on Bitcoin exclusively. Mallers embraces the “Bitcoin maximalist” label, viewing other cryptocurrencies as inferior alternatives to what he calls “pristine money.”\nHis rationale centers on Bitcoin’s role as a store of value in a world where traditional assets are constantly diluted. “I’ve created value and I want to keep it,” he summarizes as Bitcoin’s core use case. “Bitcoin allows you to abstract your effort, time, and energy, and take it with you tomorrow,” he told Bloomberg.\nThis single-asset focus contrasts sharply with diversified crypto strategies, but it also provides clarity of purpose that resonates with institutional investors seeking pure-play Bitcoin exposure.\nMarket Implications\nTwenty One’s approach could accelerate corporate Bitcoin adoption by providing a clearer framework for measuring success. With an unrealized gain of over $1.3 billion already accumulated, the company serves as a real-time case study in Bitcoin treasury management.\nFor investors, Twenty One represents a new category: Bitcoin-native companies that measure success in Bitcoin terms rather than fiat. This could appeal to those who believe traditional accounting methods undervalue Bitcoin-holding companies.\nThe broader market implications are significant. As more companies adopt Bitcoin treasuries and measure performance in Bitcoin per share, it could create additional demand pressure on Bitcoin’s fixed supply—potentially validating Mallers’ bullish price predictions.\nTwenty One’s public debut will test whether investors are ready for this new paradigm. If successful, it could mark the beginning of a fundamental shift in how we measure corporate value in an increasingly Bitcoin-denominated world.","content_hash":"d7ac8626e8640e6ddb156a1305a82c81","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5302,"method_rank":0}

She doesn’t like any of the facilities you've toured that accept those on Medicaid.\nHow can you best keep your mom comfortable for the final years of her life?\nAccessing lost savings\nWhile her finances may ultimately dictate what kind of facility she moves into, it’s worth making an effort to respect her wishes by seeing whether she can afford a nicer place.\nConsider a thorough search for long-forgotten assets. Even if you’re mostly certain that your mom doesn’t have substantial savings, it’s worth trying to find out if she has any inactive financial accounts. According to a 2023 report by financial firm Capitalize, nearly 30 million 401(k) accounts worth $1.65 trillion were left behind by American workers who may have forgotten about them during job moves.\nYou can search for these types of accounts using the U.S. Department of Labor’s Lost and Found Database. If she suffers from cognitive impairment, accessing these funds could be tricky and require you to obtain legal authority, such as through guardianship.\nPaying for assisted living with no savings\nIf a lavish facility is off the table after searching for lost funds, the focus should become your mother’s safety and ensuring her daily needs are met.\nMedicaid generally does not cover room and board costs at an assisted living facility. However, many assisted and independent living facilities accept Medicaid Home and Community-Based Service Waivers that can cover some costs. Nonprofit or church-affiliated facilities may offer support as well.\nYou might also decide to bite the bullet and chip in to pay for a private facility. The median cost of an assisted living facility is nearly $6,100 a month, according to SeniorLiving.org. Prices can vary based on location, level of care, and length of stay.\nThis is where long-term care insurance could really come in handy. This type of insurance often offers coverage for the costs of in-home assistance, nursing homes or assisted living facilities.\nGoldenCare offers different long-term care insurance based on your loved one’s needs, including hybrid life, annuity with long-term care benefits, short-term care, extended care, home health care, assisted living and traditional long-term care insurance.\nMoving parents out of their home and into a facility will always be challenging, but these are conversations families can have ahead of time to make the transition a bit easier.\nIf your parents are late in their careers or at retirement age, and they have some retirement assets, it’s worth asking if they’ve considered future care costs.\nYou may find one day you need access to your parents’ retirement accounts. Discuss getting power of attorney while your parent is still capable of granting it. They can’t sign a POA if they are incapacitated or a judge rules them mentally unfit, which could force you to pursue guardianship or conservatorship through the courts to gain authority over their financial affairs, including retirement accounts.\nBuilding a cushion for retirement\nAs for you, the caregiver, you can do your best to be equipped for your own retirement and health care costs down the line. Consider investing as a means to build long-term wealth and cushion your financial future.\nWith platforms like Acorns, every purchase on your debit or credit card is automatically rounded up to the nearest dollar, with the excess placed into a smart investment portfolio. This way, even the most essential spending translates to money saved for the future, by investing in low-cost ETFs.\nThe best part? You can get a $20 bonus investment when signing up with a recurring contribution.\nAlternative assets, like real estate and gold, can also help you inflation-proof your retirement savings. With a Thor Metals gold IRA, you can benefit from a tax-advantaged investing account. Their gold IRA can help stabilize your finances, allowing you to invest directly in physical precious metals rather than stocks and bonds.\nTo learn more, you can get a free information guide that includes details on how to get up to $20,000 in free metals on qualifying purchases.\nBy opening a Gold IRA, you’re looking out for your future self while bolstering your retirement.\nAs for real estate, commercial real estate can offer higher potential returns than residential real estate thanks to its longer lease terms, higher rental rates, and potential for greater appreciation. But direct access to the $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector has been limited to a select group of elite investors — until now.\nFirst National Realty Partners (FNRP) allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.","content_hash":"ec24e765ed32b8326b5f8d3cdff1781a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5276,"method_rank":0}

(CSCO) delivered strong free cash flow, despite significantly higher capex spending in its fiscal year ending July 31. That could propel CSCO stock at least 14% higher over the next 12 months using its average FCF margins.\nCSCO is at $66.50 in morning trading on Monday, Aug. 18. That's down from its price on Aug. 13 of $70.40 just before the release of its latest results.\nBut it could be worth $75.75 per share using its historical FCF margins and revenue forecasts. Moreover, the average analyst price target is close to this. This article will delve into these points and explore a strategy for playing short out-of-the-money (OTM) puts.\nStrong Results for FY 2025\nCisco is one of the beneficiaries of the huge artificial intelligence (AI) spending boom. It provides networking equipment, cloud software, and security solutions used by data centers and companies involved in AI-related activities.\nAs a result, its Q4 revenue rose 8% year-over-year (Y\/Y) to $14.3 billion, and its fiscal year (ending July 31) sales were up 5% to $56.7 billion.\nHowever, its AI infrastructure division took in over $2 billion in orders in FY 25, higher than its goal of $1 billion. That included over $800 million in orders in Q4 alone.\nThis is a strong growth driver for the company going forward.\nMoreover, Cisco reported that its operating cash flow was very strong and its free cash flow (FCF) - i.e., OCF less capex spending - was also high.\nFor example, in the latest fiscal Q4 ending July 31, the company generated $4.234 billion in OCF, representing 28.9% of its $14.67 billion Q4 revenue. That was +13.5% higher than last year, and the prior OCF margin was lower at 27.3%.\nMoreover, even with +9.5% higher capex spending in Q4, its FCF margins improved as well. For example, Cisco generated $4.017 billion in FCF, which was 27.4% of revenue. That was higher than the 25.89% FCF margin last year. Moreover, it beat the $13.288 FCF for the year was just 23.4% of its full-year revenue of $56.7 billion.\nThis implies that Cisco's FCF margins will rise over the next year with higher sales.\nForecasting FCF\nFor example, analysts are now projecting about $60 billion in sales for the next fiscal year ending July 2026. That is also the upper end of management's guidance for FY 26.\nAs a result, if we assume the company can generate at least 25% FCF margins (higher than the 23.4% in FY 25, but lower than the 27.4% Q4 margin), its FCF could be:\n$60b x 0.25 FCF margin= $15 billion FCF target\nThat would be an increase of 12.9% over last year's $13.288 billion in FCF. Moreover, it could push up the value of CSCO stock at least that amount.\nTarget Prices for CSCO Stock\nLast year, the company paid out $12.4 billion in dividends and buybacks to shareholders. That represented 93.3% of its $13.3 billion in FCF.\nAs CSCO's market cap is $262.726 billion today, according to Yahoo! Finance, that means its historical FCF yield is about 5%:\nSo, using a similar 5.0% FCF yield and applying this to our forecast of $15 billion:\n$15b FY 26 FCF \/ 0.05 = $300 billion market cap\nIn other words, if the market gives the stock a 5% FCF yield in the future, and if Cisco generates $15 billion in FCF, its market cap will rise 14.2% to $300 billion.\nThat means its stock price will be worth 14% more, or\n$1.14 x $66.50 = $75.81 per share target price\nThis is about the same as the average of 26 analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance ($75.58 per share). Similarly, Barchart's mean survey price is $75.06, and Stock Analysis says 18 analysts have an average price target of $74.94.\nMoreover, AnaChart.com, which tracks recent analyst recommendations, writes that 21 analysts have an average of $77.17 per share as their price targets.\nThe bottom line is that CSCO stock looks undervalued here. One way to play this, setting a lower buy-in price, is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in nearby expiry periods.\nShorting OTM Puts\nFor example, look at the Sept. 19 expiry period, one month away. It shows that the $64.00 strike price put option contract has a midpoint premium of 62 cents.\nThat represents an immediate short-put yield of about 1% (i.e., $0.62\/$64.00 = 0.96875%) for a strike price that is about 3.5% below today's trading price.\nThe point is that an investor who does this play can set a potential lower buy-in point and get paid while waiting.\nMoreover, even if CSCO falls to $64.00, the investor's breakeven point is $63.38 per share ($64-$0.62), which is 4.7% below today's price. So, the investor potentially gets to buy in at a significantly lower price using this play.\nHowever, it could still result in an unrealized capital loss, if CSCO stays below the $63.38 breakeven. Investors should study the risks here. One way to do that is to research Barchart's Options Education Center and the Profit and Loss charts on any options contract.\nThe bottom line is that CSCO stock is cheap here, and OTM selling short OTM puts is one way to play short puts.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

Kohl ","description":"Best Stock to Buy Right Now : Target vs . Kohl ","published_at":"2025-08-20T13:15:00.000Z","source_id":"gdelt_finance_yahoo_com","source_name":"finance.yahoo.com via GDELT","crawl_method":"gdelt","language":"en","paywall":false,"text":"At first glance, retailers Target(NYSE: TGT) and Kohl's(NYSE: KSS) have a lot in common.\nThe store chains compete head-to-head in many areas, from pet toys and rugs to T-shirts and jeans. Target's beauty department is a store-in-store partnership with Ulta Beauty(NASDAQ: ULTA), and Kohl's has a similar setup with Sephora. They are profitable dividend payers with decades of experience.\nAnd the companies share some painful qualities, too -- both stocks have underperformed the broader market in recent years. I'm looking at two active turnaround efforts.\nBut there are significant differences, too. Let's see how Kohl's and Target differ, and which would be the better buy in August 2025. Spoiler alert: Target looks like the steadier winner, while Kohl's is the higher-upside turnaround bet if you can stomach the risk.\nComparing Kohl's and Target by the numbers\nWhether you measure them by revenue or market capitalization, Target has always been bigger than Kohl's. It's not a close race, either:\nI could go on with profitability metrics showing the same lopsided balance, but you get the point already: If you want the bigger company, Target is the only choice on the table.\nNow, Kohl's doesn't lose every comparison against its larger retail rival. Its gross profit margins are significantly wider. But that advantage doesn't translate into sustained benefits further down Kohl's financial statements. Target takes the lead at the operating margin level, and its bottom-line net profit margin of 4% runs circles around the department store's 0.8% figure.\nAnd Target shows an even stronger advantage in metrics connected to operating efficiency. Target's return on equity is 29.1% versus Kohl's 3.2%, for example.\nThe two turnaround themes\nKohl's isn't sitting on its cramped hands, of course. The company is running in full turnaround mode under an interim management team. It's reshuffling its private label portfolio, optimizing its overall product lineup, and simplifying the customer experience.\nIn-house brands are an important part of this effort, including the exclusive Sephora partnership. Kohl's is also remodeling its stores to offer a more intuitive layout. Specifically, the accessories and juniors departments are moving closer to the Sephora shops, as the company has found lots of cross-shopping between these categories.\nTarget's turnaround plan is built around the company's reputation as a more pleasant place to shop for everyday essentials. Management is leaning into the whimsical \"Tar-zhay\" branding that suggests some kind of higher-end, slightly European quality. It's a pretty simple strategy, actually.\n\"We know that when we deliver the Tar-zhay magic, the consumer responds,\" CEO Brian Cornell said in May's first-quarter 2026 earnings call. \"And the common theme is, when we deliver newness at a great value, we see strong performance.\"\nSo the company is rolling out thousands of new items across a range of store brands. Target's focus isn't on bargain-bin pricing, but on a healthy balance between low cost and high quality. I would compare Target's strategy with the extremely successful Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) model, where the quality-obsessed Kirkland brand does a lot of heavy financial lifting. If you're ripping pages out of someone else's playbook, you might as well steal them from a world-class competitor.\nTarget is the easy choice, unless you love risky bets\nThat brings me back to that all-important question: Should you buy Target or Kohl's stock these days?\nAs noted, I can imagine different investors making different choices here. Kohl's stock is down by 58% in the last three years, and it trades at just 0.1 times trailing sales. The business is a mess, but there could be a fantastic upside if Kohl's can get back on a more profitable track. It's a high-risk, high-reward option.\nBut most people should take a second look at Target instead. The \"Tar-zhay\" tactics are already working, and this is a more robust store chain to begin with. Kohl's turnaround may be a make-or-break affair, but Target is just fine-tuning a business model that already works. That's a safer option, and Target's price-to-sales ratio of 0.5 still leaves plenty of room for robust investment returns.\nShould you buy stock in Target right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Target, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Target wasn’t one of them.

Ireland’s government debt remains on a downward trajectory\nStrong Public Finances, Robust Economic Growth Underpin Scope’s Rating\nIreland’s wealthy economy and robust fiscal position, supported by exceptionally strong corporate income tax receipts, anchor Scope’s AA rating for Ireland with Stable Outlook.\nCorporate tax revenue reached EUR 39.1bn (36% of Exchequer revenue) in 2024, up from EUR 29.3bn in 2023, bolstered by a one-off EUR 14bn payment by Apple to the government following a court ruling. Corporate tax is expected to remain substantial at EUR 29.3bn in 2025 (28% of revenue) and EUR 28.1 bn in 2026 (27%), tariffs notwithstanding.\nScope expects the general government budget to remain in surplus, running this year at around 2.6% of GNI* (a measure of the size of the Irish economy excluding distortions related to the activities of MNEs) and around 2.3% on average between 2026-30. Notably, without excess corporate tax revenues, the general government budget would be in deficit by around 1% to 2% of GNI*.\nWhile dependence on MNEs remains a key economic vulnerability – just 10 companies pay 57% of all corporation taxes and just three account for 40% – robust corporate-tax income and economic growth underpin the favourable trajectory of government debt.\nGeneral government debt-to-GNI* is likely to decline to 63% in 2025 and to less than 50% by 2030 from 68% in 2024, with government debt-to-GDP falling to 30% from around 40% over the period (Figure 1).\nGrowing Strategic Reserves to Help Ireland Meet Welfare and Infrastructure Challenges\nThe government’s strategic approach to windfall revenues strengthens the fiscal outlook through the two sovereign funds established in 2024. Although transfers only account for a relatively modest portion of windfall corporate tax receipts, sovereign funds provide a buffer for addressing the pressing structural challenges facing the economy.\nAssuming the government transfers around 0.8% of GDP a year to the Future Ireland Fund through 2040, the Fund could grow to around EUR 100bn, allowing future governments to draw down investment returns from 2041 onwards to tackle the health and welfare costs associated with an ageing population.\nThe government is also accumulating resources for the modernisation of infrastructure and to address climate change with EUR 2bn of annual flows to the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund from 2025-2030.\nScope’s assessment of Ireland’s favourable refinancing profile further supports the fiscal outlook, with less than 40% of outstanding Treasury debt maturing within five years and a weighted average Treasury debt maturity exceeding 10 years. The National Treasury Management Agency’s cash balance of EUR 30bn (around 5% of GDP) provides further substantial financing flexibility.\nSupply-side Constraints, Public Investment Needs Are Challenges\nEliminating supply-side bottlenecks remains a significant policy challenge, with the economy operating at capacity while facing labour and skills shortages.\nThe government’s updated National Development Plan includes EUR 102.4bn in capital investments between 2026 and 2030, with overall investments of EUR 275.4bn by 2035, but execution risks remain elevated given the tight labour market and lengthy processes.\nAddressing these supply-side constraints through labour-market reforms will be crucial for the economy to absorb the ambitious infrastructure spending on housing, water, energy and transport.\nOver time, implementation of the National Development Plan could enhance the growth model and support competitiveness, while mitigating the economy’s exposures to global shocks as a small, open and financially inter-connected economy.\nFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\nThomas Gillet is a Director in Sovereign and Public Sector ratings at Scope Ratings.

It said on Wednesday that it has struck a deal to acquire Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of drywall, insulation and other interior building products for large residential and commercial professionals, for about $8.8 billion.\nHome improvement demand has been weaker as higher borrowing costs and mortgage rates keep some homeowners and potential homebuyers on the sidelines. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Marvin Ellison said the company's sales improved as the quarter went on and saw a particular pop in July.\nBut he attributed that to better weather and said \"it's too early for us to call that a trend.\" He said he anticipates activity will pick up when mortgage rates fall below 6%. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is slightly above 6.5%, according to Freddie Mac, compared with the below-3% levels around the beginning of the Covid pandemic.\nTo overcome that slower backdrop, Lowe's has looked to home professionals — a steadier and more lucrative customer — to drive sales. It has made two pro-focused acquisitions in recent months: Artisan Design Group, a company that provides design services and installation of flooring, cabinets and countertops for homebuilders and property managers, and Foundation Building Materials, which it announced on Wednesday.\n\"We believe this is where the inflection and the growth is coming when housing finally unlocks, and we want to be positioned for it. And we think this acquisition helps us to do that,\" Ellison said.\nHere's what the company reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $4.33 adjusted vs. $4.24 expected\n- Revenue: $23.96 billion vs. $23.96 billion expected\nIn the fiscal second quarter, Ellison said the home improvement retailer saw \"solid performance\" in both the do-it-yourself and the home professional sides of its business.\nIn the three-month period that ended Aug. 1, Lowe's net income rose to $2.4 billion, or $4.27 per share, from $2.38 billion, or $4.17 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased from $23.59 billion in the year-ago quarter. Adjusting for one-time items, including depreciation of some assets, Lowe's reported earnings of $4.33 per share.\nComparable sales rose 1.1% in the quarter. Sales trends improved with each month, with comparable sales down 1% in May, up 0.3% in June and up 4.7% July, CFO Brandon Sink said on the company's earnings call.\nHowever, Sink said Lowe's strategy to grow online sales and pro sales, rather than a better home improvement backdrop, will move the needle this year.\n\"Our expectations for a roughly flat home improvement market and the performance of our core business remain unchanged,\" he said.\nLowe's revised its full-year outlook to reflect the acquisition of Artisan Design Group.\nFor the full year, Lowe's said it expects total sales of $84.5 billion to $85.5 billion, an increase from its previous range of $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion. It reiterated its comparable sales, a metric that takes out one-time factors like store openings or closures, saying they will be flat to up 1% from the prior year. It expects earnings per share for the year of approximately $12.10 to $12.35, down slightly from its prior range of $12.15 to $12.40.\nOnline sales grew 7.5% during the quarter, as Lowe's added more features to its website and gained traction with its customer loyalty program, MyLowe's Rewards, Ellison said on the earnings call.\nHe said it has reached out to shoppers in new ways, too. It's trying to capitalize on marketing deals with soccer star Lionel Messi and the NFL. It launched a creator network with social media influencers, including YouTuber MrBeast, to reach more Gen Z and millennial customers through social media.\nOn the pro side, he said, Lowe's acquisitions will allow it to carry a wider range of products and cater to home professionals who are tackling more complex projects.\nLike other retailers, Lowe's faces higher costs from tariffs. About 60% of its goods are sourced from the U.S., and the company is trying to diversify its imports so it doesn't rely too heavily on a single other country, Ellison said.\nLowe's rival, Home Depot, missed Wall Street's expectations for quarterly sales and earnings on Tuesday, but stood by its full-year forecast for 2.8% growth of total sales.\nHome Depot also has bulked up its pro business with acquisitions. It acquired SRS Distribution, a Texas-based company that sells supplies to professionals in the roofing, pool and landscaping businesses, last year for $18.25 billion. Earlier this summer, it announced it was buying GMS, a building products distributor, for about $4.3 billion.\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated Lowe's revenue for the quarter.","content_hash":"6be0e5b5873a929582ea0c8e9973bef2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":5089,"method_rank":0}

Bessent did not confirm the size of the stake the government would take.\nIntel has fallen behind in an industry it once dominated. Its manufacturing division is bleeding cash, just as its legacy computer chip segment forfeits market share to rivals Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) in the PC space. Intel is also woefully behind AMD and Nvidia (NVDA) in the AI race.\nThe company's market capitalization of $111 billion is less than half of its value in 2021. And CEO Lip-Bu Tan has been forced to lay off 15% of the company's workforce and shelve plans to build plants in Europe.\nBut the troubled chipmaker is the only large-scale US-based leading-edge chip manufacturer, giving it geopolitical significance as the nation looks to reshore semiconductor production.\nIntel's problems, however, may be too big for either SoftBank or the Trump administration to solve on their own.\nIntel in need of direction\nDeutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said news of the US potentially taking a stake in Intel, combined with the SoftBank investment, shows that \"[Tan] is taking bold actions to solidify Intel's financial and strategic positioning during its ongoing difficult transformation process.\" Tan became CEO in March after Intel's board ousted former CEO Pat Gelsinger late last year.\nBut others on Wall Street expressed skepticism that those investments would be enough to save Intel from its decline, which resulted from years of missteps.\nLoop Capital analyst Gary Mobley wrote in a recent note to clients that the support from SoftBank and, potentially, the US government may be \"akin to a lifeline with no secure anchor at the other end,\" because while Intel may be \"finding new buyers of its primary equity capital,\" that may not guarantee it can find customers for its manufacturing business.\nGelsinger established Intel's third-party chip manufacturing business, otherwise known as its Foundry, in 2021 as a means of competing with rival TSMC, which produces chips for companies including Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), AMD, and others.\nBut so far, its Foundry business has been a disappointment, struggling to secure customers. While Intel has said it reached agreements to build chips for Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), the company is still its own largest manufacturing client.\nIntel's plan includes building chips based on newer technologies, including its 18A and upcoming 14A node design processes, part of Gelsinger's plan for five process nodes in four years. But 18A, which was initially supposed to roll out in the first half of 2025, is now slated to debut in 2026.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon was similarly critical of Intel's cash infusion in his own investor note, writing, \"We do not believe that Intel's capability gap has anything to do with money.\"\nRasgon also questioned whether the US taking a stake in Intel would be enough to complete the company's domestic manufacturing expansions.\n\"Intel was originally supposed to get these CHIPS Act funds for free; giving up 10% of the company for them seems worse,\" he wrote in a note to clients. \"And if the goal is to help Intel build substantial US capacity, $10.9B really isn’t enough.\"\nMoor Insights and Strategy founder and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead told Yahoo Finance that while SoftBank's $2 billion investment and the prospect of a potential US stake are good things, the company would require as much as $40 billion to build out its next-generation 14A technology.\nStill, getting the US government involved, at least in the short term, could prove to be a boon for the company.\n\"My short-term answer is that the US government is a kingmaker, and they just made Intel the king, and they are going to wrap policy around that to make Intel foundry successful,\" Moorhead said.\nIf the government sticks with Intel for the long haul, though, Moorhead said it could further complicate the company's development problems, leading to a lack of innovation, inefficiencies, and growing costs.\n\"My hope is that Intel gets back on its feet, it turns itself into a reputable, leading-edge foundry, and the government sells the stake,\" he said.\nLaura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

And let's get it out of the way: PayPal(NASDAQ: PYPL) was not one of the top performers of earnings season. After the company reported its second-quarter results, the stock fell by about 8% the following day.\nDespite the stock performance, much of PayPal's results were strong, and the company beat expectations for both revenue and earnings per share (EPS). However, it's important for investors to keep in mind that PayPal's turnaround is still in its early stages, and there's a lot going on behind the scenes that isn't reflected in the numbers just yet.\nWith that in mind, here's a rundown of how PayPal did in the second quarter, why the stock fell, and what investors should keep an eye on.\nThe key numbers\nAs mentioned, PayPal reported strong results on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue climbed by 5% year over year, and both revenue and earnings handily surpassed analysts' expectations. Total payment volume came in $10 billion higher than projected, and there are now 438 million active accounts.\nHowever, there was a lot that wasn't what investors were looking for, especially when it comes to profitability. One of the biggest areas of concern is maintaining transaction margins, and the growth rate of this metric declined sequentially. Plus, total operating expenses grew and free cash flow declined, missing expectations by a wide margin.\nWhy investors shouldn't focus on these results\nTo be sure, there were some disappointing figures in PayPal's second quarter earnings. But it would be a mistake to put too much emphasis on them.\nPayPal is a business that's in the middle of a turnaround. CEO Alex Chriss and his team spent much of 2024 focusing on efficiency, and it would be fair to call that a success. Now, PayPal is stepping on the gas when it comes to growth, rolling out many new initiatives and planning many more, but these aren't apparent in the numbers just yet.\nThe company's new advertising platform is one example. It was launched in October 2024 but is still rather small. Monetization of Venmo is another big focus, and this one is actually starting to show up in the results. In fact, Venmo payment volume grew 12% year over year in the second quarter, while Venmo revenue grew 20%. That's a good indicator that the typical Venmo user is generating more income for the business.\nThis could just be the beginning. Back in February, Chriss and his team laid out their long-term growth strategy in a 224-slide presentation (link opens a PDF). And just to name some of the highlights:\nPayPal ultimately wants to combine all of its platforms (PayPal, Venmo, Braintree, etc.) into one.\nThe company sees a massive opportunity in offline (in-store) payments. This is a $200 billion market, of which PayPal has less than 1%. Scaling the omnichannel business is a major priority.\nPayPal plans to leverage its more than 500 petabytes of data from more than 430 million active accounts. One way it's doing that is through targeted advertising, but this is just one potential application.\nPayPal aims to utilize AI technology to boost engagement and add value to the platform. For example, AI can choose the credit card with the best rewards from a customer's wallet for a specific purchase.\nThese are just a few examples, and I'd encourage you to look at the full presentation to get a complete picture of management's vision. In all, management believes PayPal can achieve an EPS growth rate in the \"low teens\" by 2027, and accelerate beyond that to a sustainable 20%-plus EPS growth rate in the long term. Given the results of the past few years, this seems like an ambitious goal, but with a current valuation of about 11 times free cash flow, the stock could be a massive win for investors if management can do it.\nShould you buy stock in PayPal right now?\nBefore you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PayPal wasn’t one of them.

But what does \"cool\" mean? And does it differ from country to country?\nMy colleagues Todd Pezzuti, Jinjie Chen and I attempted to answer these questions in a new study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. We asked nearly 6,000 people, ages 17 to 75, across 12 countries to describe what makes someone cool (or uncool).\nEach respondent rated either a person they considered cool or a person they didn't across 15 personality traits: agreeable, conscientious, extroverted, open, calm, adventurous, autonomous, capable, conforming, hedonistic, powerful, secure, traditional, universalistic and warm.\nIn every country, despite cultural and geographic differences, six traits characterized cool people.\n1. Autonomous\nMost people follow the rules and strive to do what is expected. But cool people do things their own way.\nThink Steve Jobs, who ignored industry standards to help create products like the Macintosh, iTunes and the iPhone. All these things changed how people interact with technology, music and each other.\nCool people aren't merely deviants. They break the rules in a way that seems helpful or appropriate, like Robin Hood, who stole from the rich to feed the poor.\n2. Open\nCool people question convention to pursue unusual experiences and ideas. Albert Einstein became one of the most influential and coolest scientists by pioneering a new way to think about how the world works.\nMore recently, Billie Eilish has become one of the most exciting artists of the 21st century by experimenting with musical genres.\n3. Adventurous\nRather than comfort and safety, cool people seek out the new, the risky and the exciting.\nLiterary character Dean Moriarity became a cool icon by restlessly pursuing new people, places and experiences in Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road.\"\nAnd Anthony Bourdain set the standard for culinary cool by trotting the globe to pursue the most interesting dishes and dives.\n4. Hedonistic\nCool people know how to enjoy life, sometimes to a fault. They chase pleasure in the moment with little regard for the future.\nThink of Hunter S. Thompson's characters in \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" and \"The Rum Diaries.\" Or real-life legends like Janis Joplin, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Tupac Shakur, whose fast-living styles became part of their mythos.\n5. Extroverted\nBeing cool means being seen. Cool people may march to their own beat, but they share their ideas, experiences, fashions and styles with others — and increasingly, with the world online.\nThe Fonz from \"Happy Days\" epitomized old-school social charisma. Today, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson exemplifies cool because he connects with athletes, businessmen, musicians, actors and even Disney princesses.\n6. Powerful\nCool people have power and presence. They command attention and influence others, not through force, but by sheer magnetism.\nAnd because they're both extroverted and powerful, they drive change. Beyonce has shaped the direction of music, fashion, feminism and social discourse over the past 20 years, just as Muhammad Ali revolutionized sports and civil rights with his dominance, confidence and conviction.\nChasing coolness\nBeing seen as cool promises admiration and respect. But it requires questioning conventions and taking risks, traits that many people don’t have.\nSome traits, of course, are malleable. For example, anyone can become more extroverted, adventurous and risk-taking through effort and practice. The bigger challenge is that most risks don't work out. But when you discover new possibilities and communicate these discoveries, you'll have a better chance of moving culture forward.\nCaleb Warren is an associate professor at the Robert A. Eckert Endowed Chair in Marketing at the University of Arizona. He thinks about what makes things funny, what makes things cool and what helps people reach their goals. He has been published in academic journals, including the Journal of Marketing, Journal of Consumer Research, Psychological Science, the Journal of Personality & Social Psychology. Caleb teaches undergraduate, masters, MBA, and PhD students how to communicate and understand consumer behavior.\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

The vote to cut rates came via an unexpectedly slim 5-4 majority, with the dissenting policymakers preferring another hold.\nMessaging that the BOE is \"focused on squeezing out any existing or emerging persistent inflationary pressures\" and that Governor Andrew Bailey sees an upside risk to the inflation outlook amid geopolitical uncertainty, reinforced the idea that the central bank is highly wary of cutting too soon.\nThe latest inflation print out Wednesday produced a mixed picture. The headline 3.8% rate was a touch above the 3.7% consensus flagged in a Reuters poll, though in-line with the BOE's own forecast, which sees price rises peaking at 4% in September before easing to 3.6% by the year-end.\nAreas of concern include rising food prices and persistently high inflation in the services sector — attributed by some economists to the government's recent hikes to the minimum wage and tax contributions for employers. However, energy prices applied downward pressure in July.\nNovember cut still on table?\nJames Smith, developed markets economist at ING, noted however, that a big contributor to higher services inflation came from airfares, a volatile seasonal factor that the BOE can \"safely ignore.\"\nSmith said in a Wednesday note that he still saw a November rate cut as \"more likely than not,\" but added that it was \"not a particularly high conviction call right now given the very evident division on the rate-setting committee.\"\n\"Much also hinges on the jobs market, where employment has fallen in eight out of the past nine months, but where the survey data is looking a little less worrisome than it did earlier this year,\" he said.\nCathal Kennedy, senior U.K. economist at RBC Capital Markets, also said a 25-basis-point cut in November was still on the table — but only if inflation remains in-line with BOE forecasts and the labor market continues to ease.\nAt the very least, the July print \"extinguishes hope of a September interest rate cut,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.\n\"While spiralling business costs and food prices may mean that inflation peaks higher than the Bank of England's prediction of 4%, it should start decelerating in the autumn as a weaker economy increasingly bears down on prices,\" Thiru added.\nHigher rate impact\nThe latest updates will be concerning for U.K. borrowers, including homeowners on tracker mortgages or those nearing the end of fixed deals, mortgage firms said Wednesday.\n\"Mortgage rates have stagnated over the past few weeks and there may be some small increases in current rates available off the back of this data,\" said Elliott Culley, director of Switch Mortgage Finance.\nThe government will also be nervous about expectations for tighter financial conditions putting pressure on U.K. borrowing costs. While gilt yields were broadly lower on Wednesday, repricing of the rate outlook in recent weeks took the 30-year gilt yield to its highest level since 1998, while the 10-year yield reached a three-month high.\nOne asset that could benefit from higher-for-longer rates is the British pound. While flat against the U.S. dollar and euro on Wednesday, Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, said sterling should remain \"well supported during the remainder of the year.\"\nThe European Central Bank is widely considered to have finished its own cycle of policy easing, with its key rate now at 2%. Questions meanwhile remain over whether the Federal Reserve will resume rate cuts this year given the murky U.S. inflationary picture. A key update is set to come later Wednesday with the release of meeting minutes.\nHowever, given ING's view that many of July's inflationary pressures will prove transitory, its strategists on Wednesday warned of caution in chasing any post-print rally in sterling.\n— CNBC's Holly Ellyatt contributed to this story.","content_hash":"571b7fe80c86c4fc7b0d33cbf6997de4","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4590,"method_rank":0}

Since the Fire tablet's introduction in 2011, Amazon has used what is known as a \"forked\" version of Android with custom modifications that make it work like a unique operating system.\nAmazon has long sought to undercut hardware rivals with inexpensive tablets and other devices that serve as a doorway to the firm's digital content, like e-books, videos and music. The devices have typically sold at or near manufacturing cost. But the focus on simplicity has held back sales, particularly among consumers who seek higher-performing devices.\nThe multiyear project to switch to Android marks a philosophical change for the online retail giant, which has eschewed third-party operating systems and software in favor of its own. As a result, Amazon has offered its own app store requiring developers to make separate versions of their apps for Fire tablets, limiting the store's variety.\nIf Kittyhawk is successful, Fire tablets could be more desirable for consumers who crave compatibility with other Android devices, the people said. They cautioned that Kittyhawk could be delayed or cancelled over financial or other concerns.\nAmazon declined to comment, saying it does not respond to rumors or speculation.\n\"Consumers have always expressed a concern about not having access to the latest Android versions, not having access to some of their apps because Amazon used their own store,\" said Jitesh Ubrani, a researcher at IT advisory firm IDC. \"It's meant more work for developers in this day and age of largely free apps or services.\"\nUbrani noted that Amazon has nonetheless sold many millions of the tablets. Amazon has forfeited profits on the devices themselves in favor of making money on selling their associated services, like streaming movie rentals. But such inexpensive devices typically come with compromises like lower screen quality or battery life compared with pricier options.\nAmazon is the world's fourth-largest tablet seller, with 8% of the market, just behind Lenovo's 8.2%, according to second-quarter IDC data. Apple and Samsung were the market leaders with 33.1% and 18.7%, respectively.\nPricier tablet\nThe first Amazon Android tablet, slated for next year, will be pricier than current models, the people said. One of them said Amazon had discussed a $400 price tag, nearly double the cost of its current higher-end $230 Fire Max 11 tablet. IPads, by comparison, range from $350 to $1,200. Reuters could not learn additional specifications for the planned Amazon tablet, such as screen size and speaker quality or memory capacity.\nAmazon historically has avoided using software or other products from third parties, preferring to develop the services in-house or, barring that, to acquire a competitor. The Fire Phone smartphone championed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and released in 2014 failed to win over buyers in part because of its reliance on Fire OS, as well as its high price tag. Amazon canceled the device and took a $170 million writedown.\nBut the Seattle retailer has more recently shown a willingness to use rivals' services, particularly through its investment in startup Anthropic, whose Claude artificial intelligence software is the primary underpinning of Amazon's Alexa+ voice assistant and a chatbot used by employees known as Cedric.\nThe new Fire tablet, the people said, will use the open-source version of Android, meaning it does not require direct coordination with Google and can be customized.\nAmazon is planning to roll out some lower-priced tablets with its Linux-based Vega operating system now in some Fire TV devices, some of the people said. The full slate of tablets will eventually be powered by a version of Android, the people said.\nThe Fire project's internal code name of Kittyhawk seems to derive from the North Carolina town near where the Wright brothers conducted the first powered flight in 1903. But it is also the name of a failed flying car startup backed by Google co-founder Larry Page that burned through hundreds of millions in cash. Amazon declined to discuss the meaning behind its Kittyhawk project name.","content_hash":"ecf8d3156484bd608c2d6c08de613b50","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4496,"method_rank":0}

But when asked who the president should pick, Hassett ranked a more distant fourth.\nHassett, the director of the National Economic Council, firmly led the pack when asked who the president will choose from among 11 names currently being considered. He was followed by Fed Governor Christopher Waller and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.\nBut when asked who the president \"should\" pick, Warsh took the No. 1 spot, closely followed by Waller and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman was in fifth after Hassett.\n\"I think that Trump's familiarity with (Hassett) in the job that he did during the pandemic makes him a high candidate for Trump, who appreciates and awards loyalty,\" said Richard Steinberg, senior global market strategist with Focus Partners Wealth.\nWhile maintaining that Hassett is qualified, Allen Sinai of Decision Economics said he's concerned about Fed independence if he gets the job.\n\"The politics of low interest rates for political reasons — a very strong view and push by the Trump administration — is a macro risk if it is seen in markets as a takeover by the administration,\" Sinai said.\nIn the survey, 41% of respondents think the next Fed chair will conduct monetary policy independently of the president and 37% said it would be in coordination; 22% were unsure.\nTrump has campaigned hard for the Fed to cut rates, repeatedly insulting current Chair Jerome Powell, but Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee have so far resisted because of concern over potential inflation from tariffs.\nBowman and Waller both dissented in July in favor of a rate cut.\nSurvey respondents see two rate reductions this year from the Fed --- in September and December --- but also high inflation.\nThe forecast for the consumer price index 12-month inflation rate remains at around 3% this year and 2.9% in 2026, suggesting the Fed will have to deal with above-target inflation for a while. Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe \"substantial\" impacts from tariffs on inflation are yet to come.\n\"The Fed is caught between a rock and two hard places,\" said Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors. \"Political pressure to cut rates and fiscal stimulus coming vs. the ongoing strength in the leading indicators of employment and inflation.\"\nAs a result, Powell may not be as dovish about rate cuts as markets hope in his Jackson Hole, Wyoming, speech. The Fed gathers each August for a symposium at which there are no votes but the chair traditionally delivers a keynote speech that often has indicated what's ahead.\nAlmost 70% of respondents think the Fed chair will be neutral in his comments with 14% believing he will be dovish. Another 14% think he won't even discuss monetary policy or the economic outlook.\n\"Powell's comments at Jackson Hole may be more balanced than the market is currently anticipating as he needs to weigh both downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation,\" said Douglas Gordon, managing director at Russell Investments.\nPowell could discuss the Fed's effort to revisit its long-term strategy, with some expectation he addresses the Fed's controversial average inflation targeting.\nRespondents are divided over how to fix the central bank or whether it needs fixing at all. Just 11% say the Fed process of making monetary policy needs major reforms with 85% saying it needs either modest or little to no reform.\nOn specific issues, a 41% plurality say the Fed should get rid of the dot plot where central bank officials anonymously indicate individual forecasts for the funds rate. But 37% say keep it as is, with another 19% saying it should be kept with individual forecasts linked to the rate outlook.\nWhen it comes to the 2% inflation target, 52% want to retain it but 44% want the Fed to adopt a range from about 1.4% to 2.7%.\nA 44% plurality want to eliminate the Fed's average inflation targeting, while 37% want to keep it.\nIn average inflation targeting, the Fed takes into consideration prior misses in hitting its target, and could tolerate higher inflation for a while to account for inflation having run below target in previous years. Some have said this led the Fed to be more tolerant of inflation during the pandemic and slowed its decision to tighten policy.","content_hash":"210ef97b0a625a0e2ff87de1cb7fc015","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4487,"method_rank":0}

Wall Street was set to open slightly lower today after the S & P 500 closed lower yesterday for the third session in a row. Investors were parsing the latest retail earnings this morning. They were also looking ahead to this afternoon's release of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting — two days before Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addresses the Jackson Hole central bank confab Friday. 2. Shares of TJ Maxx parent TJX Companies are rallying to a new all-time high after second-quarter earnings results beat expectations. Same-store sales were also better than what the Street was expecting. TJX also raised its full-year guide despite tariff headwinds. Consumers want value, and that's what TJX's off-price chains deliver. 3. Target shares tumbled nearly 11% on earnings yet again after the struggling retailer reported another quarter of same-store sales declines and reiterated its full-year outlook. It also announced that Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke will replace longtime CEO Brian Cornell in February. 4. Shares of Lowe's added 3% on the back of better-than-expected quarterly sales and revenue , along with a slight increase to its full-year sales outlook. The home improvement retailer also announced plans to buy drywall and insulation distributor Foundation Building Materials for $8.8 billion. It's a move that mirrors Club name Home Depot's two recent acquisitions to better serve professional customers. 5. McDonald's is cutting the price of combo meals after the fast-food chain was able to convince its franchisees to go along with the plan, The Wall Street Journal reported . It's part of an effort to win back customers who have shied away from the chain in recent years due to rising prices. 6. Club name Amazon's auto sales platform is adding used cars from Hertz , sending shares of the car-rental provider up 10%. Amazon's stock wasn't moving much, unsurprisingly, given that Amazon Autos is a tiny part of the overall company. But with shares of Carvana and Carmax down on the news, investors clearly see the potential for Amazon to grow it. 7. The national average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage ticked up to 6.68% from last week's 6.67%, and home loan demand stalled. After last week's 23% surge in refinancing applications, refis fell 3% this week. Purchase apps rose 0.1% after last week's 1% increase, according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association . 8. The FDA approved the first-ever glucose monitoring system specifically for weight loss. The startup Signos makes the system, which uses AI and an off-the-shelf continuous glucose monitor from Dexcom . It can be used as another tool by people taking the GLP-1 drugs from Club name Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk . But, anyone who wants to lose weight can use the system to help them on their journey. 9. Club name Honeywell is buying a trio of utility software programs from SparkMeter. While these are small deals for Honeywell, the strategic rationale is about enhancing its exposure to growing electricity demand, thanks largely to AI computing. 10. Microsoft will be \"an important partner for years to come,\" OpenAI finance chief Sarah Friar said this morning on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" With questions about what OpenAI's push for independence could mean for Club stock Microsoft, Friar's comments are notable. Their evolving and reportedly tense relationship is one of the biggest stories in tech and AI .

However, the rally for shares of certain names in the space has cooled dramatically in August. A catalyst awaits in the form of the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole economic symposium this week: Depending on the central bank's messaging, some of these stocks could resume their upward trajectory if the market's appetite for risk returns. CNBC took a look at the winners and losers from this sector this month, as well as since they adopted their crypto accumulation strategy. We also analyzed what sets the biggest gainers apart from the rest and what potential investors should consider from this group. The data below is current as of Aug. 19. To be sure, the short-term comparison is deceptive because each of the companies announced their crypto treasury focus at different points on the calendar. Ethzilla , for example, did so most recently on July 29, and the initial rush into the stock carried into the beginning of August. The shares have the highest month-to-date return of the group at about 114%. Ether -focused BitMine Immersion Technologies has the second biggest gain this month so far, followed by Solana holding company DeFi Development Corp . Here's how the other names have fared: Support from notable backers Companies with high-profile backers like Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee and tech billionaire Peter Thiel are holding up better. Lee became the chairman of BitMine Immersion in late June, shortly before Thiel disclosed a 9% stake in the company . Thiel later bought a 7.5% stake in Ethzilla, formerly a biotech company called 180 Life Sciences. \"Large names extend their reputation to the vehicle and instill confidence that the backers of these assets — alongside executives and board members with legal ties — will operate them as real businesses, growing revenue while managing risks,\" said Michael Bucella, co-founder and managing partner at Neoclassic Capital. \"That investor confidence creates momentum and market depth, which fuels volume and options activity,\" he added. \"This in turn enables these companies to establish sizable ATM programs, raising large sums of capital to acquire more of the asset and gain greater prominence in its ecosystem.\" Steve Kurz, global head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, which has backed big deals like SharpLink Gaming and ReserveOne (which is expected to begin trading at the end of the year), emphasized the importance of quality management teams not just when picking stocks but also when assessing how long the sector's momentum can last. \"Those that raise more capital with the right partners, with the right business model, with the right management teams have a much better shot of achieving some escape velocity with their ultimate treasury management companies, which also can become ecosystem companies that are bigger than just the immediate launch moment,\" he said. The ether connection Companies focused on ether versus other cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin — have fared better overall. That's due to the successful initial public offering of stablecoin issuer Circle , the passage of the stablecoin regulatory framework known as the GENIUS Act, and the subsequent explosion of institutional interest in stablecoins – most of which run on the Ethereum network. Strategy , which famously pioneered the original bitcoin treasury strategy in 2020, is down about 16% this month. A little-known Canadian vape company called CEA Industries saw shares surge about 550% on July 28 after it joined the Strategy copycat club, with a focus on accumulating Binance Coin . It's down 28% this month. Solana-focused DeFi Development is seeing more success, however. It's up about 2,600% since its April 7 accumulation announcement – nearly as much as Strategy's return since its June 2020 pivot. For the month, it's still up 8%. Bit Digital is now an ether accumulator, having exited bitcoin mining in June to focus on its ether treasury and staking plans. However, it has seen less success with shares up 11% since the company's announcement and a 6.5% decline this month. —CNBC's Chris Hayes and Tom Rotunno contributed reporting.","content_hash":"8099efbc5c70155e71add323fd80a20d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4302,"method_rank":0}

In our view, these factors will drive gold prices even higher,” said Gordon and his team.\nThey say a combination of sticky U.S. inflation — fallout from tariffs and immigration crackdowns have yet to be felt — and below-trend growth will push down real U.S. yields, which will cut that opportunity cost of holding gold.\nHeaded into 2026, investment demand for gold will be supported by those de-dollarization trends, Fed independence questions and concerns about sustainability of the U.S.’s fiscal position, with midterms looming after September, said the UBS team. They noted that recent World Gold Council data indicated the strongest inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the first half of the year since 2010.\nThe UBS team also lifted their full-year ETF demand forecast to nearly 600 metric tons, from 450, noting that current holdings are still under prior highs. Central bank purchases are also expected to remain strong, though slightly under near-record buying last year.\n“We therefore now forecast global gold demand to increase by 3% to 4,760 [metric tons] in 2025, which would mark the highest level since 2011. The key risk for gold is if the Fed is forced to raise rates,” said Gordon and his team.\nAfter climbing at the start of the year, gold prices entered a summer lull, though did manage to log a new $3,439.20 high on July 22. Gold’s fan base has been building with DoubleLine’s Jeffrey Gundlach earlier this summer praising the metal as a real asset class, saying it was “no longer for lunatic survivalists and wild speculators.”\nTempering this gold excitement is Callum Thomas, head of research and founder of Topdown Charts, who raised some thoughts on the commodity in a post on Monday. He sees rotation around gold as a bigger theme, with other commodities such as industrial metals set to play catch up to gold’s hefty gains.\nThe markets\nU.S. stocks SPX COMP DJIA have opened mostly lower, Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y are slipping and oil prices CL00 BRN00 are down over 1%.\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but to get it delivered once to your email box.

This increase was likely due to the timing of this year's school holidays,\" he noted in a post on the X social media platform.\n\"The price of petrol and diesel also increased this month, compared with a drop this time last year. Food price inflation continues to climb, with items such as coffee, fresh orange juice, meat and chocolate seeing the biggest rises,\" he added.\nU.K. Chancellor Rachel Reeves responded Wednesday that there was more to do to ease the cost of living.\n\"We have taken the decisions needed to stabilise the public finances, and we're a long way from the double-digit inflation we saw under the previous government, but there's more to do,\" she said in emailed comments.\nThe British pound was largely steady against the dollar following the data release, trading at $1.3489.\nServices inflation gained to 5% in July from 4.7% in the previous month. The print is seen as another obstacle in the Bank of England's attempts to tame inflation, analysts say, as service-focused businesses raise prices to cover the costs of rising wages and the recent hike to National Insurance contributions.\nThe higher July reading also diminishes the chance of any further interest rate cut by the Bank of England this year.\n\"I'm annoyed about the services inflation, it's looking sticky, and given the importance of services to the U.K. economy I look at that and think, if the MPC [the central bank's monetary policy committee] is looking at that as well — and I'm sure that they are — the chance of a rate cut in November are vanishingly small,\" James Sproule, chief U.K. economist at Handelsbanken, told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe.\nInflation peak predicted\nThe latest data comes after the Bank of England earlier this month voted by a fine margin to cut interest rates from 4.25% to 4%, as the central bank resumed what it describes as a \"gradual and careful\" approach to monetary easing.\nWhile the BOE was widely expected to trim rates by 25 basis points at the time, traders and economists were keen to see the breakdown of support for the move. In the end, policymakers had to vote twice on the rate cut decision, and a majority of 5-4 opted to cut.\nBOE policy committee members have had to weigh up sticky inflation with a cooling jobs market and lackluster but slightly recovering growth. GDP data out last week showed a surprise 0.3% expansion in the second quarter.\nThe BOE is watching inflation data closely, after forecasting the consumer price index could peak at 4% in September before retreating in the early half of 2026.\nIn Deutsche Bank's estimates, Britain remains \"a sliver away\" from an annual inflation rate of 4%.\n\"We expect price pressures to soften in the fourth quarter of 2025, however, tracking closer to 3.5% y-o-y [year-on-year] by year-end,\" Sanjay Raja, senior economist at the German lender, said in emailed comments Friday.\n\"Moreover, we do expect price pressures to ease further next year. On our models, we have headline CPI slipping to just around 2.75% y-o-y in the second quarter of 2026, before landing closer to 2.25% y-o-y in the fourth quarter of 2026. Bigger picture, we think the road to achieving a 2% landing next year is narrowing. Indeed, we see more upside pressures building around our projections,\" he noted.","content_hash":"c834be751f386a2e181277c6da36c2f7","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":4063,"method_rank":0}

While jobless claims were subdued, a nonfarm payrolls report at the start of August showed the 3-month average at its weakest since 2010 when unemployment was 9%, he adds.\nAwkward. And the problem is this backdrop is occurring while stocks have pushed ever higher, leaving the S&P 500’s SPX trailing earnings per share multiple at 25.5, Emanuel notes. That’s “among the highest since Y2K [the year 2000], and into challenging fall seasonality.”\nSome market participants will have in their minds Powell’s Jackson Hole comments in 2022, when the Fed Chair delivered what Emanuel calls his stern inflation-is-job #1-and-we-are-just-going-to-keep-hiking speech. Stocks did not react well to that.\nThis time, the market may be disappointed by Powell indirectly signaling a 25 basis-point rate cut on September 17, but stressing that 50 basis points is not an option and that any possible October or December cuts will remain data dependent, Emanuel reckons.\n“For a market that was eager to embrace ‘50 in Sept’, a balanced view could catalyze a near term -7% to -15% pullback into October, within the context of the structural AI-driven bull market,” he says.\nThis fall fall, as Emanuel calls it, may track typically soft seasonal characteristics for equities.\nPlays to make under this scenario include buying October downside put options on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series I QQQ, which replicates the Nasdaq 100, says Emanuel. Puts give the buyer the right to sell an asset at a certain price by a certain date, and are usually made if the trader thinks the underlying asset will fall in price.\nAlso, buy attractive valuation sectors, such as healthcare, and help pay for that by selling high valuation stocks, such as Palantir PLTR, Cleveland-Cliffs CLF and Coinbase COIN.\nMarkets\nU.S. stock-indices SPX DJIA COMP are mixed at the opening bell as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fall.

But as this chart from Jim Bianco of Bianco Research shows, if a country’s budget deficits are growing and inflation is a concern, then easier policy can cause higher long-term rates. “The last 125 basis points of rate cuts by the Bank of England have seen the 10-year Gilt rise 87bps,” says Bianco, who adds that “cutting rates is NOT lower long rates!”\nTop tickers\nHere were the most active stock-market tickers on MarketWatch as of 6 a.m. Eastern.","content_hash":"e8b873d8bc50747c607c817d25ff1264","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3800,"method_rank":0}

Jackson Hole 101\nIt's a good week to be a restaurant or hotel in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Economic policymakers, market participants and government officials are descending on the town for the Kansas City Federal Reserve's annual policy symposium, which kicks off on Thursday. CNBC's coverage of the meeting begins today and will feature live interviews with central bank officials throughout the rest of the week, as well as coverage of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech on Friday morning. Powell's remarks come amid rising speculation about who will succeed the Fed chair when his term ends in May 2026. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that interviews for Powell's successor would start after Labor Day. The Fed on Wednesday will also release minutes from its July policy meeting, which will be closely watched given the dissenting votes from two members of the committee that sets interest rates.\n2. Target's top job\nTarget on Wednesday named Michael Fiddelke as its next CEO, saying its current chief operating officer will succeed Brian Cornell in February. Shares of the retailer were down 10% in premarket trading even though Target also beat expectations on the top and bottom lines for the second quarter. The company posted another sales decline but managed to keep its full-year outlook the same. Meanwhile, shares of Lowe's rose after the home improvement retailer surpassed Wall Street's earnings forecast, though its quarterly revenue was in line with consensus estimates. Lowe's also announced it inked a deal to acquire Foundation Building Materials for about $8.8 billion. Attention now turns to Walmart — the U.S.' largest grocer and private employer — which is expected to report Thursday morning.\n3. Tech's tough day\nTuesday was a rough day for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies and technology stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled nearly 1.5%, with every member of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" index of megacap tech names posting losses. As for crypto, digital currencies like bitcoin and ether pulled back sharply in Tuesday's session, just days after bitcoin touched an intraday all-time high last week. Stock futures were lower Wednesday morning as traders digested more earnings reports. Follow live market updates here.\n4. Pedal to the metal\nThe White House expanded its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum to include additional product categories. The Commerce Department on Tuesday said an additional 407 types of goods now fall under the levies, including everything from car parts, to specialty chemicals, to fire extinguishers. As CNBC's Erin Doherty notes, the move increases both the scope and impact of President Donald Trump's sector-specific tariffs, a key part of the president's trade agenda. S&P Global on Tuesday said it expects tariff-related revenue for the federal government to offset the impact of Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" leading the agency to leave the U.S.' credit rating unchanged.\n5. Robinhood's sports bet\nMake room, fantasy football. Online broker Robinhood announced on Tuesday that it is launching prediction markets for both professional and college football. Through the new feature, users will be able to trade on the outcomes of some popular games, including regular-season NFL matchups and Power Four school contests. As CNBC's Laya Neelakandan reports, it marks the latest effort by the online broker to expand its prediction market offerings and step further into the sports-based wagering space.\n— CNBC's Jeff Cox, Pia Singh, Melissa Repko, Gabrielle Fonrouge, Erin Doherty, Dan Mangan and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.","content_hash":"d0cd80acdfd071133a4fad587355d2b1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3713,"method_rank":0}

Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods said it assumes it can offset higher costs from tariffs.\nTJX now expects full-year fiscal 2026 earnings will be between $4.52 and $4.57 per share, up from its prior guidance between $4.34 and $4.43 per share. The retailer also raised its comparable sales expectations to a 3% increase, versus prior guidance of a 2% to 3% rise. The new guidance assumes the U.S. tariff rates currently in place will remain in effect for the rest of the year.\n\"Customer transactions were up at every division as we saw strong demand at each of our U.S. and international businesses,\" said CEO Ernie Herrman in a news release. \"With our strong second quarter profit results, we are raising our full-year guidance for both pretax profit margin and earnings per share. The third quarter is off to a strong start, and I am very confident in our position as we enter the second half of the year.\"\nTJX shares touched an all-time high Wednesday and were trading about 3% higher.\nHere's how TJX did in its fiscal 2026 second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n- Earnings per share: $1.10 vs. $1.01 expected\n- Revenue: $14.40 billion vs. $14.13 billion expected\nTJX executives had said in May that the second quarter would include a negative impact from tariff costs from orders it had already committed to when additional duties were announced.\nHerrman said on Wednesday's call with analysts that tariffs were a challenge for TJX in the second quarter, but the costs were lower than the company had expected.\nAnalysts have said off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx are better positioned to sidestep major tariff costs in the near term because they purchase excess merchandise from other brands, usually after the items have already been imported into the U.S.\nAnalysts from UBS and Morgan Stanley said in research notes this month that TJX is poised to take market share away from traditional department stores because of that edge.\nHerrman echoed that sentiment on the call, saying that TJX is taking advantage of an industry landscape that has seen store closures and \"less exciting execution across the board\" in retail brick and mortar. He added that TJX's flexible business model in pricing and merchandising is a plus as the company operates in an uncertain economy.\nTJX doesn't set prices on its merchandise through a top-down system, Herrman said. Instead, the retailer's 1,300 buyers set prices on a deal-by-deal and brand-by-brand basis.\n\"We've been navigating in the tariff environment by just staying simple and pure to that model,\" Herrman said.\nOn the merchandising front, Herrman said that TJX customers are aware that they may not see the same items or categories in stock from one shopping trip to another. That diversity of merchandise gives TJX the flexibility to deal with tariffs, he said, because the company can downplay certain categories that face high duties.\nThe company's net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 2 was $1.24 billion, or $1.10 per share, up from $1.1 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier.\nNet sales came in at $14.40 billion, up 7% from $13.47 billion in the year-ago period.\nComparable sales, a key industry indicator that excludes new stores and online sales, grew 4% during the quarter, ahead of Wall Street estimates of 3.2%, according to StreetAccount.\nTJX shares are up over 11% this year as of Tuesday's close.","content_hash":"2938efd5d0dcc7f303d4d955ba0c02e6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3604,"method_rank":0}

Broadcom , Apple , and Amazon were our worst performers on the session. Among the portfolio's best stocks were TJX Companies , which delivered a beat and raise, Palo Alto Networks , and Costco . Honeywell updates : First thing Wednesday morning, Honeywell said it bought three utility platforms from SparkMeter. Financial terms were not provided, suggesting it was a pretty small deal. Still, it makes strategic sense considering that utilities' spending is on the rise to modernize the grid and increase capacity to support growing electricity demands. One of the biggest draws on the grid has been all the energy needed to power modern data centers that run artificial intelligence. We expect this acquisition will nestle under Honeywell Automation. We favor the company making deals to boost growth ahead of becoming an independent company. Automation will be the remaining business in the overall company's upcoming three-way split, which will see Advanced Materials and Aerospace spun off late this year and early 2026, respectively. Towards midday, Bloomberg reported that Honeywell and other investors are considering raising money for Quantinuum at about a $10 billion valuation. Quantinuum is the quantum computing company that Honeywell owns a majority interest in through a joint venture. The most recent publicly known equity funding round was in January 2024, when the business raised $300 million at a pre-money valuation of $5 billion. Considering the significant market capitalization accumulation of speculative quantum stocks like D-Wave over the past 18 months, we're curious what Quantinumm could fetch in the public market. Honeywell's eventual plan for this business is to take it public, but the timeline is unclear. Next month, Honeywell management will be participating in two industrial conferences in early September. The announcement signals the upcoming transition from earnings season to conference season, when management teams typically provide intra-quarter updates on how their business is performing. Honeywell shares were modestly higher on Wednesday's weaker stock market. Up Next: Coty reports after Wednesday's closing bell, and Walmart reports before Thursday's opening bell. On the economic data side, Thursday morning brings jobless claims and existing home sales. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Ethereum dropped over 4% to $4,340, while XRP slid 4% to around $3.00. Solana, Dogecoin and Cardano also posted steeper losses, with SOL down 5% and ADA tumbling nearly 6%. The global crypto market cap shrank to $3.99 trillion, shedding nearly 3% overnight.\nPowell’s final Jackson Hole appearance\nThe selloff mirrors broader risk aversion across financial markets as traders brace for Powell’s final Jackson Hole appearance before stepping down as Fed chair. The Wyoming summit has often been a stage for defining policy shifts. In 2022, Powell invoked Paul Volcker in a vow to crush inflation “whatever the cost.” Last year, he hinted at loosening, saying “the time has come for policy to adjust.”\nThis time, Powell is expected to address stubborn inflation — still above the Fed’s 2% target — alongside a cooling labor market. Futures markets have priced in a September rate cut, but analysts caution Powell may avoid confirming it this week.\nLiquidations\nLiquidation data underscored the volatility. More than $567 million worth of crypto positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours, with long traders hit hardest. Ethereum alone saw liquidations above $14 million, while Bitcoin accounted for nearly $3 million, per data from CoinGlass.\nTrading firm QCP Capital flagged early warning signs. “BTC perpetuals across major venues started to trend lower since Friday,” the firm explained. “For example, the BTC funding rate on Deribit, which was consistently above 20% for the past week, turned negative by Saturday and stayed there even as spot drifted higher over the weekend. A similar pattern on 1 August preceded a drop from 118k to 112k.”\nThat divergence between spot and futures markets has traders bracing for more turbulence. According to QCP, “Options flows are now skewed towards another leg lower as risk reversals have swung in favour of puts across tenors,” suggesting investors are paying up for downside protection ahead of Powell’s speech.\nInflation complicates the Fed’s hand\nHole comes at a delicate moment for monetary policy. Producer prices jumped 0.9% in July — far above the 0.2% forecast — raising questions about inflation’s persistence. “Thursday’s higher-than-expected PPI numbers have complicated the Fed’s policy framework,” QCP said, adding that “the market will be looking for hints on the Fed’s thinking ahead of its September policy meeting.”\nDespite the anxiety, QCP sees limited breakout risk in the immediate term. “With implied vols still relatively low, the market does not expect a major breakout. Sideways trade seems likely, with dips near 112k attracting buyers and rallies toward 120k meeting supply, at least until Friday when Fed Chair Jerome Powell takes the stage,” the firm said.\nMeanwhile, institutional players continue to accumulate. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet disclosed it had added 775 BTC over the weekend, underscoring long-term confidence even as near-term sentiment weakens.\nCrypto markets slump ahead of Powell’s Jackson Hole speech first appeared on TheStreet on Aug 18, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 18, 2025, where it first appeared.","content_hash":"a4774c45a4de34bddd77d8badd4a3b21","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3542,"method_rank":0}

Now, he's set to become the company's next CEO.\nFiddelke, currently Target's chief operating officer, will take over the top position and join the board of directors on February 1, 2026, the company announced on Wednesday. He'll replace Brian Cornell, who's run the retailer for the last 11 years — overseeing it through record stock highs in 2021 and an ongoing market slump essentially ever since.\nWhen Fiddelke interned at Target in 2003, he was a graduate student at Northwestern University studying business administration and finance. Target hired him as a full-time analyst the following year, and he got promoted or changed jobs within the Minneapolis-based company roughly every two years, all the way up to his CEO appointment.\nHis resume at Target between 2007 and 2024 includes several director titles, vice president, senior vice president, executive vice president and chief financial officer. \"I can tell you that the intern that walked through those doors down the road 22 years ago wouldn't have predicted a Target path that leads to today,\" Fiddelke, 49, said in a video on LinkedIn on Wednesday.\nFiddelke's job as CEO may not be easy. For the past four years, Target's sales have been generally flat, a trend that the company's leaders have described as a blip — but customers, former employees, vendors and analysts say is largely a result of subpar experiences in leanly staffed stores and a Trump-era turn away from diversity efforts, CNBC reported on July 15.\n\"They have kind of lost their identity,\" said one former employee, who worked at Target for nearly 10 years.\nTarget's fiscal second-quarter results exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations, but its full-year outlook still predicts a single percentage point decline in sales.\n\"Getting Target back to growth is my top priority,\" Fiddelke wrote in his LinkedIn post. \"We'll need to operate differently, move with urgency and focus, and make bold choices to get there. We have the foundation to build new momentum, and I'm eager to accelerate work already underway and find new ways to deliver the incredible products and experiences our guests expect from us.\"\nWhen Fiddelke takes over, he'll join the likes of Nike's Elliott Hill, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and General Motors' Mary Barra as people who went on to lead the companies they joined as interns. His decades of experience at Target during both high and low periods help him \"understand this business\" and what makes it \"distinctly unique,\" he said on Wednesday during a call with reporters.\n\"I know you're not satisfied with where Target is today. Neither am I,\" he said in the LinkedIn video, speaking to consumers. \"Getting us back to growth is my No. 1 priority and I'm eager to get to work.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

Since Pop Mart trades in a relatively thin market, short-sellers rushing to cover after unexpectedly bullish news could be behind the sharp jump, he said.\nThe choppiness could also be driven by domestic China hedge funds and retail investors taking profit, while global long-term institutional investors could be buying Pop Mart shares as a China consumption play, said William Ma, chief investment officer at Grow Investment Group.\nPop Mart CEO Wang Ning reportedly said Wednesday that the firm was well-positioned to hit its 2025 revenue target of 20 billion yuan, adding that reaching 30 billion yuan this year \"should also be quite easy.\" Pop Mart also said it will roll out a miniature Labubu this week that can be clipped onto phones.\nIn June, Chinese state media urged stricter oversight of blind-box toys and trading cards sold to children under the age of eight, suggesting measures such as age verification at checkout and parental consent for online purchases. Pop Mart pioneered \"blind boxes,\" where buyers discover the toys only after opening the mystery box.\nWhile not directly naming the company, state media criticized businesses for encouraging kids to spend excessively on \"mystery boxes\" and \"blind cards.\"\nThere is no guarantee that consumers will continue to favor them in the next 5-10 years, as their preferences may change very fast.Jeff ZhangMorningstar\n\"We think the longevity of popularity for Pop Mart's key IPs remain uncertain. While sales growth of Labubu and other IPs remain robust, there is no guarantee that consumers will continue to favor them in the next 5-10 years, as their preferences may change very fast,\" said Jeff Zhang, equity analyst at Morningstar.\nPop Mart's stock has rallied more than 200% since the start of the year, data from LSEG showed.\n\"Shares likely remain overpriced as investors are overlooking the high business risk in the long run, in our view,\" Zhang added.\nAsia-Pacific, excluding China, was the company's largest overseas market, with revenue soaring 257.8% to 2.85 billion yuan compared to the same period a year ago. The Americas made up its second-largest overseas market, with revenue jumping over 1,000% to 2.26 billion yuan.\nIntellectual Property is at the \"core\" of Pop Mart's business, the toymaker said in its earnings statement, adding that it will seek to continue expanding its global business footprint.","content_hash":"d3b5de8cb17a73138ea0b38f574b7b86","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3523,"method_rank":0}

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.\nThe first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season is spinning off the East Coast, and there are sure to be more in its wake. As season after season produces more intense storms resulting in increasingly costly damage, facilities managers in commercial real estate are making property resilience a priority.\nOne of the ways to do that is through technology. Strides have already been made in combating wildfire risk: Companies like Pano AI, Satelytics and AiDash are incorporating satellite technology with artificial intelligence to pinpoint particular fire hazards, with major electric companies as clients.\nAnd similar advancements are working to reduce the risk of hurricane damage: Site Technologies employs drones to help commercial real estate facilities managers see where the vulnerabilities are in their properties and address them before those storms hit. Site was originally a construction company.\n\"We teamed up with our team of experts and engineers in pavements and roofs and facades and landscaping, and we started to figure out how we need to be able to capture data from facilities to be able to do engineering work and review of the current conditions of the properties,\" said Austin Rabine, Site CEO.\nSite doesn't have its own drones, but uses freelancers across the country. Rabine says the company has surveyed roughly 13,000 properties in 15 different countries and deploys drones on an annual basis for large customers that have hundreds or thousands of facilities.\nThe images, once captured, can be fed into Site's artificial intelligence platform that incorporates expertise from its own staff and analyzes the properties, providing condition and risk reports for the exterior of each facility.\n\"We also identify how they should be spending their money over the next three to five years to make sure that their facility is in good condition,\" said Rabine. \"So we create the scopes of work and condition reports using AI, and then we have a lot of dashboarding features that allow them to sort by their worst properties or their highest-risk properties for them to be able to focus their attention on their highest needs.\"\nThis predictive maintenance allows property and facilities managers to see the issues before they become liabilities. That's everything from clogged drains to overgrown trees to weak roofs.\nFor existing customers, Site offers to fly drones over the properties after any kind of destructive event occurs. The images can then be used as before and after assessments for insurance claims.\nSite's customers include Prologis, a major warehouse real estate investment trust, as well as Link Logistics and large national retailers. Most clients will have at least 100 properties, as companies with smaller real estate footprints can use human surveyors more easily.\n\"When you have hundreds or thousands of properties, it was never really a viable option to be able to get a snapshot, on an annual basis, of your facilities until technology like this,\" said Rabine.","content_hash":"b1cb6f680d28b87c0e4fb0a033d37772","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3371,"method_rank":0}

Microsoft and the NFL said the deal will also support operations by helping managers track factors such as weather delays or technical equipment issues.\nThe NFL and Microsoft are not disclosing how long the extension will be or the total cost of the deal.\n\"Enhancing the league is a responsibility we take seriously, and Microsoft has been a trusted sideline technology partner for over a decade. With Microsoft's AI technologies, including Copilot, we see tremendous opportunities to elevate the gameday experience for our clubs and deliver an even more compelling product to our fans,\" NFL Chief Information Officer Gary Brantley said in a press release.\nThe extension builds on a long-standing partnership between Microsoft and the NFL. Since the 2014 season, all NFL teams have had access to league-provided, specially configured Microsoft Surface tablets, according to the NFL. Previously, Microsoft had more than 2,300 Surface sideline viewing system devices installed across the NFL.\nNFL Deputy CIO Aaron Amendolia told CNBC in an interview that the existing tablets have already been swapped out for the preseason and the new devices are being used on the field now.\nHe said that during live games, players have only seconds on the bench between plays to analyze formations and look at different angles and pictures. AI helps players and coaches filter through that tremendous amount of data automatically, Amendolia said.\n\"This is not AI making decisions. It's not AI informing decisions. What it really is, is AI allowing people to get at information faster with less manual intervention,\" Amendolia said.\nFor coaches, Amendolia said game data such as snap counts or personnel counts on the field can be fed into an Excel sheet in real time with Copilot, which frees them from doing such tasks and calculations themselves.\nMost recently during the 2025 NFL Combine, coaches and scouts used Microsoft Azure AI to evaluate more than 300 prospective players for selection in the NFL draft.\nMicrosoft said Wednesday that clubs will soon be able to use AI for drafts outside of the NFL Combine, as well as for productivity across all business functions, including finance, human resources and events.\nFootball club staff will also soon be able to use AI agents for player scouting and salary cap management, Microsoft said.\nThe league has already implemented a type of artificial intelligence into its OnePass fan guide app for events, Amendolia said, that can help with fan questions and answers. He said the NFL is trying to train that so-called agentic AI to be more customer service focused.\nThe tech giant is also separately working to infuse Azure AI video tools during teams' practice sessions to help with coaching, evaluations and player injury assessments.\nAmendolia said this video component will involve automatically analyzing metadata so users can quickly find certain players, camera angles or plays in video footage.","content_hash":"a0f9fbe33270b94b02fb1222e76e9e2d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3355,"method_rank":0}

Niccol has articulated a clear, multi-pronged turnaround plan that we view as both practical and achievable. We believe Starbucks’ store operations became overly complex, resulting in over-tasked baristas and a poor customer experience. Having successfully revitalized Chipotle, we view Niccol as the right leader for Starbucks. He has already identified fixes for in-store operations, marketing, and customer service that we believe can potentially result in meaningful impact in the not-too-distant future, provided they are effectively scaled across 17,000 U.S. stores. We believe Starbucks retains an aspirational brand and a loyal customer base. As such, we see solid growth ahead through store productivity, new-store growth, and significant margin expansion.

Obesity drugs such as Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound can also be difficult to access due to their high costs, limited U.S. insurance coverage and constrained supply.\nBut now, any patient can purchase a Signos membership to access its system. It uses an AI platform and an off-the-shelf continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, from Dexcom to offer personalized, real-time data and lifestyle recommendations for weight management.\n\"There is now a solution that everybody can use to help on the weight loss journey, and you don't have to be a certain number of pounds to use it. It's available for the average American who needs it,\" said Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, Signos' co-founder and CEO, in an interview on Tuesday ahead of the approval. \"The average person might have five pounds to lose, or others might have 100 pounds to lose. We are here to help them at any point in that journey.\"\nThe obesity epidemic costs the U.S. health-care system more than $170 billion a year, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Almost 74% of Americans are overweight or obese, government data says. Signos hopes it can make a \"real big dent in that curve for the betterment of many of us,\" Fouladgar-Mercer said.\nCustomers who sign up for Signos can choose a three-month or six-month plan, which currently costs $139 and $129, respectively. The company will ship out all of the CGMs a patient needs for the number of months in the plan they choose.\nInsurers currently don't cover the system for weight management, but the plans are a fraction of the roughly $1,000 monthly price of GLP-1s in the U.S. Signos is working with health insurance companies and employers to get coverage for the system, the company said in a statement to CNBC. Signos said it expects \"this to evolve quickly as interest for tackling weight continued to expand.\"\nThe Signos system can be used in combination with GLP-1s or bariatric surgery, said Fouladgar-Mercer. He said patients can also use the system after getting off a GLP-1 to maintain their weight\nCGMs are small sensors worn on the upper arm that track glucose levels, mainly for people with diabetes. That data is wirelessly sent to Signos' app, which also allows patients to log their food intake and exercise levels, among other information that the AI platform uses to make recommendations.\nApart from helping people manage their weight, the system aims to help users understand how their bodies respond to specific foods and exercise patterns and make the right behavioral changes to manage and maintain their weight in the long term.\nSignos did not share how many patients are currently using its glucose monitoring system, but Fouladgar-Mercer said tens of thousands of people have already tried it over time. He said Signos has scaled up its CGM inventory and software capacity to \"handle a pretty massive scale\" following the approval.","content_hash":"57caf62d2c23aeb5d64a05c9b164fa97","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3303,"method_rank":0}

In addition to Denver, the firm also has offices in Cleveland, Boston and Washington, D.C.\nMonticello will continue to operate as an independent brand, led by Durham.\nSusie Cranston, president of Cresset, said the combination of the two firms will benefit clients on both sides who may have a need for new capabilities.\n“Maybe one of Monticello’s client’s investment committees personally would like some support, and they’re looking for an introduction,\" she said. “Or, it could be that some of the family offices that Monticello serves need some augmentation in some area that they don’t provide services in. Similarly, on Cresset’s side, we have quite a few clients that serve on different endowments, foundations boards, and they need investment consulting expertise.”\nOver the last several years, many in the RIA business have made concerted efforts to serve the institutional market. For example, one of the biggest RIAs in the country, Mariner Wealth Advisors, acquired two institutional consulting firms, AndCo Consulting and Fourth Street Performance Partners, last year, adding $104 billion in assets and 100 employees.\nLate last year, Hightower took a majority interest in NEPC, an institutional consulting firm and outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). And SageView Advisory Group, a California-based registered investment advisory firm, recently acquired CAP STRAT, an Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.-based institutional retirement plan consulting and wealth management firm with $25 billion in assets.\n“This is a trend that you will see continue as our business moves forward, as the industry moves forward, because it is such a fantastic way for clients to be better served, for capabilities to be added to all sides,\" Cranston said.\nCresset was founded by Eric Becker and Stein in 2017 to manage their own families’ assets. The duo came out of the private equity world, and the firm has focused on bringing private placements to its wealthy clients. It serves high-net-worth clients, including entrepreneurs, CEOs and executives, as well as multigenerational families. Cresset provides boutique family office services, personalized wealth management, private investing opportunities and a community focused on peer-to-peer learning.\nLate last year, Cresset sold a minority stake to Constellation Wealth Capital, the private equity company created by former Emigrant Partners CEO Karl Heckenberg to invest in the growing RIA channel.","content_hash":"8cd5720bddc848d454cb457a4ba71b3d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3148,"method_rank":0}

The talk could shed light on how the Fed chief is thinking about the central bank's battle to bring down inflation, and whether he thinks the Fed is ready to cut its benchmark fed funds rate from its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, a level he and other Fed officials consider high enough to \"moderately\" weigh on economic growth and put downward pressure on inflation.\nIn recent years, Powell has used the annual Jackson Hole speech to signal major changes in monetary policy. In 2024, he confirmed the Fed was about to cut rates for the first time in more than a year, after holding the Fed funds rate high to stamp out a post-pandemic wave of inflation. This time, Powell could use the summit to signal whether the Fed is ready to resume rate cuts for the first time since December.\nPowell may also shed light on how he views the Fed's current dilemma. The central bank is tasked with using monetary policy to keep inflation low and employment high. But lately, both of those economic indicators have gone in the wrong direction after President Donald Trump launched his unprecedented campaign to raise import taxes.\nExperts expect the speech to go one of at least three ways:\nSignal A Rate Cut Is Coming\nPowell could use the speech to signal that the Fed will cut interest rates soon, possibly when its policy committee announces its next meeting in September. Financial markets were pricing in an 83% chance of a rate cut as of Monday afternoon, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which forecasts rate movements based on Fed funds futures trading data.\nPowell and other Fed officials have voiced concerns that the recent slowdown in the job market could turn into a more serious wave of unemployment. Those fears were supercharged earlier this month by a Department of Labor report that showed job growth unexpectedly ground to a halt this summer.\n\"With the labor market already near the limit of what could be called maximum employment, we suspect that weak job growth and concern about further downward revisions and downside risks have already convinced the Fed leadership to resume rate cuts,\" David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a commentary.","content_hash":"de48e7f62eab6061a69172b44d8fc785","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3133,"method_rank":0}

For some, the surge is a welcome sign of renewed optimism after tariff-related chaos in the spring threatened a promised IPO revival.\nBut an analysis of recent IPO-related filings shows that women leaders are largely missing from the boards and executive teams at the vast majority of new public companies, despite years of calls for more diversity in corporate leadership. The data may even be an early signal of future losses for executive women, as DEI, already facing a backlash, is abandoned or sidelined, especially in the tech industry.\nDamion Rallis, cofounder of board data firm Free Float Analytics, combed through information about 61 companies that filed IPO-related documents in the first two weeks of August. He found that nearly 88% of the firms (most of which were in tech) had only one or no women on their board of directors, while 93% had only one or no women in their C-suite. Rallis is now calling this the “Bro-PO market,” and said his findings were “crazy.”\n“We’ve given up our ideals. We’ve just given up,” he said on Free Float’s Business Pants podcast.\nOnly seven of the 61 companies Rallis examined had two or more women on their boards, while only four listed two or more women executives. In total, women represented only 12% of the 349 directors and 11% of 205 executives identified in the filings. StubHub listed one female executive on its team of five, and one female director on a board of seven. Bullish listed two executive leaders, both men, and one woman on its six-person board.\nFor reference, women represent about 30% of board members at Russell 3000 companies, according to recent studies, and 29% of C-suite roles, according to a 2024 McKinsey survey.\nIn recent years, corporate boards have made gender and racial diversity a central focus of recruitment efforts, especially after Nasdaq issued a rule that said listed companies must disclose their board gender and diversity statistics. That directive was set to expand: Eventually, it would have imposed minimum diversity requirements or asked companies to explain why their boards weren’t diverse. However, that effort was shut down in late 2024 by a federal appeals court that decided Nasdaq had overstepped its statutory authority when it set the policy.\nIn 2020, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon declared that “IPOs are a pivotal moment for firms,” as he described his bank’s then-landmark pledge not to take companies public if their boards were entirely male. But the company abandoned that promise this year, citing “legal developments related to board diversity requirements,” my colleague Emma Hinchliffe reported in February. “We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach,” Goldman told Fortune at the time.","content_hash":"3a4277354bbb5d2887d45a7aa7ce8559","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3084,"method_rank":0}

In a new staff statement released by the Division of Corporation Finance, the regulator clarified that liquid staking activities generally won’t be treated as securities offerings—a decision that could unlock billions in previously sidelined institutional capital.\nWhat Is Liquid Staking, and Why Does It Matter?\nThink of liquid staking as having your cake and eating it too in the crypto world. Traditional staking requires you to lock up your tokens to earn rewards, but you can’t use those assets for anything else during that period. Liquid staking solves this problem by giving you receipt tokens that represent your staked assets, allowing you to maintain liquidity while still earning staking rewards.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90\/share.\n-\nGrow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto – unlock the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account.\nAccording to Gemini Research, when you deposit your crypto assets with a liquid staking provider, they stake them on your behalf. In return, you receive \"Staking Receipt Tokens\", also known as liquid staking tokens, or LSTs, that represent your ownership of the original assets plus any staking rewards, while still preserving liquidity. These tokens can be traded, used as collateral, or deployed in decentralized finance applications—all while your original assets continue to earn staking rewards in the background\nThe market opportunity is massive. Ethereum alone has over $100 billion in staked assets, and that number is growing rapidly as more proof-of-stake networks launch. Liquid staking protocols like Lido have already captured significant market share, but regulatory uncertainty has kept many institutional players on the sidelines.\nThe SEC’s Surprising Clarity\nThe SEC’s new guidance represents a dramatic shift from the agency’s historically aggressive stance toward crypto. The division explicitly stated that liquid staking activities “do not involve the offer and sale of securities” under federal securities laws, provided they meet specific criteria.\nTrending: 2,000 High Earners Manage $6B With This AI Platform — Learn More\nThe key insight comes down to the famous Howey test, which determines whether something is a security based on whether investors expect profits from the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.” The SEC concluded that liquid staking providers are essentially acting as agents rather than investment managers—they don’t make decisions about when or how much to stake, and they don’t guarantee returns.","content_hash":"31e835ec102ce9a243532e22a05b22f9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":3008,"method_rank":0}

That’s one of the key takeaways from a sweeping new MIT study on generative AI in the workplace. The study finds that workers at more than 90% of companies are using personal chatbot accounts for daily tasks, often without approval from IT, while only 40% of companies actually have official LLM subscriptions.\nA sweeping new report from MIT’s Project NANDA, State of AI in Business 2025, has uncovered a dramatic split in the landscape of enterprise artificial intelligence: While official AI adoption in companies stalls, a robust “shadow AI economy” is flourishing under the radar, powered by employees using personal AI tools for day-to-day work.\nThe main thrust of the study is the “GenAI divide”: the finding by MIT that despite $30 billion to $40 billion invested in gen-AI initiatives, only 5% of organizations are seeing transformative returns. The vast majority—95%—report zero impact on profit and loss statements from formal AI investments. Lurking under the surface, though, MIT also finds huge engagement with LLM tools on the part of workers, a shadow economy of seemingly widespread AI adoption.\nRather than waiting for official enterprise gen-AI projects to overcome technical and organizational hurdles, employees are routinely leveraging personal ChatGPT accounts, Claude subscriptions, and other consumer-grade AI tools to automate tasks. This activity is often invisible to IT departments and C-suites.\nEmployees are already crossing the GenAI Divide through personal AI tools. This ‘shadow AI’ often delivers better ROI than formal initiatives and reveals what actually works for bridging the divide.\nThe study was based on a review of over 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives, interviews with representatives from 52 organizations, and survey responses from 153 senior leaders.\nIt reveals that while only 40% of companies have purchased official LLM subscriptions, employees in over 90% of companies regularly use personal AI tools for work. In fact, nearly every respondent reported using LLMs in some form as part of their regular workflow.\nMany shadow users describe interacting with LLMs multiple times a day, every workday—with adoption often far outpacing their companies’ sanctioned AI initiatives, which remain stuck in pilot stages.\nProject NANDA’s analysis highlights key reasons for this divide:\n-\nFlexibility and immediate utility: Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are praised for their ease of use, adaptability, and instantly visible value—qualities missing from many custom-built enterprise solutions.\n-\nWorkflow fit: Employees customize consumer tools to their specific needs, bypassing enterprise approval cycles and integration challenges.\n-\nLow barriers: Shadow AI’s accessibility accelerates adoption, as users can iterate and experiment freely.","content_hash":"065351ac49a1d73f13f710cd6fec2114","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2997,"method_rank":0}

What can I do?\nBuyer-beware scams are in the headlines every day, but a growing number of buyers are ripping off businesses by reversing charges on their purchases. This is a seller-beware scenario.\nImagine you run a precious metals store and a customer wants to buy $3,000 worth of gold via wire transfer. You verify their identity, complete the sale and hand over the gold. All by the book, right?\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n-\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n-\nWant an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nNot quite. A month later, the customer calls their bank to dispute the charge, claiming they were tricked into buying the gold by a third party.\nThe bank is convinced by the customer’s story, cancels the wire transfer and withdraws money from your merchant account, leaving you without payment — and your store down $3,000 worth of gold, which is hard to trace.\nThe same thing can happen with customers who request the reversal of electronic fund transfers (EFTs) or credit card charges. Such transactions are called “friendly fraud\" or \"chargeback fraud.\"\nThe customer may indeed have been the victim of a scam, or be pulling off a scam themselves. Either way, your business is left with a loss.\nUnfortunately, it’s not an uncommon occurrence, particularly for businesses dealing in precious gems and metals, which are frequently targeted in scams.\nHere’s what happens and how to protect your business.\nBanks often side with customers in cases of alleged fraud\nBanks typically allow chargebacks or payment reversals only under certain conditions:\n-\nUnauthorized transactions. The customer claims they didn’t authorize the purchase.\n-\nBilling errors. The charge was duplicated, incorrect, or charged in the wrong amount.\n-\nFraudulent activity. The purchase was made under false pretenses or through deception.\n-\nFailure to receive goods or services. The item was never delivered, was defective, or didn’t match the description.\nIn many cases, banks default to protecting the consumer, especially when fraud is alleged. However, with wire transfers, often considered final and irreversible, the rules are more complicated and the reversal takes more time.\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market?

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Retail Dive newsletter.\nUlta Beauty and Target on Thursday took the Gwyneth Paltrow approach to breaking up — consciously uncoupling through a joint press release.\nBoth companies agreed to end the Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shops in August of 2026, about five years since the deal debuted. Customers and employees need not worry, however, as the companies “remain committed to delivering a seamless shopping experience and product availability” during this time and vow to support everyone through the transition.\nThe companies, which are each slated to report earnings this month, shared few details behind the mutual decision and did not respond to requests for comment.\n“Staffing needs, loyalty program synergies, shrink, and [return on invested capital] were likely key considerations,” TD Cowen analysts said in a Thursday note shared with Retail Dive, which also referenced “conscious uncoupling.”\nTarget has been tackling out of stock issues more generally since the Ulta partnership debuted in 2021. Similar to other mass retailers dealing with theft, Target also increased its use of locked merchandise, including beauty products, since the partnership began. The locking up of merchandise to prevent shrink had become a point of frustration for Target shoppers, per comments from GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders last year.\nHowever, Ulta CEO Kecia Steelman, while serving as COO in 2023, noted that the rollout of locked fragrance cabinets at the company’s own stores was improving sales.\nBoth retailers are steadfast on improving themselves for the time being, emphasizing the need to master retail fundamentals.\n“It starts with retail fundamentals,” Target CEO Brian Cornell told analysts on an earnings call in May when asked about a turnaround plan moving forward. “We know we've got to be reliable. We've got to be consistent. We've got to make sure we are managing inventory effectively in this environment. We've got to continue to make progress with shrink. Those are fundamentals each and every day that are embedded in our business.”\nSteelman echoed a similar perspective during an earnings call in March.\n“It’s clear to me that how we’ve operated must change,” Steelman said of the Ulta stores, noting specifically a need to improve presentation and inventory levels across its fleet.\nIn the immediate term, industry analysts foresee minimal impact to revenue from the partnership dissolution.\n“Target shop-in-shops contribute to Ulta’s other revenue line, which also includes credit card income and loyalty point redemptions,” William Blair analysts said in a note Thursday. “Target pays Ulta a royalty on product sold, taking ownership of the inventory and staffing responsibility ... Given the agreement extends beyond 2025, this announcement should not impact the company’s fiscal 2025 results or guide.”","content_hash":"01160323e48a7e218fe134508a8cad8b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2958,"method_rank":0}

Ownership surpassed $9 trillion for the fourth consecutive month, having topped an all-time high each time.\nFor the first half of the year, foreign holdings increased by $508.1 billion. During that period, the U.S. dollar tumbled by almost 11%, making it the worst first-half of a year since 1973, when President Nixon delinked the dollar from gold. A weakening dollar, alongside wider concerns that the Trump administration's tariffs could prove to be inflationary, may keep U.S. interest rates higher for longer. This means higher Treasury yields for investors.\nJapan defended its status at the largest foreign holder of Treasuries in June, with a balance of around $1.15 trillion.\nThe UK bought $48.7 billion of Treasuries in June — the largest purchase of any country — maintaining its rank as the second-largest holder. The UK is considered to be a custody country, meaning it's used by hedge funds for custody services, similar to the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas.\nThe UK's Treasury holdings have approximately doubled over the past five years due to the growing popularity of the basis trade among hedge funds. The gross holding of U.S. government bonds by hedge funds reached approximately $3.94 trillion in March, more than doubling since 2018, according to the Office of Financial Research.\nTraders exploit tiny price differences between U.S. Treasury bonds and Treasury futures. They buy the actual bonds, and sell Treasury futures at the same time. Higher rates can widen the gap between cash Treasuries and futures, making the trade more attractive — but only if the borrowing costs don’t outweigh the arbitrage gain.\nHedge funds' growing Treasury leverage has some regulators fearing it could amplify economic shocks if traders all rush to unwind their basis trades at once. When President Donald Trump revealed sweeping tariffs in April, Treasury yields spiked, indicating a bond market sell-off, as uncertainty grew about the stability of the U.S. economy.\n\"As U.S. Treasury yields started to rise, hedge fund deleveraging likely amplified the move,\" JP Morgan analysts wrote .\nChina's Treasury holdings were little changed in June, ending three months of net outflows, which saw investors shed $28 billion, equivalent to about 4% of its holdings. While China remains the third-largest foreign owner, its balance is the lowest its been since February 2009.\nChina began reducing its exposure to Treasuries in 2018, downsizing its reserves by about one-third, equivalent to $414 billion. Beijing's sell-off is an attempt to boost its currency, the yuan, experts say, as an economic slowdown and trade barriers have diminished China's inflows from exports.","content_hash":"a2911e46477c80b2a6ad40b5cfc820dc","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2939,"method_rank":0}

On Tuesday it will be Home Depot, Wednesday Target and Lowe's, and Thursday Walmart. Investors are hoping to gain fresh clues from their results and management commentary on how tariffs are impacting inflation. But it's worth noting that because retailers use different accounting methods, the short-term impact of tariffs may be obscured.\nRetailers generally use two types of accounting methods. One is cost accounting, which directly reflects the actual cost of each item. The other is the retail inventory accounting method, which uses the average cost-to-price ratio of goods.\nPwC told CNBC that compared with cost accounting, the retail inventory method reacts more slowly when costs change, because it uses the average price of all inventory, and can even exaggerate profitability. In other words, gross margins reported in financial statements may look higher than they really are. PwC estimates it may take two to four quarters before cost fluctuations are fully reflected and profitability levels return closer to reality.\nPwC data also shows that nearly one-quarter of U.S. retailers use the retail inventory method, including Walmart, Target, and Home Depot.\nAnalysts told CNBC that overall performance in the second quarter may look strong, but outlooks for the second half of the year are expected to be more cautious and conservative.\nManny Chirico\nLNK partner and former CEO of PVH Corp\n\"Because of the tariffs, especially in soft goods retail—footwear, apparel, accessories—what you're going to see going forward is tariffs averaging somewhere between 20 and 25%. And that is a cost that retailers are going to have to deal with.\"\nAnalysts point out that the extent to which retailers are affected by tariffs varies. Some large chain retailers, due to their scale and wide product range, may be better positioned to absorb the impact. But for specialty retailers such as clothing and footwear, tariffs must be paid immediately upon entry, and given the seasonal nature of the retail business, the pressure will be greater.\nOverall, analysts expect that starting from the back-to-school season in late August and early September, U.S. consumers will begin to see higher retail prices. The overall increase is expected to be around 5% to 10%, and this trend may continue into the first half of next year.\nFinally, Wall Street is also watching consumer confidence. The University of Michigan reported last week that U.S. consumer sentiment in August fell for the first time in four months, dropping to 58.6, below expectations. This has raised concerns among analysts that if U.S. prices continue to rise while the labor market tightens, consumer confidence could weaken further.","content_hash":"80569579d4860cc43482fc9cafc160eb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2921,"method_rank":0}

The programme allows for the monthly repurchase of up to 1% of their shares, equating to 12% annually.\nThe 'smart liquidity' feature offers repurchases at the quarterly share repurchase value, potentially qualifying for taxation only on long-term capital gains.\nShareholders also have the option to request the repurchase of some or all their shares on a quarterly basis, subject to holding their investment for at least one year.\nHowever, the ability to have shares repurchased is capped at 5% of the Wyoming Reserve's outstanding shares each quarter and is on a “first-come, first-serve basis”.\nRepurchases are subject to the company's contractual obligations, regulatory considerations, terms of preferred stock, and compliance with both Wyoming and federal law.\nInvestors can potentially enjoy tax-free growth on gains from investments held for a minimum of ten years.\n“Our investors avoid the 28% long-term capital gains collectibles tax that comes with physical ownership of precious metals and have an opportunity to enjoy tax-free growth on any appreciation from their investment in the Wyoming Reserve. We believe that the combination of tax advantages, the asset class and our team's breadth of experience presents a compelling opportunity,\" Phair added.","content_hash":"1eed7e5ee546d91a521802cf6c3dcde0","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2921,"method_rank":0}

Under the new SSN rule, a family can only claim the child tax credit on a joint return if at least one parent has a valid SSN.

Back in 2013, the SSA required most new enrollees to receive their benefits electronically. However, this final push eliminates paper checks entirely.\nThere are three main reasons for this shift:\n-\nFaster payments: Electronic payments arrive on time, while mail carrier issues, natural disasters or delivery errors can delay paper checks\n-\nCosts less: According to the U.S. Treasury, issuing a paper check costs approximately 50 cents, compared to less than 15 cents for an electronic transfer.

Permits for future single-family homebuilding edged up 0.5% to a rate of 870,000 units, snapping a four-month skid.\nOverall residential construction starts jumped 5.2% to a rate of 1.428 million units on the back of a second month of double-digit increases in apartment projects. Groundbreaking for multi-family projects of five or more units rose 11.6% to an annual rate of 470,000 units, the highest level since May 2023. New apartment construction, which had been in a protracted downtrend after peaking in 2022, has jumped more than 50% in the last two months.\nHow long that resurgence continues remains in question, though, as total permit issuance - a guide for future activity - fell 2.8% to a five-year low of 1.354 million units, led by a nearly 10% drop in multi-family project permits. Economists polled by Reuters had estimated housing starts would fall to an annual rate of 1.290 million and permits would dip to an annual rate of 1.386 million units.\nHIGH MORTGAGE RATES\nPresident Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs have kept the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates this year, with most central bank policymakers wary of easing borrowing costs until they have more confidence the levies will not rekindle inflation, which has yet to return to the Fed's 2% target.\nRecent indications of softening in the job market, however, have largely convinced investors that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point when it meets in mid-September, and that expectation has helped bring down mortgage rates in recent weeks.\nThe average rate on the popular 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most common U.S. home loan, fell to 6.58% last week, the lowest level since October, data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac showed. That rate is down by nearly half a percentage point since January.\nStill, mortgage rates are well above the levels that prevailed in the years just before and through the COVID-19 pandemic, and that change along with high home prices has kept a lid on demand. The slump in demand has increased the supply of homes on the market, discouraging builders from breaking ground on new housing projects. New housing inventory is near levels last seen in late 2007. A National Association of Home Builders survey on Monday showed more than a third of builders are cutting prices to attract buyers.","content_hash":"bb12bd40acd9f34ad764bc45f078e200","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2866,"method_rank":0}

Its exclusive Ozempic and Wegovy offerings, available starting today, are the lowest out-of-pocket costs for the medications available on the market.\nThe news comes just weeks after Novo Nordisk cut ties with the telehealth company Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) over claims that Hims & Hers was selling “knockoff” versions of Wegovy. It’s a dispute that reflects a broader discussion around whether compounded semaglutide drugs—or non-FDA approved versions of brand-name medicines—are a violation of intellectual property laws.\nAs of this writing, GoodRx’s stock is up by more than 30% since market close. Here’s what to know about Novo Nordisk’s latest partnership and its ongoing legal battles against compounded GLP-1s.\nGoodRx’s collaboration with Novo Nordisk\nIn the last year alone, GoodRx reports that nearly 17 million people visited the site searching for information and savings on GLP-1 medications—a 22% increase from the previous year.\n“Demand for GLP-1 medications is at an all-time high, but too many Americans still face barriers accessing them,” Wendy Barnes, GoodRX president and CEO, said in the press release. “By partnering with Novo Nordisk, we’re taking a significant step forward in making these innovative brand-name treatments more accessible for millions of people who need them.”\nIn the past, a spokesperson told Fast Company, GoodRx has worked with both Novo Nordisk and its competitor Eli Lilly to offer commercially insured patients manufacturer savings cards on GLP-1s. The company has also offered savings on other types of weight loss\/diabetes treatments, including Contrave, Dexcom G7, Lantus, and Qsymia.\nHowever, this is the first time that GoodRx has offered a cash price for a GLP-1. The $499 monthly self-pay cost will be available at more than 70,000 retail locations nationwide.","content_hash":"680915d70d0299642fc7d688a9228471","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2853,"method_rank":0}

Date, time, what to expect\n-\n‘Job hugging’ is the newest career trend: Here’s what it means—and why Gen Z is into it\nThat has led to a substantial increase in security spending, and a new study from the Financial Times finds that no company is spending more to protect its CEO than Meta. Security spending was up more than 10% last year at the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, with $27 million spent to protect Mark Zuckerberg—$3 million more than in 2023.\n“We believe that Mr. Zuckerberg’s role puts him in a unique position: He is synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,” the company says in its 2025 proxy statement.\nGoogle parent Alphabet and Amazon also saw increases of more than 10% in protection costs last year. Altogether, the 10 major tech firms spent more than $45 million to protect their leaders. Meta’s spending, however, greatly surpassed all others. The next highest was Alphabet, which allocated $6.8 million to protect CEO Sundar Pichai. Coinbase spent nearly as much, dedicating $6.2 million to guard CEO Brian Armstrong.\nThe big question on many minds, though, is how much is being spent to protect Elon Musk, arguably the most polarizing of the tech CEOs. The answer isn’t entirely clear. Only one of his companies, Tesla, is public, and it disclosed spending $500,000 to protect Musk last year (down from $2.4 million in 2023).

The UK motor insurance sector has encountered considerable challenges as it adjusts to the changing landscape of EV adoption. Although there were optimistic expectations that government incentives and environmental policies would hasten the shift to EVs, the actual rate of adoption has not met those forecasts. This slower uptake has heightened concerns among insurers, who are already dealing with the unique risks and expenses associated with EV ownership.\nResults from GlobalData’s 2024 Emerging Trends Insurance Consumer Survey reveals that 34.1% of drivers rated battery cover for theft, failure, or explosion as “extremely important,” while an additional 48.8% considered it “very important.” Furthermore, assistance to reach a charging station if the battery runs out was deemed as extremely important by 36.6% of respondents, underscoring the demand for support services tailored to address EV reliability concerns.\nInsurers are increasingly pressured to modify their products to cater to the specific needs of EV drivers, which differ significantly from those of traditional vehicle owners. Research from industry bodies found escalating battery replacement costs, a lack of repair expertise, and a shortage of specialised parts have all contributed to uncertainty regarding claims and pricing models. Industry experts stress the necessity of aligning insurance coverage with the realities of EV usage and the evolving expectations of consumers.\nInterestingly, this consumer focus on coverage aligns closely with earlier industry insights. In a GlobalData poll ran on Verdict Media sites in Q2 2023, when asked about the biggest challenge for insurers in the transition to EVs, 39.6% of respondents identified the cost of repairs as the primary issue. This reinforces the findings from 2024, as the high expenses associated with battery replacement and repair work remain a central challenge for insurers, directly influencing policy design and pricing strategies.\nTo effectively address these challenges, insurers should consider implementing educational campaigns to inform consumers about the unique aspects of EV insurance, enhancing customer service related to EV coverage, and actively engaging with stakeholders in the EV ecosystem. Insurers may need to focus on innovation and collaboration with EV manufacturers and repair networks. Tailored products, particularly those that address battery risks and roadside support, could become crucial differentiators. Ultimately, the gap between EV adoption forecasts and the current reality highlights both the volatility of the motor insurance market and the importance of building consumer confidence through responsive, specialised coverage.","content_hash":"0ee49a27df30add59e7d6e551dc7edbb","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2838,"method_rank":0}

He told Ramsey and co-host John Delony that he took on a larger-than-normal job without asking for any payments up front.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\n“There’s no amount of business that’s worth putting everything on the line for it,” Ramsey said in a clip posted Aug. 4.\nAn emotional Jeremy wondered whether he should file for bankruptcy himself or take on more debt to continue working jobs and try digging himself out of this hole. Ramsey offered him a third option.\nGetting back on track\nJeremy admitted he was willing to take lower margin jobs and foot the bill for his early clients because he didn’t have a reputation to lean on as a new business owner.\n“You’ve done amazing things for somebody your age, even though you stepped in a big old bear trap and it ripped your leg off,” Ramsey responded.\nHe advised Jeremy to learn from this harsh lesson, and find a way to get his business back on track — without going further into debt. Instead of “being the bank” for these clients, Ramsey said, he needs to learn how to work out payment schedules so that clients are paying for materials and the cost of labor as the project progresses. This minimizes the risk if the client is eventually unable to pay.\n“The industry standard is you don’t do that crap, because you go bankrupt when they go bankrupt,” Ramsey said of Jeremy’s previous method. “That’s the problem, you had bad business practices.”\nDelony pointed out that Jeremy’s reputation should be less of a concern since he’d completed around 30 jobs at this point.\nRead more: Nervous about the stock market?

These goals may differ from generation to generation.\nAccording to the 25th Annual Transamerica Retirement Survey of Workers, millennials share many of the same retirement dreams as other generations, but with some distinct differences in how they envision their golden years.\nTrending Now: 6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early\nRead More: The New Retirement Problem Boomers Are Facing\nHere’s how most millennials are planning to spend their retirement and whether they’re prepared financially to make this happen.\nTraveling\nTravel is a top retirement dream for many millennials, with 68% planning to go on vacations. While you can travel on a budget, frequent or long-distance trips can easily cost thousands each year. With the rising cost of travel, millennials will need a substantial amount set aside to fund these adventures without dipping into their retirement savings.\nTry This: 10 Vacations That Need To Be on Every Middle-Class Retiree’s Bucket List\nSpending More Time with Family and Friends\nFifty-eight percent of millennials plan to spend more time with their loved ones in retirement. Although this goal may not sound like an expense on its own, it can come with significant costs, especially if you plan to relocate closer to your family, dine out, buy gifts, or host gatherings.\nPursuing Hobbies\nMore than half of millennials (53%) see retirement as a chance to pursue hobbies they have always wanted to. While some hobbies are low-cost, others can be costly. Without carefully budgeting, these expenses could drain your savings faster.\nStarting a Business\nOne in four millennials plans to start a business in retirement. A business could provide extra income but comes with risks. Funding a business requires startup capital and time commitment, and any losses could mean tapping into your savings. Millennials pursuing this path will need a strong financial cushion and a realistic plan for profitability.\nDoing Volunteer Work\nA quarter of millennials plan to give back through volunteer work. Even though this goal doesn’t require direct income, you’ll still need to have enough savings to cover transportation and supplies.\nAre Millennials Prepared Financially?\nWhile 85% of millennials are saving for retirement, they’ve accumulated a median of just $65,000 in household retirement accounts. This is relatively lower than Gen X’s $107,000 and baby boomers’ $270,000.\nThe survey also reveals that 59% of millennials say debt interferes with their ability to save for retirement, and 49% report trouble making ends meet. This generation entered the workforce during the Great Recession, accumulated record student loan debt and then faced another economic crisis during the pandemic.","content_hash":"902a6f1e63381ee54a3f5c5cc70be476","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2832,"method_rank":0}

A new memorandum of understanding with a sustainable cotton sourcing platform aims to help.\nThis would be no easy lift: Cotton production in the South Asian nation remains relatively modest with 60,000 farmers growing the cash crop compared with neighboring India’s roughly 6 million. Because of the voracious demands of its textile sector, Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest importer of cotton after China.\nMore from Sourcing Journal\n-\nIndia Suspends Duties on Raw Cotton Imports, Benefitting US Exporters\n-\nEurofins Sustainability Services Launches Cotton Traceability Tool\n-\nMango Supports Regenerative Cotton Farmers with Materra Collection\nBut a cooperative framework with CottonConnect that focuses on building a traceable, regenerative and climate-adapted supply chain could give Bangladeshi cotton a competitive leg up, said Md. Rezaul Amin, executive director of the Cotton Development Board, an agency under the Ministry of Agriculture responsible for promoting cotton cultivation through research and training. This would mean implement rigorous data collection systems from the farm level to the final product.\nThe idea, he said, is to help farmers create a better quality fiber that promotes a healthier ecosystem, fetches higher prices and improves working conditions.\n“By focusing on farmer empowerment, climate resilience, technological innovation and market diversification, the MoU promises to benefit both producers and consumers while contributing to environmental stewardship,” Amin said in a statement. “Its emphasis on knowledge exchange, capacity building and joint projects positions it as a catalyst for long-term growth, improved farmer livelihoods and stronger global market presence for Bangladeshi cotton.”\nAnother goal of the agreement is to extend cotton’s use beyond traditional apparel, Bangladesh’s stock in trade, by exploring higher-value possibilities such as medical textiles and bio-composite materials. This could allow Bangladesh to diversify its export products, which are now heavily weighted toward basic, lower-margin garments such as T-shirts, sweaters and trousers.\n“This collaboration is a major step forward in aligning Bangladesh’s cotton sector with global sustainability and quality benchmarks,” Alison Ward, CEO of CottonConnect, said in a statement. “By integrating cotton improvements with the country’s powerful garment industry, we are creating a future where Bangladeshi cotton is not only competitive but also ethically and environmentally sound.”\nBangladesh is projected to import 8.1 million bales of cotton in marketing year 2026, or 300,000 bales fewer than the previous year, due to lower global consumption forecasts, the U.S. Department of Agriculture wrote in a note earlier this month.","content_hash":"98622cd46235ef5b4eaf94c4e026a88f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2825,"method_rank":0}

You are using that high price that they paid to argue you could have sold all of the seats at that price,” Henry, an associate teaching professor at Northeastern University’s D’Amore-McKim School of Business, said in an interview with Bloomberg News. “Not everyone wants to be at the concert quite that much.”\nFigma Inc.’s 250% first-day pop late last month, the biggest ever for a $1 billion-plus US IPO, and over 100% surges in names such as stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group Inc. in June and drone maker Airo Group Holdings Inc. in the same month on their inaugural-trading day have reignited the debate as to whether Wall Street banks and issuers set the share price of newly public companies too low relative to demand in the market.\nHenry and O’Brien, of the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, also contended that the opening trade on many IPOs overstates the true level of underpricing and describes a new measure that takes into account share price and volume.\n“We argue through supply-demand and empirical analysis that the magnitude of the puzzle is not as big as previously thought,” they write in the study.\nAccording to Henry, about 10% of the shares that a company sells in an IPO trade when those shares open for trading. When adjusted for the quantity of shares traded in the early going, the IPO pop is far less significant than is popularly thought.\n“We are not claiming there is no underpricing. It’s a question of how serious of a problem it is,” he said. “I am not sure the whole IPO ecosystem is broken if we think carefully about what these price changes mean and the quantities of shares that accompany these price changes.”\nPrevious research by University of Florida finance professor and IPO expert Jay Ritter has estimated the annual cost to issuers of underpriced IPOs was more than $5 billion in foregone proceeds or money left on the table, a number based on an average IPO pop of about 19%.","content_hash":"464c269c1fd0141ca0d518fe2158e5c9","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2818,"method_rank":0}

In the first half of this year, however, there are already 64 unique buyers, with the team expecting more to enter before the year’s end.\nThe takeaway from this quarter’s report is that the “appetite is alive and well, and the pool of buyers is widening,” said Laura Delaney McElroy, vice president of business consulting. “We may very well see more buyers this year than what the market yielded in 2023.”\nFidelity reported 16 new buyers in the market in 2025 to compete with existing acquirers.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 16 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.7%.\nThe day’s action centered again around stocks caught up in the mania around artificial-intelligence technology.\nNvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world’s move into AI, sank as much as 3.9% during the morning and was on track to be the heaviest weight on Wall Street following its 3.5% fall on Tuesday.\nBut it clawed back nearly all of Wednesday’s drop and finished with a dip of just 0.1%. As it pared its loss, so did broad market indexes because Nvidia is Wall Street’s most influential stock by being its most valuable.\nPalantir Technologies, another AI darling, fell 1.1% to add to its 9.4% loss from the day before, but it had been down as much as 9.8% Wednesday morning.\nOne possible contributor to the swoon was a study from MIT’s Nanda Initiative that warned that most corporations are not yet seeing any measurable return from their generative AI investments, according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.\nBut the larger factor may be the simple criticism that prices for such stock simply shot too high, too fast amid the furor around AI and became too expensive. Nvidia, whose profit report scheduled for next week is one of Wall Street’s next major events, had soared 35.5% for the year so far heading into Tuesday. Palantir had surged even more, more than doubling.\nThe tech stocks still have supporters, though, who say AI will bring the next generational revolution in business.\nMixed profit reports from big U.S. retailers helped keep the rest of the market in check.\nTJX, the company behind the TJ Maxx and Marshalls stores, climbed 2.7% after beating analysts’ forecasts for profit and revenue. It also raised its forecast for profit over its full fiscal year, while CEO Ernie Herrman said TJX is seeing “strong demand at each of our U.S. and international businesses” and that its current quarter is off to a strong start.\nLowe’s added 0.3% after the home-improvement retailer delivered a profit for the latest quarter that topped analysts’ expectations.\nTarget, meanwhile, tumbled 6.3%. The struggling retailer said that CEO Brian Cornell plans to step down Feb. 1 and that an insider, 20-year veteran Michael Fiddelke, will replace him. He helped reenergize the company, but it has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive post-COVID retail landscape.","content_hash":"c503750476c28ec4c79d41abdfc9f5b3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2753,"method_rank":0}

The documents were made public on Tuesday.\nAccording to CNBC calculations, the purchases had a total value of at least $100 million, assuming the lower value end listed for each disclosed transaction.\nBy law, the U.S. president, vice president and other select officials must periodically declare \"reportable transactions\" to the OGE. The precise value of these dealings does not have to be reported.\nThe extensive lists filed earlier this month show that, over the course of this year, Trump has bought bonds sold by various entities, including local U.S. governments, as well as gas districts, water supply districts, hospital authorities and school boards.\nTrump also bought debt issued by an array of big-name companies. The documents point to purchases of between $500,000 and $1,000,000 worth of bonds issued by T-Mobile U.S., United Health and Home Depot each in early February. Later that month, he procured debt issued by Facebook and Instagram parent Meta, worth between $250,000 and $500,000.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.\nCompanies, governments and other groups issue bonds to raise capital to carry out projects, fuel growth, refinance existing debt or to bolster financial stability. Investors who purchase the bonds receive interest payments — either fixed or variable — over an agreed period, along with the return of the full loan amount at the end of that period.\nSome of the companies whose debt is now owned by Trump have been directly impacted by his policies or business dealings.\nThe White House leader has a net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes. In 2020 — the last year of his first presidential term — Trump was worth $2.1 billion, according to the magazine. Forbes has labeled the years between his two terms \"the most lucrative post-presidency in American history\" thanks to a series of ventures marketed to his supporters.\nTrump's political rivals have previously accused him of various conflicts of interest during his tenure as president.\nUnder federal law, the president and vice president are exempt from some regulation relating to conflicts of interest among federal officials.\nBut according to the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington every modern president prior to Trump has opted to divest their business interests before taking office.","content_hash":"535a83b9b507a27aeee8c7d750fa1c82","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2753,"method_rank":0}

Vendor revenues grew 11% on average during the first quarter of the year, the analyst firm said in a July report.\n-\nInfrastructure software spend will lead the charge, increasing 13.3% over the next four years, as enterprises stock up on cloud services, security tools and AI capabilities. The market for application software, a category that includes IT operations management, enterprise resource planning, and supply chain tools, will see slower growth of 9.5%, the firm said.\n-\nDatabase management services will help shore up software market growth, as enterprises lay the groundwork for generative AI and agentic automation tools. The firm previously estimated off-the-shelf AI governance software spend to more than quadruple from 2024 to 2030, nearing $16 billion and capturing 7% of the software market.\nDive Insight:\nWhen vendor revenues increase, it signals a corresponding uptick in enterprise spend and budget scrutiny, as executives look for tangible returns on technology investments. The onset of President Donald Trump’s shifting tariffs regime earlier this year upped the ante for vendors and their customers, injecting economic uncertainty into the cost-benefit equation.\nA challenging macroeconomic environment will push software providers to optimize headcount and assist customers in tying spending to outcomes, particularly in cloud and generative AI, Forrester said. On the enterprise side, focus has already shifted to cost optimization, through usage audits, tool consolidation and increased adoption of open-source alternatives to high-priced vendor offerings, according to the firm.\nEconomic uncertainty has other downstream impacts on enterprise consumption patterns. To hedge against economic slowdown in the U.S., customers are gradually shifting from homegrown tools to cloud-based off-the-shelf services, reducing their reliance on third-party providers for customizations and favoring SaaS subscription billing over perpetual licenses to bring down CapEx, Forrester said.\nVendor contract renewals represent an opportunity to further optimize software spend without compromising enterprise capabilities, according to a Tropic report published last month.\nThe asset management software provider analyzed over $14 billion in purchases during the first half of the year and found spending increased 15% year over year. However, procurements slowed by 9% between the first and second quarter, corresponding with the Trump administration’s April trade policy moves.","content_hash":"f115fac9e287c17fe762766bf29493e3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2751,"method_rank":0}

Get ready for “job hugging.”\nMost Read from Fast Company\n-\nZillow changes course on home prices: Updated forecast for 400 housing markets\n-\nWhen is Apple’s iPhone 17 launch event? Date, time, what to expect\n-\n‘Job hugging’ is the newest career trend: Here’s what it means—and why Gen Z is into it\nKorn Ferry, a global organizational consultancy firm, has published a new report showing that employees are no longer moving quickly between new job opportunities and are instead choosing to stick it out in their current positions for the foreseeable future.\n“At an alarming rate, more and more employees are displaying what is colloquially known as ‘job hugging’—which is to say, holding onto their jobs for dear life,” the report reads.\nJust a few years ago, job hopping—or moving from company to company in search of the next best opportunity—was trending among employees, especially younger workers looking to climb the corporate ladder. Now, though, the opposite is true.\nKorn Ferry’s analysts say AI disruption, a lack of new jobs, and an unpredictable economic market are some of the main reasons why employees are doubling down on their current positions.\nWhat is job hugging?\nAccording to a July report from Arlington, Virginia-based Eagle Hill Consulting, the majority of employees plan to stay in their current position for at least the next six months, with Gen Z employees reporting the highest intent to remain where they are.\nFurther, the data found that the market opportunity indicator—a measure of employees’ perception of the outside job market—has dropped to its lowest level since the report’s inception.\nThe growing pessimism around employment opportunities isn’t unfounded. A recent report from global outplacement and coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that through the end of July, U.S.-based employers had announced more than 800,000 job eliminations in 2025—the highest number of jobs lost in the same period since the global pandemic in 2020.\nMeanwhile, job growth has turned sluggish: Per a July report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. economy created just 73,000 jobs in July, down from the 111,000 monthly average of earlier this year.\nThe report also significantly lowered previous estimates for May and June job creation. Many employees are pumping the brakes on hiring as inflation rises and President Trump’s tariffs continue to throw the market into periods of major flux.\nOn top of these trends, the increasing utility of AI technology is changing how some organizations are structured, and even threatening some occupations with replacement. Korn Ferry cites all of these factors as contributing toward the growing prevalence of job hugging.","content_hash":"d08be583bcf97c65d2c154b1837f8a77","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2743,"method_rank":0}

As of noon ET, the cryptocurrency had fallen 7.8% over the past 24 hours of trading. Over the same period, Bitcoin and Ethereum had fallen 1.8% and 4.8%, respectively.\nAlong with the broader market, Dogecoin is losing ground today as investors weigh valuation concerns following gains in recent months and the possibility that the Federal Reserve will wind up pushing out its schedule for interest-rate reductions. As of this writing, Dogecoin is now down roughly 3% over the last week of trading.\nIs Dogecoin a buy right now?\nDespite some recent pullbacks recently, the broader crypto market has enjoyed strong bullish momentum this summer. Gains have come from the passage and legislative advancement of crypto-related legislation and moves from the Trump administration to support the crypto industry. Dogecoin is still up 22% since the beginning of June, even though its token price is down roughly 14% from its high mark across the stretch.\nDogecoin is the market's leading meme coin and has achieved impressive levels of adoption and longevity, despite having little in the way of a fundamental-valuation case. With indications that the crypto industry will continue to see strong support under the current presidential administration, there's a good chance that new bullish catalysts for Dogecoin and the broader cryptocurrency space will continue to roll out over the next several years.\nOn the other hand, there's a possibility that higher levels of inflation will make it harder for the Fed to cut rates. If so, that could hurt crypto valuations.\nFor long-term crypto investors, continuing to buy Dogecoin and other preferred tokens on pullbacks could be the right move. However, investors who are concerned about the potential for significant downside volatility through the rest of the year may want to hold off right now or only back the safest tokens with the strongest fundamental-valuation cases.\nShould you buy stock in Dogecoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Dogecoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Dogecoin wasn’t one of them.

But eventually, you'll need to tap those funds -- even if you don't need the money just yet -- thanks to something called required minimum distributions (RMDs), which ensure the IRS eventually gets a cut of those tax-advantaged dollars.\nRMDs are mandatory withdrawals from retirement accounts that currently begin at age 73. However, the starting age is slated to increase to 75 in 2033 under the rules of the Secure Act 2.0, which passed in late 2022.\nIf you have modest savings, mandatory distributions may not be such a big deal because you're probably making withdrawals by the time you reach RMD age. But for those with substantial retirement assets, RMDs can result in a big tax bill.\nThe rules surrounding RMDs are complex and changed significantly under both the original SECURE Act (passed in 2019) and the Secure Act 2.0. Here are three new rules that took effect in 2024 that every retiree needs to know.\n1. RMDs are no longer required for any Roth account\nUnlike traditional retirement accounts that are funded pre-tax and taxed upon withdrawal, Roth accounts don't offer an up-front tax break. Instead, you make your contributions with money that's already been taxed and then get potentially tax-free income in retirement.\nBut before 2024, only Roth IRAs were exempt from RMDs. You still had to take RMDs -- and pay the resulting tax bill -- for accounts including Roth 401(k)s and Roth 403(b)s, even though you'd already paid taxes on the money you contributed.\nThat all changed last year, though. For 2024 and subsequent tax years, Roth accounts are no longer subject to RMDs. You can let your money grow indefinitely in a Roth account for your entire lifetime, making them an effective tool for passing down wealth to heirs.\n2. The penalties for not taking RMDs is reduced\nMissed your RMD deadline? In the past, you were penalized by a jaw-dropping 50% of the amount you should have taken.\nFortunately, the Secure Act 2.0 softened the rules a bit. As of 2024, the penalty is reduced to 25% of the RMD. If you can show that you took quick action to correct your mistake, the penalty drops to 10%. Technically, this change took effect in 2023, but it applies to tax returns filed in 2024 and subsequent years.","content_hash":"3f03761f45c66b7169f1e4aef09d7cff","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2718,"method_rank":0}

This figure updates HMRC's previous estimate of 2,700,000 taxpayers.\nAccording to HMRC, 2,353,000 (81%) of those expected to be subject to MTD for income tax are self-employed, including 313,000 who also earn income from property.\nOf the 563,000 in-scope taxpayers who are landlords without self-employment income, 47% (263,000) are projected to join in April 2028, indicating a slower integration for landlords compared to self-employed individuals.\nWhile a majority of in-scope taxpayers are represented by an agent (1,900,000; 65%), a significant portion (1,018,000; 35%) are unrepresented.\nAdditionally, most unrepresented in-scope taxpayers do not use commercial software for filing their tax returns (840,000; 83%). It remains uncertain how many of those using software for filing also utilise it for record-keeping.","content_hash":"0f8459c73145bba50b97a9153a1c756b","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2717,"method_rank":0}

That difference has since plunged to the narrowest since 2005.

If that happens, it would be the first time since the two yields have traded in line since 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nThe narrowing spread shows the long-standing demarcation between the “risky” periphery and “safe” core has become increasingly blurred.\nFor years, Italian bonds offered a juicy pick-up to peers because investors demanded higher compensation for a tumultuous political backdrop and mountain of government debt. But Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has ushered in an era of stability in Rome and efforts to consolidate debt are underway.\nIn contrast, French debt was swept up in a rout last year after President Emmanuel Macron’s snap elections threw a spotlight on the country’s large fiscal deficit. While the bonds have since partly recovered, yields have settled at a higher level relative to peers than in the past.\nThe move came as European bonds rose on Monday, paring a selloff from last week. Yields on 30-year German bonds fell as much as six basis points to 3.29%, while yields on the two-year tenor fell as much as two basis points to 1.96%.\nItaly’s spread to other European nations, notably Germany, has long been an obsession for Meloni, guiding her decision-making on a wide range of issues, including banking and defense. Her approach has been shaped by the experience of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi in 2011, who was ousted after spreads spiraled during the European sovereign debt crisis.\nMeloni now guides Italy’s fourth-longest government since it became a republic, adding to a sense of stability that previous governments had difficulty projecting. Though growth remains sclerotic and is seen below 1% of output in 2025, investors have placed a big premium on her perceived ability to govern with a sizable and stable majority.","content_hash":"46b2c12bfade804f22d1d5fb4a17be76","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2713,"method_rank":0}

They think it’s a technology problem when it’s really a human and technology problem,” Gary Eimerman, chief learning officer at Multiverse, said in a statement. “Without a deliberate focus on capabilities like analytical reasoning and creativity, as well as culture and behaviors, AI projects will never deliver up to their potential.”\nMultiverse researchers identified the skillsets by conducting qualitative and observational studies with AI “power users,” as well as insights from upskilling workers in AI use. The 13 human skills “sit alongside technical skills such as prompt engineering, AI model evaluation and AI process modeling” as upskilling priorities, according to the report.\nOverall, the 13 skills fall into four overarching categories — cognitive skills, AI responsibility, self-management skills and communication — that help workers effectively implement AI. Put together, the skillsets allow employees to reason, make decisions, seek feedback and ethically use technology to achieve desired objectives.\nDuring the research, for instance, principles related to ethical oversight, output verification and creative experimentation were significant differentiators for AI power users. Upskilling in these areas can help workers move from passive AI use to active innovation, the report found.\nWorkplace AI use can come with tradeoffs, both enhancing employee ideas but also reducing diversity of thought and the benefits of brainstorming activities, according to a study from the University of Pennsylvania. Human skills remain critical, the researchers said, and employers could face setbacks by not taking that into account.\nIn fact, 3 in 5 employers say soft skills are more important today than five years ago, according to a TestGorilla report. Using a holistic approach to evaluate job candidates — including their skills, values, personality and cultural fit — leads to better results in the hiring process, most employers said.","content_hash":"895af7e05894ebda459447ef22ed6246","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2707,"method_rank":0}

Moreover, over a quarter of SMEs (26.7%) cited that they were extremely comfortable with this.\nHow comfortable are you\/would you be for an AI tool to do the following? 2025\nMeanwhile, Meshed has raised £950,000 ($1.3m) in an oversubscribed pre-seed funding round to transform the commercial insurance market for SMEs. Investors included Haatch, Aviva via Founders Factory, the Exponential Science Foundation, and several angel backers. Meshed highlights that around 80% of UK SMEs remain underinsured, largely due to outdated brokerage practices and inefficient manual processes. By deploying AI-powered agents for quoting, data collection, and other routine tasks, the firm aims to cut administrative costs, reduce premiums, and enable brokers to focus more on client relationships and specialist advice.\nYet, findings from our 2025 UK Commercial Insurance Broker Survey indicate that brokers may be underestimating the scale of disruption that AI could bring. Only 5.2% of brokers see AI as the biggest threat to their business, compared with 13.2% citing competition from other brokers and 11.2% from direct players. Moreover, adoption remains limited, with just 5.9% of brokers using AI-driven policy recommendation tools, while 78.6% report no plans to adopt them.\nBrokers should recognize that while AI may not seem like the greatest threat today, failing to adopt it could make it one tomorrow.

The Palo Alto, California-based platform offers an online marketplace for global freelance talent, underpinned by AI, according to its website.\nFor its second quarter, Upwork reported a 47% year-over-year rise in net income to reach $32.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, as well as recording record revenue of about $195 million — a 1% YoY rise. Adjusted EBIDTA, meanwhile, jumped by 40% YoY to reach $57.1 million, according to its Q2 earnings results released Aug. 7.\nStrong growth in AI-related services helped drive these results, a factor that was also enabled by several strategic acquisitions in recent years. The company has made four acquisitions during the past three years. Integrating technologies from those acquisitions into its AI tools drove “some of the great growth that we've been able to show in Q2,” Gessert said.\nAs part of its Q2 results, Upwork announced its acquisition of workforce management company Bubty, as well as a plan to acquire Ascen, a “digitally native solution for contingent W-2 workers,” according to its earnings release. The moves follow the acquisitions of Objective AI in 2024 and Headroom, an AI-powered video conferencing platform, in 2023, according to company documents.\nHowever, an important factor of Upwork’s M&A strategy is “we would not have had the flexibility or optionality to do this … without worrying about accessing the capital markets, had we not made this big push to increase profitability [and] cash flow,” Gessert said.\nManaging the integration piece\nCFOs play a critical role in hitting the right balance between profitability and growth: it’s the job of the finance chief to remind the rest of the business that “profitability gives the business optionality for growth, and that's what it's done for us,” Gessert said. For its Q2, the company reported an 85% jump in free cash flow to reach $65.6 million, according to its earnings report.\nGessert joined Upwork in April 2023 after an eight-year tenure at PayPal, where she served in a number of roles, including a three-year span as its senior vice president, finance and analytics, according to her LinkedIn profile. Her past roles also include a six-year career at telecommunications provider Sprint, where she served in positions including VP, finance operations, postpaid marketing and CFO, Sprint Prepaid.","content_hash":"aaabdb5f5bab156520c9b4f04798a2d6","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2690,"method_rank":0}

That’s somewhat different from the growth we had anticipated at the beginning of the year,” he said.\nRevenue for the quarter ended June 30 was 116 billion yuan ($16.16 billion), beating the 114.7 billion yuan average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by LSEG.\nAdjusted net profit rose 75.4% year-on-year to 10.8 billion yuan, exceeding the average estimate of 10.1 billion yuan, according to LSEG data.\nThe world's third-largest smartphone maker became the bestselling smartphone brand in Southeast Asia in the second quarter and took second place by shipments in Europe, it said.\nGlobally, it was ranked third, with a market share of 14.7%, the company said, citing data from researcher Canalys.\nXiaomi's second-quarter global smartphone shipments rose 0.6% from a year earlier to 42.4 million handsets. However, its smartphone revenue decreased 2.1% to 45.5 billion yuan due to a lower average selling price.\nIts loss-making EV business generated 20.6 billion yuan in revenue during the second quarter, up from 18.1 billion during the first quarter. It delivered 81,302 EVs in the June quarter, compared with deliveries of 75,869 SU7 cars in January-March.\nIts second EV model YU7 was launched in late June, with the deliveries only beginning last month, meaning it has yet to be reflected in results.\nTogether with AI and other new initiatives, EVs delivered a total net loss of 0.3 billion yuan in the June quarter, narrowing from a loss of 0.5 billion in the first quarter.\nLu said that Xiaomi is confident it will achieve monthly or quarterly profit in its EV business in the second half, but cumulative losses remain significant after a more than 30 billion yuan investment in research and development.\nXiaomi has sold a total of 300,000 EVs as of July since launching its EV business in March 2024.\nLu also said Xiaomi is developing the next iteration of its self-developed mobile chip XRINGO1.\nHong Kong-listed shares in Xiaomi, which also makes home appliances, closed down 1.2% at 52.4 Hong Kong dollars.

The Trump administration’s goal to transform “the US into the crypto capital of the world.”\nUnder President Donald Trump, the US government has rubberstamped new stablecoin rules into law with more crypto bills waiting in the wings, appointed industry-allies into key government positions, seen regulators halt actions against crypto companies, and paved the path towards integrating blockchain projects with traditional finance.\nThe Federal Reserve is also widely expected to cut interest rates in September, which is seen as a boon to crypto markets as lower rates tend to intensify investor appetite for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies.\nBernstein’s optimism also comes as Bitcoin surged to a new record trading at over $124,000 on last week. Altcoins like XRP and BNB also notched new records recently while Ethereum has edged towards all-time highs.\nRobinhood\nBernstein gave Robinhood stock the sharpest upgrade with its price target raised to $160.

(NYSE:HD) will release earnings results for the second quarter, before the opening bell on Tuesday, Aug. 19.\nAnalysts expect the home improvement retailer to report quarterly earnings at $4.69 per share, up from $4.60 per share in the year-ago period. Home Depot projects to report quarterly revenue of $45.31 billion. Compare that to the $43.17 billion it generated last year during the second quarter, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nWith the recent buzz around Home Depot, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Currently, it offers an annual dividend yield of 2.30%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of $2.30 per share ($9.20 a year).\nSo, how can investors capitalize on its dividend yield to earn a regular $500 monthly?\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $260,396 or around 652 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $51,919 or around 130 shares.\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($9.20 in this case). So, $6,000 \/ $9.20 = 652 ($500 per month), and $1,200 \/ $9.20 = 130 shares ($100 per month).\nNote that the dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as both the dividend payment and the stock price fluctuate over time.\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2\/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2\/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2\/$40).\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price remains unchanged. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\nHD Price Action: Shares of Home Depot fell 0.2% to close at $399.38 on Friday.\nOn Wednesday, Truist Securities analyst Scot Ciccarelli maintained Home Depot with a Buy and raised the price target from $417 to $433, while Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman maintained the stock with an Outperform rating and maintained a $455 price target.\nRead More:\n-\nWall Street’s Most Accurate Analysts Give Their Take On 3 Energy Stocks With Over 8% Dividend Yields\nImage: Shutterstock\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

This mode ensures that every decision is informed by precise measurements.\nAlternatively, the unsupervised mode caters to operators seeking to automate processes for repeatability.\nThe automate mode allows the system to implement a set of pre-defined decisions based on real-time data, reducing overhead and increasing operational speed while maintaining consistency at scale without human intervention.\nSeismos CEO Panos Adamopoulos said: “Seismos is the innovator who introduced the concept of 'Closed Loop Fracturing', and we are leading the market with the only patented, transparent, fully vetted technology that is years ahead of the copycats.\n“True closed loop frac operations are built on the unbiased audit of frac performance, a capability only Seismos provides.

It has more than 370 locations in the United States and Canada serving 40,000 professional customers.\nThe acquisition is part of Lowe's move to provide more options for professional builders. The Mooresville, North Carolina-based company recently closed on its $1.3 billion acquisition of Artisan Design Group, a provider of design, distribution and installation services for interior surface finishes, including flooring, cabinets and countertops, to home builders and property managers.\nRival Home Depot has been making similar moves.

SRS provides materials for professionals like roofers, landscapers and pool contractors.\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said that the professional builder market provides a growth opportunity to both Home Depot and Lowe's as there's a lot of spending in the segment.\n“Pro is basically the new battleground for home improvement,” he said. “Naturally, with two big giants in the arena, there are likely to be some bruising battles ahead. However, at this stage, we believe the market is big enough and fragmented enough to allow both players to extract some wins.”\nLowe's deal for FBM is expected to close in the fourth quarter.\nAside from the acquisition, Lowe's reported its fiscal second-quarter financial results on Wednesday.

Much of the funding has not yet been dispersed.\nAside from Intel, memory chipmaker Micron is the biggest U.S. recipient of CHIPS Act cash. TSMC declined comment. Micron, Samsung and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed on Tuesday that Lutnick was working on a deal with Intel to take a 10% government stake. \"The president wants to put America's needs first, both from a national security and economic perspective, and it's a creative idea that has never been done before,\" she told reporters.\nWhile Lutnick said earlier on CNBC that the U.S. does not want to tell Intel how to run its operations, any investment would be unprecedented and ramps up a new era of U.S. influence on the big companies. In the past, the U.S. has taken stakes in companies to provide cash and build confidence in times of economic upheaval and uncertainty.\nIn a similar move earlier this year, Trump approved Nippon Steel's purchase of U.S. Steel after being promised a \"golden share\" that would prevent the companies from reducing or delaying promised investments, transferring production or jobs outside the U.S., or closing or idling plants before certain time frames, without the president's consent.\nThe two sources said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is also involved in the CHIPS Act discussions, but that Lutnick is driving the process. The Commerce Department oversees the $52.7 billion CHIPS Act, formally known as the CHIPS and Science Act. The act provides funding for research and grants for building chip plants in the U.S.\nLutnick has been pushing the equity idea, the sources said, adding that Trump likes the idea.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department late last year finalized subsidies of $4.75 billion for Samsung, $6.2 billion for Micron and $6.6 billion for TSMC to produce semiconductors in the U.S.\nIn June, Lutnick said the department was re-negotiating some of former President Joe Biden's grants to semiconductor firms, calling them \"overly generous\".

The company is a speculative bet on small-scale nuclear power. The stock had been rising, but NuScale shares dropped 37% from July 25 to Aug. 19. What's going on?\nThe double whammy\nIt appears that NuScale is the victim of a pair of negative catalysts that hit in rapid succession: news of a big insider stock sale and a tepid quarterly report.\nOn July 31, construction and engineering company Fluor Enterprises (NYSE: FLR) -- NuScale's largest shareholder -- entered into an agreement to exchange 15 million Class B shares of NuScale stock for 15 million Class A shares. The transaction took place on Aug. 12. That agreement allows Fluor to sell the shares starting on Sept. 11, subject to some daily limitations.\nExisting NuScale shareholders were justifiably concerned that such a massive stock sale would dilute the value of their shares, so some probably decided to sell before the lock-up period expires and a flood of new shares on the market brings the share price down.\nThen, on Aug. 7, NuScale reported its Q2 results, which featured lower-than-expected revenue of $8.1 million and a net loss of $0.13 per share. The company's stock dropped another 12% in response, and has only slid further since. Even so, shares are still up 82% year to date as of market close Aug. 19, crushing the S&P 500's approximately 10% gain.\nA risky bet\nNuScale's SMRs are still in the development phase. In its Q2 earnings presentation, management reiterated that it's hoping to get \"a firm order by the end of 2025\" for a reactor, which it would still then need to build. In the meantime, it remains a risky, speculative investment.\nFluor's impending sale of NuScale stock could cause the price to drop further, so interested investors will probably want to wait before buying in.\nDo the experts think NuScale Power is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

Many also cited rising prices, a lack of savings and economic concerns as key roadblocks to their financial security.\nHow To Become Rich: 9 Fastest Ways, According To Experts\nFor You: 10 Unreliable SUVs To Stay Away From Buying\nWhile you can’t control the economy, you can learn and apply valuable money lessons that make your financial situation less stressful. In a recent YouTube video, personal finance expert Jaspreet Singh discussed three important concepts that can help you build so much wealth that your money worries will disappear.\nCash Is King, but Cash Flow Is Queen\nSingh explained that many people don’t consider the concept of assets and liabilities when it comes to spending their cash. Many purchases, from cars and homes to jewelry and vacations, make you look wealthy, but they’re actually liabilities that take cash from you and make it harder to become rich.\nFor example, your home provides a place to live and may even increase in value, but you’ll need to give cash for the mortgage payment, utilities, repairs and various other ongoing costs. Plus, to make a profit from your home, you would need to sell it, which also involves expenses.\nSingh explained that assets are different and regularly provide you with cash flow. He included examples like rental properties, businesses and dividend-paying stocks. While choosing these assets may require sacrifice at first, the money generated can help you live the life you want, build wealth and cover your liabilities with less stress.\n“A simple rule of thumb to help you get started with this is for every dollar that you earn, the maximum that you can spend on these liabilities is three quarters,” Singh added. “Take one quarter and spend that quarter on buying assets and saving money.”\nExplore More: Are You Rich or Middle Class? 8 Ways To Tell That Go Beyond Your Paycheck\nDon’t Spend Tomorrow’s Income Today\nMany people use debt for everyday purchases without considering that they’ll have to pay interest and hand over future income to the lender. Singh explained that it’s especially problematic when you finance money-draining liabilities, like cars. As of June 2025, Equifax reported that Americans owed $1.68 trillion in auto leases and loans alone.\nSingh described how all your debt payments can add up and become a monthly cycle that is hard to escape. At the same time, you’re only helping other people profit from your struggles. Breaking free will require sacrifice and reconsidering how you buy and finance things.","content_hash":"92895d7a6dc19399dcd3643f414ef292","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2646,"method_rank":0}

There’s another mistake that Kyle Wurtzel, a partner and private wealth advisor at Northwestern Mutual, has seen play out countless times with clients: They think retirement will be way cheaper than it actually is.\nFind Out: I’m a Financial Expert: This is the No. 1 Mistake Americans Make With Their Roth IRAs\nRead Next: How Much Money Is Needed To Be Considered Middle Class in Your State?\n“One of the biggest mistakes I see middle-class retirees make is assuming their spending will significantly decrease in retirement,” Wurtzel explained. “While it’s easy to believe expenses will drop dramatically, the reality is they often stay the same or even increase.”\nWhy Retirement Expenses Don’t Disappear Like You Think\nIt makes sense to think this way. No more commuting costs, work clothes or daily lunch expenses. But Wurtzel said other costs quickly fill that gap.\n“Travel, healthcare, supporting adult children or grandchildren and simply having more free time to spend can all stretch a budget,” he said. “If your retirement plan doesn’t account for that, you may find your savings falling short faster than expected.”\nThe numbers prove his point. According to Northwestern Mutual’s 2025 Planning & Progress Study, Americans believe they need $1.26 million to retire comfortably in 2025. Very few middle-class retirees are actually planning to hit that target.\nLearn More: 4 Retirement Expenses Boomers Didn’t Plan for — but Should Have\nWhat To Do Instead of Wishful Thinking\nWurtzel’s solution is simple. Get realistic about your actual retirement lifestyle, not your hoped-for budget cuts.\n“Instead of underestimating your future expenses, build a retirement plan based on your actual lifestyle goals,” he advised. “That means accounting for inflation, long-term care and how you want to spend your time, not just how you hope to save money. The more realistic your outlook, the more secure your retirement can be.”\nThe Other Mistakes Middle-Class Retirees Make\nThinking retirement will be cheaper isn’t the only mistake that can cost middle-class retirees.\nGoing It Alone Too Long\nThe second major error Wurtzel sees is people waiting too long to get professional help. Some people also think they don’t need an advisor once they retire.\n“Another common mistake we see is waiting too long to start working with a financial advisor or assuming you no longer need one once you’ve reached retirement,” he said.\nRetirement planning is way more complicated than just saving money. Wurtzel said it involves balancing multiple moving parts that most people have never dealt with before.","content_hash":"c1104a82ee664dd4f79fc64701ed4d9a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2644,"method_rank":0}

The drop comes as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) lost 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) dropped 1%.\nPalantir, the AI pioneer, was the target of a short report from Citron Research, one of the most prominent short sellers on the market.\nCitron says Palantir's valuation is irrational\nCitron cited the most recent valuation of OpenAI, which on Friday was confirmed to be raising another $6 billion in funds at a $500 billion valuation, as proof that Palantir's stock is overvalued.\nThe short seller points out that this $500 billion valuation puts OpenAI's price-to-sales (P\/S) at roughly 17x. If you apply the same P\/S to Palantir, the stock would trade at just $40, a steep drop from today's $162 per share.\nCitron went on to say that at this P\/S of just shy of 17, OpenAI \"has the highest multiple of any scaled SaaS stock in the world,\" and that this multiple \"in itself is extreme,\" meaning that for Palantir, even at $40 a share, it would still be an incredibly expensive stock.\nInvestor beware\nWhile short reports should always be taken with a heavy grain of salt (after all, the company profits off of a drop in Palantir's stock price), I have to agree with Citron's evaluation -- and have been saying so for some time now.\nThe scale and pace of OpenAI's growth and the potential it has to transform the entire economy far outweigh that of Palantir. Yet its stock carries a P\/S almost 7.5 times higher than OpenAI's (if it were publicly traded).\nI would note that there is one major caveat: Palantir is profitable, something that OpenAI decidedly is not (it is burning cash at an incredible pace).

With similar increases likely in major markets like the U.S. by year-end, Spotify is poised for a significant financial impact in 2026.\nThe price moves have prompted a positive revision from Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris, who raised his price forecast to $850, up from $800, and reaffirmed his Buy rating. Morris projects these hikes will continue to enhance Spotify’s long-term growth trajectory.\nAlso Read: Spotify Rallies As Price Increases, Apple App Win Fuel Investor Optimism\nMorris reiterated his bullish stance on Spotify after announcing another round of price hikes across several European markets. Late last week, Spotify raised subscription costs in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, with increases ranging from 8% to 22% depending on the plan. Morris estimated that these markets represent about 10% of Spotify’s premium subscriber base.\nThe updated pricing, 12.99 euros for Individual in Germany and Austria (up 18%) and 13.95 Swiss francs in Switzerland (up 8%), along with similar hikes for Duo, Family, and Student plans, mirrors prior adjustments in the U.S. and other regions where Spotify has expanded its offering beyond music.\nAccording to Morris, these increases will be gross margin accretive, since a significant portion of the higher price is attributed to non-music services such as audiobooks and video podcasts, which lowers Spotify’s royalty obligations to music rights holders.\nEarlier this month, Spotify lifted prices in various emerging and secondary markets. Those adjustments, which followed the company’s earnings release, largely impacted regions excluded from the sweeping third-quarter 2023 price cycle.\nCombined, Morris estimated that the recent increases now cover about 25% of Spotify’s global premium subscriber base, which was not already affected by last year’s hikes.\nHe further projected that Spotify will introduce another round of pricing changes in its largest markets, including the U.S., before the end of 2025, with the financial impact to materialize in early 2026.\nConsidering industry dynamics, Morris highlighted that recent licensing agreements likely included increases in per-subscriber minimum fees.","content_hash":"0f57f02389a3baef268805cdcb162c37","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2640,"method_rank":0}

Investors are less keen to pay a premium for defense stocks when the risks of conflict seem to be declining, even if Europe’s long-term rearmament program holds.\nThat volatility, though, is precisely why most investors prefer U.S.-listed defense ETFs as a more stable way to tap the theme.\nAlso Read: AeroVironment Set For Growth As Drones Take Center Stage In Defense\nU.S. Defense ETFs Hold The Edge\nFunds such as the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (BATS:ITA), SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSE:XAR), and Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSE:PPA) provide exposure to U.S. contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corp (NYSE:NOC), and Rtx Corp (NYSE:RTX).\nSuch companies are insulated by the Pentagon’s persistently high budgets, multi-year contracts for procurement and strong export pipelines, all of which insulate them from the political whirlwind of peace talks (and failures) overseas.\nWhile European stocks had a good run earlier this year, U.S. defense ETFs have been steadier performers. ITA, for instance, has climbed more than 33%, while XAR and PPA are also higher by 28% and 26%, respectively, showing resilient defense spending and increased aerospace technology demand.\nA Long-Term Spending Tailwind\nExperts point out that international defense budgets will not meaningfully contract even if fighting in Ukraine or Gaza dries up. NATO partners remain pressured to hit or surpass spending levels, and American defense companies can gain from both domestic budgets and foreign military sales.\nEuropean defense is more likely to be vulnerable to political news, but the U.S. defense sector is supported by multi-decade procurement cycles. That provides U.S. ETFs with a degree of robustness that investors prefer.\nThis week’s slip in European defense stocks highlights the dangers of wagering too much on short-term conflict dynamics. For those looking for steady exposure to the industry, U.S.-listed defense ETFs continue to offer an attractive alternative — less volatile, better diversified, and securely tied to Washington’s defense spending commitments.","content_hash":"d26f3dba842d684b872add20a8794338","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2633,"method_rank":0}

The policy is part of a broader trade strategy targeting more than 90 U.S. trading partners.\nThe White House has stated that the latest round of tariffs is intended, in part, to encourage domestic manufacturing and job creation.\nFoxconn’s expansion strategy is intended to give Taiwanese manufacturers an alternative to shipping goods directly to the U.S., reducing exposure to tariff-related costs. The company’s proposed technology parks will prioritize development in Texas, with future projects under consideration in Mexico and other developing nations.\nIndustry experts say the tariff developments are prompting many global firms to reassess their supply chain strategies.\nMichelle Comerford, industrial and supply chain practice leader at Biggins Lacy Shapiro & Co., said the tariffs have intensified existing uncertainty in international manufacturing.\n“The tariff topic has already created a lot of uncertainty for companies with global supply chains for the past seven months, and will continue to do so as not all countries have reached new agreements with the U.S.,” Comerford said in a statement.\n“For U.S. manufacturers with domestic supply chains, this could create a competitive advantage — but for those reliant on imports, it adds cost pressures and more risks of disruption. We expect many firms will revisit sourcing strategies and accelerate plans for regionalized manufacturing footprints as a result.”\nBased in Princeton, New Jersey, Biggins Lacy Shapiro & Co. is one of the nation’s largest independent site selection and economic development consulting firms.\nComerford noted that while tariffs may incentivize domestic manufacturing, companies must first undertake comprehensive planning.\n“The very first, and arguably most important step when a company decides to consider a U.S. manufacturing facility is to spend time defining the operational requirements of the proposed new facility,” Comerford told FreightWaves in an interview. “It’s really important to understand what you want this facility to do in order to evaluate locations appropriately.”","content_hash":"89fb2613f1210ef401ae555f2d72e9a3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2632,"method_rank":0}

Scaramucci has previously criticized companies that have adopted Strategy’s tactic of issuing debt to buy BTC for their corporate reserves.\nCompanies Using Debt to Buy BTC Could ‘Hurt Bitcoin’: Anthony Scaramucci\nHe argued that JPMorgan will choose to buy their Bitcoin via BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF, saying “it's a very secure asset that people trust,” calling it the \"purest link to Bitcoin.” This is currently the world's largest BTC fund as of writing.\nScaramucci isn’t alone in issuing bullish end-of-year predictions. Earlier this week, institutional investor VanEck made a comparable prediction of Bitcoin hitting $180,000 by year-end.\nStablecoins in, CBDCs out\nScaramucci expressed a fairly bullish view about stablecoins, saying they will “bring a wave of technological innovation,” pointing to how they may allow users to avoid credit card fees and some of the other third-party fees which have historically been charged in the payments space.\nHowever, he was less optimistic about the prospects of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).\nScaramucci said he thinks CBDCs would be “too intrusive” from a privacy perspective, adding that he prefers dollar-based stablecoins. This is a view shared by his former boss, U.S. President Donald Trump.","content_hash":"e1aac145b2ba8697e9ddaf1804f0202c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2629,"method_rank":0}

At 29, she was earning around $70,000 a year as a software engineer and had already invested $100,000, according to her YouTube channel. No secret inheritance. No viral side gig. Just quiet, steady progress.\nThe problem is that most people still believe that you need six figures to succeed.

That’s what everyone around her was doing. She even enrolled in a local finance course to learn more about mortgages.\nHowever, she discovered she didn’t have to follow everyone else’s lead. One day, she started playing with a retirement calculator just out of curiosity. She adjusted her retirement age to see how her savings needs shifted with her goals. So, she dropped it from 65 to 60 and then 55. The only thing she had to do was save just a little bit more.\nThat single shift flipped a switch. She could retire much sooner if she could increase her savings now. That’s when she began to think about freedom instead of square footage.\nTrending Now: I’m a Self-Made Millionaire: 6 Steps I Took To Become Rich on an Average Salary\nPick One Financial Priority and Stick With It\nMost people attempt to pursue everything at once. Debt repayment, home savings, investments and travel quickly mount up. That wasn’t what Kinoshita did. She narrowed her focus to just one objective: increasing her investment portfolio.\nShe quickly assessed her financial situation before making a big commitment. Emergency fund? Completed. Insurance? Managed. She also had no outstanding high-interest debt, which allowed her to relax and concentrate.\nBut numbers weren’t the only consideration in this choice. It was more like a change in perspective. She stopped being concerned about what her peers were up to. She was no longer drawn to purchasing homes, improving lifestyles or pursuing “grown-up” milestones.\nShe knew her priorities and lived by one mantra: “You can have anything, but not everything.”\nRethink the Big Three\nKinoshita didn’t skip coffee or waste time clipping coupons. Yes, that stuff adds up, but not in the same way as groceries, rent or auto payments. That’s where she began.\nRent: She had a roommate.

He revealed that US tariffs had carved a staggering ¥1.4 trillion — nearly US$9.5 billion — off the company’s full-year operating profit. That figure, part of a 16% downward revision to ¥3.2 trillion, marked the sharpest tariff-related impact estimate yet from any global automaker, according to Reuters.\nThe announcement followed a July 22 decision by US President Donald Trump to lower tariffs on Japan-made vehicle imports from 25% to 15%, with a similar rollback for South Korean-made vehicles announced just before the August 1 deadline.\nIndustry observers welcomed the move as a reprieve from potentially harsher trade penalties. But relief was tempered by realism.\n“I’d hesitate to call it good news. A 15% US import tariff is still significantly higher than where Japan started — and higher than most had expected,” said Stefan Angrick, head of Japan and Frontier Market Economics at Moody’s Analytics, according to CNBC.com.\nAsian automakers, including Hyundai, are experiencing “unprecedented” profit erosion in Q2 2025, even as US sales show modest gains. Hyundai reported a 22% drop in net profit, absorbing a ₩828 billion (US$604 million) tariff hit, according to the Financial Times.\nMitsubishi Motors saw its net profit nearly wiped out, falling from ¥29.5 billion ($201 million) a year earlier to just ¥14.4 billion, largely due to tariffs and increased incentive costs. Sales also dipped 3% to ¥609 billion, the FT reported.\nFitch Ratings warned on August 15 that US auto tariffs continue to weigh heavily on the financial health of Japanese and Korean automakers. While Japan’s direct exports to the US are relatively limited, Korean manufacturers are more exposed to the new 15% tariff rate. Both countries, however, remain vulnerable to tariff risks tied to other export hubs — particularly Mexico and Canada — where trade terms are still unsettled. Fitch also noted that the long-term impact on component and raw material costs remains unclear.\nSo far, Japanese and Korean carmakers have been reluctant to pass tariff-related costs directly to US consumers. Fitch expects them to prioritise internal cost-cutting measures, though gradual price increases are likely, especially if competitors follow suit. The extent to which these companies can shift costs to buyers will play a key role in determining how much financial strain they face.","content_hash":"405b6b4c149c3d4a6398474a9667776e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2613,"method_rank":0}

The cryptocurrency's token price had fallen 2.2% over the past 24 hours of trading as of 3 p.m. ET. Bitcoin's token price had fallen 0.8% over the same stretch.\nThe cryptocurrency market hit its highest-ever valuation level last week, and Ethereum reached its highest token price in four years. Investors are selling to take profits following the recent rally and looking at some potential risk factors that could disrupt bullish momentum.\nEthereum pulls back from recent highs\nEthereum and other cryptocurrencies surged last week after President Trump signed an executive order that allows for crypto tokens and other nontraditional assets to be included in 401(k) accounts. The development suggested a significant new buying catalyst for the crypto market, but some investors are now repositioning on the heels of the rally.\nExpectations that the Federal Reserve will serve up multiple interest rate cuts this year have helped fuel strong bullish momentum for cryptocurrency valuations, but the Producer Price Index (PPI) report published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) last week arrived with higher-than-anticipated inflation. The Fed is still expected to issue a rate cut at its meeting next month, but July's PPI data is causing some jitters in the market.\nWhat's next for Ethereum?\nThe Trump administration's support for the crypto industry will likely continue to be a positive catalyst for Ethereum and other crypto tokens. Along with the Genius Act stablecoin legislation that was passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump last month, the House of Representatives also passed the Clarity Act -- which establishes regulatory frameworks for the broader crypto market. The Clarity Act is now awaiting discussion and a vote in the Senate, and it seems to have a solid chance of passing.\nWhile political dynamics appear to be favorable for Ethereum right now, there are still some big questions on the table. Developments on inflation and interest rates will continue to play key roles in shaping the token's valuation moves, and investors will be watching closely to see if the higher-than-expected PPI inflation shows up in other areas of the economy.","content_hash":"9a613c6498cf01d46b4457c1a5d3994c","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2612,"method_rank":0}

And while the devices themselves are certainly interesting, Google is also using its latest smartphones to flaunt its AI leadership role.\nYes, Google has been outfitting its Pixel phones with generative AI since its Pixel 7, but with Apple (AAPL) flailing as it tries to gain traction in the AI race and its next-generation Siri not expected until 2026, the search giant is pushing its Gemini AI as the marquee feature for the latest iteration of its smartphone line.\nGoogle isn’t just hyping Gemini in its smartphones, though. The company is also bringing the technology to its Pixel Watch.\nOf course, Google’s latest Pixel lineup is far from an existential threat to Apple’s iPhone. According to research firm Canalys, Apple’s iPhone made up 49% of US smartphone shipments in Q2. Samsung accounted for 31%, while Motorola had 12%. Google devices made up just 3% of shipments.\nBut Google’s AI capabilities should eventually find their way into Samsung’s smartphones, since Samsung runs on Google’s Android platform and the two collaborate on Samsung’s own smartphone AI.\nGoogle’s most impressive, and seemingly useful, offering as part of the new phone lineup is what the company calls Magic Cue. The feature surfaces information from different Google apps as users need them.\nSay your friend texts you to ask when your dinner reservations are. Magic Cue will pull the information from your Gmail and serve it up in a suggested reply. If you call your airline to ask about your upcoming flight, Magic Cue will display your travel information on screen so that you don’t have to search through different apps to locate it.\nThe Weather app can tell you personalized weather updates based on what Magic Cue sees in your Calendar, as well. If you save an upcoming trip to Yellowstone in your Calendar app and check the Weather app, it will tell you if it will rain during your trip and provide tips like how to keep your electronics dry and more.\nGoogle says Magic Cue won’t send information to the cloud and that data is saved in a secure enclave on your Pixel phone. Apps also don’t see the data Magic Cue pulls in unless you allow them to.\nGoogle has also added AI-powered real-time voice translation for phone calls, something that’s also coming to Apple’s iOS 26 this fall.","content_hash":"e695eac9c538143123c3fd271bb9b062","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2605,"method_rank":0}

Since then, home values have increased significantly, but the thresholds have not been adjusted for inflation.\nAs a result, more homeowners, particularly retirees and long-term owners, are exceeding the exemption limits and facing tax bills that were once rare. This has reignited debate over the fairness of the policy.\nUnderstanding how capital gains tax is calculated — and how it may affect your finances and the broader market — is essential.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it\nUnderstanding home equity taxes\nIf you own assets like property, stocks, or cryptocurrency, you’re likely familiar with how capital gains taxes work. But homeowners who have lived in their primary residence for at least two of the last five years before selling receive a special tax break.\nThis break applies to the profit from the sale — not the full sale price. For example, if you and your partner bought a home for $250,000 and later sold it for $750,000, your capital gain would be $500,000. As a married couple filing jointly, that entire amount would be excluded from capital gains tax under current IRS rules. That’s a whopping 200% gain, completely tax-free.\nGiven that the median U.S. home sale price is $410,800, according to data from the Federal Reserve, many middle-class homeowners still fall under the exemption limits. However, the sharp rise in home prices over the past 30 years means more owners are now exceeding those limits and facing unexpected tax bills.\nAccording to data from Realtor.com, home values have increased approximately 260% since 1997 — a trend that has particularly affected older homeowners who’ve held onto their properties for decades. In response, some lawmakers have proposed updating the exemption threshold.","content_hash":"5065a273348cb6bd13b6c5836f88c589","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2600,"method_rank":0}

Currently, multi-sector bond fund VGMS ranks as Vanguard’s costliest ETF with a 0.30% fee.\nJack Bogle-founded Vanguard — famed for its low-cost, index-tracking funds — has been mounting an offensive into the growing universe of actively managed ETFs. Investor demand has pushed assets in active ETFs to about 10% of the overall $12 trillion industry, compared to less than 5% a decade ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. While Vanguard currently manages rules-based active equity ETFs, the trio of funds would mark the firm’s first fundamental, stockpicking strategies to launch in the wrapper.\n“By combining Wellington’s active management expertise with the structural benefits of ETFs, we’re aiming to deliver low-cost, active, transparent, and tax-efficient solutions for today’s investors,” Ryan Barksdale, Vanguard’s head of active equity product, said in a statement.\nVDIG, VUSG and VUSV’s debut would bring Vanguard’s total ETF lineup to 100 funds, 17 of which would be actively managed. While the new funds would bump up Vanguard’s average expense ratio, all three are still well below the average fee of 0.76% for US-listed active equity ETFs, Bloomberg data show.\nVDIG will focus on large-cap, dividend-growing stocks in a low-turnover portfolio of about 25 holdings, according to Monday’s filing.

But that configuration is giving way to smaller, more uniform office sizes for lawyers as a way to save money, use space more efficiently and make space planning easier regardless of staffing changes such as lateral hires, promotions and attrition, it says.\nLaw firms are starting to put first- and second-year associates in cubicles, too, and turning corner offices into meeting spaces.\n“Traditional corner-office culture is declining,” the report says.\nIn the place of larger offices, law firms are trying to make office attendance more attractive by putting resources into social spaces and higher-end amenities.\n“A greater percentage of the project budget is being allocated to improving the quality of space,” the report says. “Creating a positive experience in the office and the overall well-being of their people remain top priorities for law offices.… Attracting and retaining talent, along with improving the workplace experience [are] key to their real estate goals.”\nHigher quality amenities can include an increased use of glass, better materials and finishes and more social spaces like cafes, collaboration areas and conference rooms with state-of-the-art audiovisual systems, the report says.\nFor the building operator who will oversee a law firm fit-out project, the report has some recommendations:\n-\nSecure the budget and do some scenario planning early in the process.\n-\nExplore structural procurement programs.\n-\nEvaluate the use of alternative materials and look for domestic sourcing.\n-\nPre-purchase materials and equipment to lock in pricing.\n-\nAdjust contract terms to balance risk-sharing.\nAmong major North American markets, law firm fit-outs are likely to be most expensive in San Francisco, where costs are estimated to be $351 to $584 per rentable square foot, and least expensive in Austin, Texas, where costs are expected to be between $228 and $380 per RSF.

Over the past year, housing prices in the U.S. rose by 4%, making it more difficult for those hoping to wait and buy a home a few years down the line.\nFind Out: I Asked ChatGPT If a Recession Is Coming Soon — Here’s What It Said\nRead Next: 7 Ways To Tell If You're Rich or Middle Class -- It's More Than Your Paycheck\nTo get a sense of what the market could look like in the not-so-distant future, I asked ChatGPT what the cost of affording a home would be in five years. The AI bot analyzed home price growth, mortgage interest rates, inflation, wages and affordability to come up with an estimate.\nChatGPT noted that the median home price today is around $420,000 and predicted it will rise to between $510,000 and $580,000 by 2030. It based its analysis on the assumption that home prices will grow 4% to 6% annually, inflation will average 2.5% to 3% and mortgage rates will remain within 5.5% to 7.5%.\nHearing that property prices may continue to rise until 2030 isn’t the greatest news for potential homebuyers. However, ChatGPT did offer some guidance that may lessen the blow of the price hike. Here are some tips to help lower your monthly payments and make a home more affordable.\nStart Saving Aggressively Now\nThe AI bot’s first piece of advice if you’re hoping to afford a home in 2030, you should “[s]ave for down payment + closing costs (~25% total). Take advantage of high-yield savings accounts or CDs.”\nSaving is an obvious but necessary tip. The more you have for a down payment, the less you’ll need to pay off over time.\nToday, high-yield savings accounts can yield returns of over 4% depending on the bank, while CDs can offer around the same depending on the term. Both options are safe investments that will help your money grow. However, while somewhat riskier, investing in stocks or index funds could amount to a higher return, such as 10%.\nExplore More: Barbara Corcoran: This Is the ‘Real Problem’ With the Housing Market Right Now\nBuild and Monitor Your Credit Score\nAnother piece of advice is to boost your credit score. Chat GPT said, “Aim for a score of 740+ for best mortgage rates. Avoid new debt and pay off credit cards monthly.”\nA high credit score is essential because it directly affects how much you’ll pay over time and whether the lender approves you for a mortgage. With a high credit score, the lender will see you as less of a risk to pay back what you owe. As a result, you’ll receive a lower interest rate and pay less each month.","content_hash":"8dbaee3475048d86954ac485b14d2e09","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2585,"method_rank":0}

The Silicon Valley company reported a net loss of $2.9 billion in its latest quarter. It is also downsizing and cutting back certain initiatives in an effort to position itself for growth in the artificial intelligence era.\nAs part of the investment, Softbank has agreed to pay $23 per share of Intel’s common stock, slightly discounted from its current share value on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions. Softbank is also collaborating with Foxconn to operate an AI server site in Ohio.\n“This strategic investment reflects our belief that advanced semiconductor manufacturing and supply will further expand in the United States, with Intel playing a critical role,” Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son said in a statement.\nThe deal would give Softbank a roughly 2% stake in Intel, making the investment holding firm Intel’s fifth largest stakeholder with 87 million shares. Blackrock and Vanguard are the largest, each holding a roughly 9% stake in the company, according to Yahoo! Finance.\n“Masa and I have worked closely together for decades, and I appreciate the confidence he has placed in Intel with this investment,” Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said in a statement.\nIn addition to Softbank, the Trump administration is interested in a potential 10% government stake in Intel following positive talks between the president and Tan, Bloomberg first reported. White House staff did not immediately return requests for comment.\nAfter calling for Tan’s resignation earlier this month over alleged ties to Chinese firms, Trump swiftly changed his tune, later posting on Truth Social that the executive’s “success and rise is an amazing story.”\nUnder Tan’s leadership, Intel is making deep cuts as part of an overall revamp. It plans to reduce its core workforce to 75,000 by the end of this year, down from 99,500 as of Dec. 28, 2024. The company is also slowing construction of its $28 billion chip facility in New Albany, Ohio, and scrapping manufacturing projects in Germany and Poland, among other actions.","content_hash":"6ef3169cde7b6cb95fa5b89a9df6e503","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2585,"method_rank":0}

(NYSE:WMT) will release earnings results for the second quarter, before the opening bell on Thursday, Aug. 21.\nAnalysts expect the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company to report quarterly earnings at 74 cents per share, up from 67 cents per share in the year-ago period. Walmart projects to report quarterly revenue at $174.32 billion, compared to $167.77 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nWith the recent buzz around Walmart, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. As of now, the retailer offers an annual dividend yield of 0.93%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 23 cents per share (94 cents a year).\nTo figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Walmart, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).\nNext, we take this amount and divide it by Walmart's 94-cent dividend: $6,000 \/ $0.94 = 6,383 shares.\nSo, an investor would need to own approximately $646,534 worth of Walmart, or 6,383 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.\nAssuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 \/ $0.94 = 1,277 shares, or $129,347 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\nThe dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.\nLet’s say a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50. Its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2\/$60).\nConversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2\/$40).\nFurther, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.\nWMT Price Action: Shares of Walmart rose by 0.6% to close at $101.29 on Tuesday.\nOn Monday, Guggenheim analyst John Heinbockel maintained a Buy rating on Walmart. He also raised the price target from $112 to $115.\nRead More:\nImage: Shutterstock\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

Even those only scratch the surface of how creative real estate investors can tap their equity.\nHome Equity Loan\nOften referred to as a second mortgage, home equity loans (HELs) let you take out a new mortgage loan. Technically these could be a first mortgage if you’ve already paid off your original mortgage loan.\nKimball noted that investors can use these loans to upgrade their homes. That could include adding an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). Homeowners could then rent out that extra unit to cover some or even all of their mortgage payments.\nAlternatively, investors could use the money as a down payment for a flip or rental property.\n“The interest rate is fixed, as is the monthly payment,” explained Michael Micheletti of home equity lender Unlock Technologies. “But it puts up your home as collateral, so if you can’t keep up with payments, you face foreclosure.”\nRead Next: Florida Home Prices Are Dropping Rapidly: Should You Buy While Prices Are Low?\nHome Equity Line of Credit\nUnlike HELs, which are fixed installment loans, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is rotating credit more similar to a credit card. Borrowers can draw on it as needed and pay it back at their own pace — at least until it enters the repayment phase of the loan.\nKimball pointed to the flexibility of HELOCs, the ability for investors to tap them or repay them as they like.\nThat flexibility could prove useful to flippers, for example, who might tap their HELOC to pull out a down payment for a flip and then pay the entire balance off as soon as they sell it. Rental investors could take a similar approach, funneling every spare dollar to pay off the HELOC balance. Then they could do it all over again to add another rental to their portfolio.\nThe current high interest rates could make HELOCs more attractive than refinancing. “Many homeowners right now have rates below 5% on their primary mortgage,” said Mason Whitehead of Churchill Mortgage. “For them to do a HELOC at 8% or 9% still carries a blended rate below what a new refinance mortgage rate would be.”\nJust beware that HELOC rates float with current interest rates. If interest rates rise, so too would your HELOC rate.","content_hash":"3754c27d38ba8b9a97f5605c6e84e3b2","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2573,"method_rank":0}

Economists have warned that the current system is holding back growth.\nImproving productivity will form a key plank of Ms Reeves’s second Budget and changes to the property tax system are expected to form part of these plans.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) have both called on Ms Reeves to scrap stamp duty on house sales, with the think tank branding the levy Britain’s “worst and most damaging tax”.\nExperts say the tax discourages people from moving, with a knock-on effect for the broader dynamism of the economy.\nSources said any changes would be designed to “protect revenue”, in a clear sign that taxes on higher-value properties will have to rise if the Chancellor does overhaul the system.\nProperty taxes including stamp duty are forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to raise £15.7bn this year, rising to £26.5bn by the end of the decade. Council tax is forecast to raise £50bn this year.\nThe desire to protect this tax income raises the prospect of the Chancellor introducing new council tax bands on the highest value properties in England, or a more radical recurring property tax on homes valued above a certain amount that could replace stamp and council tax.\nHowever, government sources vigorously denied a report in the Guardian that said the Treasury was examining proposals that would see sellers face a new “national tax” on houses worth more than £500,000 when they sell their home.\n“That’s definitely not going to happen,” said one source close to the Treasury.\nAnalysis of Land Registry data by Hamptons shows that 50pc of English home sales over £500,000 are currently in London, with a further 26pc in the South East.\nTreasury officials have pushed previous chancellors to replace stamp duty and council tax with an annual tax on property or land values.\nSuch a move would prompt a political backlash. Margaret Thatcher was forced to shelve a fixed tax to fund council services in the 1990s after Conservative plans for a poll tax sparked riots.","content_hash":"2f0467f8904af208d6cd6627a20255a1","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2569,"method_rank":0}

He pointed out that the US dollar is being undermined due to excessive borrowing and deficit spending, leading to currency debasement.\n“If you were neutral on everything and optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin,” Dalio stated.\nDon’t Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90\/share.\n-\n2,000 High Earners Manage $6B With This AI Platform — Book Your Private Demo\nDalio also emphasized the need for effective diversification in a portfolio, recommending allocating about 15% as a protective hedge.\nDuring the discussion, he clarified that although he has a preference for gold over Bitcoin, the real economic issue is the devaluation of fiat money, which is currently affecting markets and investors.\nWhile some financial experts advocate for a higher allocation towards crypto, Dalio’s balanced approach aligns with his brand.\nDalio’s recommendation comes at a time when the US is grappling with a burgeoning debt crisis.

But he warned that guidance for Q3 could be conservative, given uncertainty around US export licenses to China.\nStill, KeyBanc reiterated its Overweight rating and lifted its price target to $215 from $190, pointing to Nvidia's central role in the AI boom and supply-demand dynamics that remain firmly in its favor.\nNvidia's near-term growth story looks solid without China. Supply of Nvidia's Blackwell B200 GPU jumped 40% in Q2 and could rise another 20% in Q3, according to Vinh. Simultaneously, shipments of the more advanced Blackwell Ultra (B300) are ramping up, reinforcing Nvidia's dominance in AI chips.\nKeyBanc raised its full-year shipment forecast for Nvidia's rack-sale AI systems, known as GB200. The firm now expects 30,000 units to ship this year, up from 25,000 previously, citing stronger yields and improved supply-chain execution.\nFor now, KeyBanc assumes Nvidia will exclude China revenue from its guidance. That mirrors the approach of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which earlier this month left China out of its outlook amid the same regulatory uncertainty.\nThe Chinese impact on Nvidia is significant. KeyBanc raised its Q2 revenue estimate to $47.1 billion from $45.1 billion, above Wall Street’s consensus of $45.7 billion. It raised earnings per share to $1.05 from $0.99, slightly above consensus of $1.00.\nBut with Nvidia agreeing to pay 15% of Chinese chip sales to the US government, plus China's push for domestic AI chips, the company is likely to adopt a more conservative stance on its financial forecast.\nFor Q3, KeyBanc cut its revenue estimates to $50.4 billion from $53.5 billion, versus a consensus of $52.6 billion. EPS was clipped to $1.14 from $1.22, below the Street's consensus of $1.19. Longer term, KeyBanc trimmed fiscal 2026 forecasts on China risks, but boosted 2027 expectations on stronger rack shipments due to accelerating spending by hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG).\nWall Street remains bullish. Morgan Stanley recently called Nvidia the most undervalued megacap stock in the market. Its shares are up more than 30% year to date and over 35% in the past 12 months.","content_hash":"73b94365ec1ec743e17efe9f73ac075f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2566,"method_rank":0}

Thanks to a new partnership with pharma giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) , the creator of Ozempic and Wegovy, it might soon be the cheapest way to buy branded weight loss drugs too.\nOn Monday, the two firms announced a partnership which will allow patients with a prescription to get the branded medication for $499\/mo, so long as they're willing to pay out of pocket and present the GoodRx coupon at their local pharmacy.\nHow Does that Compare to Alternatives?\nAt $499\/mo the branded drug is only a little more expensive than compounded GLP-1 injectables sold by telehealth pharmacies, which have drawn the ire of pharmaceutical giants and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\nIt's also more expensive than the $349\/mo single-dose vial of Zepbound, the competing GLP-1 drug sold by competitor Eli Lilly (LLY) , which is also available through GoodRx.

The company has conducted a series of changes across its research & development (R&D) department, operating model, and plasma network. For example, the company closed 22 underperforming plasma centres in August 2025.\nCSL did not disclose the areas of the company from where the 15% reduction in employee base would be initiated. As of 2024, CSL employs 32,000 people globally.\nThe initiatives are expected to lead to savings of $500m-$550m progressively over the next three years, with the majority achieved by the end of the 2027 financial year. CSL said it would redirect the funds to “high priority opportunities”.\nWhile most of CSL’s revenue comes from its blood plasma treatments for rare illnesses, the pharma company is also one of the world’s largest influenza vaccine manufacturers. It supplies more than 130 million doses of seasonal influenza doses globally each year in its Afluria, Fluad and Flucelvax brands.\nCSL also announced a planned spin-off of its vaccine division, known as CSL Seqirus. The company did not disclose a valuation for the demerger, which is slated to be completed in early 2026 and produce a publicly listed company in Australia, but CEO Dr Paul McKenzie said it would help “reshape and simplify the [core] business”.

Sanofi and Eli Lilly are both undertaking billion-dollar share buyback programmes.\nThe significant restructuring, announced on CSL’s 2025 financial year earnings report, eclipsed what was a positive year for the company. Net profit after tax was $3bn for the past 12 months up to June 2025, a rise of 15% on constant currencies.\nCSL’s headcount reduction and vaccine spinoff dragged shares down 9.5%, from A$271.32 at market close on 18 August to A$245.45 at market open on 19 August.

The company reported its Q2 results on Aug. 7, delivering strong growth that highlighted the growing demand for its voice artificial intelligence (AI) technology. That upbeat report sent shares sharply higher, with SOUN stock climbing more than 45% since the announcement.\nThe company reported $42.7 million in Q2 revenue, representing a 217% increase from the same period last year. Much of that momentum came from its enterprise AI division, with both the automotive sector and restaurant partnerships adding meaningful gains.

Cloud adoption has also been solid, with active users climbing more than 50% over the past year. This reflects SoundHound’s ability to acquire and retain customers in a competitive market.\nThe restaurant industry has been a key growth catalyst for the company. In Q2, growth was driven by a combination of fresh customer wins, steady new activations, and deeper integration with existing brands. By the end of the second quarter, SoundHound’s AI-powered voice solutions were deployed across more than 14,000 restaurant locations, making this vertical a significant contributor to growth. SoundHound’s business is scaling in this sector, with the company adding new restaurant partners each quarter and increasing activations at a faster clip than the quarter before.","content_hash":"5d834cf1232ca5e1c4b3b0412b7f4cf5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2551,"method_rank":0}

Some of the companies offer services directly to workers, while others go through employers, via various business models.\nThe Attorney General for the District of Columbia also sued EarnIn late last year, alleging the company engaged in unlawful lending and deceptive advertising.\nIn a wide-ranging interview last week, the company’s CEO, Ram Palaniappan, sidestepped commenting directly on the Washington AG’s lawsuit. “The key thing is that the product is good for consumers, and we have the data that backs that,” Palaniappan said in the interview.\nIn response to the ruling, a spokesperson for the company said EWA is fixing a system that delays payments to workers in a way that is \"distinct from lending.\" “Workers should not have to wait until payday to access wages they’ve already worked for,\" the spokesperson said in response to the ruling. \"EarnIn provides timely access to wages with a no cost option.\"","content_hash":"ad50a5203aa95266a1e65de16d1dd011","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2547,"method_rank":0}

Collins said in June. The tally includes employees who accepted an early resignation offer and will stay on payroll through Sept. 30.\nRoughly 26% of revenue agents and 27% of tax examiners have left the agency or intend to do so, TIGTA said in July.\n“With the IRS workforce reduced by 26% and significant tax law changes on the horizon, there are risks to next year’s filing season,” Collins said in a June report.\nThe Trump administration, in its 2026 budget request, flagged the risks from mass cuts in taxpayer services and requested the hiring of 11,000 customer service employees.\nAt current staff levels, “most taxpayers would be unable to reach the IRS by phone or receive answers to questions related to tax compliance,” the IRS said. “Taxpayers that do get through will face long wait times.”\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has triggered unprecedented turnover in the agency’s top spot. During the past eight months, the administration has cycled through seven commissioners, a position with a five-year tenure.\nDozens of top career civil servants have left the IRS, with many resigning after the announcement of a memorandum of understanding on the use of tax data between the IRS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.","content_hash":"591685580966eb91e0d85ad165ac781f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2543,"method_rank":0}

Subscribe to our free daily Wealthmanagement newsletter.\nA former Wells Fargo Advisors employee is suing the firm and questioning whether her ethnicity and gender played a role in her termination.\nLisa Krugler originally filed suit against Wells Fargo Advisors in July in Kentucky state court, but the case was transferred to federal jurisdiction last week.\nAccording to the complaint, Krugler joined WFA as a client services associate around May 2021, where she was tasked with helping advisors generate documents, run office responsibilities and process estates. According to the suit, she was adopted from South Korea and grew up in the United States.\nAccording to LinkedIn, Krugler worked for Cullinan Associates for eight years before moving to Wells Fargo. The suit noted that she was the only non-white Wells Fargo team member in her location and had consistently met performance review expectations.\nKrugler said she served as “primary support” for three advisors, backed up other associates working with eight advisors, and helped handle office tasks. Krugler argued she had the highest workload of anyone in the office.\nKrugler purportedly asked for a raise in January of this year, and while she was assigned more work, she didn’t get a pay bump.\nAccording to the complaint, Krugler’s supervisor, Chris Bohnert, “was observed to treat the women in the office differently” than the men, frequently ignoring female coworkers altogether. Krugler found it challenging to take time off, as she often had to do the work of multiple associates.\nHowever, according to the suit, she traveled to Disney World in June to celebrate her son’s birthday. On the trip’s third day, Krugler got a call from Bohnert, which surprised her because WFA prohibits work during paid time off.\n“Believing it must be important, Mrs. Krugler answered the phone,” the complaint read. “Mr. Bohnert began the call by stating, ‘I’m glad you’re at the happiest place on Earth, because I have to let you go.’”\nAccording to the suit, Krugler was “shocked by the callousness and lack of professionalism” on the call, and asked Bohnert to call back with a third-party witness to the conversation; Bohnert allegedly said he would, but Krugler never received that call. According to Krugler, she was never given a “satisfactory answer” for her firing.\n“When she asked if her status as a Korean woman was the reason she was terminated, Mr. Bohnert responded, “I don’t know. It’s nothing personal,’” the complaint read.","content_hash":"827d31d43e056113e7c02d1b640c9f76","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2541,"method_rank":0}

It plans to launch a new discounted model in as little as six months, with two more new models to follow soon after. These launches could easily double or even triple the company's revenue over the coming years.\nThat has investors excited and the stock price on the rise. Think it's too late to invest? Think again. There's one reason Rivian shares remain surprisingly cheap.\nRivian doesn't have this exciting business segment\nOther electric vehicle stocks like Tesla and Lucid Group trade at 6 to 13 times trailing sales. Rivian, meanwhile, trades at just 2.6 times trailing sales. Why the big discount?\nGrowth is a big part of the story. Lucid is expected to grow its sales by 60% this fiscal year, while Rivian's sales are expected to grow by just 6.5%. Tesla is the outlier. Analysts expect its sales to fall by around 5% this year. Why then does Tesla stock remain extremely expensive? It turns out that both Lucid and Tesla have a growth opportunity that Rivian hasn't pursued very aggressively: robotaxis.\nRobotaxis are expected to be a huge market. Some analysts think the global opportunity could eventually be worth up to $10 trillion. Recent robotaxi announcements from both Lucid and Tesla, therefore, have given investors plenty of optimism for long-term growth potential.\nRivian has been surprisingly quiet on the robotaxi front. One of its board members even recently criticized Tesla's efforts, stressing that the service has a long way to go to be truly autonomous. A lack of robotaxi upside is likely a strong reason why Rivian shares are priced at such a relative discount to the competition.\nThe robotaxi opportunity is still very early stages, however. Rivian's new models, meanwhile, are near-term opportunities. We should see growth rates pick up considerably next year, allowing investors to take advantage of today's discounted valuation. Rivian simply doesn't need robotaxis to grow considerably in 2025.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rivian Automotive right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Rivian Automotive, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rivian Automotive wasn’t one of them.

Its ADA token is a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, which means the tokens can be staked to earn rewards. The man behind it, Charles Hoskinson, was also a co-founder of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH).\nCardano's biggest selling point\nIn an industry that's often focused on short-term gains, Cardano is built to last. Each step of its development has been peer-reviewed and carefully thought through. It is designed to scale easily and work with other blockchains.\nThe Cardano team is also more outward-looking than other cryptocurrencies and focused on real-world use cases. For example, it has been working in Africa and Asia for years to promote financial inclusion -- spreading financial tools to more people.\nIt spent several years creating a blockchain-based way to track education records in Ethiopia. The project didn't succeed, but the technology played a key part in Cardano's decentralized identity work. That could be increasingly important in the real world as we grapple with ongoing data breaches.\nCardano's biggest risk\nHowever, Cardano's slow-and-steady approach could be too slow, costing it market share. Once developers start using a particular coding language or platform, it takes a lot to make them switch. And blockchains like Cardano need users and developers if they are to grow and stay relevant.\nCardano didn't launch its smart contract capabilities until 2021. That's later than other cryptocurrencies like Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) and Tezos (CRYPTO: XTZ). Smart contracts are crucial for layer 1 blockchains as they make them programmable. Its late start is one reason the Cardano ecosystem currently has a fraction of the applications of other top cryptocurrencies.\nCardano has long-term potential\nIt's still early days in the smart contract crypto race, and there's a lot to play for. That relative infancy makes it important that crypto investments are part of a wider, balanced portfolio.\nFor Cardano, crypto's next chapter could present an opportunity. As crypto becomes more mainstream, its dependability may appeal to non-crypto businesses. And if security and scalability become more important than speed and transaction costs, developers may well switch to Cardano.\nShould you buy stock in Cardano right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Cardano, consider this:","content_hash":"92291baf2a9a455a41ab2200cbcdd58f","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2526,"method_rank":0}

Colocation vacancy rates dropped to an historic low of 2.3% across the region, dipping below 1% in the largest markets, including Northern Virginia, the commercial real estate investment firm said in a Monday report.\n-\nA spike in demand for cloud and AI services has upended the market, driving up rents by 50% in the last five years even as supply in major regions has doubled or tripled, JLL found. With nearly three-quarters of the current pipeline under prelease agreements, the capacity crunch is expected to persist through 2027, the firm said.\n-\nEnterprises are securing capacity 18 to 24 months in advance, sometimes even earlier, according to Matt Landek, JLL’s U.S. Data Center Work Dynamics division president and data center project development lead. “The days of build-it-and-they-will-come are long gone,” Landek said in a release. “What we’re seeing now is ‘commit-before-it’s-built-or-you-won’t-get-in.’”\nDive Insight:\nAs CIOs prepare IT estates for AI adoption, cloud providers are laying the groundwork for a compute capacity demand surge that’s already eclipsed supply. Massive waves of hyperscale capital investments flowing into data centers are squeezing out enterprises seeking colocation space.\nThe scope of the buildouts is immense. Eleven cloud service providers poured roughly $450 billion into data center infrastructure last year, according to Dell’Oro Group. The firm expects data center-related CapEx to continue growing 21% year over year and surpass $1 trillion by 2029.\nThe spending spree spilled over into the colocation market as big tech supplemented billions of dollars in new construction with leased capacity. Cloud and technology providers dominated colocation demand in North America, accounting for nearly two-thirds of all leasing activity during the first half the year, per JLL.\nHyperscalers are rapidly gobbling up global compute. Last year, cloud providers captured 44% of capacity through owned and leased data centers, while on-premises data centers and non-hyperscale colocation facilities accounted for 34% and for 22% during the first quarter of the year, according to Synergy Research Group analysis. The firm expects hyperscalers to own more than 60% of global capacity by 2030.","content_hash":"ce236c5ead18b0ffca682cb3db1cd1be","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2486,"method_rank":0}

The company plans to use the capital to invest in products and expand its go-to-market operations.\nFounded in 2024, TinyFish is building web-based agents to automate repetitive and complex online tasks for enterprises. Its technology simulates human-like browsing to perform actions and gather data at a massive scale.\nThe company is initially focusing on the retail and travel sectors. Its primary use cases include dynamic price surveillance, where AI bots track prices, promotions, shipping times, and inventory levels across competitor websites in real-time.\nThese tasks were traditionally handled by large, offshore teams performing manual data entry or by custom software scripts that would often break when a website's design changed.\nPalo Alto, California-based TinyFish has a team of about 25 people. The new funding provides TinyFish with a runway of three to four years, according to CEO Sudheesh Nair.\nThe AI agent space is experiencing a gold rush, with a flurry of offerings on autonomous software. Big tech companies and startups are racing to capitalize on the shift from static large language models (LLMs) to dynamic agents capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks.\nTinyFish says its technology could help solve the problem of efficiently and reliably gathering critical data from the dynamic and messy environment of the internet.\n\"If you can turn the internet into analyzable data, it will fundamentally give businesses advantages that others don't have,\" Nair told Reuters, adding that the goal is to help businesses \"make more money,\" not just save on costs.\nIts system uses advanced AI models for reasoning and exploration, and then codifies that knowledge for high-speed, deterministic execution at scale, according to Nair.\nAmit Agarwal, partner at ICONIQ, said the decision to invest was driven by TinyFish's success with early pilot customers, including tech giant Google.\n\"They had operationalized it, productionized it at a very large scale for two large-scale customers who have all the development resources in-house to build these types of things themselves,\" Agarwal said.\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu; Editing by Stephen Coates)","content_hash":"42888185a8b87eb8ce7de2259d7c3816","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2486,"method_rank":0}

Home sales were down 1.9% year over year in the quarter, per GlobalData research.\nHome Depot, compared to smaller rivals like Lowe’s, will get “the lion’s share” of growth within smaller project categories right now as it “remains the number one destination for consumers due to strong customer service, a comprehensive range, and sharp pricing,” Saunders said in emailed comments. “The latter factor will serve it well as consumers become more price conscious.”\nHome Depot has been building out its offering for its Pro customer base more recently.

Autos are one of Japan's largest exports, and make up its largest export to the U.S. in 2024.\nThe value of auto exports — which includes cars, buses and trucks — to the U.S. plunged 28.4% year over year in July, a steeper fall compared to the 26.7% decline in June.\nJapan reached a deal with Washington on July 22 that saw its so-called \"reciprocal tariff\" lowered to 15% from the 25% threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump earlier that month.\nWhile the effects of the 15% tariffs will not show up until the August data, analysts have warned about their impact on the Japanese economy.\nSenior economist Masato Koike at Sompo Institute Plus said in an Aug 14 note that there was a possibility that Japan could enter a recession, depending on the magnitude of the impact of tariffs.","content_hash":"3129048bb156340b487a9dcbf1574f2d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2431,"method_rank":0}

The four-year project, announced in January, aims to build new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the U.S., according to the Jan. 21 press release. Software developer Oracle and tech company MGX are also involved in the project as investors.\nSoftBank will take on the financial responsibility, while OpenAI will oversee operations. Additionally, Oracle, Nvidia, and OpenAI will collaborate to build and operate the Stargate computing system, according to OpenAI’s press release. The buildout is currently underway and started in Texas, with plans to establish more campuses in the U.S. as the companies finalized agreements.\nThe project’s progress has been “going slower than usual,” Softbank SVP and CFO Yoshimitsu Goto said during an Aug. 7 earnings call. One reason, at the time of the call, is the selection of a site to house the project.\n“There are a lot of stakeholders,” Goto said. “To build consensus, we need to have a lot of discussions and also technical issues and construction issues. There are a lot of things that we need to look at.”\nHowever, the joint facility plans with Softbank have been moving “for some time,” more than “half a year ago,” Liu said on Monday.\n“We know that this cooperation project, first of all, requires electricity and land,” Liu added. “Timing is also very important — if we wait too long, it won’t work. Considering all these factors together, we feel that Ohio is a very suitable location. SoftBank feels the same way.”","content_hash":"865f7a6d1b0c29d817477dea33acc5d5","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2427,"method_rank":0}

The outlook for Brazil's sugar mills to boost sugar production at the expense of ethanol output is weighing on sugar prices. Covrig Analytics said today that Brazil's sugar mills are favoring sugar production over ethanol and have been crushing more cane for sugar, and that will likely continue as harvesting approaches its peak due to drier cane crops, which prompt the mills to make more sugar.\nMore News from Barchart\n-\nCoffee Prices Give Up Early Gains on Comments From Brazil's Ag Minister\n-\nSoybeans Are Heating Up.

Also, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said last month that 2024\/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y\/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported today that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 611.2 mm as of August 18, or 1% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association recently said that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025\/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025\/26 sugar production would climb +19% y\/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y\/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024\/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).","content_hash":"b24075f623d05166251365ee7bd5bf7e","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2423,"method_rank":0}

The Tel Aviv-based trading and investing platform went public in May at a $4.2 billion valuation, only to see its stock slide 8% post-earnings, leaving its market cap closer to $4 billion. Investors appear cautious despite solid fundamentals, including a 54% year-over-year (YOY) jump in assets under administration (AUA) to $17.5 billion and steady growth in funded accounts.\nThe reaction comes at a time when crypto markets remain volatile, even as trading platforms like eToro post strong activity. Crypto revenue rose to $1.9 billion in Q2, up roughly $300 million YOY, highlighting the company’s exposure to digital assets. With the stock now trading at the lower end of its 52-week range, the question for investors is whether this dip represents a buying opportunity.\nMore News from Barchart\nAbout eToro Stock\nEstablished in 2007, eToro runs a multi-asset investment platform across equities, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and wealth solutions. Based in Tel Aviv, it has an expanding presence across the world, including a new base in Singapore. eToro provides services to more than 3.6 million funded accounts. eToro's market capitalization stands at close to $4 billion since it issued its IPO earlier in the year.\nETOR stock has ranged from $46.03 to $79.96 since its debut, and the stock most recently closed at $48.14. It’s a sharp fall from the $6 billion market capitalization it touched in its first-day trade, and the stock is off close to 17% just in the last week. As a point of comparison, the S&P 500 Index (SPY) is higher by roughly 25% over the last year, a reflection of ETOR’s underperformance against the general market.\nOn a valuation basis, eToro commands a forward price-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 21.34 and a price-sales ratio of 0.31. As the P\/E seems reasonable for a growth fintech, the razor-thin profit margin of 1.53% and the absence of a trailing P\/E do make me question the durability of earnings. The price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio, though, is very low, which in itself indicates the doubt the market may have regarding its longer-term growth profile if it can continue scaling its profit profile. eToro doesn't pay a dividend at this time, and based on its priority for reinvestment in growth, income investors shouldn't look for it in the near term.","content_hash":"2397344183b84f1b7a83cc04975c18f3","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2390,"method_rank":0}

You can also make these alerts recurring by tapping on “Repeat” and selecting days of the week.\nThe feature allows a grace time of a few minutes from the set time, after which the alert goes off.\n“Coordination is generally a top concern for families, but this is especially true during the busy back-to-school season. In fact, new app downloads of Life360 actually peak during the weeks leading up to the first day of school,” Mike Zeman, CMO at Life360, said in a statement.\n“No Show Alerts were designed to give parents peace of mind and mitigate the need to constantly check in on their kids’ whereabouts. It’s a tool to encourage trust in their families to get where they need to be, while still having a backup alert if they need to step in and see why someone didn’t make it to where they are supposed to be.”\nWhile Life360 described the parent-children use case, it said that anyone in the family can set alerts for someone else if location sharing is on. The company added that anyone in the family can turn off location sharing at any time.\nThe new no-show feature will roll out to all members in the U.S. today and will be available to international members in the coming weeks.\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Shares of many companies in this space, from Strategy (MSTR) to Coinbase (COIN) and plenty of others, have seen massive stock price appreciation in 2025 as investors look for publicly traded ways new record highs in Bitcoin (BTCUSD).\nAnd for crypto-hungry investors, there is a new company on the block.\nMore News from Barchart\nEverything Blockchain (EBZT) is the latest company to announce its digital asset strategy, with the company’s leadership team recently announcing plans to put around $10 million in capital to work in high-growth blockchain projects.\nLet’s dive into whether Everything Blockchain is a company the average investor should consider right now. After all, this is a penny stock that’s fallen significantly from its previous peak.\nWhat’s the Strategy for This Strategy Rival?\nLike other blockchain-focused stocks, Everything Blockchain is attempting to provide investors with an avenue to put capital to work in cryptocurrencies.\nThe company is planning to deploy $10 million in leading blockchains such as Solana (SOLUSD), Hyperliquid, Sui (SUIUSDT), XRP (XRPUSD) and Bittensor. These are among the best-performing large-cap cryptos in the market. For instance, although Solana is underperforming Bitcoin, it is still up a healthy 22% over the past year.\nThese blockchains also appear to be where the majority of real utility is being created.\nAssuming the crypto rally continues, EBZT stock could certainly see further upside on top of its nearly 1,900% year-to-date rally. But that’s the key question investors will have to ask: If there’s another crypto winter ahead, can this rally not only be sustained, but accelerate from here?\nWhat Do the EBZT Numbers Say?\nEverything Blockchain is one of those companies that’s hard to value.\nWhy, you might ask?\nWell, on the fundamentals front, there’s not a lot to see. The company does not generate revenue or earnings, which is worrisome for investors. Plus, the company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier in 2025 to reveal it was unable to file its annual report on time. This means that the only real way to track Everything Blockchain moving forward will be based on its digital asset holdings.","content_hash":"3104702aaf80fe74db4ec53f3c377e09","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2261,"method_rank":0}

Declines in Nvidia , Meta Platforms and Amazon , among others, sent the S & P 500 lower on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite suffered a worse fate, sliding 1.5%, its worst day since Aug. 1. The pullback comes as the major averages sit near record highs, perhaps encouraging investors to cash in chips on some of this year's major tech winners. Nvidia and Meta Platforms remain 38% and 43% higher for the year, respectively, even after the decline. The Technology Select Sector SPDR fund (XLK) is still up 12.2% in 2025 despite falling 1.8% Tuesday. Taking some risk off the table is seldom a bad thing in investing, especially given the 2025 moves. What may be concerning is Tuesday's slide also coincided with investors appearing to load up on market hedges. Jeff Jacobson, 22V Research head of derivative strategy, noted Sunday that the put skew on the Invesco QQQ Trust — which tracks the Nasdaq-100 index — has jumped to a three-year high. Put skews signal that put options on the underlying asset are more expensive than call options. Or, expressed another way, investors are scooping up downside protection on the QQQ at a fast pace. \"Should we see a pullback in tech that is more than just a shallow one, then the 200-day would be a likely level of support,\" Jacobson said.

Here's what tends to happen to stocks in this unique backdrop. The fed funds futures market is indicating an 87% chance for a quarter-point rate cut at the Fed's next policy meeting in September, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. The S & P 500 has rebounded more than 30% from its April lows to hit consecutive record highs as investors cheered solid corporate earnings and the prospect for lower rates. \"One could argue this is the big dynamic in the game: the Fed is set to cut rates ... into a growth upswing. When taken together with the AI capex surge, that constitutes an objectively friendly backdrop for the market that I don't want to lose sight of amidst local noise,\" Tony Pasquariello, Goldman Sachs head of hedge fund client coverage, said in a note to clients. Lower rates should be good for stocks for various reasons. They can make safer investments like bonds and savings accounts less appealing due to lower yields. Lower rates also are particularly beneficial for growth stocks, whose value is heavily tied to future profit expectations. But would it boost stocks when the market is already at its peak? Goldman Sachs strategist Jenny Ma looked at S & P 500 performance since 1990 in various time frames after the Fed trimmed rates when the broader market was at or within 1% of a record high. There have been nine such occurrences going back to 1990 when Fed cut rates with the S & P 500 at or close to its peak, Goldman said. Forward returns when the Fed is cutting at the highs are mixed, but it's been generally positive especially after a one-year period, Goldman said. The S & P 500 median return in this environment after a year is 8%, compared with a 9% median return when the market is not at or close to a record, Goldman's analysis showed. \"This profile of returns is NOT that much different from when the Fed is cutting and the market is NOT on the highs,\" Pasquariello said.","content_hash":"eb4e46ed84037f7ac55c26b5b6778056","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2087,"method_rank":0}

Subscribe to our free daily Wealthmanagement newsletter.\nAmplify Platform, a wealth management tech provider, has launched a proprietary risk analysis tool to help advisors measure risk in client portfolios.\nThe new tool, QuantumRisk is based on the work Dr. Ron Piccinini, director of investment research at Amplify, who has a background in fat tail risk modeling. He was responsible for developing PrairieSmarts’ risk management system in 2017, which was subsequently acquired by Covisum, a software company that serves RIAs.\n“Over the last decade, advisors became more and more focused on trying to explain portfolio risk to their clients,” Piccinini said. “As an advisor, your goal is to maximize some kind of return for the risk you’re taking.”\nPiccinini said Amplify had a risk scoring tool previously, but it provided a “vague indication” of the actual risk of underlying investments. The firm considered using something off-the-shelf, but they didn’t think any of the existing tools were sophisticated enough.\n“The sad reality is, we think, most of these things out there are toys, at best,” he said.\nQuantumRisk uses a series of risk scores across a portfolio on a scale of 0 (cash) to 1,000 (penny stocks). The S&P 500 is scored at 100.\n“So I know if I have a score of 100, I’m just as risky as the market,” he said. “If I have a score of 200, I’m twice as risky as the market. If I have a score of 50, I’m half the risk of the market.”\nIt uses real-world probabilities and market stress scenarios, rather than relying on backward-looking models.\nThe tool will start with risk analysis of stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs. Alternatives and options are on the roadmap for future inclusion.\n“What we’re trying to do is just inform people about the risk of their investment, and we’re not cutting any corners on statistical distributions, calculations, those types of things,” he said. “A lot of toys\/tools out there oversimplify things and give people overconfidence.”","content_hash":"fa5a45323f656f939848c5dd9ce3566a","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":2033,"method_rank":0}

Many industry voices expect the craze may start fading by the end of 2025, calling into question if revenue can sustain and thus whether expansion will offer a return-on-investment.","content_hash":"fb431fd93eb38dbc3893c36c8222a43d","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1951,"method_rank":0}

The funds will be managed by Wellington Management, according to the filings.\nWhile Vanguard has rolled out a handful of active bond ETFs, the new products mark its first push into stock-picking ETFs. They will target dividend growth, growth stock and value stock investment strategies, Vanguard said.\nThere has been a torrent of new ETFs this year from asset managers trying to capture growing demand for actively managed ETFs that aim to outperform indexes. Actively managed ETFs arose around six years ago. The advent of this strategy in a more tax efficient and lower-cost ETF wrapper has attracted growing investor interest.\nMorningstar Direct calculates that there have been 630 new exchange-traded products so far this year, compared to 381 for the same period in 2024. Some 86% of those launches were of actively managed strategies, according to a report published this month by JP Morgan Asset Management, which also found that active ETFs now account for some 37% of total U.S. ETF inflows.\n\"Until now, Vanguard had been sitting out this rush,\" said Jeff DeMaso, editor at the Independent Vanguard Advisor.\nDeMaso said he expects the new funds will attract a steady if not spectacular flow of assets.\n\"These are proven strategies,\" he added.\nThe new ETFs are \"building blocks that reflect our ... commitment to disciplined product development and investor outcomes,\" said Ryan Barksdale, head of active equity product at Vanguard, in a statement.\n(Reporting by Suzanne McGee; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)","content_hash":"5f31cfa3612f042d13ff4a321e071400","extract_method":"trafilatura","text_len":1877,"method_rank":0}

And the stock slid 6.5% after the company’s February report, when its full-year sales and earnings forecasts fell short of Wall Street estimates. Shares advanced after its two prior reports.\nWalmart stock is up about 11% since the start of the year after rebounding from a tariff-fueled slump throughout March and early April.\nInvestors will be looking to Walmart for clues about how consumers and retailers are responding to President Trump’s tariffs. After a slump in consumer spending this spring, retail sales upticks of 0.9% in June and 0.5% in July “suggest the consumer is on slightly firmer footing headed into Q3,” according to Wells Fargo economists Tim Quinlan and Shannon Grein.

Yet the main focus remains its proposed merger with AI cloud provider CoreWeave (CRWV), which is set for a shareholder vote in the fourth quarter, investment bank Jefferies said in a research report Monday.\nAt CoreWeave’s current price of $99.97, the all-stock deal values Core Scientific shares at roughly $12.35, well below Jefferies’ estimated fair value of $16 to $23.\nInvestor sentiment on the merger is tied directly to CoreWeave’s price, the report said. The agreed exchange ratio of 0.1235 translates into a Core Scientific value that fluctuates with CRVW’s share swings.\nThe report noted that while CoreWeave has traded as high as $183 in June, the stock closed below $100 on Friday, pushing the implied Core Scientific price beneath market levels. CORZ itself ended the day at $14.13.\nThis disconnect suggests some investors expect the deal to fail, Jefferies said, arguing that Core Scientific’s assets and cash flow potential justify a higher valuation.\nIf CoreWeave's stock doesn’t recover ahead of the vote, Jefferies sees room for renegotiation. A higher exchange ratio, potentially 0.16 to 0.20, could bring the implied valuation of CORZ shares back within the $16 to $23 range. A collar provision could also stabilize the deal against further volatility.\nThe bank has a buy rating on Core Scientific shares. It raised its CORZ price target to $22 from $16 to reflect the CoreWeave acquisition.
