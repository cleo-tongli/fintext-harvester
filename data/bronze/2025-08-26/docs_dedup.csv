Full Conference Call Transcript
Kristian Sorensen: Thank you, Aline, and hello, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to be with us today as we review our second quarter financial results and recent relevance. So let's turn to Slide four, please. The second quarter was marked by extraordinary geopolitical and market events, which substantially increased the market volatility both for shipping and trading. For the quarter, we reported a TCE income of $38,800 per available day and $37,300 per calendar day, above our guidance of $35,000 per day. In a quarter with spot rates fluctuating between $10,000 and $70,000 per day, the time charter portfolio played a vital role in protecting our downside.
After minority interests, the Q2 profit was $35 million, equivalent to an EPS of $0.23. And the Board of Directors has declared dividends of $0.22 per share, consisting of 75% of our shipping NPAT, topped up with retained dividends from Product Services 2024 results. Moving on to our trading operations. Product Services achieved a gross profit of $15 million and a profit after tax of $6 million. Samantha will take you through the details later in the presentation. And it's important to keep in mind that it is the realized result, which generates Product Services dividend capacity. As of June 30th, the aggregated realized result for 2025 is $39 million.
Further on our shipping activities, 2025 is a busy drydocking year for us. In the second quarter, we had 139 days related to vessels drydocking. In the second half of the year, we expect 143 and 135 days, respectively, for Q3 and Q4. These numbers should be noted since they impact our revenue-generating potential on top of the drydocking cost itself. For the third quarter, we are guiding on about $53,000 per day fixed for 90% of our available days. These are solid levels above our all-in cash breakeven of $24,800 per day. On the asset side, BWG was added to our own fleet in June after we declared a very lucrative purchase option earlier this year.
On financing, we finalized a $380 million term loan and revolving credit facility to finance the advanced gas fleet and secured a $215 million term loan facility for BW LPG India fleets. Our $250 million shareholder loan from BW Group was terminated earlier due to ample liquidity. But now that Q2 is over, the focus is on 2025, which has started off on a strong note. So let's turn to the next slide, please. The current VLGC market is characterized by solid fundamentals with robust growth in export volumes from the U.S., supported by high domestic LPG production and ongoing terminal expansions. The Middle East volumes are also slightly up, backed by a reversal of the OPEC cuts.
The extraordinary factor is how inefficiencies in the LPG trade pattern have absorbed substantial shipping capacity in recent months. The first such inefficiency emerged after China imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-sourced LPG, which led to a significant reshuffling of U.S. export volumes away from China and into other parts of Asia. The sudden shift of U.S. volumes toward India and Southeast Asia, combined with the redirection of Middle East volumes to China rather than India, absorbed considerable capacity from the VLGC fleet and pushed rates up. The short but intense Israel-Iran conflict also fueled spot rates for ships loading around that period in the Middle East.
Now trade patterns are slowly returning to pre-trade workflows, but the Panama Canal has once again become a bottleneck as growing traffic from container ships, ethane carriers, and other prioritized or high-paying segments strains capacity. The consequence has been more VLGCs routing around South Africa, which significantly impacts the tonne mile for the global VLGC fleets, making fewer ships available, which, in turn, is pushing rates up. In addition, the global fleet growth is at a low level, with 409 ships currently in service and only seven more to be delivered in 2025.
We keep an eye on the LPG FFA market, which is currently pricing the balance of 2025 at an equivalent of low $60,000 per day for the Middle East Japan benchmark leg. Next slide, please. This slide shows how the LPG market dynamics played out after the Chinese retaliatory tariffs were implemented. The U.S. LPG export volumes shifted from Chinese destinations to India, but also Japan took a big chunk of the rerouted cargoes. U.S. LPG exports to India were above 1 million tonnes in 2025 compared to less than 100,000 tonnes for the entire 2024.
Middle Eastern volumes also played a key role by replacing U.S. cargoes to China, thereby redirecting traditional cargo flows for India to longer haul destinations in China and absorbing more shipping capacity. Furthermore, China substituted U.S. LPG with cargoes from Canada and Australia, a trend that we see continues. All in all, the massive reshuffling of cargoes that took place was creating substantial inefficiencies in the LPG supply chain, which required more shipping capacity and moved rates up. The trade pattern is now pivoting towards the pre-liberation day structure in anticipation for a trade deal between the U.S. and China. But the Panama Canal has created new inefficiencies for the fleets. Next slide, please.
In 2023, 2024, we all spent significant time analyzing the Panama Canal dynamics. Now with the canal regaining relevance, it's worth revisiting its key aspects driving our markets. The new Panama Canal locks have a daily capacity of around 10 ships in total combined for both directions. VLGCs have over the last years taken up between two to three of these 10 transit slots. As previously explained, VLGCs are not prioritized through the canal during periods of increased traffic. So when waiting times become excessive or auction fees for available slots are prohibitively high, the alternative is to route vessels around the Cape Of Good Hope.
And this rerouting increases sailing distances by up to 50% compared with the Panama Canal route to Northeast Asia and has an immediate and material impact on the VLGC market by raising demand for tonnage to offset the longer voyages. Monitoring developments in the Panama Canal will therefore be important in assessing the direction of the VLGC freight rates going forward. The increased demand for shipping capacity has pushed spot rates up to a level above $70,000 per day for loading in the U.S. Gulf. As you can see from the graphs on this page, shipping is currently capturing almost all the profit in moving cargoes from the U.S.
Gulf to the Far East, and there is very little room left for profit on the cargo price itself. Demand for vessels, driven by increased export volumes and the aforementioned inefficiencies, is growing faster than the capacity of the VLGC fleets. And the upcoming export terminal expansions will likely lend support to shipping share of the U.S. Far East arbitrage. In the LPG value chain, there is a daily arm wrestling going on between terminals, cargo owners, and the shipping market on capturing as much as possible of the price difference between the U.S. and the landed price in Asia.
For the time being, the supply-demand balance in the VLGC market is tight, and the bargaining power is in the shipping market's favor. On that note, I'd like to remind you how this may impact the Q3 accounting result for Product Services since the change in the mark to market valuation of their shipping portfolio is not captured in the P&L, while forward cargo and paper positions are included. Looking ahead on this slide, the U.S. export volumes are forecasted to continue growing on the back of increased production of LPG.
The crude oil wells in the Permian Basin are more gaseous than we expected some years ago, and the gas production is forecasted to grow at least twice as much annually as the crude oil production, where lower growth figures are expected in the next five years' periods. The growth in U.S. LPG exports is supported by several terminal expansions from now into 2028. And Energy Transfer has already started their LPG exports from their Nederland terminal expansion. Moving over to the Middle East. The export growth is forecasted to accelerate next year with Qatar leading the way as well as Abu Dhabi. In neighboring Saudi Arabia, the Jafura project is worth keeping an eye on.
Although it's further out in time, the size of the LPG volumes made available for exports are potentially adding another 5 to 10 million tons of LPG to the growing volumes from the Middle East. On the fleet and newbuilding front, there is little new to report and the order book counts 111 additional vessels to the current fleet of 409 vessels where about 15% equal to 60 ships and thereabouts are older than 20 years. And then it's over to you, Samantha.
Samantha Xu: Thank you, Kristian, and hello, everyone. Let's dive into our shipping performance. The 2025 completed with the TCE of $37,300 per calendar day or $38,800 per available day, over 94% fleet utilization after deducting technical off hire and waiting time. The healthy result achieved in a volatile market was a strong testament to our commercial strategy, consistently taking on time charter and FFA for coverage in a strong market to provide support when spot markets are under pressure. In Q2, the time charter portfolio was 44% of the total shipping exposure, amount of which 32% is fixed rate time charter.
Looking ahead for Q3 2025, we have fixed 90% of the available fleet days at an average rate of about $53,000 per day. For the second half of 2025, we have secured 34% of our portfolio with fixed rate time charter and FFA hedge respectively at $45,200 and $51,700 per day. Our time charter out fleet is estimated to generate a profit of around $9 million over our time charter in fleet. On top of that, the balance of our fixed time charter out of portfolio is estimated to generate $74 million. On the product services side, the business posted a realized gain of $6 million for Q2.
The positive result reflected a disciplined approach and effective risk management in a volatile quarter. On the unrealized open positions, we reported a $12 million increase in mark to market on our cargo position, which was offset by a negative movement in paper position of $3 million. After accounting for other expenses, which mainly comprise general and administrative expenses, product services reported a net profit after tax of $6 million for Q2 and net asset value of $58 million as at the quarter end. As we mentioned in the previous quarters, the large mark to market valuation movement is due to the gradual phase in of our multiple year term contract, which reflects value adjustments in time of volatile market.
While the value is significant, it reflects the delta between the balance sheet dates, and we'll continue to see fluctuations before the positions are realized. We also want to highlight that due to the nature of trading, its gain and loss are realized in different financial periods and cannot be extrapolated and predicted using its historical performance. Its unrealized position will fluctuate depending on the valuation at the end of the financial period, driving the accounting results up and down drastically. It's important to remember that our trading model looks at creating value combining positions of cargoes, paper, and shipping positions.
As such, we would like to remind you that the reported net asset value does not include the unrealized physical shipping position of $10 million, which was based on our internal valuation. In light of the strong shipping market outlook, the open cargo contracts and hedging position may in turn experience negative mark to market valuation changes, and we'll continue to see fluctuations before the positions are realized. In Q2, our average bar value at risk was $6 million, reflecting a well-balanced trading book of cargoes, shipping, and derivatives after including the increased term contract volume as mentioned. Going on to our financial highlights.
We reported a net profit after tax of $43 million, including a profit of $16 million from BW LPG India, a $6 million profit from product services. Profit attributable to equity holders of the company was $35 million for this quarter, which translates into an earnings per share of 23¢ and an annualized earning yield of 8% when compared against our share price at the June. We reported a net leverage ratio of 31% in Q2, a slight decrease from 33% reported end of last year. The decrease was due to lease liability reduction of $123 million from the purchase option exercised for BW Kisuku and BW Yushi, partly offset by the net drawdown of some banking facilities.
For Q2, the board declared a dividend of 22¢ per share, which translates to a 110% payout of our quarterly shipping profit. These are also supported by some of the retained dividends from product services in 2024. For the period end, our balance sheet reported a shareholders' equity of $1.9 billion. The annualized return on equity and capital employed for Q2 were 98%, respectively. Our Q2 OpEx was $9,000 per day. For full year 2025, we estimate our own fleet's operating cash breakeven per day to be $19,100 per day and total fleet's operating cash breakeven, including time charter in vessels, to be $21,700 per day.
Please note, this is a reduction compared with the cash breakeven of 2024 of $22,800 per day, primarily due to meticulously managed financing, reduced time charter in vessels, and lower G&A per day. And this is also offset by increased OpEx. All in cash breakeven, including dry dock program, for the year is estimated to be $24,800. Next slide, please. On the liquidity side, at the end of Q2, we maintained a strong position of $7.8 billion, including $287 million in cash and $421 million in undrawn revolving credit facilities. Due to our meticulously managed financing plan, we are able to support our fleet growth and remain a robust and resilient financial position to weather the future.
Our repayment profile continues to be sustainable and healthy with major repayment only kicks in after February 19, 2029. On the product services side, trade finance utilization stood at a moderate level of $303 million or 38% of our available credit line, providing sufficient room for future trading needs. Okay. With that, I would like to conclude my update. Thank you for listening, and back to you, Aline.
Operator: Thank you, Samantha, and thank you, Kristian. We would now like to open the call for Q&A for questions. So please type your questions in the Q&A channel. You can also click the raise hand button to ask your questions verbally. Please note though that participants have been automatically muted, so please press unmute before speaking. We will start with the verbal questions first before then moving on to the chat. So please, if you want to ask a question, please raise your hand. I see first up Thomas Christiansen. Please unmute yourself.
Thomas Christiansen: Thank you. Can you hear me?
Operator: Yes.
Thomas Christiansen: That is really good. I have a question regarding the fleet growth. First of all, if you could that's a factual question. Put some figures regarding the capacity of the VLGC fleet today and with the expected 111 vessels going forward. And then my next question is if that is a concern, this fleet growth to you? And if it is, how you will mitigate the impact? And if not, why it's not a concern?
Kristian Sorensen: Thank you, Thomas. I can say I mean, it's to go into detail of every vessel size. It's probably going to take too long, but these ships are quite standardized, except that you have about is it 60 ships now of this fleet, which are Panamaxes, which can go both the old and the new canal lane with a capacity of 88,000 cubic meters. Otherwise, the VLGCs are relatively standard in their design. Some are 91,000, some are 93 and some are 88,000. Like I said, if you go back to the years before 2010, these ships are typically 82,000, maybe 84,000 cubes. So that's kind of the way that the design has developed over the last ten years.
When it comes to the fleet growth in 2027, 2028, it's something we're absolutely not naive about. It should be viewed in the context of also more LPG volumes coming on stream, like mentioned, from the U.S. as well as the Middle East. I think the fleet growth is kind of the same picture we had going from 2022 into 2023, where the fleet growth was actually absorbed very well in the market because the inefficiencies and the volume expansion from the U.S. in particular absorbed the fleet capacity, which came on the water. But we are absolutely not naive about this.
And as previously mentioned, we also have a time charter portfolio, which is currently just above 30% of our capacity, which we are given provided the rates are found attractive, probably going to grow into towards 40%. So that's the way we are protecting the downside as also mentioned in the beginning of our presentation.
Operator: Thomas, you had a follow-up question?
Thomas Christiansen: Oh, yes, I did. I mean, little bit in the same context. I mean, recently, Panama announced that it wouldn't register the ships above fifteen years. I mean, you say on a global level, how does that impact the fleet of big gas carriers? And also, does would that impact the BW LPG's business?
Kristian Sorensen: Sorry. I didn't get that. That the Panama Canal has?
Thomas Christiansen: No. The Panama register, the flag register Panama, announced that it will not register ships above fifteen years going forward. How that how does that impact the global market and your market?
Kristian Sorensen: Well, then there will be fewer ships going through the Panama Canal, and I guess more ships have to sail around South Africa if to and from Asia and the U.S., if that is the case.
Thomas Christiansen: I think it's more I think it's more about, to register, to be to be to flag the Panama flag going forward that the
Samantha Xu: Hello?
Kristian Sorensen: Thomas, you disappeared.
Operator: Yeah. It looks like we lost him.
Kristian Sorensen: Thomas, are you with us?
Thomas Christiansen: Can you hear me now? Yes.
Kristian Sorensen: Yeah. We can.
Thomas Christiansen: Okay. Sorry. Yeah. It's no. I think it's more about it's the register, the flag register, Panama's flag register that one doesn't want to allow, vessels above fifteen years to be registered, with Panama Flak going forward. So I guess that somehow will exclude some vessels from the global fleet of big gas carriers. So if you have a view on how that will impact the global fleet and your business too.
Kristian Sorensen: I think the I'm not sure about the restrictions on flagging ships in Panama. But if that is the case, I presume that there are all the registers where you can flag your ships. So it's nothing which will have a commercial impact on our markets as far as I can see.
Thomas Christiansen: Alright. Thank you.
Operator: Thank Next up was Climent Molins. Please go ahead.
Climent Molins: Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. Over the years, you've generated significant shareholder value by exercising the purchase options at well below market prices on time charter team vessels with the Yuchi as the most recent example. Could you remind us whether you have purchase options on any of your remaining time charter in vessels?
Kristian Sorensen: We do have on one ship later in the decade, but there are no purchase options in the immediate future to say to phrase it that way. But we do have some towards the end of the decade.
Climent Molins: Okay, makes sense. Q3 guidance was a bit, let's say, disappointing maybe relative to recent market trends, especially on the spot market. A portion of that is attributable to your time charter book. But could you please delve a bit into the numbers? Where a significant portion of days fixed before rates went up?
Kristian Sorensen: That's something we will have to get back to you on for the next quarter because that's that requires a bit of meticulous working to get that number correct. But you're absolutely right that the time charter portfolio, which protected our downside in the second quarter is also affecting the number we're guiding on for the third quarter. And also keep in mind that we do have dry dockings taking place throughout this year. And there is also a position and timing effect here, which is important to keep in mind because these voyages are usually three months voyages.
And to have ships in position for the uptick in the rates takes time to before you see ships are load ready and can actually benefit from the strength in the market. So I think we have to get back to you on the details on the split between spots and time charter like we typically do in our earnings presentation.
Climent Molins: Makes sense. Thank you for the color anyway. And final question from me. You had 139 dry docking days in Q2 followed by 143 and 135 in Q3 and Q4 respectively. How many vessels are expected to go through drydocking each quarter? And secondly, have you seen any congestion going into drydocks?
Kristian Sorensen: No congestions, but it's another six, seven ships for the remainder of this year.
Climent Molins: Thank you. That's all from me. I'll turn it over.
Kristian Sorensen: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you, Climent. We have, John Dixon next.
John Dixon: Good morning, Kristian. Good morning, Samantha. I just have a real quick question for you related to the Panama Canal. We saw earlier this year like, just you can hear me. Right?
Samantha Xu: Yeah. I can hear you well, John.
John Dixon: Oh, okay. Earlier this year, President Trump here in the United States has really spent a lot of time with Panama trying to get the freight rates down for US flag vessels. Is that and US naval vessels, of course. Is that something that you see that's impacting the congestion in the Panama Canal? And do you kind of expect to see that going forward?
Kristian Sorensen: Not really. The capacity is mainly being absorbed by container ships. We see more ethane carriers on the back of the increased exports of ethane from the U.S. And this is going to accelerate in coming years as well as other ship types. But we don't so far see any impact from the, let's say, naval ships or the U.S. flagships as you mentioned.
John Dixon: Okay. Thank you very much. That was my only question.
Operator: Thank you, John. Do we have any more questions that you would like to ask verbally before we move on to the chat? If not right now, we might just turn to the chat, maybe starting with Andreas first. SGA has come down from Q4 and also Q1. What is driving this? And is the current level a more realistic level going forward?
Kristian Sorensen: Samantha, I guess this one is for you. On the G and A side, what typically drives this up? I presume this is the G and A we are referring to. Right?
Samantha Xu: I assume the SGA refers to the G and A. Yeah. From this and the current level is more or less. Yeah. I think, Andreas, so GNA is not something that we can how to say how to say we can give you a good base for you to estimate because partly of that is the shipping's journey and the other part is product services journey, which is a reflection of the realized profit as part of the incentive scheme. So that's why it would you will see fluctuations of a G and A as a true up reflecting that the product services are realized profit as well.
Operator: Alright. Anders had another question related to spot rates being lower. So the question was, with the current market dynamics being favorably and comparing relative to peers reporting recently, what is the reason for the achieved spot rates for Q3 being relatively lower for BW LPG Limited?
Kristian Sorensen: Yeah, I think well, it's not I guess, our peers have to answer for their numbers themselves. But at least for us, when we guide on the Q3 numbers, it's including both spot and the time charter portfolio. So it's not pure spot. And as mentioned also to Climent earlier is that the time charter portfolio is affecting this number compared to the pure spot rate that you see in the markets. And of course, have the positioning, the timing effects and the fact that we also have a relatively busy drydocking agenda and scheme this year, which will impact guiding and the results going forward.
Operator: Thank you. We move on to a question from Peter on VLACs. To what extent are the VLACs affecting the VLGC market? And when do you expect to start seeing some scrapping?
Kristian Sorensen: The VLACs are currently, you know, as they are being phased in, you know, these are basically going to trade as far as we can see as regular VLGCs because the ammonia trade for these kind of vessels hasn't materialized yet and has probably not gone materialize before we are well into the 2030s as it looks now. So we regard them as part of the, let's say, conventional VLGC fleet in our market outlooks. And then there was another question, which was whether we start seeing some scrapping. Scrapping is typically taking place when the markets are really, really low.
These ships, when they go out, let's say, the conventional trade, they're typically when they reach, at least 25 years, they end up in captive trade, floating storage operations. And technically, these ships can last, you know, until they are 40 years of age basically, because there is very little wear and tear compared to a dry cargo ship, for instance. So we I don't anticipate to see any scrapping activity picking up before the markets are at a very different level than what we see today.
Operator: Thank you, Kristian. We have another question in the chat from Olaf on contract extension. Do you have any plans to extend the contracts for the vessels you're currently chartering in?
Kristian Sorensen: This is something we will decide on as we get closer to the expiry of these various contracts. So we will inform the market more on how we extend or choose not to extend these contracts as we move into the third and the fourth quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Another question from Greg on ton mile upside. Regarding ton mile upside from U.S.-China trade tensions, you mentioned that voyage patterns are reverting. Can you quantify in general terms how much of the tonne mile upside is still here still there today? Is it mostly still there or mostly gone?
Kristian Sorensen: This is a very good question, Greg. What we do see is that U.S. cargo flows into China have kind of returned to a certain extent. But the surge in U.S. cargoes heading into India has come off. So I think it's it's a bit too early to see whether there is actually a new trade pattern established between the U.S. and India, for instance, or if this was just a one off. So it's hard to kind of quantify this. But as mentioned, we saw more than 1 million tons heading from the U.S. into India in the second quarter against less than 100,000 tonnes for the entire 2024.
But the and also a side effect of this, which is quite interesting, which we probably underestimated was that India, which over the last years has absorbed basically 50% of all the LPG exports from the Middle East was suddenly receiving less cargoes from the Middle East because the Middle East sent more cargoes all the way to China. So we need a bit more time, I think, to quantify these ton mile effects and how it really impacted the market.
Operator: Thank you. We have a question from Axel Styrman on Ethene. Do you have any comments to the optionality on Ethene LPG exports from the U.S. Gulf in 2025 and in 2026. Which share of Ethene LPG do you expect to be shipped from the expansions where there is such optionality?
Kristian Sorensen: Thanks, Axel. So we understand that from the Netherlands terminal, for instance, they will start up with LPG and then phase in the ethane as we get into 2026. We assess kind of we have a fifty-fifty split on that one. Enterprise, they have two expansions where one of them will eventually be ethane only. So I think there is good reasons to believe that, you know, a substantial part of the terminal expansion for energy transfer as well as enterprise will be designated for ethane capacity.
Operator: We have another question in the chat from Chandan on Panama Canal congestion. So he would like to know what is driving the containership congestion increase in Panama Canal. What do you think?
Kristian Sorensen: I'm not sitting close enough to the container market to give a kind of a qualified reply on this, but I suspect that it has something to do with the ongoing trade war, negotiations between China and the U.S. But the container traffic in and around the canal is steadily growing simply because also there are more ships in general on the water fighting for this very limited capacity, which the Panama Canal has to offer.
Operator: And final question for now in the chat before we can open up again, verbally as well is from John on the spot rates level. How do you look at the current freight market for VLGCs? Are spot rates of $70,000 a day a sustainable level, or do you feel there are some downside risk in the near to medium term? And how do you look at the traffic in Panama Canal, especially for containers into the second half of 2025?
Kristian Sorensen: Good questions. I think there is always a downside risk when you are at $70,000 per day in the market. But we do see also today, for instance, that ships are being booked around that level. So it seems like the market is able to absorb it and that the rates are sustainable. But I wouldn't say that there is not any downside risk to this rate level. But we believe that the Panama Canal is definitely playing a vital role in driving these rates further up or down. The fundamentals are solid. So it's not like we have changed any views on the fundamentals of the market. But the wildcard is the Panama Canal.
And as mentioned, we see the containers are taking up substantial and increasing part of that capacity over the last couple of weeks. So it seems like the situation, even though it's it's rapidly changing from one week to the other, it seems like the Panama Canal congestion is going to be playing a role in the market in our market going forward. I think that seems to be the case.
Operator: Thank you, Kristian. There's no more questions in the chat right now, but we have John Dixon who raised his hand again. So please, if you wanna go ahead, John.
John Dixon: Kristian, just real quick. Looking to the fourth quarter, Samantha said and you all showed that you've you've booked about 30% of your available days into the fourth quarter. Obviously, the way I'm looking at that is that if those freight rates stay higher leading into the fourth quarter, I'm assuming that is gonna be reflected. I mean, obviously, you still have a lot of available days left to book. Is that kind of the way you guys are looking at it? Or what's your perspective leading into that fourth quarter?
Kristian Sorensen: I think, John, the way to look at this is that regardless of how the market is performing the spot market is performing, we have this 30 odd percent of all the fleet capacity locked in at $45,000 per day thereabout. And this will obviously have an impact on our time charter equivalent for an income for that quarter. But the remaining 70%, are exposed to the spot market. So that's something we are happy to keep for time being at least, if that kind of answered your question.
John Dixon: It does, Kristian. Thank you. I and I appreciate it.
Operator: Thank you, John. Do we have any more questions? Either you wanna type it into the chat or raise your hand. We still have a couple of minutes left. Alright. If not, Kristian, you wanna provide a few closing remarks?
Kristian Sorensen: Then I think it's time to round it off and say thanks to everyone listening in and for asking good questions. And we look forward to seeing you again in November. And in the meantime, we look forward to an exciting market development in the months to come. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: Thank you, Kristian. Thank you, Samantha. This will conclude our call. The call transcript and recording will be available on our website shortly. So thanks a lot for dialing in, and we wish you a very good rest of your day.

Full Conference Call Transcript
Yongchen Lu, our CEO and Director, and Albert Li, our CFO. After the company's prepared remarks, the management team will conduct a question and answer session. You can find a slide presentation and the webcast of today's earnings call on our website. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our earnings presentation and investor materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to future events and uncertainties. Statements that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, statements about the company's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from those forward-looking statements.
All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. This presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe can be helpful in evaluating our performance. However, those measures should not be considered substitutes for the comparable GAAP measures. The accompanying reconciliation information related to those non-GAAP and GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release issued earlier today. With that said, I would now like to turn it over to Yongchen Lu, our CEO and Director. Please go ahead, Yongchen.
Yongchen Lu: Thank you, Gemma. Good morning and good evening, everyone. In Q2, we reinforced our differentiated coffee plus freshly prepared food strategy with a successful launch of the live lunch box platform, a series of new combo products for the lunch daypart to further drive our top-line growth and enhance store unit economics. The product lineup includes hot baked bagel sandwiches, energizing lunch wraps, and loaded power bowls, paired with a coffee or other beverage, all at an acceptable price point. As a result, food revenue increased by 8.6% year over year, and food revenue contribution as a percentage of sales reached a historical high of 35.2%, an increase of 2.8 percentage points from 32.5% in 2024.
Our system sales continued to grow during the quarter, achieving a 1.4% year-over-year increase. Our subfranchisee and retail businesses continue to deliver steady cash flow and profitability. Profits from other revenues achieved a year-over-year increase of 110.3%. At the same time, we returned to positive adjusted corporate EBITDA and reduced adjusted net losses by 16.2% during the quarter. These achievements underscore TH International Limited's successful disciplined execution and our unwavering commitment to achieving sustainable long-term profitable growth.
On store development, leveraging several franchisee partnerships, we expanded our store footprint into 98 cities, including the city of Zibo in Shandong province, Lishei in Zhejiang province, Luan in Anhui province, and Jincheng in Shaanxi province that we entered in Q2 while maintaining capital efficiency and delivering absolute convenience for our guests. Since we launched our individual franchisee programs in December 2023, we have received over 8,100 applications and successfully converted over 400 stores by the end of the second quarter, showcasing market confidence in our franchisee model.
We have established attractive and desirable store unit economics for subfranchises with a reasonable two to three-year payback period on average and have a target to open on a gross base around 200 franchise stores in 2025. We are also focused on special channel store development with 18 new store openings in locations such as railway stations, airports, highway rest areas, hospitals, universities, and schools, etc. As of 06/30/2025, our registered loyalty club members reached 26.2 million, reflecting a remarkable 22.4% year-over-year growth. The average number of members per store is now close to 26,000, serving as a strong catalyst for our future growth.
On product category and offering in China's highly competitive beverage market, April marked the onset of peak seasonal demand, triggering intensified rivalry among brands aiming to capture market share and drive top-line growth. Therefore, TH International Limited executed a focused product-led strategy in Q2, strengthening its position across key consumption occasions and customer segments. We introduced a total of 43 new items during the quarter, 28 beverages, and 15 food products, reflecting our commitment to innovation and menu diversification. This low-cost pipeline supports our dual goals of increasing same-store sales and expanding our consumer base.
On beverage portfolio expansion, to meet growing consumer demand for healthier, lighter beverage options, we launched the sparkling cold brew series, building on the success of our grape variant with additional fruit-inspired flavors. The sparkling texture differentiates the line from our value-tier Americano, while the use of cold brew coffee enhances the perceived quality and attracts black coffee enthusiasts seeking a refreshing upgrade. For our milk coffee drinkers, we reintroduced the water buffalo milk series, leveraging its naturally creamy, lightly sweet profile that resonates well in warmer weather. Positioning alongside our affordable like, pay offers, this creates a compelling product mix that strengthens our appeal across both price-sensitive and premium-seeking customers.
Recognizing rising demand for non-coffee options, particularly among families and younger guests, we expanded into adjacent categories by launching a series of non-coffee beverages, including the ice cap line as well as cold tea, etc. This product leverages existing product ingredients and infrastructure, enabling efficient innovation while broadening our afternoon reach. Together, these initiatives have enhanced the depth and balance of our beverage portfolio across price tiers and consumer needs, driving higher basket diversity and category penetration. Online time growth and data expansion, building on the successful launch of the live and fit lunch box series in Q1, we expanded the platform in Q2 with two new formats, the rock series and the energy ball series.
These additions reinforce our positioning in the growing light and healthy VO segments to strengthen our competitive advantage during the lunch daypart. We are confident that the full live meal box lineup not only meets rising demand for nutritious, convenient meals but also serves as a catalyst for traffic growth. Early data indicate a positive spillover effect with increased lunchtime business contributing to higher engagement during the breakfast and even during the daypart. Beyond revenue generation, this initiative enhances brand equity by positioning TH International Limited as a proven provider of balanced and everyday solutions, not just coffee.
In July, we announced the appointment of an immensely popular and talented singer-songwriter and influencer, Lars Wong, as our official brand ambassador for the year. Last, we launched a dynamic series of collaborations aimed at expanding the reach of the TH International Limited brand and introducing its flavorful, healthy, and light products to ever-growing audiences, especially among Gen Z consumers. These efforts are designed to drive traffic, increase average transaction value, and establish new consumption occasions. At this time, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Albert Li, to discuss our second quarter 2024 financial performance in more detail.
Albert Li: Thank you, Yongchen. We continued to demonstrate our capabilities to further improve our financial performance by refining store unit economics and driving efficiencies at both store and corporate levels. Our subfranchisee and retail business contributed steady cash flows and profitability. In 2024, we further improved our company-owned and operated store contribution margin and adjusted corporate EBITDA margin by 2.7 and 2.8 percentage points year over year, respectively. We remain focused on delivering high value for quality, healthy products, and thoughtful services to our ever-growing customer base. Our overall monthly average transacting customers reached 3.59 million in Q2 2024, a 14.3% increase from 3.14 million in the same quarter of 2023.
Additionally, digital orders as a percentage of total orders rose from 86.5% in Q2 2023 to an all-time high of 90.4% in Q2 2024. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities to meet the growing demand for delivery and takeaway services. In Q2, our company-owned and operated store revenues dropped by 12.5% year over year, which was primarily due to the planned closure of certain underperforming stores and a 3.6% decrease in same-store sales growth. We have seen positive same-store transaction growth since April, and our same-store transaction growth was positive 3.4% in Q2. In the meantime, revenues from our franchised business and retail business increased by 50.7% year over year.
The number of our franchised stores increased from 333 as of 06/30/2023 to 449 as of 06/30/2024. Our system sales increased by 1.4% year over year. We also made significant progress in boosting operational efficiency in Q2, setting the stage for our long-term sustainable growth. Through refinements in our supply chain capabilities and economies of scale, we reduced the food and packaging costs as a percentage of revenues from company-owned and operated stores by 0.8 percentage points year over year. Food and packaging costs accounted for 30.1% of our company-owned and operated store revenues during the quarter. We continued to streamline our operations by pruning underperforming stores, refining staffing arrangements, and optimizing store managerial efficiency.
These actions led to a year-over-year reduction in labor costs and other store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues from company-owned and operated stores by 1.0 and 0.4 percentage points year over year, respectively. Rental and property management fees as a percentage of revenues from company-owned and operated stores increased by 0.9 percentage points from 19.3% in 2023 to 20.2% in the same quarter of 2024, which was primarily due to a 3.6% decrease in same-store sales volume growth for company-owned and operated stores in 2024.
Delivery costs as a percentage of revenues from company-owned and operated stores increased by 1.8 percentage points to 11.8% in 2024 compared to 10% in the same quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to the higher delivery revenue mix as a percentage of total revenues from company-owned and operated stores. The number of delivery orders for company-owned and operated stores increased by 10.2% year over year. We made more efforts to promote our newly launched Light and Fit Lunchbox series products. Our marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues accounted for approximately 4% during the quarter, an increase of 0.5 percentage points year over year.
Our general and administrative expenses decreased by 5.2% year over year, which was primarily due to our cost optimization measures at the headquarter level. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively stable at 10.8% in 2023 and 2024. As a result of the foregoing effects, we have been able to achieve positive adjusted corporate EBITDA again during the quarter as we achieved earlier in 2023. Turning to liquidity. As of 06/30/2024, our total cash and cash equivalents, time deposits, and restricted cash were RMB 10.778 billion compared to RMB 184.2 million as of 12/31/2023.
The change was primarily attributable to cash disbursements on the back of the expansion of our business, partially offset by the drawdown of additional bank borrowings. Looking ahead, with profitable growth always being front and center of everything we do, we are poised to further enhance our operational efficiencies such as supply chain optimizations and rigorous cost controls to roll out our differentiating made-to-order fresh and healthy food preparation model to drive traffic, to optimize the overall store unit economics, and to accelerate the expansion of our successful sub-franchising. And I will now turn it over to Yongchen for concluding remarks followed by Q&A.
Yongchen Lu: Yes. Thank you, Albert. Our second quarter performance reflects continuous improvements and the resiliency of our business and execution as well as both challenges and opportunities in this industry. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our guests, team members, business partners, shareholders, and everyone supporting our endeavors and journey. Together, we have built over 1,000 stores in 90 cities, and a robust community of now over 26 million loyal club members, a unique coffee plus fresh prepared food business model offering the best value for quality products, a unique advantage of offering franchise opportunities as an international company in China, and refined store unit economics with a check payback period within two to three years.
With these milestones, we are steadfast in our commitment to sustainable profit growth and to generating long-term value for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Gemma for today's Q&A session.
Gemma Bakx: Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Yongchen. We will turn it over to Q&A now and open it up for our registered questions. Let's begin with the first one. Go ahead, operator.
Operator: Thank you. We will take our first question from the phone lines. This is from the line of Steve Silver from Argus Research Corporation. Please go ahead.
Steve Silver: Thank you, operator, and thank you for taking my questions. I was hoping you could provide your current thinking on the rate at which you can review the growing number of sub-franchise applications to accelerate the rate of new store growth and ultimately return to net store growth?
Yongchen Lu: Yes. I mean, I want to clarify, okay. I mean, for the Q2, we continue to improve underperforming company-owned stores as well as franchised stores, especially those non-MTO stores, those Express stores. Among the 49 closures in Q2, 41 were such non-MTO Express stores. So if we exclude these stores, actually, we had 31 net openings of MTO stores. So, I mean, based on the pipeline we have so far, our target is still to open around 200 new MTO stores in 2025 on a gross basis. And we'll open the majority at the subfranchisee stores, and we'll continue to improve underperforming stores over the year to improve profitability.
So, I mean, last year, this year, we'll continue to close nonperforming stores and aim at improving profitability. And we expect, okay, now we'll have over 100 net openings this year, and we expect, okay, 200 to 300 new openings every year in the next few years.
Steve Silver: Okay. Thank you. So it looks like the company continues to make good progress in managing its costs, although marketing expenses did go up as a percentage of revenues in Q2. Curious as to your thoughts on how sustainable that trend would be? And what impact it would have on the business same-store sales growth and its margins?
Yongchen Lu: Yes. I mean, our same-store sales have been recovering well. And we expect we will have positive same-store sales in the third quarter and in the second half of the year. And now the market spends in the second quarter, some part of the third quarter was to support the lunch box campaign. I mean, lunch box is a big campaign this year and which has been improving which has been working so far. As we can see, the food contribution has been continuing now to grow, and we have reached the historical high of the contribution in the second quarter. And we expect, okay, that will continue.
Steve Silver: Great. And one last one for me, just a big picture question. Just in terms of how TH International Limited is balancing the need to invest in order to grow revenues while at the same time being conservative with operating capital, really just your current thinking about your capital needs in order for TH International Limited to take the next steps towards sustainable profitable growth?
Albert Li: Okay. Sure, Steve. I think let me address this question. So as we just mentioned during the earnings call, we returned to positive adjusted corporate EBITDA this quarter as we did in the second and third quarter of last year. So we believe we are very close to full-year adjusted corporate EBITDA breakeven as of this moment. So which means, you know, we are very close to, you know, realizing or achieving operating cash flow self-sufficient. So in terms of that, I think we are not, like, actually putting cash on at the operating level.
So in the meantime, you know, if we could secure additional capital, actually, we continue working very hard on that, I think, in terms of securing, like, more bank loans onshore. And also, you know, we are also working on, like, certain financing plans for the company to bring more capital to the company and to the business. So if we could, like, actually secure more additional financing capital, we would consider opening more profitable company-owned and operated stores in the meantime. So honestly speaking, we want to achieve a very good balance between opening more company-owned stores and also in terms of balancing our overall financial position. So hopefully, I can address your question here.
Steve Silver: Yes. That was helpful. Thank you very much.
Albert Li: Thank you, Steve.
Operator: Thank you. I will now hand back to Gemma to read the questions coming through via the webcast.
Gemma Bakx: Yes. Thank you, Sarah. We received a couple of questions online. You already commented on same-store sales trends. Is there anything additional you can say about those trends thus far? And also, in particular, your outlook for the remainder of the year that you haven't addressed when you spoke with this earlier?
Yongchen Lu: Yes. We talked about the same stores already. I mean, we will improve quarter by quarter. And in the second quarter, the same-store sales decreased, what has been now to only 3.6%. And we have seen, you know, a very positive trend in recent months. And again, we expect, okay, we'll achieve positive same-store sales in Q3 and in the second half of this year.
Gemma Bakx: Okay. And could you provide an update on the refinancing of the convertible debt?
Yongchen Lu: Yes. We are in good progress right now, and we will disclose when it's running.
Gemma Bakx: Okay. Another question we received online is how can we better monetize the team's loyalty members, which is sort of 26 million by now. The question is about the theoretical spend of $1 per member per week and what that would generate in annual sales. What is realistic in this regard? And how could this be better monetized?
Yongchen Lu: Yeah. It's a great question, but it's also a very challenging question. No. I mean, we kind of have a gold mine. We need to dig and derive the value from the memberships. So we have the mine there, and we need to design a good product and campaign and attract those members to spend more in our stores. I mean, that's something that we are working on every day.
Gemma Bakx: Okay. The last question I have online is do you expect your liquidity position to improve going forward?
Albert Li: Yeah. I think as, you know, what I have explained to Steve's last question. So, actually, we are actually approaching operating cash flow self-sufficient. So we do not expect to burn cash. And in the meantime, we are working very hard to bring in new capital to the company. So as of this moment, I think we are very confident that we can actually we are in a good liquidity position for now.
Gemma Bakx: Sarah, those were the questions I have that came in online.
Operator: Thank you. And as a reminder, to ask a question via the webcast, you can type it into the box and click Submit. Please stand by while we check for any further questions. There are no further questions at this time. So with that, that concludes today's question and answer session. I would like to hand the call back to Yongchen for closing remarks.
Yongchen Lu: Thank you always for your time and attention. And as mentioned earlier, we are optimistic about the second half of the year. We are at a turning point of, you know, parts of same-store sales and parts of, you know, corporate EBITDA. So we'll see you again in Q3 and report back the good news. Thank you.
Gemma Bakx: Thank you all very much.
Yongchen Lu: Thank you. Bye-bye.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.
Trump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush
The Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech. Over $1.5 trillion is already flowing into infrastructure, AI, and advanced manufacturing… and the number keeps climbing.
Following a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape, and we think the real winner is a company 1/100th the size of NVIDIA.
It builds the tech infrastructure that Apple, OpenAI, and others suddenly can’t live without. We just released a full write-up on this under-the-radar stock — and why now might be the exact moment to move.

The numbers are impressive: Naturals2Go has helped 2,500 new operators get started since 2009, placing 40,000 machines. And, according to the company, they have a 14% market share. Vending is a hot business, and from all indications, it is now a meaningful part of the gig economy.
In this episode of Automatic Merchandiser’s Vending & OCS Nation, the podcast for the convenience services industry, produced by Endeavor Business Media, a Division of EndeavorB2B, host Bob Tullio talked to Natali Pupovac-Peters, head of global operations at Naturals2Go Healthy Vending.
Naturals2Go is a company that appears to be taking an extremely responsible approach to introducing the convenience services business to people who are attracted to the business opportunity.
She takes us behind the scenes and pulls back the curtain on their fast-growing operation — talking about their role as an operator, a seller of business opportunity, an equipment manufacturer and a company that is doing all they can to support new operators while keeping their expectations in check. All the while, making sure their operators understand that convenience services are not some magical “passive income” business.
No time to listen? Prefer to read? Here is an edited podcast transcript:
One thing that has been very obvious at industry conventions — whether it be the NAMA show, the Coffee, Tea & Water show, or even regional gatherings like ACE, the Atlantic Coast Exposition — is the influx of new operators.
For some, convenience services — vending in particular — have become part of the gig economy. Those TikTok videos showing vending operators with fistfuls of cash and the promise of vending being a passive income business — that’s pretty attractive.
On today’s episode, I’m talking to Natali Pupovac-Peters, head of global operations at Naturals2Go, a company that appears to be taking an extremely responsible approach to introducing the convenience services business to people who are attracted to the business opportunity.
Let me set the table for the interview by giving you some facts about Naturals2Go, provided to me by Pupovac-Peters. The company started in 1988 as an operator of gumball machines — you know, the U-turn-it machines. Today, the company is owned by Heath Falzarano, who is president as well.
Today, they are an established full-line operator. That division of the company is called Naturals2Go Plus, and they currently have branches in Pennsylvania; in Savannah, Ga.; Chattanooga, Tenn.; Tulsa, Okla.; and El Paso, Texas. More are on the way, according to Pupovac-Peters.
The business opportunity division kicked off in 2009. It is called Naturals2Go, and they have helped 2,500 individuals get started and 40,000 machines on the street: A14% overall market share, according to Pupovac-Peters. They have what Pupovac-Peters calls a boots-on-the-ground and in-house sales team to help operators find qualified locations.
Naturals2Go had a huge presence at the 2025 NAMA show as an exhibitor, and they are active in NAMA advocacy efforts such as the Fly-In. The company’s Ventech division is their equipment manufacturing arm — everything from vending machines to micro markets to VMS systems. Between their own operating entity and the network of operators in their program, Pupovac-Peters said, they have landed some national accounts, including a large car dealership group, and they are pursuing more.
As a long-time operator myself, I had plenty of experience meeting people who had entered the vending business, ushered in by entities that did not have good intentions in mind, and were certainly not concerned about whether or not the operator was successful. No reflection on Naturals2Go by any means, but I started the interview pulling no punches. It was not a surprise to Pupovac-Peters.
You know, as an operator, I would go into locations — and this has nothing to do with Naturals2Go — but there are a lot of folks out there that are putting different models like this together or models that loosely follow what you folks are doing. And I would go into locations, and you’d have this location, and the machines were sitting there empty. They’re machines that I personally would never have purchased in a million years because they were U-turn-it type machines, that type of thing. Then ultimately I was told, you know, that the operator just abandoned the equipment because the sales weren’t there was misrepresented.
Bob Tullio: So, you know, there’s been a lot of criticism — not of your company — but of people who are involved in ushering people into the vending business. Tell me what the difference is. What really sets your company apart? Tell me why people should turn to Naturals2Go with confidence, and what really the differentiator is?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: That’s a great question. And I will start with a little story, actually, kind of going back to prior to getting into this world myself. So, when I originally learned about Naturals2Go, I actually considered becoming an operator myself. And the only reason I didn’t is because they weren’t available in Canada yet. And I remember mentioning this to my partner in the recruitment business.
And she said, “No, no, no, I know somebody that went into that business. Don’t do it. You know, he said he will never go back to that business again because he had such a bad experience.”
And I asked, “Well, why? What happened?”
And my business partner told me that he said he’d bought a bunch of vending machines, thought this was going to be a great idea. And then what happened is they just sat in his garage for a long time, or he placed them in places that just didn’t make money — the way that somebody promised him that they would. So exactly what you’re talking about, Bob.
It’s interesting because I totally understood where she was coming from, but I could see how Naturals2Go was different.
You know, vending is one of those businesses that I think people just thought, “This was an easy business to get into.” And it is — if you know what to do and if you have somebody guiding you along the way. So, I think that the big difference with Naturals2Go, well, it’s a few things. One, it really is that business in a box and we have all the support to make sure that somebody is going to succeed as long as they put the effort into it.
Don’t get me wrong, no business is going to be successful if you don’t put in the work. We really do provide that one-stop shop. Anything that you need, you can get from Naturals2Go, whether that’s service, whether that’s different types of machines, whether that’s tech support, telemetry support, whatever it is, we can provide it right inside Naturals2Go, which is really nice. So we’re able to take people from the point of not knowing anything about the business to the point of running a $20 million operation.
We have experience because we were operators ourselves or we are operators ourselves, I should say. We’re not just people that learn about the business through other people. We know about it because we’re in it ourselves. So that’s the one big differentiator.
Two, this company and one of the things that really attracted me to this company, is the people and the focus on people.
I say that because I remember when I first started, and my first task was actually to create the account management team. And I remember coming up with the plan and saying this is what I would do. And I said, “OK, here’s the ideal scenario, but here’s the cost-efficient scenario.”
And I remember [company president] Heath [Falzarano] looked at me and he was like, “Tell me what the best thing is for us to do for our operators. I don’t care what it costs. I don’t care about the bottom line. I care about what’s best for the operator. If it’s the right thing to do for the operators, then just do it. The money will come. The money will follow.”
It’s that focus on the operator that’s put us to where we are. We’ve had some amazing hockey stick growth, as we call it, over the last several years. And I think it’s because of that focus on people, both from us caring about our operators and then also teaching our operators to care about their customers. So, one of the things that Heath likes to do in training is ask the operators, “Who here is now in the vending business?”
And so many people put up their hand, and he says, “No, no, you’re in the people business that just happens to be in snacks and beverages.”
Service is king. This industry hasn’t always provided very good service. And you know, you’ve been in it for a long time — or you were — and it doesn’t always have the best reputation because people just abandoned their machine because they leave them sitting empty. We don’t do that. And we really train our operators to not do that. Because if you do this business properly, you can create a really great business for yourself.
Bob Tullio: Training is a big part of it. Talk to me a little bit more about that.
Natali Pupovac-Peters: Training is probably one of the biggest parts of it. And it’s actually where my experience was in the corporate world before I went out on my own was in training and development.
So, even when I joined Naturals2Go and I didn’t know vending, and I was trying to learn my way through vending, training I knew. My first day I went to an operator training that used to be held in Buffalo. I went to it and I went, oh, this is, it’s great, but it could be so much better.
We really turned the training upside down on its head a couple of months after I came. So, my first task was the account management team. My second task was the training. We receive absolute rave reviews from the training that we hold every six weeks in Savannah. It’s two days of hands-on, of experiences, [and] of storytelling. And it’s something that we put a lot of pride into because it’s setting people up for success. That training makes all the difference.
They’re going to forget 90% of what they learn in that training. So how do we support them after training? Because nobody can learn the business in two days and be successful. It’s about the ongoing support. So all our trainers have also been operators themselves. So they’re teaching from experience, which makes a big difference.
Bob Tullio: Talk to me about the channels of business that a Naturals2Go operator can get into. Obviously, vending is the core. Micro markets?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: Yeah, absolutely. Yes.
Bob Tullio: Smart markets at this point?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: Absolutely.
Bob Tullio: Being manufactured by you guys?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: No, so we don’t manufacture our own smart markets right now, but we’re very picky with who we partner with. So, we only partner with the best out there.
Our micro markets we do manufacture on our own. So it’s something that we just started doing earlier this year. I think people start in vending and with the vending machines because that’s the simple route. That’s the easiest route to really learn the business.
And I do recommend it because once you go to micro markets, that’s a different kind of business. It’s not something that you can do as a part-time gig. It is a full-time investment. So, it is a fantastic one out there, and you’re going to be making three or four times the amount that you do from a vending machine. So I think the opportunity is fantastic, and it’s something that we encourage our operators to do, and many of them have gone down that route very successfully.
Some just don’t have interest because it’s a different type of investment both not only financially but also timewise.
Bob Tullio: What about coffee service?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: Yeah, coffee service is something that we do. I told you, Bob, we’re a one-stop shop. We do just about everything out there, and coffee service is actually one that I hope we can grow over the next several years because I think there’s a huge opportunity.
But again, it’s just, requires a lot more maintenance and a lot more attention than a vending machine does. Again, it has to be the right operator. And we have operators out there that do it all. They have the vending, the micro markets, the coffee, pantry services, and AI coolers; they do it all, and they do it really well.
And then we have ones that go, know what? Everything else scares me. Let me stick to the vending machines. That’s okay, too.
Bob Tullio: What percentage of your, you say 2,500 operators you’ve ushered into the business. What percentage of those operators are full-time, and what percentage of those operators would you say are kind of doing it on a gig basis?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: I don’t know how accurate of a number I can give you. I actually haven’t done the analysis, if I’m being completely honest. But I’d say the majority of them come into the business wanting to be full-time, but they come in kind of dipping their toes in the water.
Bob Tullio: Sure.
Natali Pupovac-Peters: They start with four, five, six, maybe 10 machines — something that they can run part-time and between a couple of people on the side of their full-time job. And many of them have the goal of quitting their full-time job and doing vending full-time, getting into the unattended retail space.
And I would say that it’s interesting when we do connect with operators, even at NAMA, we connect with some operators that were able to make that dream come true. And I think a lot of them do, but again, it takes the time and investment — both financial and time-wise — in order to make that happen.
Bob Tullio: It’s not a franchise operation, but how does Naturals2Go make money?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: We make very little money on the initial purchase. Of course, you know, the initial purchase, that’s one way. But really, our focus and our desire are to help operators grow. That’s where we end up making the money is when they come back and they buy more machines from us. Primarily up until now, we’ve made money from people coming into the business, people growing their business. So that’s why it’s so important for us to provide good service, good training and ongoing support and service because we want people to come back and buy from us because that’s how we make money.
Similar to our franchise, unless our franchisees — or our operators, in this case — make money, we don’t make money.
Bob Tullio: Okay, so it’s related a lot to equipment sales.
Natali Pupovac-Peters: Yes, at this point it is.
Bob Tullio: The number one business killer out there is lack of capital. Do you vet operators when they come in to see if they have the capability to stand on their own two feet financially? And what kind of financial support does your company offer?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: Everybody’s focus is, know, do you have the working capital? Because as much as this is a simple business, and it can be a very fruitful business to be in, it doesn’t happen overnight. And it is something that we try to be very candid about and make sure that people have the right working capital to get into the business. Because, like you said, that’s a very quick way to kill the entrepreneurial spirit, and to kill a business, is by bootstrapping it so much that now you have very little wiggle room.
Bob Tullio: Can you name a couple of success stories of operators who maybe dipped their toe in the water, then got into it and really ran with it?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: Now, a lot of our trainers are people who are great examples of that. Anybody who’s come to our training knows a gentleman that we like to call Super Dave. So, he’s somebody who went into retirement and thought, “Oh, you know what, I want a little side business,” and, you know, bought a few machines and now runs over 140 machines and micro markets out there.
He said, “Well, that retirement didn’t work out the way I planned.”
And then, actually, one of our executives is somebody who was one of the very first owner operators for Naturals2Go and ended up growing a business to — I don’t even know the exact number — but it was well over 500. And then he ended up coming internal, and is now helping us run that operator side of it internally. So what we call Naturals2Go Plus — those are our own vending operations that we run.
So now he oversees those. It’s a simple business, but it still requires work and dedication and time and energy and that patience. And anybody can get there. That’s the nice thing about this business, you don’t have to have a special set of skills or experiences to be successful in.
Bob Tullio: That’s great.
Natali Pupovac-Peters: We are a national company. We’re doing this on a large scale. However, our operators are local owner operators, so they get that small personal touch and feel, but they get supported by a big national organization. So it’s almost the best of both worlds because the vending industry has typically been a very mom-and-pop, fragmented type of industry. And now we’re able to provide that personal touch, that personal experience and service, but do it with also a national support in the background.
Bob Tullio: What’s the best piece of advice you have for someone who wants to come into the business?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: Do it. Is that too simple?
Bob Tullio: Because it’s a nice passive income business?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: No, absolutely not. That goes to our key messaging out there right now. And even with our sales team, we don’t have trouble bringing operators in. It’s a hot business now. Everybody’s curious about it [and] people want to be in it.
You and I were talking before the podcast started and talked about the fact that it’s an industry that’s been around for so long, but it was always just kind of this thing that ran in the background. And now looking at it, it was almost very, it’s a very neat business from there’s so much that goes into it. So if you’re into technology, there’s that piece to it. If you’re into customer service, there’s that piece to it. AI, there’s that piece to it. If you’re into business development, there’s that piece to it.
It covers all the different segments of business. But I think the biggest message that we try to tell operators is it’s a simple business, but you still have to work hard and dedicate your time, energy and money to it. But if you stay in it, and you can get through those tough times of finding the best locations and optimizing the machine and putting the best products in there and finding the best staff to help you and finding the best products and all that type of stuff. It’s going to be a very fruitful business.
Bob Tullio: Here’s what I say to my friends when they’re going to try to make a four-foot putt. I say, take your time with that one. So, here’s the question. What’s the secret sauce at Naturals2Go?
Natali Pupovac-Peters: One, the people. It’s really what attracted me to the business in the first place, the people. I think the combination of the people that we have is very interesting, and we are full of entrepreneurs.
So up until a couple of years ago, think something like 70, 80% of our staff were actually operators themselves. We’ve tripled in size in the last two years while I’ve been there. So when I joined, it was a 50-person company. Now we have over 160 employees.
The second thing I would say is that we’re not afraid to fail or do something wrong — in the sense that we know that’s how we learn.
So I remember when I first took this job, and I’ll never forget, you know, I was on the phone with Heath, and I said, Okay, I’m in. And he said, “I can’t wait to watch you fail.”
And I thought, “Well, that was a weird thing to say to somebody who just accepted this executive position.” And now it really makes sense. It really allowed me to not be scared to take chances to do things differently.
And we’re very big and now within my teams, when somebody is like, I had this idea, but I don’t know, it may be the wrong move. It’s like, that’s okay. If it’s the wrong move, then we’ll stop doing it and we’ll do something else. And really allowing people to not be afraid to make mistakes. I think it’s what’s allowed us to more than quadruple the size of this company in a few years.
And then I’d say the third thing, that’s our secret sauce, is that we’re never going to be satisfied with where we are. I think we’re always going to have a desire to do more because we have this culture of just never wanting to stop growing and improving. Because no matter how good something is, it can always be a little bit better. That’s something that really stems from the people, and the leadership is really going to continue to make sure that we’re going to be successful for many years to come.

US stocks nudged higher on Tuesday as Wall Street absorbed President Trump's bid to remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook and investors turned their focus to Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings this week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. The move higher among the major gauges follows a pullback in stocks on Monday after a record-setting rally at the end of last week.
Investors are treading carefully after Trump took to social media to ramp up pressure in his Fed feud and in his trade offensive.
The president said late Monday that he had determined there was ""sufficient cause"" to oust Cook, after the top Fed official resisted persistent demands for her resignation over allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook said she won't step down. Cook's attorney said she would file a lawsuit to challenge what he called an ""illegal action.""
On Tuesday, Trump signaled that his administration has ""very good people"" in mind for Cook's position, adding that he expects to soon hold ""a majority"" at the Fed, paving the way to lower rates.
Longer-dated US bond prices fell amid concerns over Trump's moves against Fed independence, as he pushed for interest rate cuts that could stoke inflation. The yield on 10-year (^TNX) Treasurys fell to 4.26%, while longer-term 30-year (^TYX) Treasurys rose to 4.9%. The US dollar (DX=F) index fell.
On the trade front, Trump vowed to impose fresh tariffs and export curbs on chips and technology from countries that ""unfairly"" placed taxes on US digital services, speaking in a Monday social media post. The reprisal risks escalating trade tensions between the US and the European Union, which defended its use of the measures on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Wall Street is bracing for Nvidia (NVDA) earnings, which land Wednesday after the bell. Expectations for its results are sky-high, with the company's stock up almost 34% so far this year, even as restrictions on chip sales to China have possibly cost the company billions.

Stocks rise as Trump pushes to oust Fed's Cook, Nvidia earnings in focus
US stocks climbed on Tuesday as President Trump indicated he will soon have a majority at the Fed when he replaces Fed Governor Lisa Cook, while investors await Nvidia (NVDA) earnings this week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% as Nvidia stock edged higher ahead of the AI chip giant's earnings release on Wednesday after the bell.
Trump said he has ""very good people"" in mind to replace Cook, who he removed from the Fed board via a letter posted on social media.
Cook has said she will not step down, and her lawyer vowed to sue.

Fed says it will 'abide by any court decision' on Lisa Cook
The Federal Reserve responded to Trump's move to oust Fed Governor Lisa Cook, who has said she would not leave while her lawyer signaled a lawsuit was coming.
""Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,"" read a Fed statement.
“As always, the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision,"" read the statement.

Trump says 'we have some very good people' to replace Fed governor Lisa Cook
President Trump said on Tuesday that he may nominate Stephen Miran for a long-term seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and expects to hold a majority at the central bank soon in order to push rate lower.
The remarks were made during a cabinet meeting, where Trump was asked about a variety of topics.
The remarks followed his social media post of a letter to Fed Governor Lisa Cook, stating he was removing her over an alleged mortgage fraud incident. Cook has said she will not resign, and her lawyer has signaled a lawsuit over the matter.
When asked about a replacement for Cook, Trump stated, “We have some very good people for that position, and I think we have some very good people we’re down to.""
Trump has been pushing for more control of Federal Reserve policy, hurling social media insults at Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting rates during his term.
Stephen Miran was tapped earlier this month to replace Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned early from her term, which was set to expire on Jan. 31, 2026.

Bitcoin drops to hover near $110,000 as rotation into ethereum heats up
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices fell to the $110,000 level on Tuesday, but a rotation into ethereum (ETH-USD) lifted the world's second-largest cryptocurrency.
A bitcoin rally following Fed Chair Powell's speech in Jackson Hole last Friday continued to fade as investors took profits off the table.
""Adding to the pressure is investor rotation into ethereum, which has accelerated in recent times, with ETH-linked products posting multi-billion-dollar inflows already in August in light of recent strong ETH outperformance,"" said Leo Zhao, Investment Director at MEXC Ventures.
Ethereum's native coin, ether, rose more than 1% on Tuesday to hover above $4,500. ETH has surged roughly 36% year to-date, while bitcoin is up about 18% during the same period.
Corporate purchases of crypto, along with favorable regulation and increased inflows into spot ETFs, have helped lift prices in recent months.

Gold trades near record highs as Trump's Fed push fuels 'growing global investor unease'
Gold (GC=F) prices moved higher Tuesday to trade near record levels after President Trump moved to oust Fed governor Lisa Cook late Monday over alleged mortgage fraud, raising fresh concerns about the central bank's independence.
Wall Street sees the precious metal's upward movement as far from over, especially if Cook, who has refused to step down, is replaced.
""We think the episode will add to growing global investor unease over Trump's efforts to influence the independent central bank,"" UBS chief investment officer Americas and Global Head of Equities Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi said.
Gold futures in New York gained 0.48% to hover near $3,, roughly $100 away from record highs. Spot prices edged 0.4% higher to near $3,380, the highest level since Aug. 11.

Furniture stocks slip after Trump says substantial tariffs on imports will come soon
President Trump said ""very substantial"" tariffs on furniture imports will come quickly, sending shares of RH (RH), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), and Arhaus (ARHS) lower.
Trump commented on the tariffs during a live Cabinet meeting on Tuesday afternoon.

Trump wants more furniture manufacturing to happen in the US.

Consumer confidence dips in August
Consumer confidence fell in August as pessimism about the job market and tariff-related inflation outweighed optimism over future business conditions.
The Conference Board's August reading for consumer confidence fell by 1.3 points to 97.4, down from 98.7 in July. Consumers' assessments of current market conditions and short-term expectations also weakened, with the expectations index falling 1.2 points to 74.8. Expectations readings below 80 typically signal a recession ahead.
12-month inflation expectations also picked back up in August, rising to 6.2% from 5.7% in July but below the April peak of
“Consumer confidence dipped slightly in August but remained at a level similar to those of the past three months,” said Stephanie Guichard, Senior Economist, Global Indicators at The Conference Board. “Notably, consumers’ appraisal of current job availability declined for the eighth consecutive month, but stronger views of current business conditions mitigated the retreat in the Present Situation Index. Meanwhile, pessimism about future job availability inched up and optimism about future income faded slightly. However, these were partly offset by stronger expectations for future business conditions.”

Cracker Barrel stock pops after Trump says company should go back to its old logo
Cracker Barrel's (CBRL) controversial redesign has made its way to the president's desk.
On Tuesday, shares of the restaurant operator rose 5% after President Trump called on the company to change its logo back following a redesign it unveiled last week, which sent shares tumbling amid broad customer backlash.
""Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social Tuesday morning.
""They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right. Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity. Have a major News Conference today. Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again.""
Cracker Barrel stock fell more than 14% last week after the company announced the fifth evolution of its logo to a more minimalist look, removing the image of Uncle Herschel.

Trump Media stock jumps after announcing plans to launch crypto treasury firm
Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) climbed nearly 5% after the company, in which President Trump is a majority stakeholder, said it's partnering with Crypto.com to launch a new crypto treasury firm.
The new company, called Trump Media Group CRO Strategy, will accumulate Crypto.com's own cryptocurrency, Cronos.
The announcement follows Trump Media's move in May to launch a bitcoin treasury, following the trend of companies across various sectors adding bitcoin to their balance sheets to try to replicate the success of crypto advocate Michael Saylor's company Strategy (MSTR).
The latest news adds to Trump's rapidly expanding crypto empire, just as the president ushers in regulations to cement digital tokens as legitimate currencies.

AMD stock jumps as Truist upgrades to Buy, chipmaker announces quantum computing partnership with IBM
Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) climbed nearly 2% after the company announced a new partnership with IBM (IBM).
The companies said they're developing a ""hybrid"" model of computing combining IBM's quantum computers with AMD's AI chips.
IBM in June said it is building the world's first large-scale quantum computer capable of operating without errors, set to launch by 2029.
""As we partner with IBM to explore the convergence of high-performance computing and quantum technologies, we see tremendous opportunities to accelerate discovery and innovation,"" AMD CEO Lisa Su saidin a statement.
Also boosting AMD stock, Truist Securities analyst William Stein upgraded his rating on shares to Buy from Hold. Stein said that, while he saw AMD's AI chips initially only being used as a ""price check"" to Nvidia, now ""hyperscalers are working with AMD in a partnership manner, expressing true interest in deploying AMD at scale.""
Stein said that AMD's gain on Intel in the CPU market (central processing units, or traditional computer chips) could provide a model for AMD gaining on Nvidia in the GPU (graphics processing units, or AI chips) market.
Stein raised his price target on the stock to $213 from $173.

Defense stocks steady after Lutnick says Trump admin. is thinking about taking stakes in defense contractors
Defense stocks held steady after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's Squawk Box on Tuesday that the Trump administration was thinking about taking stakes in top defense contractors after the US took a 9.9% stake in Intel (INTC).
When asked about the potential for the administration to strike other deals with US companies that do business with the government, Lutnick replied: “Oh, there’s a monstrous discussion about defense.”
""Lockheed Martin makes 97% of their revenue from the US government; they are basically an arm of the US government,"" Lutnick said. ""But what’s the economics of that? I’m going to leave that to my Secretary of Defense and the deputy Secretary of Defense. These guys are on it, and they’re thinking about it.""
Lockheed Martin (LMT) stock rose 0.4% in premarket trading.
RTX (RTX) shares also rose 0.4%, while L3Harris (LHX) gained 0.2%, and Northrop Grumman (NOC) was roughly flat. Meanwhile, shares of Palantir (PLTR) fell 0.9%.
Lutnick's comments come after President Trump said Monday morning that he wanted to see ""many more cases"" like Intel.
""I will make deals like that for our Country all day long,"" Trump said.

EchoStar stock surges on $23 billion spectrum sale to AT&T
Shares of EchoStar (SATS) rocketed higher in premarket trading, up 65% as investors welcomed news the company has sold a tranche of wireless spectrum to AT&T (T) in a $23 billion deal.
“This transaction is part of EchoStar‘s ongoing efforts to resolve the Federal Communications Commission’s inquiries,” Dish TV owner EchoStar said in a statement on Tuesday.
In May, the FCC told EchoStar it was investigating its obligations to provide 5G wireless service in the US, with a focus on buildout extension and mobile-satellite service. The following month, President Trump urged the company to come to a deal with the FCC over spectrum licences, reports said.
The licenses cover more than 400 markets across the US in total and will strengthen AT&T's low-band and mid-band spectrum holdings, the communications giant said, per Reuters.

While Nicholas Wealth Management has been on the leading edge in its use of ETFs—it has launched several of its own funds since 2021—the firm’s core clientele tends to be on the risk-averse side of the spectrum. The Atlanta-based firm, with $254 million in pure RIA AUM (it has another $421 million in AUM through its ETFs, securities and annuity holdings), serves primarily Fortune 500 employees in or nearing retirement. For them, current income is a far more important goal than future outsized returns, according to David Nicholas, founder and president of Nicholas Wealth Management.
Still, Nicholas prefers to deliver that higher yield when it’s possible. WealthManagement.com recently spoke with him about the strategies the firm uses to do so.

WM: Can you describe your average client?
DN: We have a niche in the retirement market. We are generally working with clients who are 55 years old on the younger end and into their 70s. So many Americans have 401Ks. We are in Atlanta, so we have a lot of big Fortune 500 companies, like Coca-Cola, Home Depot, and private companies like Chick-fil-A that are still very large. [Our clients] may have been investing in their 401K for all their working career, and now they have to make these big decisions on retirement—""Who do I work with? How do I manage it?” That’s where we provide value. I would say our average [client net worth] is somewhere between $800,000 investable to $5 million.
WM: What’s your overall investment philosophy?
DN: Given the nature of who our clients are, this is not a 25-year-old who has high risk tolerance and 30 to 40 years before they’ll need the money. Our clients are at a point where they are either about to retire or in retirement. Income is a primary goal of theirs. So, we generally start at a 60/40 benchmark, and over- or underweight that for our clients. It’s 60% fixed income/40% growth equities. Depending on needs, goals and risk tolerance, we’ll treat that, but our typical client is going to have somewhere around 40% to 60% fixed income, 40% to 60% equities.
WM: If you can break down your model portfolio on a more granular level? What’s in it right now?
DN: On our equity piece of the portfolio, we really try to keep it simple. We have publicly-traded ETFs that are separate, but our SMA business, the largest allocations go to two strategies—Nicholas Large Cap Strategy and Nicholas Dividend Growth Strategy.
In our Nicholas Large Cap Strategy, we take 50 of what we feel are the best stocks out of the S&P 500, and we over- or underweight based on the 11 sectors. Every quarter, we are going to rebalance based on those sectors. S&P is up 9.5% year-to-date; our Nicholas Large Cap Strategy is up 21% year-to-date. Over the last year, S&P is up 15%; our Large Cap Strategy is up 33%. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but a lot of the returns are driven by the top 10% of those names, which is why we try to find that top 10% and overweight there.
Sector-wise, we are underweight in IT, technology. We are overweight in financials, consumer staples, materials. And we really underweight a lot of other areas—consumer discretionary, communication services, industrials, healthcare, utilities, energy, real estate. Some of this is interest rate-driven. Some of this we may be slightly underweighted. For example, IT—there’s a 35% weight in the S&P 500. We have a 33% weighting in the Nicholas Large Cap. We still have a healthy weighting; it’s just that we are slightly underweighting. For financials, the S&P has a 13% weighting; we’ve got a 21% weighting. In terms of the names, we have some private equity like Ares, but we have Bank of America, we have some of the insurers, like Chubb. We have Goldman, Robinhood, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, SoFi, Visa and XYZ.
Consumer staples is overweight. We’ve added Celsius Holdings recently, we’ve got Costco, we’ve added Dollar Tree to the portfolio. Some of [what’s driving that] is the slowing employment, we see job revisions coming down. We have Coca-Cola and Walmart.
All of the other sectors, we are underweighting anywhere between 0.2% to 3.0%. The highest underweight that we have is in healthcare at 3.12%. If we were going to change somewhere, it would probably be healthcare going into the fall, where we probably will overweight a little bit.
WM: Can you give us more details on the Nicholas Dividend Growth Strategy?
DN: Our Nicholas Dividend Growth is really driven by yield, but we also do something a little bit unique in our dividend growth strategies. We own equities that are paying dividends, like British American Tobacco. It’s a very stable cigarette tobacco company with a 5% yield. We own Lincoln National, an insurance company that’s got a 4.5% yield. Global Ship Lease has a 7% yield. So, we typically are going to own 20 to 30 names of dividend growers that are paying quality, steady dividends.
But there’s a whole new asset class emerging—it’s the high-income ETF asset class. And I really think this is going to be a whole new asset class. Wall Street has been a little slow to this, but retail has just eaten this up in droves. So, we have an allocation—two of them are our funds. GIAX is our Global Equity and Income ETF, but it has a 25% yield because of the options overlay. We also have a 2.5% allocation to MSTY, but the yield on MSTY is 90%.
Here’s what’s interesting about that. We have a 2% weighting to an ETF that has a 90% yield. What that essentially does to our entire dividend portfolio is it adds almost 2% of additional yield. We have a 20% weighting to GIAX, which has a 24% yield, so that weighting equates to about 5% average yield to the portfolio. When you just add GIAX and MSTY together, about 27% of the fund is accounting for 7% yield just from those two positions. It allows our Nicholas Dividend Portfolio to have a yield close to 12% because we are almost leveraging, using options income in this fund, to generate a high yield. I look at it as a risk-managed way to increase yield without taking on a lot of additional risk.
How do you get higher yield typically? You’ve got to go either into lower-valued stocks or high yield, which carries more risk. But we are using options to leverage some yield without taking on a lot of extra risk.
WM: Can you talk about your holdings on the fixed-income side?
DN: In the fixed-income bucket, we are generally looking at two different areas. We’ve seen a lot of success in what are called fixed-index annuities. One of the reasons I like these contracts is they fit the fixed-income sleeve nicely, but they offer something called trigger rates. Right now, you can get trigger rates of about 8% on a 10-year fixed-income annuity. If the S&P is up at all, the investor would earn the trigger rate, which is 8%. If the S&P is up 4%, they earn 8%. If the S&P is up 20% in a year, they earn 8%. So, if the market is positive at all, they get 8%; and if the market is negative, they don’t lose principle and they don’t lose any of the interest they’ve earned in prior years.
It’s a unique structure that clients really like. We would normally balance that with our fixed-income ETF, which is FIAX. It’s predominantly Treasuries, about 98% Treasuries, and then we do an options overlay to generate higher income. We are able to get exposure to higher-yielding sectors of the market, but do it in a risk-defined way. We have a trade on right now on HYG, which is a high-yield ETF, but we’ve limited our loss to 1%. So, whenever interest rates go the other way or we have a contraction in the economy, high yield spreads increase, we are protected on the downside.
But we can also do unique stuff there—we are long on volatility. A lot of the time, fixed income is looked at as a hedge to equity markets. If we see volatility on the equity side, we’ll benefit from that by our long volatility trade in FIAX. It’s really a way that we can get income from the Treasuries, but that’s yielding 4% to 4.5%. The fund is distributing 8%, so we are getting that additional yield through the options overlay. I like the safety of Treasuries, but I want to juice the yield a little bit, and we do that in a risk-defying way.
WM: It doesn’t sound like it, but do you have any allocations to alternatives in the portfolio?
DN: Depending on how you define alternatives. We don’t have any private equity. Our fixed-income fund is the Fixed Income Alternative ETF, so it’s technically in the alternative category just because of the options overlay, but no. The only alternatives that we use are crypto and real estate. We do have a small crypto allocation in BLOX, in our Nicholas Dividend portfolio.
Generally, we try to have a 10% allocation to real estate for clients. We historically use hospitality REITs because post-COVID, we saw a boom in hospitality, and then also multifamily REITs. We use the preferred shares, not the common shares. But we don’t have any private equity allocations, we don’t have any hedge fund allocations.
WM: Do you keep any cash on hand?
DN: We keep a minimum amount of cash on hand, just to cover management fees. But we don’t necessarily keep it on hand as part of a strategy. We just got burned in the past. We’ve gotten away from all types of tactical strategies.
We saw it recently, during the tariff sell-off, that when the market can go up 10% in a day, we don’t want to be holding cash. During COVID, the market went up 20% in two days! And we had some strategies that were on the sidelines in cash. You’ve got inflation, you’ve got the dollar declining, and cash is just too much of a drag.
WM: You mentioned that you rebalance the portfolio every quarter. Did you make a lot of changes during the previous quarter?
DN: This was not a full rebalance. We probably made three to four name changes during the quarter. A lot of it will be if we had a lot of profits, we’ll take some profit. One of the names that we added is O’Reilly Automotive. It’s a name that you don’t hear a lot, but in the last month, O’Reilly Automotive is up 9%. In the last three months, it’s up 13%. S&P is flat for the last month. Whenever the market is trading at a high multiple, like it is now, we want to own businesses that have a solid track record of creating a profit and having a high margin. You’d be hard-pressed to find a business that has a higher profit margin than an auto parts store. They are very profitable, and they trade at a reasonable valuation. There are a few more stories like that.
We are not traders. If we put money to work in a company, we are typically looking to hold that for a minimum of 12 months. We’ve now owned Palantir for about four years, and we are up 1,000% on that. That name has been in a portfolio for a while, it’s done well, and we don’t have any plans to sell it.
WM: Do you work with outside fund managers?
DN: It’s very limited. Most of our strategies are done in-house, except for the outside ETFs that we use in our actively managed strategies.
WM: On those, how do you determine which funds/asset managers you want to invest with?
DN: On the SMAs, it really comes down to—are we bullish on the stock? Some of these are single stocks. NVDY is a single-stock ETF that they do covered calls on. We have to believe in the growth story of the underlying, and then we balance that with the volatility and the yield that the fund kicks off. I would not buy an income fund just because it has a high yield if I thought the underlying was not going to perform well. The underlying drives it, and the yield is secondary, but it’s a parity equation.
On GIAX, we primarily use Vanguard funds for all of our general index exposure. Inside it, we’ve got VOO, VIG, VB. Why would I choose Vanguard for those? When I just want broad market exposure, I am going to go for the lowest cost.
We have Freedom, which is an emerging markets ETF. It’s called the Freedom 100. We like that because it owns emerging markets, but eliminates nations that have strong state ownership in the fund. It’s truly a free market emerging market ETF.
And then we use iShares to give us exposure to regions that there are not a lot of other options for. So, iShares gives us exposure to Spain, Germany and Sweden.
We also use Global X. They have defense, so we have SHLD, which is a defense tech fund and then their Argentina fund, mainly because they are a little bit more active. But they had the best offering for defense and, also, for South America.
For index funds, it’s mainly cost. For the other funds that are active, it’s more what’s available, and iShares and Global X are two of the best [managers] to do it.
WM: Broadly speaking, where do you see risk on and risk off at this point in the cycle?
DN: We are on the front end of what is hopefully going to be a Fed that’s lowering interest rates. It’s an anticipated event; in many ways, the market has run up in anticipation of it. But we are also balancing it—we are going into September, which is generally one of the top two worst months in terms of returns for the market. So, we’ve tried to derisk our strategies—add a little bit more consumer staples, remove some of the higher beta names in the portfolio, which are typically technology and communication services. It’s not that we are going to go fully risk-off, but we just want to lower the beta in the center deviation of the portfolio going into September.
But we are fully expecting that even though we may see some volatility, for the fourth quarter of this year, we feel bullish on the upside potential for the market. S&P hitting 7000 or above is still intact.
We are never going to fully go risk-off. But when you have a market that’s trading right now with S&P multiple at 25 times the earnings, it’s not like markets are cheap. So, for example, that move to O’Reilly Auto Parts—I want to find some of the names that are great businesses that are very profitable that are trading at a reasonable multiple.
Then, if we do get a sell-off and things get more reasonable, we can go back and buy more of those higher beta names.
WM: Is there anything else that you feel is important to note about your approach to investment strategy?
DN: The U.S. market has been an absolute powerhouse for growth, which is why we’ve predominantly stayed with the U.S. International has had its year, which is why we have international exposure in GIAX. But as the dollar stabilizes, I think U.S. domestic large cap stocks are going to outperform. Strong balance sheet, high-growth names that we are seeing are going to outperform going into the fourth quarter.",791260ed0bad836f507da5a773b00819,trafilatura,14700,0

PCE Inflation Data Awaited",2025-08-26 18:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"September S&P 500 E-Mini futures (ESU25) are down -0.24%, and September Nasdaq 100 E-Mini futures (NQU25) are down -0.32% this morning, pointing to a slightly lower open on Wall Street after last Friday’s rally as some of the optimism around expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts faded.
Investor focus this week is on an earnings report from semiconductor stalwart Nvidia, comments from Fed officials, and the release of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge.
In Friday’s trading session, Wall Street’s major equity averages closed sharply higher, with the Dow notching a new all-time high. The Magnificent Seven stocks rallied, with Tesla (TSLA) climbing over +6% and Alphabet (GOOGL) gaining more than +3%. Also, chip stocks advanced, with ON Semiconductor (ON) surging over +6% and GlobalFoundries (GFS) rising more than +5%. In addition, Zoom Communications (ZM) jumped over +12% after the videoconferencing platform posted upbeat Q2 results and raised its full-year guidance. On the bearish side, Intuit (INTU) slid more than -5% and was the top percentage loser on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after the company issued disappointing full-year guidance.
Speaking Friday at the Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Chair Jerome Powell cautiously signaled the possibility of a September interest rate cut, citing rising risks to the labor market even as concerns over inflation persist. “The stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance. Nonetheless, with policy in restrictive territory, the baseline outlook and the shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” Powell said.
“Powell has thrown the door wide open to a September cut with his Jackson Hole speech that sends a clear, strong signal the Fed is on track to reduce rates by 25 basis points at that meeting,” said Krishna Guha at Evercore.
Meanwhile, U.S. rate futures have priced in an 87.3% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut and a 12.7% chance of no rate change at the conclusion of the Fed’s September meeting.
On the trade front, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Friday a “major” tariff probe targeting imported furniture. In a Truth Social post, President Trump stated, “Furniture coming from other Countries into the United States will be Tariffed at a Rate yet to be determined.”
This week, market participants will focus on earnings reports from several major companies, with semiconductor giant Nvidia’s (NVDA) report on Wednesday attracting the most attention. Nvidia’s earnings reports have been market-moving since May 2023, when the company delivered the revenue growth forecast that reverberated globally. Analysts expect another record in sales, driven by the continued robust demand for the company’s GPU chips used in generative AI applications. Prominent companies like CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), Snowflake (SNOW), Dell Technologies (DELL), Marvell Technology (MRVL), HP Inc. (HPQ), and Autodesk (ADSK) are also set to release their quarterly results this week.
Market watchers will also keep a close eye on a slew of U.S. economic data releases this week to assess whether tariffs are driving inflation higher and to gauge the extent to which the economy is slowing. The July reading of the U.S. core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, will be the main highlight. If the core PCE price index comes in strong, then the Fed may need another weak jobs report for August to justify lowering interest rates, according to Pepperstone head of research Chris Weston. Other data will provide insight into the state of the U.S. economy, including U.S. GDP (second estimate), the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index, Durable Goods Orders, Core Durable Goods Orders, Initial Jobless Claims, Personal Income, and Personal Spending.
In addition, investors will follow comments from Fed officials to gauge their appetite for a rate cut in September. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan, New York Fed President John Williams, and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin are scheduled to speak this week.
Today, investors will focus on U.S. New Home Sales data, which is set to be released in a couple of hours. Economists, on average, forecast that July new home sales will stand at 635K, compared to 627K in June.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.273%, up +0.31%.
The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is down -0.56% this morning, erasing Friday’s gains that were driven by dovish remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Renewable energy stocks underperformed on Monday, with Orsted A/S (ORSTE.C.DX) tumbling more than -17% after the Trump administration halted construction on a nearly completed offshore wind farm. Investors found little reassurance in a survey that showed German business morale improved in August to its highest level in 15 months. Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, speaking in Jackson Hole on Saturday, said the European labor market has remained surprisingly resilient despite an inflation shock and aggressive interest rate increases in recent years. Investors are awaiting preliminary August inflation figures from Germany, France, Italy, and Spain later this week, along with an account of the European Central Bank’s July policy meeting that will likely underscore the increasingly difficult path to another rate cut. In other corporate news, JDE Peet’s (JDEP.NA) soared over +15% after Keurig Dr Pepper agreed to acquire the Dutch coffee maker for 15.7 billion euros ($18.4 billion).
Germany’s Ifo Business Climate Index was released today.
The German August Ifo Business Climate Index came in at 89.0, stronger than expectations of 88.7.
Asian stock markets today settled in the green. China’s Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) closed up +1.51%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index (NIK) closed up +0.41%.
China’s Shanghai Composite Index closed sharply higher today, hitting a fresh 10-year high, led by gains in rare earth and property stocks. Rare earth stocks jumped on Monday after China, on Friday, issued interim rules for overseeing and managing its rare earths mining, smelting, and separation activities. Property stocks also rallied as measures to encourage home buying in Shanghai bolstered stimulus hopes. The gains came after Shanghai authorities lifted restrictions on the number of units buyers can purchase in suburban areas of the city. Non-residents who have paid pensions for three years are now allowed to purchase new homes in urban areas, rather than being limited to buying only existing residences there. Analysts noted that while the measures are unlikely to significantly boost sluggish sales, they indicate growing policy momentum. Meanwhile, the Securities Daily reported that further measures could be introduced as early as September, with authorities preparing to accelerate urban renovation projects and support the struggling property market. In other news, HSBC raised its year-end targets to 4,000 for the Shanghai Composite Index and 4,600 for the CSI 300, citing abundant liquidity. “We see the rally continuing on abundant domestic liquidity from deposit migration, fund issuance, and insurance fund buying,” analysts at HSBC Qianhai said in a note. In corporate news, Pop Mart gained over +1% in Hong Kong after Hang Seng Indexes announced on Friday that the stock would be added to the Hang Seng Index, effective September 8th. This week, investors will turn their focus to China’s industrial profits data for July for fresh insights into the health of the world’s second-largest economy. Attention will then shift to official PMI readings due on the final day of August.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Index closed higher today, tracking Friday’s rally on Wall Street. Metal and machinery stocks led the gains on Monday. Technology stocks also advanced. Data from the Cabinet Office released on Monday showed that Japan’s June leading economic indicators index, which gauges the economic outlook for a few months ahead based on data such as job offers and consumer sentiment, was revised downward. Investors also digested hawkish comments from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda. Speaking at the Fed’s Jackson Hole conference on Saturday, Ueda said wage increases are spreading beyond large firms and are likely to continue accelerating amid a tightening labor market, signaling his optimism that conditions for another interest rate hike were coming together. Meanwhile, the Asahi newspaper reported on Monday that Japan’s government is considering introducing a new tax to fund repairs of aging public infrastructure, replacing a decades-old gasoline surcharge set to be abolished by the end of the year. Investor focus this week is on a series of Japan’s economic data releases. Inflation figures, including producer prices for services and the Tokyo CPI, will indicate whether price growth could push the BOJ toward raising rates later this year. A separate set of data, including industrial production, retail sales, and the unemployment rate, will offer fresh signals on Japan’s economic resilience amid tariff pressures. Signs of strength could heighten expectations that the BOJ will hike rates as early as October. In corporate news, TOTO jumped over +8% after the luxury toilet maker announced on Friday it would build a $224 million plant in the U.S. state of Georgia, marking a shift away from production in Asia. The Nikkei Volatility Index, which takes into account the implied volatility of Nikkei 225 options, closed down -3.42% to 24.25.
The Japanese June Leading Index came in at 105.6, weaker than expectations of 106.1.

His investment in those banks ran counter to the common wisdom at the time – but it perfectly encapsulated his contrarian approach to investing.

Tepper, who founded hedge fund Appaloosa Management in 1993 and has a personal fortune north of $21 billion, has always held to two main principles: seek out value, and don’t worry about the common wisdom. Market sentiment plays no role in his investment strategy; he seeks out shares that are undervalued and ignored by the mass of investors – but that also offer sound fundamentals and the prospect of a turnaround.
This strategy has led Tepper to buy big into unexpected stocks in the past – and more recently, he has stuck to his contrarian guns. A look at his most recent filings, covering 2Q25, shows that UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have both attracted his attention, even as the companies faced massive headwinds.
We’ve opened up the TipRanks database to get a feel for both of these stocks – to see how the Street thinks about them, and to get an idea of why Tepper is buying in so heavily.
UnitedHealth Group
We’ll start in the health insurance industry, with UnitedHealth. This firm, with its market cap of $278 billion and its customer base numbering 148 million strong globally, is the largest operator in the US health coverage space. UnitedHealth has been in the business since 1974, and took on its current name in 1978. The company employs over 400,000 people, in everything from administrative functions to direct care staff.
UnitedHealth’s business is split between two main areas of operation, the insurance side and the direct care side. On the insurance side, the company offers a wide range of affordably priced health benefit and insurance plans. These policies include offerings for individuals and for employer benefit packages. UnitedHealth is also a major player in the Medicare and retirement sector, and offers packages for community and state benefit plans.
Turning to the direct care side, we look at Optum, UnitedHealth’s provider segment. Under this aegis, the company provides direct-care health services for a variety of audiences, in a patient-centered manner. The company prioritizes high-quality, community-based care services, and includes mental health services in its packages. The company’s Optum Insight branch works with providers, payers, and government agencies, as well as life-sciences companies, to develop service plans and payment options that simplify the administrative and financial ends. The company also provides pharmacy services, under Optum RX, for affordable medication options.
The US healthcare sector is a huge business, and UnitedHealth has in recent years been expanding its revenue share. In 2023, the company generated a top line of $371.6 billion; this increased to $400.3 billion last year, and for the 12 months including 2H24 and 1H25, UnitedHealth saw a total of $422.8 billion in revenue.
Despite these gains, UNH has seen share price drop sharply this year – the year-to-date decline is currently 38.5%. The company has faced serious headwinds since the spring, when its 1Q25 report included a downward revision to the full-year 2025 revenue guidance, which was then followed by the company completely taking its guide off the table. The share price suffered another blow when the company confirmed that its Medicare billing practices have come under scrutiny from the Department of Justice. The company’s statement included confirmation that UNH is now complying with both civil and criminal investigations.
Normally, that type of admission from a major company would make big-name investors think twice, but this is exactly the sort of situation that gets Tepper’s attention. Tepper is a contrarian, and he focuses on stocks that are suffering a price decline but retain sound fundamentals.
With this in mind, in Q2, Tepper increased his UNH stake significantly, buying 2,275,000 shares. Tepper’s stake in UnitedHealth now totals 2.45 million shares, worth approximately $753 million.
When we look at UnitedHealth’s last earnings release, for 2Q25, we find that the company had $111.6 billion in quarterly revenue, growing 13% year-over-year and meeting Street expectations. On earnings, UNH realized a non-GAAP EPS of $4.08, which missed the estimates by 37 cents per share. We should note that in the quarterly report, the company reinstated its 2025 revenue guide, calling for revenue between $445.5 billion and $448.0 billion.
Despite recent headwinds, looking ahead, Cantor analyst Sarah James thinks UnitedHealth presents strong potential for investors, although she maintains a careful stance. James writes, “We believe we are at a turning point for UNH, with ’25-27 EPS growth achievable & baking in appropriate risk. We believe guidance was intentionally set low for 2025 and 2026/2027 commentary to allow the company to return to earnings predictability and a beat-and-raise pattern. That said, we are also keeping our estimates conservative to respect the unpredictability of several end markets impacted by policy changes, the turnaround needed in multiple segments, and new cost trend commentary that seems to be more bearish than peers on multiple segments.”
Quantifying her take, James put an Overweight (i.e., Buy) rating on the stock, with a $440 price target that suggests a potential one-year upside of 43%. (To watch James’s track record, click here)
This health insurance giant has picked up 20 recent analyst reviews from the Street, and the breakdown of 17 Buys, 2 Holds, and 1 Sell gives the stock a Strong Buy consensus rating. That said, the stock is currently priced at $307.42 and its $314.95 average price target implies the shares will stay rangebound for the time being. (See UNH stock forecast)
Intel
Next on our list of Tepper picks is Intel, one of the best-known names in the world of semiconductor chips. While not in the same league as industry leader Nvidia, the company still boasts a respectable market cap of $108.5 billion and controls nearly 75% of the market share for PC microprocessor chips. The company built itself up on that niche and is the leading provider of x86 chips for desktop and laptop PCs; if you’ve bought a computer recently, there’s a strong chance that it has the blue-and-silver ‘Intel Inside’ sticker on it.
Intel provides us with a case study, however, in why a tech firm can’t stand still, even on a successful product line. The company was founded in 1968, and from the 90s into the mid-2010s, the company led the industry in annual revenue. Even today, with $53 billion in 12-month revenue through 2Q25, the company still ranks 5th globally and 3rd in the US among its peers. By market cap, however, Intel has fallen out of the top ten and ranks #17 globally. The firm’s decline has two roots: first, the AI boom prompted industry leaders to shift toward AI-capable chips, and Intel is conspicuous as a latecomer to that space; and second, competitor AMD, whose $272 billion market cap provides much deeper pockets, has been making a serious challenge to Intel in the desktop processor market.
We should note that Intel has been developing new products for the AI market, with chipsets designed for AI cloud and AI-capable PC systems. In a clear sign that management is looking to change focus, the company brought on former Cadence CEO Lip-Bu Tan earlier this year as the new CEO, with plans to meet the challenges presented in the chip market by the AI boom and by increased competition.
On another note, one that has generated controversy, Intel has also secured strong financial backing from the US government, which recently confirmed an enormous $11.1 billion investment in the company. While the cash infusion is undoubtedly welcome from Intel’s end, and is in line with the Trump Administration’s commitment to promoting US companies and to onshoring US high-tech manufacturing, the move might also bring politics into Intel’s business decision processes. The move gives the US government a 10% stake in Intel.
We should also note that Japan’s Softbank has bought heavily into Intel, with a $2 billion investment in the company.
These large governmental and institutional investments help to highlight the fact that Intel’s stock has not been attractive in recent years. Yes, the stock has gained this year, but the shares are still down over the long term, with a five-year drop of 50%.
And now we come to David Tepper. The contrarian billionaire bought 8 million shares of the chip maker during 2Q25. This stock acquisition marked a new position for Tepper, and his stake in the company is valued at $198.4 million.
5-star analyst Gus Richard, from Northland, covers Intel, and while he acknowledges that the company has a difficult path to reverse its fortunes, he believes that the path does exist. In his note on the stock, Richard writes, “Intel’s turnaround remains in doubt, but we believe INTC has a lot of technology and levers to execute its turnaround. Next year, INTC will be in the same zip code as TSMC, sharing similar process technology and, along with TSMC, will be a leader in advanced packaging. INTC can leverage these capabilities to become a SiP package foundry.”
Following from this, Richard rates INTC as Outperform (i.e., Buy). He complements that with a $28 price target that points toward a one-year share price gain of 13%. (To watch Richard’s track record, click here)
That’s definitely the bullish take. The 29 recent reviews on this stock include that single Buy along with 25 to Hold and 3 to Sell, for a Hold consensus rating. The shares have a trading price of $24.80, and the $22.17 average price target implies that the stock will slip 10.5% in the next 12 months. (See INTC stock forecast)

It would certainly be understandable if it did. This is a tricky time to navigate the market. The Federal Reserve may or may not lower interest rates soon. New tariffs may or may not remain in place. Home prices may or may not come back to Earth. All of it impacts equities one way or another.
The thing is, in times like these it's important to look past the short-term details that don't really matter and refocus on the bigger picture. The quality and enduring marketability of a company's product, for instance, largely determines how that organization's stock performs in the long run.
With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three brilliant long-term growth stocks you can add to your portfolio today even if it means paying a bit of a premium for them. They're worth it.
1. Taiwan Semiconductor
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) isn't a household name here in the United States. It's a pretty safe bet, however, that you or someone living in your household regularly uses something it made.
See, TSMC (as it's often called) manufactures semiconductors, microchips, and even computer processors on behalf of several of the biggest names in the business. Nvidia, Intel, and Apple are just some of this company's chip customers. As it turns out, it's often easier and even cheaper to punt this sort of foundry work to a specialist with the know-how and equipment necessary to make silicon according to your specifications.
That's why this company makes about two-thirds of the world's microchips, and an even greater proportion of the high-performance semiconductors you'll usually find within artificial intelligence platforms.
That doesn't mean some of the biggest names in the semiconductor business aren't attempting to wean themselves off their reliance on third-party manufacturers. Intel, for instance, has committed billions of dollars to building its own foundries in and outside of the United States. It's not going particularly well, though. It's proving complicated, and expensive.
In retrospect, partnerships like the one Apple has entered into with Taiwan Semiconductor to purchase chips made at its production facility in Arizona just make more fiscal sense for most chip companies. That's not apt to change anytime soon either, if ever. Taiwan Semiconductor is simply too good and too efficient at what it does to lose out to efforts from the industry's best-known brands to establish their own foundries.
And the opportunity remains enormous. Thanks to the advent of AI and its proliferation out of the data center and into all corners of your home, Precedence Research believes the global semiconductor industry is poised to grow from less than $600 billion last year to more than $1.2 trillion by 2034.
For its part, analysts expect Taiwan Semiconductor to grow its top line from less than $3 billion last year to more than $5 billion in 2027. That's just a taste of what awaits further down the road, though.
2. Microsoft
Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) shares aren't cheap. Indeed, they're almost uncomfortably expensive, priced at more than 30 times this year's expected earnings, and 28 times next year's estimate of $18.11 per share. But sometimes you have to pay up for quality. It's usually worth the price.
You know the company. Microsoft is of course the king of computer software, with some version of its Windows operating system installed on more than 70% of the world's desktops and laptops, according to numbers from Statcounter. It's not quite the powerhouse it originally was on the productivity software front, with the entry of Google Docs into the race. It's still a key player in this arena though.
And, while not nearly as big as Amazon's cloud business, Microsoft's Azure is an increasingly popular cloud computing platform, leading this arm to 25% growth during the recently ended fiscal Q4.
None of these quantitative factors are the chief reason you'd want to own Microsoft for the long haul, however. The strongest argument for stepping into a stake in Microsoft at this time is far more qualitative. That is, it's a well-established brand name that's well-entrenched within the landscape of personal computers. If for no other reason than it just being too much trouble to switch to other kinds of computing and productivity platforms, Microsoft is here to stay, and thrive.
The kicker: Over the course of the past several years Microsoft's business model has evolved away from one-time purchases of software, and toward ""renting"" always-updated software at a monthly cost that's almost negligible. Not only is this recurring revenue more predictable, this revenue doesn't need to be ""won"" over and over again. Most of these customers are content to simply stick with the system or software they know.
That's not apt to change anytime in the near or distant future either. The world's just too busy tackling more pressing problems to worry about shopping around for alternative solutions.
3. Broadcom
Finally, you probably know that Nvidia's processors are the heart and soul of most artificial intelligence data centers, where you'll find stacks of servers assembled by Super Micro Computer inside buildings built by Applied Digital. But, have you ever thought about who makes the technology that interconnects all of these individual motherboards into a single unified AI system?
It's Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). OK, Broadcom isn't the only name in the business. It's the biggest and arguably the best, though. Take its recently unveiled Jericho4 ethernet fabric router as an example. It's a ""purpose-built platform for the next generation of distributed AI infrastructure"" capable of connecting over one million processors to one another and delivering digital data between these processors at a speed of up to 3.2 terabytes per second.
And earlier this year, the company introduced a digital signal processor chip with the ability to handle an industry-leading 200 gigabytes' worth of digital data per lane. This may not mean much to the average investor who isn't familiar with exactly how data centers function. So, to put it in layman's terms, it means Broadcom's tech adds massive capacity and blazing fast speed to AI's underlying architecture, making artificial intelligence platforms even more powerful.
And here's something every investor will certainly understand. Late last year Broadcom's CEO Hock Tan suggested the artificial intelligence hardware market could be worth between $60 billion and $90 billion as soon at 2027, versus the company's 2024 AI revenue of only $12.2 billion. Now, AI isn't all Broadcom does -- it only accounted for less than half the company's 2024 top line of $30.1 billion, in fact.
But in light of Global Market Insights' belief that the global AI hardware market is going to grow at an average annualized pace of 18% through 2034 -- paired with Broadcom's current leadership of its sliver of this space -- this stock's modest pullback since early August may be all the discount you're going to get here.

The treatment is inching closer to becoming a new, needle-free alternative in the highly lucrative market for weight loss and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s. More convenient pills could boost supply for the treatments and make them easier to access than the pricey weekly injections currently dominating the space. The Eli Lilly pill also would not come with dietary restrictions, in contrast to a similar oral treatment from chief rival Novo Nordisk.
Eli Lilly shares climbed more than 4% on Tuesday.
The highest dose of the pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose 10.5% of their weight, or 22.9 pounds, on average at 72 weeks, compared with 2.2% weight loss among those who took a placebo. The drug's weight loss in the study was 9.6% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations.
Eli Lilly's pill met the trial's other goals of helping patients lower their hemoglobin A1C, a measure of blood sugar levels. By the end of the study, most patients no longer met the criteria for Type 2 diabetes based on that metric. The rate of side effects and treatment discontinuations in the study, called ATTAIN-2, appeared to be generally consistent with two recent phase three trials on Eli Lilly's drug.
Eli Lilly said it now has the full clinical trial data package required to file for approvals of the drug for chronic weight management with global regulators. The pharmaceutical giant expects to launch the pill around the world ""this time next year,"" CEO David Ricks told CNBC in early August.
In an interview, Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer, Daniel Skovronsky, said the pill had ""unprecedented efficacy"" in patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, who typically have a more difficult time losing weight compared with those without diabetes. Skovronsky said he hopes that diabetes patients will be able to use the pill earlier in their disease to slow down its progression.
Existing GLP-1 injections have shown greater weight loss than Eli Lilly's pill, but having an oral option that offers more than 10% for patients with both obesity and Type 2 diabetes is ""actually very good, so that's positive,"" said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
But she called it ""concerning"" that more patients – 10.6% of those on the highest dose – stopped taking the pill due to side effects compared with what has been seen in separate studies on the existing injections, Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's Wegovy. Apovian said patients and their prescribers will have to consider the risks and benefits of the pill and the injections when deciding which to take, including convenience, side effects and efficacy.
The side effects of Eli Lilly's pill were mainly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting, and were mild to moderate in severity. An estimated 23.1% of those who took the highest dose experienced vomiting, while 36.4% and 27.4% had nausea and diarrhea, respectively.
Around 20% of patients stopped taking the pill for any reason, which is roughly the same rate as the placebo group. Skovronsky said that reflects a combination of reasons apart from side effects. Those can include patients who wanted to stop participating in a trial because they were able to access another obesity medication, or those who didn't lose enough weight because they were taking a lower dose of the drug.
But he said most patients stay on the drug, and said ""the most important thing here is the scale of the opportunity,"" referring to the number of people around the world could benefit from orforglipron. More than 100 million adults in the U.S. alone have obesity, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
Apovian said she's most excited about an oral option entering the market not because of how much weight loss it can promote, but rather its potential to expand access to obesity treatments, especially since a pill is much easier to manufacture than an injection. Apovian hopes Eli Lilly's pill will be priced lower than injections — which cost roughly $1,000 per month before insurance — and receive broader insurance coverage.
Tuesday's results are the third set of late-stage data the company has released on orforglipron this year. In April, the pill succeeded in a shorter phase three trial on diabetes patients without obesity.
Earlier this month, the drug also met the goals of a separate study on patients with obesity and not diabetes, but fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The pill's weight loss was higher in that trial compared with Tuesday's data, but ""that's expected,"" given the differences in patient populations, said Dr. Jaime Almandoz, medical director of the Weight Wellness Program at UT Southwestern Medical Center.
Overall, some doctors have touted the pill's weight loss in the trials, and some analysts say it will still be a viable competitor in the space due to factors such as its easier manufacturing and lack of dietary restrictions.
""The convenience and specifically the lack of fasting requirements and water restrictions with orforglipron is likely one of the main differentiators when people think about other oral agents with similar effectiveness for weight change and A1C levels,"" said Almandoz.
He said a pill creates additional opportunities for individualized patient care ""where there's more autonomy.""
For example, some people may be hesitant to take injections for weight loss, said Dr. Andrew Kraftson, clinical associate professor at the division of metabolism, endocrinology and diabetes at the University of Michigan
""While this is a surmountable barrier for many, oral therapy aligns with traditional medication treatment and may have higher acceptability,"" he said, adding that pills are less likely to be in short supply.
Detailed trial data
The trial followed more than 1,600 people, who were randomized to receive three different target doses of Eli Lilly's pill or a placebo. Patients started at a lower dose of the drug and gradually increased it at four-week intervals to reach their final target dose.
More than 50% of patients on the highest dose of Eli Lilly's treatment lost at least 10% of their weight in the trial, while 28.4% of those participants lost at least 15%. Across the different groups, the company did not disclose how many patients lost at least 5% of their weight.
Orforglipron ""may not be the answer"" for patients who are morbidly overweight, said Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart. But he said, ""for a lot of people who need to lose a fair amount of weight, losing 10% can make a big difference.""
Orforglipron lowered A1C by an average of 1.3% to 1.8% across different doses at 72 weeks, from a starting level of 8.1%. Around 75% of participants taking the highest dose achieved an A1C of 6.5% or less, which is at or below what the American Diabetes Association defines as diabetes.
Eli Lilly's pill also improved key cardiovascular risk factors.
""We now have study after study with GLP-1 agonists showing that they reduce very important outcomes, which is what I do every day as a preventive cardiologist,"" Weintraub said. ""I try my very best to prevent them from having heart attack, stroke and death.""
Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. Novo Nordisk is also seeking approval of an oral version of Wegovy, which could come by year-end.
But unlike those three medications, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus or oral Wegovy does.

Eli Lilly's closely watched obesity pill is inching closer to entering the market.
The drug, orforglipron, succeeded in another late-stage trial, helping patients with both obesity and Type 2 diabetes lose weight and lower their blood sugar levels. Eli Lilly now has all the data it needs to start filing for approvals of the daily pill for chronic weight management by the end of the year.
It could become a new needle-free alternative in the blockbuster GLP-1 market, helping to ease the supply shortfalls and access hurdles of existing injections. Eli Lilly's pill is easier to manufacture than a shot and does not require dietary restrictions, and some health experts hope it could cost less than injections.
Eli Lilly's Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky broke down the trial results with CNBC.
On the biggest take-home message of the data:
Skovronsky said orforglipron passed the so-called ATTAIN-2 trial ""with flying colors."" The study is the second of two large phase three trials for the treatment of obesity. He said the pill met the main and secondary goals of the study, and its safety and tolerability data were ""just as we expected, consistent with the [GLP-1] class.""
Skovronsky said it's difficult to compare the trial to separate studies on other GLP-1s. But overall, he called the data ""in line with the injectables"" in patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, a notoriously ""hard-to-treat"" population that has a difficult time losing weight.
""To get this kind of unprecedented efficacy in this population, and to get it with an oral, it's just really satisfying and exciting,"" Skovronsky said.
The highest dose of the pill helped patients lose 10.5% of their weight, or 22.9 pounds, on average, at 72 weeks. The drug's weight loss in the study was 9.6% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations.
Skovronsky said more than half of the patients on the drug lost at least 10% of their body weight in the trial, which he called a ""life-changing level of weight loss.""
Orforglipron also lowered hemoglobin A1C – a measure of blood sugar levels – by an average of 1.3% to 1.8% across different doses at 72 weeks, from a starting level of 8.1%. By the end of the study, most patients no longer met the criteria for Type 2 diabetes based on that metric.
""I just think it's exciting – a huge relief now to have the full data package that confirms the safety and confirms efficacy"" of orforglipron, Skovronsky said.
Shares of Eli Lilly climbed more than 4% Tuesday afternoon following the results. The move comes after investors battered the company's stock in early August, when the pill fell short of Wall Street's expectations in a separate trial on patients with obesity.
""I think after the prior data readout, people could have asked questions"" about orforglipron, Skovronsky said. ""This readout puts those questions to rest.""
On the pill's side effects and discontinuation rates:
Some health experts have raised concerns about the rates of side effects and patients who stopped treatment in the trial.
Eli Lilly said 10.6% of patients on the highest dose stopped taking the pill due to side effects, which were mainly gastrointestinal-related and mild to moderate in severity.
Some experts have pointed out that the discontinuation rates due to side effects in late-stage trials on obesity injections from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are around 7% or less.
An estimated 23.1% of those who took the highest dose of Eli Lilly's pill experienced vomiting, while 36.4% and 27.4% had nausea and diarrhea, respectively. But Skovronsky said side effects typically ""go away as [people] stay on the medicine.""
Around 20% of patients stopped treatment for any reason, which is roughly the same as the placebo group.
But Skovronsky said, ""it's not that they don't want to be on this medicine.""
He said the discontinuations are due to multiple factors apart from side effects. Those can include patients who wanted to stop participating in a trial because they were able to access another obesity medication or those who didn't lose enough weight because they were taking a lower dose of the drug. He said that is ""no longer an issue"" when you take a higher dose.
""Maybe they got a new job and their insurance covers [an existing obesity drug] now and they say, 'Why should I take the chances on something unproven when I could just be on the injections?'"" Skovronsky said, adding that many patients ""didn't have any kind of alternative"" for treatment when the trial started.
In other cases, people move, change care or ""something else happens in their life and they no longer want to be in a clinical trial,"" he added.
Overall, Skovronsky said most patients stay on the drug, and that ""the most important thing here is the scale of the opportunity"" of people around the world who could benefit from it. More than 100 million adults in the U.S. alone have obesity, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.
On his hopes for the pill's future:
""I think this is going to be an important option,"" Skovronsky said. ""Maybe it will become seen as the most powerful oral medication for treatment of Type 2 diabetes, and certainly Type 2 diabetes with obesity, as we saw in this trial.""
He said he hopes that an oral option without food and water restrictions could allow people to start using it earlier in the course of their disease to slow its progression.
""I think that's one of the important uses here, the early intervention,"" he said.
Unlike other GLP-1s, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. It is a small-molecule drug that is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus and the oral version of Wegovy, which could enter the market at the end of the year.

Latest in health-care: Stephen Hemsley's first 100 days
If you've lived through a big renovation, one thing you learn is that rehab projects always cost more and take longer than you think they will.
Stephen Hemsley helped build UnitedHealth Group into the giant it is today through strategic acquisitions during his first stint as CEO. Now, three months into his return to the job, he's moving quickly on an ambitious and strategic turnaround.
While pushing to bring the company's Medicare program and Optum Health physician unit back to profitability, Hemsley has also prioritized the rehabilitation of UnitedHealth's reputation.
The murder in December of the company's insurance chief Brian Thompson, by an accused gunman who appeared to have a history of claims denials, ignited an outpouring of public criticism in the months following the killing. At the same time, published reports of a federal criminal probe into the company's Medicare program stoked investor concern and weighed on the stock.
""We have embarked on a real cultural shift in our relationship with regulators and all external stakeholders … and intend to be proactively engaged, constructive and responsive,"" Hemsley said on the company's second-quarter earnings call.
In his first 100 days, he's made three moves to take control of the narrative. In June, he announced outside auditors would look at UnitedHealth's billing and business practices. In July, the company initiated a meeting with the Department of Justice and confirmed that its Medicare program is under investigation. Then last week, UnitedHealth announced a new Public Responsibility Committee, as part of its board of directors, which will focus on regulatory and stakeholder concerns.
As with any big renovation project, it's going to take time to rebuild the business fundamentals. Rehabbing the company's public reputation could be the part that takes even more time and diligence.

As sage billionaires go, BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink belongs in the same rarefied air as Warren Buffett.
And while he probably stopped worrying about his own nest egg a long time ago, as Fink’s firm hit a record $12.5 trillion in assets under management in Q2 of 2025, he has a warning for his peers without substantial retirement savings in the bank.
“If the tariffs are instituted over the next five months, I think we’re going to see very elevated inflation,” Fink said at the Forbes Iconoclast Summit in June, adding, “We are going to start seeing the impact of these tariffs that are going to start impacting the economy over the course of the next five months.”
However, Fink has been surprisingly supportive of Trump’s tariff policies.
""Let's be clear, the U.S. deficits are an issue ... the U.S. economy needs a 3% growth rate to overcome its deficits and I do believe what President Trump is trying to do is consistent with what the kingdom has been trying to do, they are trying to create more public-private investing,"" Fink said at the Saudi-U.S. investment forum in May.
Here’s what you need to know now to build a strong nest egg for whatever the future may bring.
Building on the ‘fantastic foundation’ of Social Security
One-third of Americans don’t have any retirement savings at all, according to Larry Fink’s 2025 Annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors. But Social Security is a good place to start.
As of July 2025, the average monthly benefit for retirees is $1,918.22, according to the Social Security Administration. Supplemental security income for those over the age of 65 amounted to $593.96 on average last month.
""Social Security is a fantastic foundation for retirement,"" Fink said in an interview with Bloomberg last March. ""But if that's all you have when you retire, you're going to be living below the poverty line. It's supplemental, but it's not meant to be the totality of what you have in retirement.""
With the combined reserves of old-age and survivors' insurance projected to become depleted in 2023, relying on social security alone might not be feasible.
Planning for retirement isn’t easy, and it’s natural to have lots of questions about how much you should save per month and how to ensure you have a healthy income after you leave your career behind. If you want expert advice on planning your retirement, seeking a financial advisor is a smart first step.
Finding a financial advisor that suits your specific needs and financial goals is simple with Vanguard.
With a minimum portfolio size of $50,000, this service is best for clients who already have a nest egg built and would like to try to grow their wealth with a variety of different investments. All you have to do is set up a consultation with a Vanguard advisor, and they will help you set a tailored plan and stick to it.
Social Security likely won’t come close to covering your needs in retirement. In order to live the retirement you want, you’ll need to save up a separate nest egg to supplement your benefits. One of the ways you can do that is by consistently contributing to a retirement account like a 401K or IRA.

Diversify your IRA
With the inconsistent performance of the markets in the last few years, many of those close to retirement may be worried about putting their hard-earned dollars into stocks and bonds.
However, alternative assets can help you reduce your reliance on the stock market to grow your retirement fund.
Gold
A traditional hedge against inflation is gold. Unlike fiat currencies, precious metals can’t be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks. And because its value isn’t tied to any one currency or economy, gold could provide protection during periods of economic uncertainty. This unique characteristic has earned it the reputation of being a “safe haven” asset.
In 2024, gold has lived up to its reputation, soaring by over 25% and surpassing $2,600 per ounce. It now sits around $3,300 per ounce.
One way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of American Hartford Gold.
Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to potentially hedge their retirement funds against economic uncertainties.

Many Americans consider buying investment properties for income in retirement, but the current market — plus the work associated with finding and managing tenants — may make buying property less appealing. But new investing platforms are making it easier than ever to tap into the real estate market, without the headaches of being a landlord.
For accredited investors, Homeshares gives access to the $36 trillion U.S. home equity market, which has historically been the exclusive playground of institutional investors.
With a minimum investment of $25,000, investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.
Backed by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived makes it easy to fit these properties into your investment portfolio regardless of your income level. Their flexible investment amounts and simplified process allow accredited and non-accredited investors to take advantage of this inflation-hedging asset class without any extra work on your part.
Another avenue is commercial real estate. For years, direct access to the $22.5 trillion commercial real estate sector has been limited to a select group of elite investors — until now.
First National Realty Partners (FNRP) allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.
With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities. Thanks to Triple Net (NNN) leases, accredited investors are able to invest in these properties without worrying about tenant costs cutting into their potential returns.
Simply answer a few questions – including how much you would like to invest – to start browsing their full list of available properties.
Invest as you spend to save for your future
""We need to really educate our citizens about the need for savings,"" said Fink — though not via vanilla bank accounts. Investing, he stressed, allows people to take advantage of capital markets and compounding.
Thankfully, there are ways to invest for retirement, no matter the size of your income or portfolio, so you don’t need to be reliant on Social Security benefits alone.

Overall, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2.4%, now standing at $3.96 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $187 billion.
TLDR: About five of the top 100 coins are up today, the rest have dropped; All top 10 coins are red today; BTC and ETH saw drops of around 3% each, trading at to $111,806 and $4,625, respectively; ETH continues to outperform BTC and may see a recovery sooner; The market surged following the US Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech on Friday, falling on Monday morning (UTC); While US BTC recorded outflows of $23.15 million, ETH ETFs saw inflows of $341.16 million; Some analysts warn that rate cuts in September are not guaranteed; ’Tariff-driven price pressures could offset some of the easing impact’; ’The market has proven its resilience, digesting multiple disappointments over the past two years while still achieving new highs’; Investors remain very cautious, awaiting further signals.
At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have decreased over the past 24 hours.
Bitcoin (BTC) fell 2.8% and below $112,000, now standing at $111,806.
At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is down by 3.2%, now trading at $4,625.
Dogecoin (DOGE)decreased the most today. It’s down by 4.9% to the price of $0.2219.
The smallest fall in this category is BNB’s 1.2%, now changing hands at $862.
As for the top 100 coins, three coins appreciated above 1%: Provenance Blockchain (HASH), VeChain (VET), and Monero (XMR). They’re each up between 2% and 3%.
On the other hand, Mantle (MNT) is down 11% to $1.14.
It’s followed by Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), which decreased by 9.6% to the price of $0.0322.
The markets recorded a jump on Friday following the speech by the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in which he indicated incoming rate cuts. The “shifting balance of risks may warrant adjusting our policy stance,” he said.
The speech reignited investors’ risk appetite, and with the ongoing bull market, many turned to cryptocurrencies.
However, some analysts had noted before the speech that the event had already been priced in.
Meanwhile, a Bitcoin whale sold 24,000 BTC on Sunday, worth $2.7 billion. This sparked significant liquidations and BTC’s move to a key support zone near $113,000.
Some argued, however, that whales selling is healthy for the market in the long run.
In an email to Cryptonews, Bitunix analysts noted that historically, rate cuts after long pauses supported equities. However, “tariff-driven price pressures could offset some of the easing impact.”
They argued that the US is “entering a phase of policy tug-of-war between ‘rate-cut tailwinds’ and ‘tariff-driven inflation risks’.” If food prices in that country continue rising, “the Fed’s room for easing may be constrained.”
“Investors should closely track upcoming PCE and nonfarm payroll data. While short-term sentiment remains bullish, the medium-term risk is that inflation erodes the benefits of rate cuts,” the analysts said.
Moreover, Katalin Tischhauser, Head of Research at Sygnum Bank, said that for crypto markets, the reaction to the speech was “swift and positive,” with investors being “eager to seize any dovish hint to fuel the uptrend.”
Even if a September rate cut doesn’t happen, she said, the market has already proven resilience, “digesting multiple disappointments over the past two years while still achieving new highs.”
Therefore, “the prevailing optimism means momentum could continue regardless of near-term policy outcomes, although at higher market volatility.”
Notably, Tischhauser argued that Powell’s speech could be seen as contradictory, possibly leaving markets “debating his true intentions.” While he indicated September rate cuts, “he stressed that for now the labour market is still “in good shape,” the economy remains “resilient,” and that tax, trade, and immigration changes carry risks of higher inflation.”
Hence, she said, “this mixed messaging might leave observers unsure whether he was seriously considering a cut or simply bowing to external pressures.”
At the time of writing on Thursday morning, BTC trades at $111,806. The coin saw a plunge from $114,666 to $112,174, and then further below the $112,00 level.
Its intraday low was $111,473 while the day’s highest point was $114,927. Looking at the weekly level, the highest price was $117,016. BTC is down 3.3% in a week and 5% in a month, while it’s up 74% in a year.
It is now 10.2% away from its previous all-time high of $124,128. The price may continue to fall further towards the $109,000 level, which could be an indicator of additional dips.

Ethereum is currently trading at $4,625. It first increased to $4,946, finally hitting a new all-time high. But much like BTC, it then saw a sharp drop to $4,738, before relatively gradually decreasing to the current level.
Over the past week, the price has made significant movements. Its lowest point was $4,080.65, and the highest was the ATH of $4,946. Overall, it’s up 7.7% in a week, 22.5% in a month, and 66.5% in a year.
It’s notably outperforming BTC and may see further increases before Bitcoin does. That said, as the larger market in general, ETH may continue to decrease in the short term, below $4,600.
Bitunix analysts suggested that investors monitor support at $4,600–$4,650 and resistance at $4,850–$5,000.
Moreover, with the rise and drops in the market, the crypto market sentiment increased, then dropped again within the neutral zone. The crypto fear and greed index rose from 46 on Friday to 56 over the weekend, before falling back to 50 today.
This shows uncertainty in the market, with a notable amount of caution and fear among investors, but also a dose of bullish sentiment.

Meanwhile, as of 21 August, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw more outflows on Friday of $23.15 million. They weren’t able to maintain positive flows.
Notably, six funds did see inflows, with Ark&21Shares and Fidelity at the top, taking in $65.74 million and $50.88 million. However, BlackRock noted outflows of $198.81 million.

On the other hand, the US ETH ETFs saw more inflows on Friday of $341.16 million. With this, it has started another green streak.

Meanwhile, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet bought more BTC, acquiring 103 coins for about $11.8 million. This comes just a week after the company added 775 BTC to its balance sheet.

Why did crypto move against stocks today?
The crypto market fell over the past day, but we still don’t have Monday data for the stock market. On its last trading day, the stocks were up. By Friday’s closing time, the S&P 500 was up by 1.52%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 1.54%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.89%. The markets jumped on Friday after the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that an interest rate cut is incoming.

Is this dip sustainable?
Dips may still continue. Overall, analysts argue that there’s room for the crypto market to rally some more, but the prices could decrease further in the short term.

How workers really feel about it,2025-08-26 15:30:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Back in January, Priscilla Abii kicked off her new year the same way a lot of people did: by mapping out her goals and resolutions for the year.
Abii, 25, was just a few months into a new role as a marketing assistant and wasn't sure her career was going in the direction she wanted it to. She tried talking to her friends and family about work, but they're unfamiliar with the marketing world and would just ask: ""What do you do for work?""
So, she turned to a different resource a lot of people are finding useful for life's bigger questions: ChatGPT.
In the few years since generative AI chatbots have been easily available to the public, people have turned to it for therapy, to combat loneliness and isolation, to work through relationship problems and more.
Naturally, they're also turning to AI for career advice.
The exercise was helpful for Abii, who lives near Baltimore: ""I had heard of other areas of marketing that potentially would make more and could increase my earnings down the road,"" she tells CNBC Make It. ""So I was like, let me go to ChatGPT just to see the options I have.""
Abii's research helped her explore different specialties in her field, like growth marketing and data analysis, as well as what certifications could help her learn necessary skills for them. While she hasn't left her current job, she says her research at least gives her some guidance of where she can take her career next.
AI ""gathers information from everywhere, which is helpful, because sometimes you don't even know where to start, you don't even know the best places to find answers, and sometimes you don't even know what questions to ask,"" Abii says. ""It was a really helpful tool.""
People are using AI to map out their careers
As people become more familiar with AI tools, they're getting more specific in the problems they want it to solve for them. Users of Claude, the gen AI assistant from Anthropic, are shifting their career-related queries from straightforward resume writing help, and referring to the platform for more long-term strategic planning.
Nearly 20% of all career-focused conversations are to help users create a personalized career map, according to an Anthropic analysis of 4.5 million Claude conversations provided to Make It.
AI can be especially helpful to young professionals just getting started. Jeanie Thompson, 23, a writer and marketer in Boston, recently started poking around Fide, an invite-only career app where one feature allows users to ask an AI agent about topics like preparing for a job interview or getting started in a certain field. The app also prompts her with daily questions to help her shape her long-term goals, like what she considers her marketing superpowers to be, and what boundaries she hopes to break in the marketing world right now.
Beyond the app, Thompson still prefers to ask friends and colleagues for help navigating big career questions, even though doing so can be hard as a junior worker.
Thompson says she's worked to ""overcome the embarrassment of feeling silly for asking questions,"" she says. ""I'm still young, and so I know there are things that I don't know, and I think it's really important to utilize the resources around you,"" like the expertise of senior colleagues.
""I'm just looking to soak up and absorb everything, because I know that they have stories to share.""
Where AI career advice falls short
AI is great for handling administrative work and aiding research but isn't a substitute for connecting with other people, says Ruth Gotian, an author and expert in mentorship and leadership development.
Guidance from a chatbot is ""going to be very generic,"" Gotian says, while a mentor can give you insights from their firsthand experience and possibly connect you to other opportunities.
Then, there's the emotional support that AI can't offer.
""There are two roles for mentorship,"" Gotian says. ""One is to help you with career guidance — apply to this, talk to this person, etc. But it's also to help with the psychosocial support, which is being your cheerleader, being your shoulder to cry on, helping you come up with a game plan if you don't get exactly what you were seeking. AI doesn't do that yet.""
AI technology doesn't foster the same sense of trust and empathy that humans have with one another, she adds. That's one reason why some people avoid getting overly personal with chatbots, says a 26-year-old partnerships manager who goes by Rai Tryna on social media.
""I know a lot of people ask ChatGPT for relationship advice and therapy advice, and I'm just not personally comfortable doing that just yet,"" says Rai, who lives in West Palm Beach, Florida.
AI query results can also be overly self-affirming, he says: ""It doesn't necessarily give you the real critiques that you are looking for in your self-development.""
That sentiment might not last forever, he says, as AI platforms are continuously fed new data every day. ""I think over time, the AI is forever evolving, and will get better at providing more sound advice to people,"" Rai says.
Ziad Ahmed, 26, thinks AI technology can improve a lot of the world's problems, like in medicine and manufacturing. But the Gen Z brand expert in New York City is concerned about using AI as a replacement for human connection, including in the workplace.
""I think folks might be turning to AI because of a lack of the prioritization of in-person mentorship and training,"" he says, ""that really workplaces and society and governments ought to be offering.""
A good place to self-reflect
For now, some users see AI as a good place to prompt some self-reflection.
Michael Campbell, 41, is an HR professional in Dallas. Over the past year, he's used ChatGPT to take personality tests and figure out if he's in the right field altogether.
""Everybody has their idea of a perfect career, and I was curious: Does my idea align with my personality?"" Campbell says AI tests have helped him realized he's risk-averse and hates stress. His AI searches ""helped me understand how I can provide [HR] solutions and not have to stress out about it.""
AI helps him plan out his career options: How could an MBA change his trajectory? What job titles would put him on track to becoming a chief HR officer one day?
It's helpful to hear about potential outcomes based on unlimited experiences recorded on the internet. ""Even if I had a CHRO friend, they could tell me their experience, but it would be anchored on his or her knowledge,"" Campbell says.
Ultimately, Campbell sees his AI career searches as an enhancement to his current job search, not as a replacement for people in his network. ""You still need people to tell you, 'Hey, maybe you're totally off here,'"" he says.
Plus, since he's feeding the chatbot his prior work experience, it usually validates that he's suited for another HR job, and it hasn't opened up entirely new career opportunities.
""It hasn't given me anything totally off the wall, like you'd do better as a pilot,"" he says.

Trump, in a termination letter to Cook posted on Truth Social, cited allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that she had made false statements on applications for home mortgages.
The letter came four days after the Justice Department said it would investigate Cook because of Pulte's claim.
Cook, in a statement Monday, said, ""President Trump purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so.""
""I will not resign,"" said Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor. ""I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.""
Cook, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, hired the high-profile attorney Abbe Lowell to represent her. She has not been charged with any crime.
Lowell, in a statement, said, ""President Trump has taken to social media to once again 'fire by tweet' and once again his reflex to bully is flawed and his demands lack any proper process, basis or legal authority.""
""We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action,"" Lowell said.
On Tuesday, he said Cook would file a lawsuit challenging her termination.
A spokesman for the Federal Reserve had no immediate comment on Trump's letter.
On Tuesday, a Fed spokesman, in a statement, pointedly noted that ""Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' ""
""Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,"" the statement said.
The spokesperson also said, ""As always, the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision.""
Trump's removal of Cook could be challenged in federal court. The Supreme Court could eventually rule on whether her firing is legal.
If it is upheld, Trump would be on track to have a Fed board whose majority is comprised of governors who he has appointed.
Congress curbed the president's authority to unilaterally fire a Fed governor in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which states that the president can only do so ""for cause.""
While the law does not elaborate on what constitutes ""cause,"" it has historically been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.
Trump, in his letter to Cook on Monday, tied Pulte's allegations about mortgage fraud to the public's perception of her actions as Fed governor.
The president wrote, ""There is sufficient reason to believe you have made false statements on one or more mortgage agreements.""
""For example, as detailed in the Criminal Referral, you signed one document attesting that a property in Michigan would be your primary residence for the next year,"" Trump wrote.
""Two weeks later, you signed another document for a property in Georgia stating that it would be your primary residence for the next year,"" he continued.
Trump claimed that it is ""inconceivable"" that Cook was ""not aware of [her] first commitment when making the second.""
""In light of your deceitful and potentially criminal conduct in a financial matter, [the American people] cannot and I do not have such confidence in your integrity,"" Trump wrote.
""At a minimum, the conduct that issue exhibits the sort of gross negligence in financial transactions that calls into question your competence and trustworthiness as a financial regulator.""
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., in a statement Monday night, said, ""The illegal attempt to fire Lisa Cook is the latest example of a desperate President searching for a scapegoat to cover for his own failure to lower costs for Americans.""
""It's an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court,"" said Warren, who is the ranking member on the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee.
Edward Mills, managing director of the financial advisory firm Raymond James, said that Trump's move to fire Cook ""marks an unprecedented moment for both central bank independence, signaling the White House's escalating campaign to exert direct influence over monetary policy decisions.""
""Markets are likely to view this attack on Fed independence negatively, amplifying uncertainty over future policy direction,"" Mills said.
Pulte applauded Trump's move and thanked his ""commitment to stopping mortgage fraud and following the law"" in a post on X.
Cook's termination comes after months of complaints by Trump about the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Jerome Powell, for not cutting interest rates as the president has demanded they do since he returned to the White House in January.
On July 15, Trump asked a group of Republican members of Congress if he should fire Powell, and they agreed he should, according to a senior White House official. Trump said he would follow through on that.
But a day later, Trump publicly denied that he would fire Powell even as he left the door open for it to happen at some point.
""We're not planning on doing it,"" he said at the time.
""I don't rule out anything he said. ""But I think it's highly unlikely, unless he has to leave for fraud.""
If Trump is ultimately successful in removing Cook, he will be able to nominate her successor and reshape the Fed's governing board for the next several years. Fed governors typically serve 14-year terms.
Two of the seven current Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, are Trump appointees. Trump nominated Powell to be the chair of the Federal Reserve in 2017.
As of Monday afternoon, there were six members on the Board of Governors, including Cook, with one seat vacant after the resignation of Adriana Kugler earlier this month.
Trump has nominated Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to fill Kugler's seat.
If Miran is confirmed by the Senate and if Trump succeeds in removing Cook and getting her successor confirmed, it would give Trump a 4-to-3 majority of appointees on the board.
The board, along with five regional presidents who are seated on a rotating basis, makes up the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's key interest rate.
However, the board alone controls several other rates, including the interest paid on reserves that banks keep at the Fed.
After resisting pressure from Trump for months to lower rates, Powell last week suggested that conditions ""may warrant"" interest rate cuts as the Fed proceeds ""carefully.""
The ICE U.S. Dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, shed 0.3% in a rapid move overnight just after Trump said he had fired Cook.
The 2-year Treasury yield, a rate sensitive to Fed moves, ticked lower by 4 basis points on the move. One basis point equals 0.01%.
Stock futures were down in overnight trading before Trump's announcement and continued to slightly move lower after it.
Gold futures were the biggest mover other than the dollar, gaining 0.3%.

If he ever does gain control of the Fed, it could endanger the Trump economy, throw markets into a tailspin, and leave Trump's economic legacy in the basement alongside that of George W. Bush and Herbert Hoover.
Trump's latest Fed attack is a threat to fire Lisa Cook, one of 12 voting members on the Fed committee that sets interest rates. Trump wants to install loyalists at the Fed who will slash rates and do whatever else he wants. Cook is a Biden appointee who, like Fed Chair Jerome Powell, has voted this year to keep rates steady. Most economists think the Fed has been right to sit tight on rates. Trump clearly disagrees.
Trump thinks he found leverage over Cook because his top housing regulator, Bill Pulte, scoured millions of individual housing records looking for dirt and found that Cook declared two different properties as her primary residence when applying for bank loans. Trump claims that gives him the authority to fire Cook. But there's no formal charge against Cook, just the Trump-Pulte smear. Cook said she's staying in her job and will fully defend herself.
Trump has not yet actually moved to fire Cook. He has only said he will do it. So Trump might be floating a trial balloon to see how markets react. But his plan to gain control of the Fed is self-evident. He has repeatedly pressured Powell to resign while nominating loyalist Stephen Miran to the rate-setting committee when Adriana Kugler unexpectedly stepped down in early August. Trump's broader plan may be to seed the rate-setting committee with friendly members by early next year, when the Fed must select the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve banks — normally an uncontroversial process.
Fed watchers are now debating whether Trump could actually pull enough strings to populate the rate-setting committee with a majority of allies willing to do his bidding. But there's no debate over how disruptive it would be if Trump pulled it off. ""Trump's efforts to bend the Fed to his will are a genuine threat to US markets,"" Capital Economics explained in an Aug. 26 analysis. ""Prolonged attacks risk pushing up long-term bond yields while weighing on the value of the dollar and potentially equity prices.""
Markets have already registered a negative reaction. Long-term interest rates rose slightly on news of Trump's plan to fire Cook, while the value of the dollar dipped. Those moves indicate greater worry about inflation due to bad Fed decision making. The moves were modest, but that may be partly because Cook hasn't left, and the Fed, for now, remains independent.
The Fed is far from perfect, but it is the world's most powerful financial institution and a key factor in the US economy's routine outperformance, compared with other advanced nations. Rating agency S&P Global repeatedly cited the Fed's independence as a standout feature of the US economy in a recent update on its US credit rating. In an obvious reference to Trump, S&P said it could lower the US credit rating ""if political developments weigh on the strength of American institutions and the effectiveness of long-term policymaking or independence of the Federal Reserve.""
Markets would render their judgment much faster than any rating agency if Trump did manage to co-opt the Fed. Trump has said he wants the Fed to slash interest rates by two or three percentage points, which would be a dramatic move that typically only happens during economic emergencies. Trump wants lower rates to stimulate an economy that is slowing due to his tariffs and immigration policies. He also wants the government to be able to borrow at lower rates, to help cut federal interest payments and annual deficits.
The problem with lower rates is that cheaper money gooses spending, which can make inflation worse if prices are already elevated — which they are now. The main reason the Fed hasn't been cutting rates is that excessive inflation of the last four years may still be a problem. Inflation fell from a peak of 9% in 2022 to a low of 2.3% in April. But it has ticked back up to 2.7% and many economists think Trump's tariffs will push it to around 3.5%. The Fed normally wants inflation of 2% or so and is reluctant to cut rates if inflation is much above that.
Even so, Powell recently indicated the Fed may be ready to start trimming rates because the labor market is weakening and might need a bit of monetary stimulus. But Powell is talking about a very gradual pace of rate cuts, most likely a quarter-point cut every month or two. Trump wants much faster action. It's unlikely the Fed would cut by a full three points even during the next year or two, unless a recession develops.
The folly of Trump's pressure on the Fed is that the central bank only controls short-term rates, which, for the most part, only affect banks. The market sets long-term rates such as those on mortgages, car loans, and business loans, and politicians cannot muscle financial markets. In fact, it's the other way around.
Last fall, the Fed cut short-term rates by a full point during a four-month period. Long-term rates rose by a point during the same timeframe. That was unusual, but also logical. At the time, bond investors expected higher future interest rates and higher future inflation, so they demanded higher rates on longer-term bonds to compensate for those risks. There were also concerns about the massive amount of US government debt coming into markets to finance persistent deficits. Those concerns generally remain.
If investors lose confidence in the Fed's ability to manage inflation, long-term rates have nowhere to go but up. That's why Terry Haines, founder of Pangaea Policy, calls Trump's attack on Cook an ""own goal misfire.""
""Sustained lack of market confidence could well manifest in more debt and deficit pressures, destabilizing Trump's entire economic policy priorities at a moment of great geopolitical peril for the US,"" Haines wrote to clients in an Aug. 26 newsletter.
Higher rates normally bring lower stock values, slower economic growth, and less hiring. Businesses and consumers who have to pay more to borrow will simply borrow less, which means less economic activity. Higher borrowing costs ding corporate profits, which pass through to lower stock values. All of this creates more risk, making everybody more reluctant to spend. It may not add up to recession, but stagflation is bad enough to bum everybody out.
Trump has a few cool economic heads in his court of otherwise sycophantic advisers, such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who must be telling Trump that a central bank at his beck and call would be a lot less helpful than the Fed as it is now. An independent Fed really does have the president's back, because its entire job is to keep the economy stable. A politically expedient Fed could become feckless because nobody would trust it, and not even the Fed can muscle markets into doing what the president wants. If Trump's threat to fire Cook really is a trial balloon, it's a Hindenburg bound to explode.

In a paper presented to global central bankers at a Fed conference in Wyoming on Saturday, Emi Nakamura, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said the episode showed the value of Fed credibility in action, and also the stakes on the table if that trust is eroded - a no-longer abstract risk after President Donald Trump moved on Monday to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook in the first such move by a U.S. chief executive.
""It's easy to forget how remarkable it was that the Fed was able to look through 7% to 8% inflation while maintaining almost completely anchored long-term inflation expectations. This requires (an) extremely strong reputation,"" Nakamura said, something that hinges ""on institutions like central bank independence and a strong track record, and those are things that take a long time to build up and perhaps not very long to destroy.""
The immediate market reaction to the announced firing of Cook has been tame so far, but analysts feel the seeds of lost faith have been planted even if it remains uncertain how quickly that will matter to policy decisions or market pricing. Trump may not succeed in removing Cook, for instance, which could strengthen the Fed's standing. Reactions in the U.S. Senate, which confirms the president's appointments to the Fed and where members of both parties typically voice strong support for central bank independence, could also be important.
For now Fed policymakers are expected to begin cutting interest rates at their September 16-17 meeting, and Cook has said she intends to continue participating.
Still, ""it's a huge attack on the Fed's efficacy as an independent agency, which of course is the basis for achieving its price stability mandate,"" said Maurice Obstfeld, a professor of economics emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley and a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
""It's going to make it harder for the central bank to achieve its other prime responsibility, which is supporting employment in the economy, without possibly destabilizing expectations of inflation,"" he said. ""The markets will understand that monetary policy decisions are likely to be more politically motivated, and the central bank will be perceived more broadly as being more focused on other goals of the administration, for example, financing our large fiscal deficit.""
Trump has insisted on lower interest rates because he feels it would make it cheaper for the government to finance its large deficits, an idea that could go awry in practice if markets lose faith in inflation control and add a steeper inflation premium to bids on U.S. government debt.
'HE HAS NO AUTHORITY'
The resilience of the Fed's reputation and independence in the face of a determined chief executive has never been fully tested since the central bank was established in its current form, with a series of reforms enacted by Congress in the 1930s, in what historians say was an explicit move to distance monetary policy from White House control.
Key features of this arrangement include long 14-year terms for members of the Washington-based Board of Governors and a division of power between the board and the presidents of 12 regional Fed banks that reflects the federal structure of other parts of the U.S. government. It is rooted in the idea that elected officials are less likely to make the hard and unpopular decisions sometimes needed to control inflation than independent experts prioritizing data and analysis over election outcomes.
It is also a setup that has frustrated Trump and his administration's expansive view of executive power. After failing to pressure the Fed to lower rates since his return to the White House in January, Trump on Monday said a controversy over two residential mortgage loans taken out by Cook before she joined the central bank gave him ""cause"" to fire her.
Supporters of Cook, who is also the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, note that her term runs until 2038, far outlasting Trump's, as do the terms of two other governors appointed by former President Joe Biden. While Trump can name a new Fed chief to take over when Jerome Powell's term ends in May, as it stands the president may lack a majority of his own appointees on the board until 2028, his last full year in office, a barrier to his effort to reshape the central bank.
Even then, there's no guarantee that the central bank's governors who have passed Senate scrutiny would agree to any White House demands, with the separately hired Fed regional bank presidents also involved in policy decisions.
Cook's mortgage issue has been referred to the U.S. Justice Department, but so far no formal action has been taken. In an emailed statement on Monday night, Cook said of Trump that ""no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority"" to remove her from the board. Cook's lawyer, prominent Washington attorney Abbe Lowell, said ""we will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.""
What follows could be an important test of whether the U.S. central bank's independence over monetary policy has been more a matter of practice and protocol than actual legal protection, and in turn a test of how important that independence is to U.S. and global financial markets that have viewed the Fed as a stabilizing influence and central pillar of the world's financial architecture.
During crises, for example, the Fed has acted quickly to calm markets with programs that have crossed borders without political constraints, using ""swap"" lines and other tools to be sure other central banks had access to dollars they and their local companies might need.
The Federal Reserve Act does allow a governor to be removed for ""cause,"" but does not try to define what that means. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a recent similar dispute, did seem to carve out an exemption for the Fed that would prevent removal of a governor in a dispute simply about rates.
But those were not yet full decisions, noted Kathryn Judge, a law professor at Columbia University, with much about the Fed's status still to be decided.
""The law here is under-developed because we have never had to rely on the formal law alone to protect Fed independence. Although a number of presidents have put pressure on Fed chairs, we have never faced a situation where a president has tried to fire a Fed governor,"" Judge said. ""If the president is willing to pull out all of the stops and use an aggressive reading of his inherent authority under Article II (of the U.S. Constitution) to pressure the Fed to follow his lead on monetary policy, it is unlikely to remain independent.""

It a big deal to some shoppers and businesses,A US tariff exemption for small orders ends Friday . It a big deal to some shoppers and businesses,2025-08-26 14:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"NEW YORK (AP) — Low-value imports lost their duty-free status in the United States on Friday as part of President Donald Trump's agenda for making the nation less dependent on foreign goods and resetting global trade with tariffs.
An executive order eliminated a widely used customs exemption for international shipments worth $800 or less as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, nearly two years earlier than the deadline set in the tax cuts and spending bill approved by Congress.
Saying they received too little time and information to start collecting duties on small parcels, the national postal services of more than 30 countries have temporarily suspended sending some or most U.S.-bound packages. They include the mail systems of Australia, New Zealand, India, Japan, Mexico, Thailand and almost every country in Europe.
Purchases that previously entered the U.S. without needing to clear customs will require vetting and be subject to their origin country's applicable tariff rate, which can range from 10% to 50%. For the next six months, mail carriers can instead apply a flat duty of $80 to $200 to packages sent through the global postal network. After that, both mailed parcels and those handled by private courier services will be subject to the value-based tariff rate.
Although the president previously ended the “de minimis” rule for inexpensive items sent from China and Hong Kong, having to pay import taxes on small parcels from everywhere else likely will be a big change for some small businesses and online shoppers. In addition to bringing new costs, the withdrawal of duty-free treatment is likely to delay orders, according to logistics experts.
Exemption created in 1938 for $1 imports
The Trump administration says the exemption has become a loophole that foreign businesses exploit to evade tariffs and criminals use to get drugs, counterfeit products and other contraband into the U.S. Former President Joe Biden and members of Congress also discussed the issue.
Other countries have similar exemptions, but the threshold is usually lower. For example, 150 euros ($175) is the value limit in the 20 European Union countries that use the euro as their official currency. The U.K. allows foreign businesses to send parcels worth up to 135 pounds ($182) without incurring tariff charges.
In the U.S., the “de minimis” — Latin for lacking significance or importance — exemption started in 1938 as a way to save the federal government the time and expense of collecting duties on imported goods with a retail value of $1 or less. U.S. lawmakers eventually increased the eligibility cutoff to $5 in 1990, to $200 in 1993 and to $800 in 2015, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Since then, the number of shipments claiming de minimis treatment has exploded. A total of 1.36 billion packages with a combined value of $64.6 billion reached the U.S. last year, compared to 134 million packages sent under the exemption in 2015, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency reported.
About 60% of the 2024 shipments came from China and Hong Kong, according to an analysis logistics firm Flexport prepared based on U.S. government data. Multiple countries and regions accounted for the remainder, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, India and Vietnam.
Boutique owner anticipates higher costs for European apparel
Proponents of limiting the exemption argue that it has served as a way for China-founded retail platforms like Temu and Shein to flood the U.S. with low-priced goods. The National Council of Textile Organizations said the move would help close a ""backdoor pipeline for cheap, subsidized, and often illegal, toxic and unethical imports.” But some smaller American companies that rely on imported products and materials benefited from the exemption too.
Kristin Trainor is worried the end of de minimis will also mean the end of Diesel and Lulu's, her 3-year-old boutique in Avon, Connecticut. Over 70% of the women's clothes and accessories she stocks comes from small fashion houses in France, Italy and Spain. Trainor places small batch orders each week that fall under the $800 threshold.
“Our business model is to provide casual chic and unique clothes at affordable prices,” she said. “The added customs and duty charges that will go into effect on Aug. 29 will eliminate that affordability. ”
Trainor said she was looking to replace her European vendors with ones based in the U.S. But her bestselling product categories, such as apparel made of Italian linen, come from other countries. She estimates a simple linen sundress that cost $30 wholesale at the beginning of the year will rise to $43 next month.
After a corporate career, Trainor opened the store to have more time with her 9-year-old son and her 91-year old father. Raising the boutique’s prices to absorb part of the import charges would help offset higher shipping and logistics costs, but Trainor worries her customers will balk at higher prices.
“I have not made any official announcements to my customers just yet, although they have started to ask if I will stay open as they understand the economic impacts that are occurring,” she said. “At this point, I am leaning more and more towards closing the boutique, sadly.”
Trade agreement doesn't shield products from Mexico and Canada
Ken Huening started CoverSeal, his business making and selling protective covers for cars, motorcycles, grills and patio furniture, in 2020. The company is based in Los Gatos, California, and the covers are manufactured in Mexico and China. When a customer places an order, it ships from Mexico.
Although a trade agreement that took effect in 2020 has made most goods from Mexico and Canada exempt from country-specific U.S. tariffs, the withdrawal of the de minimis rule applies to all countries.
Huening said he'll either have to raise prices or end free shipping now that his products will be taxed when they are sent from Mexico to U.S. customers. He's looked at setting up a U.S. production and logistics network but says domestic sewing facilities and textile manufacturers do not exist for the engineered fabric used in CoverSeal's products.
“We are often asked why we don’t just establish a U.S. supply chain,” he said. “It is not possible in the short term. By the time the infrastructure is established, many companies and small businesses will be out of business.”
Shannen Knight imports hard-to-find sports goggles and glasses as the owner of A Sight For Sport Eyes, her online store and shop in West Linn, Oregon. She routinely received shipments from the U.K., the Netherlands and Italy that fell under the de minimis dollar cutoff.
Knight estimated that she would need to raise the retail price of the rugby goggles she gets from Italy by 50%. It took the International Rugby Board two years of testing to approve the Italian-made goggles, a specialty item without strong prospects for stateside production, she said.
“There are products that it just makes sense to be made internationally, where there is the stronger demand for them, but there still is some demand for in the U.S.,"" Knight said.",6b1ddd5907381abe36ffa7aeb9fbbf3a,trafilatura,7126,0

Its GPUs are found in data centers operated by the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and xAI, generating billions in revenue.
While the company's relationships with Big Tech are undoubtedly important, its connections to research universities and colleges across the country and world are no less significant to Nvidia's long-term success.
That's because, as university researchers come up with new techniques for using GPUs, Nvidia, and its competitors, can take advantage of them to develop new technologies.
After all, Nvidia's leadership role in AI kicked off in 2012 when researchers at the University of Toronto used the company's GPUs to develop their image recognition tool, AlexNet. This opened the door to how Nvidia's chips could be used to power AI applications and helped to turn Nvidia into what it is today.
""One of [CEO Jensen Huang's] most brilliant moves early on was to start to work with researchers on the very beginnings of AI,"" TECHnalysis chief analyst Bob O'Donnell explained.
""He figured out early on that it was going to take a lot of work and research to do this,"" O'Donnell added. ""So he jumped in and wholeheartedly supported academic research into AI, and all of that has paid off in spades. And so he's obviously continuing that approach, because he knows that that's where a lot of the most interesting developments are happening.""
Naturally, those same universities benefit in their own way, creating a kind of flywheel that continues to spin faster each day.
University programs running on Nvidia tech
Nvidia says it works with universities in three major ways: through infrastructure, the actual hardware necessary to run AI research and programs; its software libraries, like CUDA, which help researchers and students develop new AI applications and use cases; and hackathons, grants, and joint research projects.
The University of Florida received donations from Nvidia, as well as Nvidia co-founder and University of Florida alumnus Chris Malachowsky, to help deploy its HiPerGator supercomputer in 2020. The school was the first in the US to use Nvidia's A100 and Blackwell chips and developed a program that allows all students to gain access to the high-powered system.
""We launched an initiative called AI Across the Curriculum, which meant that every student at the University of Florida, all 60,000 some students ... will have the opportunity to learn about AI, work with AI at different levels of complexity, from basic to as advanced as building digital twins,"" University of Florida vice president and chief information officer Elias G. Eldayrie explained.
""So HiPerGator now supports about 67% of the university research portfolio. And that research portfolio is about $1.2 billion,"" he added.
So far, Eldayrie said, the university is using AI in healthcare, agriculture, and building maintenance. In healthcare, the university built a digital twin of an emergency room to simulate the ER experience, including everything from managing the room temperature to how many times a patient gets interrupted in an effort to improve surgical outcomes.
In agriculture, the university is analyzing data from drones to determine the best treatment for specific crops rather than spraying entire fields. The school has also built a digital twin of the city of Jacksonville to simulate buildings and how best to maintain them.
The Georgia Institute of Technology is building out its new Nvidia-powered Nexus supercomputer that the school says will allow it to perform research on large global problems.
""If you think about curing cancer. It's just very dependent on complicated histories of people and their environment, and so just keeping track of all that stuff is a really challenging problem,"" Georgia Tech executive vice president for research Tim Lieuwen explained.
""Or ... keeping our country safe; radar systems to detect incoming missiles and deploy systems to take them out,"" he added. ""Those are really complicated problems where AI can really help. Taking the best in robotics, in AI, and bringing really exciting, high value jobs back to the United States in manufacturing. So these are all really interesting applications, and applications where this [high-performance computer] resource is going to help Georgia Tech researcher ... move the needle.""
The State University of New York's University at Albany received millions in funds from the 2022 state budget to set up its Nvidia-powered supercomputer facility. The goal is to perform research on cybersecurity, weather modeling and climate prediction, and fine-tuning large-scale AI models.
""It is really being used heavily,"" University at Albany vice president for research and economic development, Thenkurussi Kesavadas, explained.
""I will tell you that faculty members are using it for research, but also students ... are using that in their advanced classes on AI, and doctoral students and PhD students are using it for their own research in collaboration with faculty members,"" Kesavadas added.
To be sure, universities also lean on Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to power their supercomputers, as well as Intel (INTC) CPUs. University supercomputers are also far smaller than the warehouse-sized systems cloud computing companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google operate.
Nvidia also benefits from working with universities. In addition to breakthroughs like AlexNet, Nvidia's involvement with research schools ensures a steady stream of new students familiar and comfortable with using its AI software and hardware.
""[Huang] gets a whole bunch of grad students who get trained in their technology and then are ready to get hired and continue that work at Nvidia,"" O'Donnell said.
""It's not just the product benefits, it's the pipeline. Because, look, we're still in an era when ... there's not enough of these [AI experts] out there,"" he added.
The company also gets a healthy dose of cachet whenever researchers announce new AI advancements they've reached using Nvidia's chips.
While that might not directly benefit the company's bottom line, it serves to continue to build the brand's reputation as an AI leader.
For now, Nvidia continues to be the go-to choice for AI chips, followed by AMD. But that may not remain the case in the future as the technology continues to evolve and companies like Google and Amazon build their own specialized AI processors.
But at the moment, Nvidia doesn't appear to be losing its grip on the AI market or the university space. And if it can hold on to that, the flywheel will keep spinning.

Last summer, Mark Cuban found himself seated on a warehouse floor alongside viral sensation Bobbi Althoff, as a guest on her popular podcast, “The Really Good Podcast”.
During the 58-minute interview, Althoff used her awkward yet engaging tactics and got Cuban to open up about a range of topics from the Mavericks to Shark Tank— and even asking him for $5 million to buy a home.
“You could give me a billion dollars right now and it probably wouldn’t even affect you,” Altoff quipped, negotiating with Cuban. “Fine $5 million, we’ll go small. I could buy a house in Southern California.”
Despite finding common ground over their shared birthday and lactose intolerance, Cuban cautioned Althoff that even with a multi-million dollar handout, California living would still be beyond her means. “I would have given you $5 million for nothing,” replied the Shark Tank star.
Here’s why Cuban cautioned Altoff — plus some options worth considering if you’re priced out of buying a home in California (or any other state) but still want to invest in the lucrative U.S. real estate market.
Alternatives to homeownership in Southern California and beyond
The California housing market has soared to unprecedented levels, with the median sale price reaching a staggering $906,500 as of August, according to Forbes Advisor.
Cuban emphasizes the importance of considering the complete financial picture when thinking about homeownership. While you might believe you can afford the initial down payment, there can be significant ongoing expenses to maintain the property.
“You’d have to pay all those taxes,” said Cuban, nodding to the high property tax rates in California.
According to the California Association of Realtors (C.A.R.), a minimum annual income of $218,000 was needed to afford the median-priced home in California in the first quarter of 2025.
Thankfully, there are ways you can make money on the current real estate market without having to buy a home, pay property taxes, or deal with the responsibilities of managing rental properties and tenants.
For accredited investors, Homeshares gives access to the $36 trillion U.S. home equity market, which has historically been the exclusive playground of institutional investors.
With a minimum investment of $25,000, investors can gain direct exposure to hundreds of owner-occupied homes in top U.S. cities through their U.S. Home Equity Fund — without the headaches of buying, owning or managing property.
FNRP is a private equity firm where accredited investors can access institutional-quality, grocery-anchored commercial real estate deals, without the need to source or manage the deals themselves.
Their experienced team has established connections with some of the nation's largest essential-needs brands, such as Kroger, Walmart, and Whole Foods, giving them access to prime commercial properties both on and off the market. They handle the entire deal process from start to finish, so you can enjoy the benefits of investing in necessity-based real estate without the hassle of buying or managing the property yourself.
If you’re not an accredited investor, crowdfunding platforms like Arrived allow you to enter the real estate market for as little as $100.
Backed by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived makes it easy to fit these properties into your investment portfolio regardless of your income level. Their flexible investment amounts and simplified process allow accredited and non-accredited investors to take advantage of this inflation-hedging asset class without any extra work on your part.
Mogul is a real estate investment platform offering fractional ownership in blue-chip rental properties, which gives investors monthly rental income, real-time appreciation and tax benefits — without the need for a $250,000 down payment or 3 A.M. tenant calls.
Each property undergoes a vetting process, requiring a minimum 12% return even in downside scenarios. Across the board, the platform features an average annual IRR of 18.8%. Their cash-on-cash yields, meanwhile, average between 10-12% annually.
Every investment is secured by real assets, not dependent on the platform’s viability. Each property is held in a standalone Propco LLC, so investors own the property — not the platform. Blockchain-based fractionalization adds a layer of safety, ensuring a permanent, verifiable record of each stake.
Getting started is a quick and easy process. All you need to do is sign up for an account and then browse available properties. Once you verify your information with their team, you can invest in the properties of your choice in as little as 30 seconds.
In classic Bobbi Althoff fashion, she not only asked for a $5 million handout from Cuban, but she pitched him on investing in her podcast.
“I don’t know that I’d invest in a podcast,” responded Cuban, despite Althoff mentioning her $20,000 debt related to her podcast.
High-net-worth individuals like Mark Cuban might buy and sell large quantities of stocks, giving them the power to offset their gains with strategic losses to maximize their overall returns through tax savings.
If you have no appetite for the ups and downs of the stock market and you have a large stash of cash you want to invest, there is an array of lucrative alternative assets open to you.
One option is fine art, a private asset that has historically been available exclusively for billionaires like Cuban.
But with Masterworks, that isn’t the case anymore.
Through their easy-to-use online platform, you can now invest in artwork by iconic artists from Banksy to Basquiat without having to get all dressed up to attend an auction to pay the sticker price for a painting.
Whether you’re buying stocks or investing in alternative assets, having the guidance of a financial advisor is essential. A vetted financial advisor through WiserAdvisor can help tailor an investment strategy that aligns with your goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation, ensuring your windfall works hard for you without unnecessary risks.
That’s probably why three in four Americans with an advisor (75%) believe that they will be financially prepared to retire, compared to just 45% without an advisor.
WiserAdvisor is a free matching service that helps you find an advisor who can help you reach your financial goals by matching you with a pre-screened financial advisor from their database of thousands.
All it takes is a few minutes to answer some questions about yourself, and WiserAdvisor will provide you with a personalized match of two to three advisors.

When the Fed raises rates, borrowing tends to get more expensive for consumers on the whole, and when the Fed lowers rates, borrowing tends to cost less.
Shop Top Mortgage Rates
Powered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above. However, despite the Fed holding its benchmark interest rate steady since December, some banks are raising annual percentage rates (APR) for credit card users that they deem to be riskier, while lowering APRs for borrowers with better credit.
And that's something consumers should be aware of.
The Fed is not in charge of setting interest rates for consumer products like credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans. But its benchmark interest rate does directly influence how much it costs consumers to borrow. When the Fed raises its benchmark interest rate, it becomes costlier for banks themselves to borrow money — so they tend to pass that cost on to consumers. And on the flipside, when it's cheaper for banks to borrow, they tend to charge consumers less to borrow. Banks or lenders also base this decision on other factors that include loan size and creditworthiness.
MarketWatch recently reported that a growing list of credit cards are seeing changes to their APRs. Your card's APR determines how much your credit card balance costs you in interest.
Bankrate credit-cards expert Katie Kelton told the news outlet she noticed a small increase in credit-card rates during recent months.
Matt Schulz, an analyst at LendingTree, noted in the report that Fidelity’s Rewards Visa Signature card went from a single 18.24% APR in May to a variable APR of 17.24% to 27.24%. Likewise, Chase’s Sapphire Reserve Card used to have an APR range of 21.49% to 28.49%. Now, the top end of that range is 28.74%, while the lower end actually fell to 20.24%.
The reason banks are widening the range of their credit card APRs boils down to risk. Borrowers with lower credit scores may be more likely to default on their debt (be unable to pay it back), so banks try to offset that risk by collecting more interest on unpaid balances. They also want to reward their more creditworthy customers.
Of course, this isn't exactly a new practice. When you apply for a loan, your lender will review your credit score and offer an interest rate based on how high or low that number is, among other factors. It's also not unusual for credit cards to jack up APRs for borrowers with poor credit. But the fact that banks are doing it at a time when Fed rate cuts are on the horizon is telling. Many believe that the Fed will make its first interest rate cut of the year at its upcoming September meeting.

The fact that banks are making changes to APRs ahead of that meeting shows that they're feeling the broader squeeze of economic uncertainty.
“Banks hate risk and always try to avoid it,” Schulz told MarketWatch. “In an uncertain economy, there are a lot of risks out there, and part of what banks are doing to protect themselves is slowly raising interest rates, especially on folks at the lower end of the credit spectrum.”
“Banks are used to responding to a changing economy. But the muddy waters around tariffs, economic policies and consumer sentiment may be leading to precautionary moves from banks,” said Kelton.
The Fed's next opportunity to make a change to its federal funds rate is mid-September. But even if the Fed lowers interest rates as expected, it doesn't mean consumers will get to enjoy relief overnight. It can take a few billing cycles for a Fed rate cut to trickle down to credit card APRs.
As of May, the average credit card APR was 21.16%, according to the Federal Reserve’s own data. But even if credit card APRs do come down fairly quickly, some consumers may not even realize it.
A recent LendingClub survey found that 47.1% of Americans do not know the APR they're paying on their credit cards. A further 49.5% were not aware that their credit card APRs rose by over five percentage points between March 2022 and July 2023, when the Fed raised interest rates aggressively to combat inflation.
It’s also worth noting that the last time the Fed lowered interest rates, it was only a quarter-point drop. The Fed typically likes to raise and lower interest rates incrementally, as opposed to drastically, so this was not an unusual thing. If the Fed makes a rate cut in September, it will likely be only a quarter-point as well.
As of the second quarter of 2025, Americans carried a total credit card balance of $1.21 trillion, 5.87% above the level a year ago, according to the New York Fed. In March of 2025, it reported that 74% of U.S. adults have a credit card, and that 60% of those borrowers carry a balance from one month to the next.
If you have credit card debt, the sooner you pay it off, the better, of course. Losing money to interest eats into your monthly budget, so consider whether the snowball or avalanche method is better for you.
One thing you may want to do if you’re able to aggressively pay down your debt over the next year is transfer your existing credit card balances onto a single card with a 0% introductory APR. This gives you a break from accruing interest for a period of time, allowing you to pay down your principal more efficiently. However, make sure to read the fine print. The introductory offers only last a specific period, and you need to be able to repay the amount within that time to benefit.
Another option to consider is taking out a personal loan, using its proceeds to pay off your credit cards, and then paying off that loan in installments. With a personal loan, you’re likely to be looking at a lower interest rate on your debt than what your credit cards are charging you.
Case in point: In May of 2025, the average 24-month personal loan rate was 11.57%, according to the Federal Reserve, as opposed to 21.16% among credit cards.
You may, however, want to wait a couple of months before consolidating your credit card debt into a personal loan. If the Fed does indeed lower interest rates in September, personal loan rates could come down toward the end of the year, making it a more affordable option for you.

The Paris CAC 40 index was 1.4% lower in afternoon deals on Tuesday, after dropping more than 2% in early trade. French medium to long-term borrowing costs ticked higher, with the country's 10-year bond yield up 2 basis points and its 30-year yield up 4 basis points.
France's need to lower its public deficit is a long-running and highly politically contentious subject. Forcing through a 2025 budget without parliamentary approval last year led to the collapse of the previous minority government led by Michel Barnier. Political volatility has increased in France since the July 2024 parliamentary election failed to deliver any party or coalition a majority.
Bayrou is now seeking to pass a 2026 budget containing around 44 billion euros ($51.2 billion) in fiscal tightening, with his proposals including freezing welfare and pension spending, as well as tax brackets, at 2025 levels. He has also proposed cutting two public holidays in a highly unpopular move.
The government argues cutbacks are needed to tame a deficit which totaled 5.8% of gross domestic product in 2024 — a figure it says will continue to rise without action. The European Union states that its members should target a 3% deficit ratio in order to reduce excessive debt.
French economic growth has meanwhile been sluggish, cooling to 1.2% in 2024 from 1.4% the prior year.
Speaking to press on Monday, Bayou said France's dependence on debt had become ""chronic.""
""Our country is in danger, because we are at risk of over-indebtedness,"" he said, according to a CNBC translation.
Bayrou said French debt had grown by 2 trillion euros over the last two decades, noting that the country had weathered events including the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia-Ukraine war, inflation spike and most recently the impact of U.S. tariffs. He added that the budget dispute should be resolved through an orderly debate in parliament followed by a vote, rather than through ""street clashes and insults.""
Comments by officials from the far-right National Rally, the Greens and the Socialists suggested no party will officially back him, risking government collapse.
Pierre Jouvet, general secretary of the Socialist Party, said on the X social media platform on Monday that the group would vote against Bayou, and that the government did not have the confidence of parliament or the French people. Jouvet added the party would present its own budget proposals in the coming days.
National Rally President Jordan Bardella said his party would ""never vote confidence in a government whose choices make the French people suffer,"" according to a CNBC translation.
Risk of collapse 'not priced'
""Should the government lose the confidence vote, President Macron may seek to nominate a different Prime Minister to form a government, who would then face the immediate challenge of passing a 2026 budget,"" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a Tuesday note.
""Alternatively, Macron could call snap elections. Current polls point to another fragmented outcome as happened after the summer 2024 snap vote, though with the far-right [National Rally] leading in polls, investors would be watchful whether it could translate this lead into an outright majority this time round.""
Following the Monday news, the spread on Italian 10-year bond yields over France's fell to 9.8 basis points, its lowest level since 1999, the analysts said — sign that investors are putting a similar premium on the countries' political risk. In 2022, the spread was as high as 180 basis points.
Reinout de Bock, UBS head of European rates strategy, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Tuesday that Bayrou's call for a confidence vote was a ""surprise"" to markets.
""I think this is not priced at all, and it's potentially a big story in the next couple of weeks,"" he said.
""In Europe right now, it's really about spending more than we had 10-15 years ago...The challenge for France is that they're having a budget deficit [of] around 5.8% of GDP. That is the biggest budget deficit in the euro area, and there [are] open questions to what extent they will succeed in reducing spending.""
Bayrou could cling on
Erik Nelson, head of G10 FX strategy at Wells Fargo, called the outlook for French assets ""not great"" — but said the outcome for Bayrou's government was not a foregone conclusion.
""I think part of the issue here is that European equities, the euro itself, have been a very popular momentum trade throughout the year. What we're seeing in the last couple of days has been a little bit of unwind of some of the momentum trades that have been working, and so there is the risk there that we can see further unwind on some of these political risks,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""
""I don't know that Bayrou is definitely out. There's still some uncertainty there. He's got a lot of things he can offer the opposition.""
He noted that the French prime minister had previously threatened — and could now walk back — plans to remove some public holidays.
""Surely that's going to be taken off the table. So it's not a done deal, but they're walking a very fine line here, and as I mentioned earlier, given where market positioning in European assets, there's a lot of risks,"" Nelson said.
However, political analyst and consultant Julien Hoez said it was ""almost certain"" that Bayrou would lose the vote.
""Despite Bayrou saying that all austerity measures were negotiable, the reality is that the opposition parties don't trust him,"" political analyst Julien Hoez told CNBC. Unsuccessful negotiations earlier in the year over reform of French President Emmanuel Macron's controversial 2023 move to raise France's retirement age in line with the Socialists' demands fractured relations with the government, Hoez said.
No-confidence votes from members of the Greens, Socialists, far-left La France Insoumise and National Rally — as appears likely — would then tally up to 315 votes, well above the 289 needed to topple the government, Hoez added.
""The more important question is what happens after, with Macron having agreed to an extraordinary session of the [National Assembly] for this vote, which will show the impossibility of governing with the extremes in today's configuration, and will actually be more of a push towards another election than any other outcome,"" he said.",f7578de748b1496b0c1a7db78dc19a13,trafilatura,6556,0

Yet for many workers, flexible work arrangements are a must-have.
Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, has a new book co-written with Ranya Nehmeh, a workplace strategist. ""In Praise of the Office: The Limits to Hybrid and Remote Work"" lays out the business case for employers pushing for workers to get back to the office.
Here are edited excerpts from my recent conversation with Cappelli:
Kerry Hannon: Why has the case for in-office work never been stronger?
Peter Cappelli: We've gone through this period where there's been big debates about remote work and a lot of companies have persisted in various kinds of remote, but mainly hybrid. At the moment, the recognition is growing across employers that it hasn't worked so well.
When business returned and things became a little more normal, it became easier to start to see some of the drawbacks. It wasn't enough just to keep the wheels going.
We're at this inflection point now where companies really have to decide if they ever want to get people back. The longer you wait, the harder it is to ever get people to come back without a big fight.
Right now, people might be saying, ‘I will quit if I have to go back to the office,’ but it turns out they don't mean it. The reason, of course, is it's one thing to say that you will quit; it's another to actually walk away from a paycheck.
What’s wrong with a hybrid work arrangement?
People just don't come in. That’s maybe the single biggest factor. There is a growing awareness that people are really never there on their anchor days. If you want that for your company, you have to manage that attendance.
That’s on the shoulders of the managers themselves. It's not that we don't think you could have hybrid work, but if you're going to do it, it requires a lot of effort on the part of management.
Lots of employers trumpeted the success of remote work not that long ago. What changed?
One thing that changed is the labor market softened. It's not the case that people are job hopping right now because there just aren't very many jobs offered. The number of jobs that are being offered with some kind of remote possibility is declining.
At the CEO level, immediately after the pandemic they were glad things were still running at all. Expectations were really low. What's changed is the CEOs are now thinking we're losing something, and the employee resistance to return to the office has weakened. That's why we're seeing the push right now.
Until recently, it was resistance from employees and a little kicking the can down the road. Employers didn't want to take on their employees. The labor market was tight. In reality, remote work was a short-term solution during the pandemic that ended up causing a longer-term problem.
What’s the compelling advantage of in-person work?
There’s value in human interaction, what we learn from each other, the cooperation that we can get in solving problems, and the motivation and commitment that comes from being around other people.
Our view is not that you have to be in the office all the time — but social connections matter a lot. When you first began your career, imagine what it would've been like if no one was in the office. You'd be completely lost.
If you think about how we learn about office work, we learn by watching. You learn what the values of the organization are. You learn it from the conversations in the office. You can see how the boss reacts to different requests and different problems.
As you advance, you've got your ear to the ground, and you've got the opportunity to raise your hand and pitch in and have some influence. You can catch the boss between meetings and pass along a little tidbit of information, and you develop relationships with people where you can solve problems.
If you’re in the office and you need help from somebody, and it's urgent, you just go around the corner and stick your head in their door and ask them a quick question.
Those are the kind of things that we miss when we move to remote — in addition to the general fact that people are energized by working with people.
With remote work, people also spend more time in meetings that are worthless. A lot of those things could be fixed, but the problem is they're not.
What’s one thing that working in an office can give us that most people don’t think about?
You will have friends. You build your social network. Remote workers having shrinking social networks, and that contributes to the loneliness epidemic and the lack of social connections.
Is remote work as big as it appears to be in terms of the number of people who work that way?
No. In Europe, for example, where employees have always had more power, I figured remote work would stay. It hasn't. Most everybody's gone back to the office. In Asia, most everybody has gone back to the office. In the US, the best data we've got from the government, which is now a little dated but nobody believes it's gone up since then, is that more than 70% of US employers have no remote or hybrid workers of any kind.
Now that sounds stunning. But remember, most employers are small. Remote work and hybrid work, in particular, is largely a big city, big company phenomenon. It isn't everywhere, and it isn't in all jobs. It's only white-collar jobs.
The future of work is certainly not remote? Correct?
That's right. Every once in a while somebody pops up a list of the employers that have fully remote work. It is almost always companies that begin as remote. By the way, the thing that struck me about those companies if you look at them, they've got a lot of rules about how to behave, and it's quite different from the office. It requires a lot more management time and energy than we've given it.
What's your parting thought for employers of how to approach the new world of work?
If you opt for remote or hybrid, good outcomes don't happen by themselves. You can make it work, but it requires more time and effort for management, more rules, more practices, more leadership.
And for employees?
Be very practical. If you’re beginning your career, go to the office. Be careful about taking remote positions because I think it won't be too long before CFOs start asking, ‘Why is Peter an employee at all? We don't see him. Why not just make him a contractor?’ I imagine that will start happening pretty quickly.",6e248d97a9575a35b1f8a467631989cf,trafilatura,6512,0

He spoke to BI about what it's been like to start his career at a hedge fund in this environment.
From his daily tasks to what he's learned from senior traders, this is what the macro analyst said.
Not every Wall Street rookie gets a market like this. For one new macro analyst at Balyasny, his first year on the trading floor lined up with surging volatility — a backdrop that can be both daunting and unusually rewarding.
That's been the last 12 months for Francesco Catanzariti, an analyst on Balyasny Asset Management's macro trading team.
He started at the firm as an intern in 2023, an exclusive cohort that accepts about 0.5% of applicants. Only about half of that summer class received a full-time job offer, and Catanzariti made the cut. Now, at 24, he has finished his master's degree at Princeton and sits at the center of the action at Balyasny, which manages $25 billion in assets.
Catanzariti spoke with Business Insider about what it's been like to start his career in a volatile market that's been characterized by tariff turmoil. Balyasny, which as a multistrategy firm diversifies its bets among various investment strategies, has gained 7.8% for 2025 as of the end of July.
The questions and answers below — which range from what he's learned by watching senior traders above handle chaos to examples of his day-to-day tasks — have been edited for length and clarity.
BI: What a year to start your career at a hedge fund. What has it been like?
FC: It is an incredibly fun place to be, and especially this year, with everything that's happening in the markets, it was really fascinating to see people react. It was for sure a big learning experience.
Of course, I didn't have trading responsibility from day one. That was good because there was a gradual process from the internship. I got more and more involved with what the team does, all the way up to helping them develop models, book trades, and things like that — growing step by step.
I think we have a very good network of experts, and it was really helpful to navigate that and listen to different voices. I saw how my team had a more semi-systematic approach, and in particular, how long-term projects take a step back during market turmoil. They try to take advantage of the specific opportunity that presents itself at that moment.
BI: What did you learn from watching experienced traders and investors navigate this year?
FC: The growth mindset that the senior people have — and how they can deal with many different situations and asset classes. This is something I'm trying to develop, but of course, still have a lot of room to grow. As an analyst, you focus much more on a specific asset or a specific project, and you don't think in terms of the overall portfolio.
It was fascinating to see PMs expressing views on different things and changing those views based on the circumstances. Being able to think quickly and do some approximation — maybe not caring as much about having the exact results or exact price, but rather wanting some heuristic, some intuition. And if they see that there's not an opportunity, they don't keep obsessing about it. That deep humility it's something that really surprised me.
BI: What does a normal day at work look like for you? What does the day-to-day work of a first-year analyst look like?
FC: My tasks are very diverse. I have my own long-term projects that could be, for example, implementing some new changes, visualizing something for my team, or building a dashboard.
Other things could be fixing and improving our code base.
There are other fun and academic tasks, for example, researching, looking at a paper, a specific model, a particular asset class, and explaining the returns. I'll write code, present the results to my team, and explain models and interesting patterns I notice.
When the other analysts present a project for their manager, we'll look together at the risk, evaluate it based on the historical simulation, and how we can restructure our portfolio to try to take advantage of the particular situation or to be exposed to a particular catalyst. I also listen in when we have experts and consultants come to speak — learning what they say about specific events or a specific economic situation.
When we trade, I help with reporting the trades, keeping track of them, and interfacing with the middle office for booking. I'm exposed to all the different parts of what my team does. And that provides for a lot of organic learning, which I'm sure will be helpful for the future.
BI: When reflecting on year one, going from student and intern to full-time analyst, what has been unexpected for you?
FC: How much BAM invests in technology. I think that's something I was really impressed by, even when I was an intern. My internship was a few months before all the hype about LLMs and AI, and we already had our own implementation of LLMs. Seeing the evolution over time, and the tools that we have access to now — it's incredible because it effectively means the amount of work you can do is multiplied.
Another aspect is, apart from the learning, I can totally see the impact that I have on my team.
BI: So, after the year you've had, are you more or less interested in sticking with macro long term?
FC: Definitely more interested. You can combine so many things together, which gives it so much breadth. You incorporate your views about macroeconomics and geopolitics, but you can also try to implement a mathematical technique or study a particular machine learning approach.
When I was in undergrad and I was more interested in investing long short equity, that was missing there. I was just looking at the financial statement analysis and looking at specific companies, but it was difficult to think about all the different factors that were impacting a company from the outside. Here, you have exposure to these factors and you try to look at them. You can develop as much quantitative skill as you want and always be up to date with what's happening in the world, which I think is fantastic.
I'm passionate in general about following current events, but this — I can make it part of my job. And on top of that, I can apply more quantitative techniques, which is something that I'm interested in. So, for sure, I'm more and more in love with the industry and with the sector.",98fee81784c78e60f055b10ddc3993ed,trafilatura,6427,0

Associated Press Finance
5 min read
NEW YORK (AP) — In an unprecedented move, U.S. President Donald Trump said that he’s firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook — marking a sharp escalation in his efforts to exert greater control on one of the most powerful financial institutions in the world.
Trump took to social media Monday night to announce that he would be removing Cook, effective immediately, over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud before she joined the board. In response, Cook said that she would not step down — and maintained that the president has no authority to fire her.
“I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022,"" she said in an emailed statement. An attorney for Cook later said that she would be suing to challenge Trump's action.
Cook made headlines three years ago when she became the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s board of governors, which votes on the central bank’s key interest rate decisions. Prior to her appointment to the board, she was a longtime economics professor and also held roles in the Clinton, G.W. Bush and Obama administrations.
Here's what to know about Lisa Cook.
How long has Cook served as a Fed Governor?
Cook was appointed to the Fed’s board by President Joe Biden in 2022. Her nomination was opposed by most Senate Republicans, and she was approved on a 50-50 vote with the tie broken by then-Vice President Kamala Harris.
When she took office, Cook became the first Black woman to serve as a Fed Governor in the institution's over century-long history. She initially filled an unexpired term and was reappointed the following year. Her appointment runs through January 2038.
What did Cook do prior to her role at the Fed?
Cook has taught economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and was previously also on the faculty of Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.
She has received degrees from Oxford University, Spelman College and the University of California, Berkeley. Some of her most well-known research has focused on the impact of racial violence on African-American innovation, and consequently wider economic growth.
Also prior to her appointment to the Fed, Cook served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama from 2011 and 2012 — as well as a senior adviser on finance and development in the Treasury Department’s Office of International Affairs from 2000 to 2001, under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
What does a Fed Governor do?
Fed governors vote on the central bank’s interest rate decisions — as well as other issues of financial regulation.
Board members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. But unlike cabinet secretaries — who serve at the pleasure of the president, for example — Fed governors take on 14-year terms that are staggered in an effort to insulate the Fed from political influence.
The political independence of the Fed is considered critical to its ability to fight inflation because it enables the central bank to take unpopular steps, like raising interest rates. If bond investors start to lose faith that the Fed will be able to control inflation, they will demand higher rates to own bonds — pushing up borrowing costs for the U.S. government as well as consumers' mortgages, car loans and business loans.
What is the Trump administration accusing Cook of?
The Trump administration has accused Cook of mortgage fraud. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who heads the Federal Housing Finance Agency, made the accusations last week — alleging that Cook had claimed two primary residences, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta, in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.
In a letter addressed to Cook that Trump shared on Truth Social Monday night, the president said that the “American people must have the full confidence in the honesty of the members entrusted with setting policy and overseeing the Federal Reserve” — and that he did not have confidence in Cook's integrity in light of her “deceitful and potentially criminal conduct.”
The law allows a president to fire a Fed governor “for cause,” which typically means for some kind of wrongdoing or dereliction of duty. But establishing a for-cause removal usually requires some type of proceeding that would allow Cook to answer the charges and present evidence, which hasn’t happened in this case.
Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said on Tuesday that she would be filing a lawsuit to challenge Trump's action — maintaining that his attempt to fire Cook “lacks any factual or legal basis.”
While presidents have clashed with Fed chairs before, no president has ever sought to fire a Fed governor before. And critics say these accusations are being used as a tool by Trump to gain control of the central bank. Forcing Cook off the Fed’s governing board would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist.
Have any other government officials been accused of mortgage fraud?
Yes. Pulte, whose agency regulates mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has targeted several government officials with mortgage fraud claims in recent weeks.
“If you commit mortgage fraud in America, we will come after you, no matter who you are,” Pulte wrote on social media platform X following Trump's action against Cook.
Still, this isn't the first time Pulte has raised allegations against individuals who have clashed with Trump. He and Trump have simiarly targeted Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Schiff led Trump’s first impeachment, while James sued Trump’s company over alleged fraud for falsifying records.
Meanwhile, Trump's administration has faced criticism for not targeting others accused of mortgage fraud — including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a staunch Trump ally. An AP review of public records earlier this year found that mortgages for three houses signed by Paxton and wife, Angela, contained inaccurate statements declaring that each home was their primary residence — enabling the now-estranged couple to improperly lock in low interest rates. But Pulte and the Trump administration have yet to publicly share any plans to investigate.",af132a429b151d0e171e779ba0ec4b0c,trafilatura,6379,0

JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming (Reuters) -Global central bankers gathered at a U.S. mountain resort over the weekend are starting to fear that the political storm surrounding the Federal Reserve may engulf them too.
U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape the Fed to his liking and pressure it into interest rate cuts have raised questions about whether the U.S. central bank can preserve its independence and inflation-fighting credentials.
Trump, frustrated by the legal protections given to the Fed's leadership and the long terms for Board of Governors members meant to outlast any given president, has put intense pressure on Chair Jerome Powell to resign and is pushing to oust another board member, Governor Lisa Cook.
If the world's most powerful central bank were to yield to that pressure, or Trump finds a playbook for removing its members, a dangerous precedent would be set from Europe to Japan, where established norms for the independence of monetary policy may then come under new attack from local politicians.
""The politically motivated attacks on the Fed have a spiritual spillover to the rest of the world, including Europe,"" European Central Bank policymaker Olli Rehn, from Finland, said on the sidelines of the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
That's why Rehn and colleagues were enthusiastically backing Powell to stand his ground, even after he signaled a possible rate cut in September. Powell was met by a standing ovation when he took the podium at the conference.
'NOT BE TAKEN FOR GRANTED'
Conversations with a dozen central bankers from across the world on the sidelines of the Fed's getaway in the shadows of the Grand Teton Mountains revealed that a scenario in which the Fed sees its ability to counter inflation jeopardized by a loss of independence was taken as a direct threat to their own standing and to economic stability more broadly.
It would likely entail major turmoil in financial markets, they said, with investors demanding a greater premium to own U.S. bonds and reassessing the status of Treasury securities as the lifeblood of the global financial system.
Central banks around the world have already started preparing for the fallout, telling lenders on their watch to watch their exposure to the U.S. currency.
More fundamentally, a Fed capitulation would end a regime that has brought relative price stability and has lasted at least since late Chair Paul Volcker vanquished high inflation 40 years ago.
Since then, more and more central banks followed the Fed's model of political independence and a single-minded focus on their mandate - for most, keeping inflation near 2%.
""It’s a reminder that independence should not be taken for granted,"" Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel, also a member of the ECB's Governing Council, said. ""We have to deliver on our mandate and make clear that independence is the conditio sine qua non for price stability.""
POLITICAL FOOTBALL
Markets so far have not registered deep concerns about the Fed's independence. U.S. equity markets are roaring, and there hasn't been the sort of jump in Treasury yields or inflation expectations that would be emblematic of the Fed's credibility being seen at risk.
While Trump can name a new chair when Powell's term as the chief policymaker ends in May, he needs more departures among the Fed's seven-member board for his appointees to gain majority control. The Fed's network of 12 regional reserve banks, whose leaders take turns voting on interest rate policy, is a further counterweight, hired by local boards of directors as a way to distance them from Washington's influence.
Yet Trump's soured relationship with the Fed, set in a country perceived to have strong institutional and legal traditions, has made other central bankers all too aware of how fragile their independence may be.
Even the ECB, whose autonomy from the 20 governments of the euro zone is sanctioned by European Union treaties, has had to fight hard to prove it.
It was accused of bankrolling governments when it launched its massive bond-buying scheme a decade ago with the aim of staving off deflation, and survived multiple court challenges seeking to block those purchases.
Right- and left-wing parties in countries such as Italy, Germany and France have also periodically criticised the central bank.
Other countries have turned the appointment of their national governor into a political football.
Latvian central bank governor Martins Kazaks was criticised by national politicians for not catering to the government's wishes during his fractious reappointment process. Slovenia hasn't had a governor since January amid party bickering.
In Japan, the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe blasted then central bank governor Masaaki Shirakawa for doing too little to beat deflation, and hand-picked Haruhiko Kuroda in 2013 to take the helm when Shirakawa stepped down weeks before his term ended.
Kuroda then deployed a massive asset-buying programme, which helped weaken the yen and reflate growth, but raised eyebrows among conventional central bankers for making the BOJ the main creditor of its own government.
SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE
Trump has said the end of Powell's term next May could not ""come fast enough"" and very publicly started the process of choosing a successor.
""It's as if Trump learned from Abe,"" said one source familiar with the BOJ's thinking who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
In turn, Trump's moves could embolden governments around the world, particularly those with populist inclinations, to assert control over their central banks.
That could set the stage for globally higher inflation rates and more volatile markets.
""Taking over the Fed is one development that would set a very bad example for other governments,"" said Maury Obstfeld, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
""How do you look at this happening in the United States, which was thought to be the bastion of institutional checks and balances and the rule of law, and not conclude that other countries are easier targets?""

Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - August 26, 2025) - Pasofino Gold Limited (TSXV: VEIN) (OTCQB: EFRGF) (FSE: N07A) (""Pasofino"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has completed its Phase One update to the 2022 feasibility of the Dugbe Gold Project (""Dugbe"") in Sinoe County in Liberia.
The Company engaged MineScope Services Pty Ltd. (Perth, Western Australia) (""MineScope"") to conduct a gap analysis of the Dugbe July 2022 feasibility study1 (the ""2022 Study""), to prepare the roadmap of various work streams required to fully update and optimize the study Pasofino Gold Engages MineScope Services to Conduct Phase One Feasibility Study Update at Dugbe Gold Project - Pasofino Gold is developing the Dugbe Gold Project/Liberia.
The gap analysis indicates that the Dugbe 2022 feasibility has no fatal flaws. However, several areas of 2022 Study require additional work to validate the resource model, mine plan, infrastructure to support a large scale mining operation, and other associated activities related to environment, social and governance initiatives (""ESG"").
The gap analysis also has clearly identified the various work streams that are required to update the 2022 Study to a current level regarding capital costs, production profile over its life of mine, metallurgical processing methods and recovery of gold, operating costs, power requirements, associated other infrastructure needed to support the operation, and deliver economic models reflecting an updated gold price environment from 2022, suitable for project financing of the Dugbe project.
These work streams are expected to take a further twelve (12) months to complete, with the Company conducting as many work activities in parallel to compress the timetable where possible.
Highlights of the Phase One Study Update:
-
Geology: In order to validate the tonnage, grade and contained metal above cut-off, MineScope are proposing a c.16,000 m drill program, including infill, step out and definition drilling, to give a higher degree of confidence in reconciliation to the resource model.
-
Mining: Update mining pit shells, mine design, sequencing / scheduling and costs.
-
Process and Metallurgy: Conduct a comprehensive metallurgical test work program to include additional variability in areas of the pits with low sample representation. Samples are currently held in very good condition in cold storage at a metallurgical test facility in Perth, Australia. From this data, mill sizing can be confirmed and other factors positively impacting gold recoveries can be determined, as well as potential ways to reduce capital costs on construction.
-
Processing Trade Off Study – Flotation vs. Carbon in Leach (""CIL""): Given the various assumptions made in the 2022 feasibility study leading the process flow sheet to conventional whole-of-ore gravity separation, crush, fine grind, and CIL, a trade off study will be conducted to determine the economic viability of flotation and concentrate ultra-fine grind for the Dugbe project. The trade-off study will use the recovery relationships from the 2022 feasibility study, and consider updated unit costs and usage rates for power and reagents, and the overall capital and operating costs for the two process flow sheets to determine the optimum process flow sheet to be use in the feasibility study.
-
Power Generation Trade Off Study: Given that oil costs (power costs) are much lower today than they were in 2022; the efficacy of liquified natural gas (""LNG"") not currently being viable in Liberia, various methods of power generation will be studied including: diesel, heavy fuel oil, solar, bio-fuel, and hydro power generation, and the most effective source(s) will be implemented into the project. This trade off study will also consider capital costs, operating costs, owner-operator power generation and outsourcing power generation.
-
Infrastructure Reviews: Various areas of infrastructure will be reviewed with a goal of reducing capital costs, reducing operating costs, maintaining a minimally impacted host site and surrounding area. The areas of study will include: tailing storage facility (""TSF"") (location and design), road and bridge work required, port rehabilitation required and comprehensive water management study(s) site wide.
-
Comprehensive Geochemistry Data Review: A detailed review and kinetic test work will be conducted of waste rock types, to understand various aspects of water reaction and management including: pit decant water quality, TSF water quality design, biodiversity and community health.
-
Logistics Review: Given the elapsed time between the 2022 feasibility study and current, a comprehensive logistics review will be conducted with a focus on supply chain management in Liberia and the necessary road and air logistics required to support the construction of Dugbe and support the mine in commercial production.
-
Environmental, Social Impact Assessment (""ESIA"") Review and Submission: Final overview of the ESIA and Resettlement Action Plan (""RAP"") will be conducted in an effort to submit both areas of study to the Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") of Liberia during the course of the feasibility update period as well as ensuring that the project meet performance standards in environment and social required for financing.
-
Project Schedule and Project Costs: Currently, the process to update the feasibility study to a level suitable for project financing is twelve (12) months, and is expected to cost approximately US$6.0-8.0 million depending on factors including the costs of final drilling metres, final metallurgical test work determined representative of the quality of study, ESIA and other external study work required for the final report.
-
Additional Costs Under the Mineral Development Agreement (""MDA""): In addition, as previously disclosed by the Company, during the period of the feasibility update, there are other obligatory costs of US$0.3 million to be paid to the Liberian government upon submission of an application for approval of Dugbe's ESIA and RAP. Once the feasibility study update is completed, there is an additional application fee of US$1.5 million upon submission of the updated NI 43-101 towards a Class A Mining Licence.",2d6239b3c86a1f7d3a948406a9f6f0c7,trafilatura,6341,0

We will then look at some of the key market movers early this week before providing you with the latest analysis of the top news events taking place in the global energy complex over the past few days. We hope you enjoy.
Seoul Mates in Energy: U.S. Powers Up South Korea
- The official visit of South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung to the US marked one of the highlights of Trump’s tariff deals as the two sides formally upheld South Korea’s $100 billion commitment to buy US-origin energy over the next four years. - South Korea is already the largest buyer of US crude in Asia, ramping up imports every year since 2020 and reaching 460-470 kbd currently – such a pace of imports would equate to $12-14 billion per year, or half the promised commitment. - South Korea’s imports of US LNG peaked in 2021 at 8.9 million tonnes and have been on a declining trend since, as the country’s importers prefer shorter-haul options from Australia and Qatar. - Similarly, 2018 marked the peak of coal shipments from the United States to Korea at 3.7 million tonnes, dropping to a mere 1.4 million tonnes last year and staging a gradual recovery since.
Market Movers
- Canada’s leading oil producer Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) agreed to buy oil sands peer MEG Energy (TSE:MEG) for $5.7 billion in a cash and stock deal, sending Cenovus’ stock up almost 8% on Friday. - Norway’s state oil firm Equinor (NYSE:EQNR) delayed development drilling at the UK’s largest untapped oil field Rosebank to Q1 2026 after the UK government demanded additional emissions documentation. - US upstream firm Crescent Energy (NYSE:CRGY) agreed to purchase peer shale producer Vital Energy (NYSE:VTLE) in an all-stock deal worth $3.1 billion, adding some 70,000 b/d of oil production to its portfolio. - Japan’s leading gas importer Tokyo Gas (TYO:9531) is reportedly in talks with US LNG developer Venture Global (NYSE:VG) to buy 1 million tonnes of LNG per year from the Calcasieu Pass 2 facility, starting from 2028.
Tuesday, August 26, 2025
Russia-Ukraine has been dominating oil headlines recently, even if President Trump’s involvement has notably declined over the past week as Kyiv’s European allies discuss security guarantees with their US counterparts. Drone strikes on Russian refineries have had minimal impact on oil prices, with ICE Brent futures correcting back to $68 per barrel.
Putin Wants US Majors Back. Russian and American officials have reportedly discussed the return of US oil majors to Russia as part of a wider post-Ukraine diplomatic arrangement, with Moscow offering ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) to re-enter Sakhalin I and sell equipment to the Arctic LNG 2 plant. Donald Trump Demands Chinese Magnets. Further escalating of the US-China trade war, Donald Trump stated that China ought to provide the United States magnets as soon as possible, hinting at inadequate rare earth exports lately, absent which the White House will slap a 200% tariff on Beijing.
Iran's Crude Output Roars Back to Peak Levels. According to Iran’s national oil company NIOC, the country’s oil production soared to the highest level since May 2018, reaching 3.24 million b/d in July, mostly driven by the West Karun and Arvandan projects in the western province of Khuzestan.
Trump Keeps on Burying Wind Companies. The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a work-stop order for the $1.5 billion Revolution Wind project offshore Rhode Island, with shares of Danish wind developer Orsted (CPH:ORSTED) plunging by 17% on Monday. China’s Oil Giant Sells Off Bankrupt Refineries. Chinese state oil company Sinochem agreed to divest two bankrupt refineries (Zhenghe and Huaxing) in Shandong province – legacy of its 2021 merger with ChemChina – to regional refiners, alongside a 26-million-barrel quota for the rest of 2025.
Iron Ore Prices Jump on Mine Closure. Iron ore futures traded at China’s key Dalian exchange jumped to $110 per metric tonne this week after Australian mining giant Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) was forced to suspend all mining activities at its SimFer mine in Guinea, due to a contractor’s death.
Pakistan Asks for LNG Supply Deferrals. The government of Pakistan is seeking to delay delivery of its contracted liquefied natural gas cargoes from Qatar, citing weak domestic demand and rising import costs, having so far imported only 4.6 million tonnes in 2025 to date, down 14% year-on-year. Libya Courts US Oil Majors. Seeking to ramp up production capacity to 2 million b/d by 2028, Libya’s state-run National Oil Corporation (NOC) said it would soon host a Libya-US Energy forum to help clinch new exploration deals, just as Tripoli invited ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) back to the country.
Elliott Emerges as Top Contender for Citgo. The distressed assets of US refiner Citgo Petroleum might be up for grabs for activist investor Elliott Investment Management after a Delaware court officer said its bid was the best on offer, giving three days to competing Gold Reserve to match.
Refinery Strikes Spur Russian Oil Surge. Russia has increased its crude export plan this month by 200,000 b/d, reacting to widespread downstream damage as Ukrainian drones continue to target the country’s refineries, with markets fearing a flooding of markets with September loadings. Rare Earth Prices Shoot Through the Roof. Prices of neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) soared to their highest since March 2023, up 40% month-on-month at $88 per kg, as US miner MP Materials (NYSE:MP) halted raw material exports to magnet producers in China, selling output domestically.
Canada Courts Japanese Refiners. Authorities in Canada’s main oil-producing province of Alberta are mulling ways to invest in Japan’s refining sector as oil sands producers want to market their heavy bituminous crude in the Asian country, proposing to jointly construct a coking unit.
BP’s Massive Outage Rocks Midwest. The one-week outage of the 440,000 b/d Whiting refinery operated by UK oil major BP (NYSE:BP) has lifted gasoline prices across main PADD 2 states by $0.27 per gallon from a week ago, further pressuring Midwest gasoline stocks below the 5-year range.",5397b8ef9963020f8d32df690a295554,trafilatura,6239,0

Here Are 2 Risks to Consider . ,Thinking of Buying the Trade Desk Stock ? Here Are 2 Risks to Consider . ,2025-08-26 14:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The Trade Desk (NASDAQ: TTD) is one of the most closely watched companies in the advertising technology space. Its platform helps brands and agencies buy digital ads across various channels, including connected TV (CTV), audio, display, and mobile. The company has built a reputation as a disruptor, benefiting from the secular shift away from traditional linear TV and the move toward more automated, data-driven ad buying.
However, even great companies face risks, and investors should carefully weigh these before investing. In The Trade Desk's case, two stand out: ongoing operational challenges that could slow growth, and a valuation that leaves little room for error.
The Trade Desk faces risks that could impact its long-term growth
On the surface, The Trade Desk looks unstoppable. It continues to win share as advertisers reallocate budgets from traditional channels toward digital and CTV. However, beneath that momentum, the company is facing a few operational hurdles.
The biggest one involves its UID2 identity solution. With third-party cookies being phased out by Google in 2025, The Trade Desk has promoted UID2 as an industry standard to enable targeted advertising while preserving user privacy. Adoption has been broad and partners such as Walt Disney, Fox, Roku, and many publishers have integrated UID2. Still, it's far from guaranteed that UID2 will emerge as the universal replacement. Google has its own Privacy Sandbox framework, and other walled gardens, such as Apple, are unlikely to adopt UID2.
This means The Trade Desk's future growth in open-internet advertising depends heavily on how well UID2 gains traction versus rival identity solutions. If adoption slows or if regulators impose stricter privacy rules, the company's targeting capabilities -- and therefore its value proposition to advertisers -- could weaken.
Another challenge is the competitive intensity in connected TV. While CTV is The Trade Desk's fastest-growing segment, competition is intensifying as streamers like Netflix, Amazon, and Disney ramp up their advertising businesses. These platforms are building in-house tech and are under pressure to maximize revenue per user, which could limit the scale of inventory they make available through third-party demand-side platforms like The Trade Desk. In other words, if major streamers decide to keep more ad buying within their ecosystems, The Trade Desk's CTV runway could narrow.
Internally, the company is undergoing one of the most significant adjustments with significant changes in the senior management team. For example, in the second quarter of 2025 alone , it saw the hiring of a new CFO and a new board member with expertise in data, AI, and advertising. Managing this transition while scaling the business is not an easy task.
Together, these operational challenges may derail The Trade Desk from its historically high growth trajectory.
The stock price isn't a bargain despite the uncertainties ahead
The second red flag that investors need to consider is valuation. Even after a sharp pullback in recent months, The Trade Desk trades at approximately 63 times earnings and nearly 10 times sales. That's an expensive price tag for a company operating in a cyclical industry where growth depends on macro ad spending trends.
To be fair, The Trade Desk has earned its premium multiple. It has consistently grown its revenue , maintained profitability, and adjusted its strategies as the industry has developed -- introducing platforms such as Kokai AI, UID2, and others.
Additionally, it operates in an industry with a global total addressable market (TAM) of nearly $1 trillion . Within this industry, connected TV (CTV) is one of the fastest-growing segments -- an area where the company has invested heavily over the years to capitalize on the tailwind.
But here's the thing. Even if The Trade Desk continues to march ahead, sustaining its current valuation requires near-flawless execution. Any stumble -- whether slower UID2 adoption, increased competition in CTV, or a cyclical ad slowdown -- could trigger a sharp contraction in multiple.
That's the risk of buying in at a premium: The business can do well, but the stock may not if expectations are too high.
What does it mean for investors?
The Trade Desk has undeniable strengths: It's founder-led and well-positioned for the secular shift toward programmatic advertising.
However, it's essential to balance the bullish case with the risks. Operational challenges around identity and CTV competition could complicate execution. And with the stock still trading at a steep valuation, investors aren't getting much of a discount for taking on that uncertainty.
If you're considering buying The Trade Desk stock today, the prudent move may be to wait for a better entry point or clearer signs of UID2's industry dominance before committing your hard-earned capital.

The average American is likely to have a few knowledge gaps when it comes to their Social Security benefits.
For example, Anna was married for 15 years and never remarried after her divorce. Now that she’s retired, she’s collecting her Social Security retirement benefit based on her own earnings record. Along with her personal savings, it’s enough to get by.
However, her ex-husband isn’t in the best of health, and Anna wants to know if she would be eligible for his higher survivor benefits if he passes away before she does — even though he’s now remarried. While she has an amicable relationship with her ex, she doesn’t feel comfortable approaching him (or his new wife) about the topic, either.
Her situation isn’t uncommon, as women tend to outlive men by an average of about five years. Women, on average, also make less money than men (16% less, according to the U.S. Department of Labor) and can have shorter work histories if they’ve taken time off for maternity leave and child care. Coupled with the rising cost of living, it’s natural for Anna to wonder if she can increase her retirement benefit.
How survivor benefits work
Survivor benefits are paid monthly to eligible family members of a deceased beneficiary. So, whether you’re a spouse or ex-spouse, you can be eligible, so long as you meet the criteria outlined by the SSA.
Since they were married for more than 10 years and Anna is currently unmarried (and would only potentially remarry after 60), she may be eligible for survivor benefits.
Anna is also at least 62, as she’s collecting her retirement benefits already, so she meets the spousal 60-plus age requirement for survivor benefits (or 50 if you live with a disability). Still, if she were caring for the deceased’s child, she may be eligible regardless of these other criteria.
Anna would have to choose between her own retirement benefit and her survivor benefit (after her ex-husband has passed away, of course). She can’t receive two benefits at the same time — but this can work in her favor.
The SSA says she could choose to start with her survivor benefit and then switch to her retired worker benefit at age 70 when she’d be able to receive the highest amount.
If your ex-spouse passes away and you claim your survivor benefit before full retirement age, you’ll receive a reduced benefit. For spouses and ex-spouses, payments start at 71.5% of the deceased’s benefit.
If you’re still employed, you may be subject to an earnings limit (depending on your age). That means your survivor benefit would be reduced — though temporarily — if you earn above that limit in a year.
Anna may choose to contact the SSA to discuss her future options — and she can rest easy knowing her ex-husband won’t be notified of it.
Also, if she does qualify, her benefit won’t impact the benefit amount paid out to other survivors, such as a current surviving spouse.
How to prepare for a comfortable retirement
Social Security is meant to supplement income in retirement, not completely replace it. At age 67, men receive an average monthly benefit of $1,853.68, and women receive $1,478.02.
So it’s crucial to build a solid investment portfolio so that you can make up the difference in your income. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the average retiree spends $5,000 per month.
To build a high-growth investment portfolio, consider diversifying outside of the stock market with alternative assets like real estate, art, and commodity investments like gold.
Real estate
First National Realty Partners (FNRP) allows accredited investors to diversify their portfolio through grocery-anchored commercial properties, without taking on the responsibilities of being a landlord.
With a minimum investment of $50,000, investors can own a share of properties leased by national brands like Whole Foods, CVS, Kroger and Walmart, which provide essential goods to their communities.
Even better, FNRP handles the work for you. Their team of experts manages every component of the investment life cycle from due diligence and leasing to property management.
Simply answer a few questions — including how much you would like to invest — to start browsing their full list of available properties.
Art
Another investment class that’s also no longer restricted to the super-wealthy is fine art.
Masterworks is a platform that lets you invest in shares of contemporary art. That means you can invest in the value of paintings completed by well-known artists like Banksy, Picasso and Basquiat.
As an investor, simply select the pieces you want to invest in — with every work thoroughly vetted by their team of industry leaders. Based on the Masterworks selection criteria, less than 3% of all artwork passes the vetting process — making each investable asset a prime candidate for future appreciation.
Masterworks takes care of all the heavy lifting from buying the paintings, to storing them, to selling them opportunistically for you — no art experience required. Get started with Masterworks today.
Gold
Finally, gold’s popularity has been booming as investors look for safety outside of the shaky stock market.
One way to invest in gold that also provides significant tax advantages is to open a gold IRA with the help of Priority Gold.
Gold IRAs allow investors to hold physical gold or gold-related assets within a retirement account, which combines the tax advantages of an IRA with the protective benefits of investing in gold, making it an attractive option for those looking to hedge their retirement funds against potential economic uncertainties.

That's what you get when you invest in Cathie Wood's Ark Venture Fund(NASDAQMUTFUND: ARKVX), a mixed basket of 60-plus private and publicly traded stocks. It's a rare opportunity to buy shares of some of the most promising private companies in the market. Among them are SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic.
As of this writing, these privately owned behemoths are valued at an estimated $712 billion, when combined. It's an indication of the confidence private investors have in the future of these fast-growing businesses.
You can own a piece of all three, even if you're not an accredited investor. Here's how.
Invest through Public, SoFi, or Titan investing apps
Public, SoFi, and Titan are the only places you can buy Ark Venture without an advisor, so you'll need to download one of these apps first, if you haven't already.
From there, it's as easy as opening an investment account and plugging at least $500 into the fund. Why $500? It's the minimum amount you need to purchase shares.
Voila! You're a proud owner of three of the top 10 biggest private and hottest companies on the market.
Data source: Crunchbase, Anthropic.
As of this writing, 12% of the Ark Venture Fund is SpaceX, the company that pioneered reusable rockets. The case for SpaceX: It has launched over 8,000 Starlink satellites into space that connect you to the internet for a monthly subscription.
The medium-term total addressable market for satellite connectivity is $100 billion, according to Ark. Starlink's 2024 revenue is estimated at $8.4 billion, up from $4.2 billion in 2023. The company's internet service is growing fast, with room to run.
The magic of Ark Venture is it gives you a little bit of everything that could shape the future. And an annualized 18.51% growth is nothing to sneeze at.
But there are big caveats.
It's a venture-interval fund, riskier than your typical ETF basket
This isn't your typical ETF. It's a venture-interval fund, which means it's got special restrictions and costs you don't see in the public market. It's less liquid, fees are high, and it includes private companies that aren't upheld to the same regulatory standards as public companies.
Liquidity is low. You can only sell your investments once per quarter, at specific dates. Furthermore, the fund limits total withdrawals to 5% of the fund. So, if the fund tanks and everyone tries to sell, your sale might not go through.
Fees are much higher than your typical basket of public stocks. An actively managed fund, Ark Venture charges a 2.9% fee, whereas the average fee of actively traded ETFs lands around 0.51%. That's a hefty haircut.
Say you invest $10,000 into two funds with average returns of 18%. With an annual fee of 0.51%, your investment would grow to $50,120 in 10 years. Fees of 2.9% would only leave you with $40,809. That's almost $10,000 lost to fees! Over long periods, every percentage point matters.
The fund's high fees may seem partly justified by its growth, as its holdings have returned 79% in shareholder value since March 2023. But over the same period, the market has returned 89%.
Like most Ark funds, this one seems to be underperforming the broader market. It remains to be seen whether the it can continue to return high multiples during a bear market.
A couple of perks set the fund apart. First, it's public-private, giving individual investors a unique opportunity to invest in private funds -- and hold them when they go public. Another perk is access. Ark Venture holds a staggering amount of high-profile companies. You get toeholds in many coveted companies, before they become available to everyone else.
Note, private companies are tough-to-access for a reason. These aren't as regulated as public companies, they don't need to report company metrics, and they aren't held to the same standards as companies like Tesla and Palantir. If anything goes wrong, it might be individual investors who shoulder the burden.
It's a growth play and a hedge against FOMO -- fear of missing out on stocks like OpenAI
Despite the risks, Ark Venture is a unique investment opportunity, and I think it's worth a small piece of your portfolio.
The promise is growth. Companies in the fund continue to grow at a blistering pace, driven by massive demand in sectors like space and artificial intelligence (AI). If Ark analyst forecasts are correct, then the fund's fees are probably justified.
But the real benefit of owning Ark Venture Fund might not be growth, but mindset. Why I own shares: An investment in the fund is a hedge against FOMO -- ""fear of missing out"" on profits made by fast-growing, next-generation companies. Taking a small stake gives me the peace of mind I need to focus on other, less speculative bets.

But AI training might,Another AI tool wont solve your problems . But AI training might,2025-08-26 20:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Every company wants to have an AI strategy: A bold vision to do more with less. But there’s a growing problem—one that few executives want to say out loud. AI initiatives aren’t delivering the returns they were hoping for.
In fact, many leaders now say they haven’t seen meaningful returns at all. IBM recently found that only 1 in 4 AI projects hit the expected ROI. And BCG’s research goes further still: 75% of businesses have seen no tangible value from their AI investments.
Stop buying tools your team doesn’t know how to use
The fix? Increase your investment in AI training to support your business transformation. The data tells a simple story. An Akkodis survey suggested only 55% of CTOs believe their executive teams have the AI fluency needed to grasp the risks and opportunities of the tech.
Yet, it is these same executives who are trying to reengineer entire workflows, teams, and business models around tools that their people barely understand. And when performance disappoints, the knee-jerk reaction is to buy even more tech. More platforms. More licenses. More dashboards.
But that only makes the problem worse. The teams that were struggling to learn one tool are now juggling five. Everyone’s overwhelmed. No one’s effective. And adoption flatlines. Even if you have the most advanced tech in the world, if your team doesn’t know how to use it effectively, it’s worthless.
Expand your training budget
But, equally, throwing money indiscriminately at AI education alone isn’t going to fix the problem. The training investment must be smart. And that means implementing training programs that are truly pan-company and aligned with the business objectives.
Too many businesses funnel their AI training into a tiny corner of their workforce—usually just their IT, engineering, or data teams. And while these teams do need support, they’re not the ones who are going to deliver the productivity gains that you are trying to realize.
That job falls to the rest of your company: the 90% working in frontline roles and business functions where the AI transformation will be felt most. Whether that’s operations, strategy, product development, sales, finance, marketing, HR, legal, or customer service.
These are the people who run your business. And if they don’t know how to apply AI to their day-to-day work, your transformation will stall. If the goal is to modernize the business end to end, your training needs to reach end to end.
Teach Data and AI literacy before you teach tools
At the same time, surface-level AI training that focuses only on tools—such as how to write a prompt, where to click, and how to navigate an interface—will also fall short. Effective AI training needs to build capability and not breed dependency.
The best results come when your people understand what’s happening under the hood. Don’t get me wrong, your team members don’t all need a PhD in computer science. But they do need solid data literacy. They need to know how to interrogate, interpret, and act on data.
The real value of data comes from understanding what it can actually do—seeing its potential and seizing it with both hands. Without even the most basic data skills, AI will create beautiful spreadsheets that can’t be acted on. And that’s not the revolution anyone had in mind.
Train your managers just as much—if not more
Equally, when it comes to AI training, there’s a myth I sometimes hear: Managers don’t need AI training because they’re not “doing the work.” Their job is to manage the team or set the vision, not run the tools. But that logic falls apart quickly.
Firstly, I can think of countless ways that AI can make managers more effective: being able to synthesise and extract lessons from performance data, providing their team with hands-on guidance on how to use AI, and spotting opportunities to reengineer workflows.
But, more importantly, it is the bad message that not training your managers sends to your wider team. It runs the risk of your wider company writing off your transformation as “hot air” and “warm words” rather than concrete, in-the-trenches implementation.
Wide-scale transformation needs managers who can lead by example. If you train the team but skip the managers, don’t be surprised when nothing changes.
Build a culture that lets people use what they learn
Finally, even the best training program will fall flat if your workplace punishes people for using it.
In many businesses, employees are quietly, and perhaps unconsciously, discouraged from using AI. There’s a genuine fear that if they’re seen to be using AI, they will be criticised for “cutting corners” or cheating. The result? Team members keep their heads down and go back to old habits.
In other companies, colleagues are afraid to give AI a go in the first place. They’re hamstrung by a fear that they’ll make a mistake or get something wrong. In both cases, your training budget goes to waste.
So, if you want this to work, you need to create a culture of experimentation and entrepreneurship, where trying something new is actively encouraged—and not seen as a risk—and where teams share learnings, trade prompts, and build real know-how together.
Too many companies are pinning their hopes on the next big AI tool. But no tool, no matter how powerful, will move the needle if your people don’t know how to use it.
The smart move right now isn’t just buying more software. It’s training your people to work smarter with the tech you already have. That’s how you make AI worth the investment. That’s how you turn strategy into results. And that’s what will, ultimately, stop your AI vision from dying on paper.",7c94bca30af3f3512b3a2f3446cb8f42,trafilatura,5631,0

S . open banking retreat,2025-08-26 16:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Visa is reportedly at least pausing its open banking product in the U.S., drawing attention to new regulatory and financial complications surrounding data sharing.
""This highlights just how unsettled the space still is. Regulatory uncertainty and the possibility of higher fees could definitely slow adoption, especially for smaller players that can't afford compliance missteps,"" Chris Miller, senior director at Cornerstone Advisors, told American Banker. ""That said, the underlying demand for open banking and embedded payments isn't going away; consumers and businesses both expect smoother, more integrated financial experiences.""
Open banking enables third parties to access banking data, payments data and other information with a customer's permission. Payment companies are pursuing open banking technology to enable real-time payments, account-to-account transfers and embedded payments.
Regulatory ""assertiveness"" in changing U.S. open banking rules has turned into ambiguity and enabled financial institutions to claim ownership of customer data and monetize access to it, creating uncertainty that threatens to stall progress in embedded payments and broader open banking adoption, according to Enrico Camerinelli, strategic advisor at Datos Insights.
""The decision from Visa is directly connected to an unintended consequence from the U.S. regulation on open banking to loosen the regulatory requirements and give more freedom and flexibility to banks to run their business,"" Camerinelli said. ""This has created a paradox where financial institutions claim ownership over their customers' data and demand to be paid to share this data.""
U.S. vs. the worldVisa plans to continue its open banking service in other markets, according to Bloomberg. Payment experts say Visa has more opportunity for open banking outside the U.S., regardless of the American regulatory situation.
Uncertainty about regulation is likely part of the thinking, but the decision to pull out of the U.S. is likely more about the market and Visa's presence, or lack thereof, Aaron Press, Research Director of Worldwide Payment Strategies at IDC, told American Banker.
""Visa has not made significant inroads in bank data access compared to its competitors,"" Press said.
Visa rival Mastercard offers open banking through the card network's acquisition of data-aggregator Finicity. Mastercard recently added nine fintechs to its Start Path Open Banking and Embedded Finance accelerator program. Three are based in the U.S.: Link Money, a San Francisco-based pay-by-bank company for merchants; Payitoff, a New York based debt management provider; and Quiltt, a New York and Dallas-based software company that helps streamline open banking, a key strategy for Mastercard.
And pure-play data aggregators like Plaid and MX have the largest share of the open banking technology business, according to Press.
Visa discontinuing open banking in the U.S. is an ""admission"" that Visa was not getting much traction in the U.S, Aaron McPherson, a principal at AFM Consulting, told American Banker, referencing Visa's acquisition of Tink, a Swedish data company.
""Visa's primary entry into the market, Tink, has been focused on other markets,"" Press said. Visa bought Tink in 2021 for about $2.2 billion, after backing off an earlier deal to acquire Plaid for $5 billion. The Plaid acquisition was called off in early 2021 following a battle with the U.S. Department of Justice. The DOJ contended that Visa was removing a potential competitor in the online debit market by acquiring San Francisco-based Plaid, thus raising antitrust issues.""I expect Visa to continue to support open banking applications in the U.S. through partners, rather than directly,"" McPherson said. ""Nothing prevents them from getting back in when the market situation is resolved.""
Embedded complications
Open banking can support embedded finance and embedded payments, or it can support offering payments or financial services through third party apps, a strategy banks and fintechs are using to broaden customer relationships.
Embedded payments are based on the premise that users give permission to use their data in return for the possibility of accessing added services, Camerinelli said, adding that the exchange of proprietary data for embedded access to banking applications is the core of the value proposition. The potential of banks to charge for that data creates challenges for this model.
""[Easy access to new products] is the answer a bank can give when the client asks why it should give access to their own data,"" he said. ""If the answer goes further to something like 'And, oh, by the way, we're going to sell your data,' I'm not sure this will work,"" Camerinelli said.
There are also other options to support embedded payments beyond using open banking to share data.
""I've long thought that open banking's value proposition and therefore opportunity in the U.S. were modest, at best,"" Eric Grover, a principal at Intrepid Ventures, told American Banker. ""Existing payments systems in many respects are superior. They have near-universal acceptance, offer robust consumer protections, rewards, a credit option, and are habit for consumers and merchants, and near-frictionless. Visa's shuttering its U.S. open banking unit puts an exclamation point on it.""
And while embedded payments and embedded banking often co-exist as bank strategies that result from open banking, embedded payments aren't necessarily reliant on open banking, Grover said. ""Virtually all payment systems can be and are being embedded in systems consumers, businesses, and banks use.""",a261e2a5141e62dfa3900f1994b565a8,trafilatura,5620,0

By Mike Dolan, Editor-At-Large, Finance and Markets
While markets cheered Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's apparent dovish tilt on interest rates last week, everything's gone flat today, and President Donald Trump’s claim to have fired Fed board member Lisa Cook isn’t helping.
Trump’s attempt to fire Cook is based on allegations of improper mortgage borrowing. The legality of this move is unclear, but it has still sparked fresh concerns about the central bank's independence, as her removal would potentially give the president a majority on the Fed board next year.
Cook's refusal to accept Trump's announcement sets up a major battle between the White House and the Fed. In response, the 2-to-30-year Treasury yield curve moved to its steepest since January 2022, the dollar dropped lower and U.S. stock futures fell into the red.
* Despite Powell's Jackson Hole nod to labor market softness on Friday, forcing many Wall Street banks to change their forecasts to see a quarter point rate cut next month, Fed futures are still not fully priced for that outcome - with only an 80% chance of a cut seen. That's partly because August U.S. payrolls and consumer price reports could yet be a game changer in that decision. This week's big economic release is the July PCE inflation report on Friday, with Nvidia's quarterly results tomorrow dominating the corporate diary and holding tech stocks back in advance. The S&P 500 closed in the red on Monday.
* Part of the reason why the dollar's initial losses on the Cook announcement weren't larger was that the euro has tensions of its own. France's main stock index fell 2% and 10-year French bond yields hit their highest since March as three main opposition parties said they would not back a confidence vote, which Prime Minister Francois Bayrou announced for September 8 over his plans for sweeping budget cuts. Shares of French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale slumped 6.2% and 5.2%, respectively, with talk of another snap election in the mix.
* With last week's tech angst still in the air and Nvidia's report due, Trump on Monday threatened countries that have digital taxes with ""subsequent additional tariffs"" on their goods. The anxiety ratcheted up on news Trump is considering sanctions on European Union or state officials responsible for implementing the bloc's Digital Services Act on complaints the law censors Americans and imposes costs on U.S. tech firms. Elsewhere, Intel said the U.S. government's 9.9% stake in the chipmaker could pose risks to its business, from potentially harming international sales to limiting its ability to secure future government grants.
Today's daily column looks at the lonely plight of the value investor, as a leading light of that strategy refuses to fold.
Today's Market Minute
* U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he was firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over alleged improprieties in obtaining mortgage loans, an unprecedented step that could test the boundaries of presidential power over the independent monetary policy body.
* Indian exporters are bracing for disruptions after a U.S. Homeland Security notification confirmed Washington would impose an additional 25% tariff on all Indian-origin goods from Wednesday, ramping up trade pressure on the Asian nation.
* U.S. and Russian government officials discussed several energy deals on the sidelines of negotiations this month that sought to achieve peace in Ukraine, according to five sources familiar with the talks.
* Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is coming under fire for appearing to cave to political pressure in his Jackson Hole speech on Friday, which opened the door to an interest rate cut next month, a shift from his more hawkish stance only a few weeks ago. But the charge is unfair argues ROI markets columnist Jamie McGeever.
* China's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are poised to rise for a fourth straight month in August, but, writes ROI columnist Clyde Russell, this may not be quite as bullish as it first appears.
Chart of the day
Now the world's most valuable company with a market cap of $4.39 trillion, Nvidia's stock has climbed more than 30% so far in 2025, pushing its gain to over 1,400% since October 2022.
The California-based company has epitomized the broader AI excitement that has driven up shares of a raft of tech companies and others involved in AI infrastructure, such as power generation and cooling systems. But its explosive growth is inevitably set to slow and Wednesday's results will be forensically examined for bumps in the road ahead.
Nvidia options implied a roughly 6% swing for the shares in either direction following the results, which will be reported after markets close.

An additional 25% duty announced by President Donald Trump, confirmed in a notice by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, takes total tariffs to as much as 50%, among Washington's highest, in retaliation for New Delhi's increased buying of Russian oil.
""The government has no hope for any immediate relief or delay in U.S. tariffs,"" said an Indian commerce ministry official, seeking anonymity for lack of authorisation to speak to media.
Exporters hit by tariffs would receive financial assistance and be encouraged to diversify to markets such as China, Latin America and the Middle East, the official added.
The commerce ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the latest notice.
The new duties will apply from 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday (9:31 a.m. IST), it showed. Exceptions are shipments in transit, humanitarian aid, and items under reciprocal trade programmes.

The benchmark equity indexes and closed down 1% each, their biggest daily declines in three months. [.BO]
Wednesday's tariff move follows five rounds of failed talks. Indian officials had signalled optimism that tariffs could be capped at 15%.
Officials on both sides blamed political misjudgment and missed signals for the breakdown in talks between the world's biggest and fifth-largest economies, whose two-way trade is worth more than $190 billion.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have accused India of indirectly funding Russia's war against Ukraine by boosting Russian oil purchases.
This month, Bessent said India was profiteering from its sharply increased imports, making up 42% of total oil purchases, versus less than 1% before the war, a shift Washington has called unacceptable.
The standoff has raised questions about the broader relationship between India and the U.S., important security partners who share concerns about China.
However, on Tuesday the U.S. State Department and India's Ministry of External Affairs issued identical statements saying senior officials of the ministries and defence departments met virtually on Monday and expressed ""eagerness to continue enhancing the breadth and depth of the bilateral relationship.""
The statements said both sides looked forward to increasing defence cooperation and also discussed trade and investment, energy security, critical minerals exploration, and counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism cooperation.
Both sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the Quad, a partnership that brings together the U.S. and India with Australia and Japan. It is supposed to meet at leader level later this year.
India has issued no directive yet on oil purchases from Russia. Companies will continue to buy oil on the basis of economics, three refining sources said.
EXPORTERS SEEK AID
Exporter groups estimate hikes could affect nearly 55% of India's merchandise exports worth $87 billion to the U.S., while benefiting competitors such as Bangladesh, China and Vietnam.
""The U.S. customers have already stopped new orders,"" said Pankaj Chadha, president of the Engineering Exports Promotion Council. ""With these additional tariffs, the exports could come down by 20% to 30% from September onward.""
The government has promised financial aid such as greater subsidies on bank loans and support for diversification in the event of financial losses, Chadha added.
""However, exporters see limited scope for diversifying to other markets or selling in the domestic market.""
The commerce ministry official said India had identified nearly 50 countries to which it could boost exports, particularly items such as textiles, food processed items, leather goods and marine products.
India's diamond industry exports have already hit a two-decade low on weak Chinese demand, and the higher tariffs now threaten to cut it off from its largest market, taking nearly a third of $28.5-billion annual shipments of gems and jewellery.
BROADER ECONOMIC IMPACT
Private sector analysts warned that a sustained 50% tariff could weigh on India's economy and corporate profits, prompting the steepest earnings downgrades in Asia, even if proposed domestic tax cuts partly cushion the blow.
Last week, Capital Economics said full U.S. tariffs would chip 0.8 percentage points from India's economic growth both this year and the next.
Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar also said trade talks continued and Washington's concern over Russian oil purchases was not equally applied to other major buyers such as China and the European Union.
The U.S. could be a major energy supplier to India and is committed to collaborate on exports of products and services to help India achieve energy security and economic growth, an official of its embassy said on Tuesday.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed not to compromise the interests of Indian farmers, even if it entails a heavy price. Modi is also moving to burnish ties with China, planning his first visit there in seven years at the end of the month.

The sale will expand AT&T’s network and add about 50 MHz of low-band and mid-band spectrum in an all-cash transaction, the Dallas, Texas-based telecommunications company said in a statement on Tuesday. The deal is expected to close by mid-2026, pending regulatory approval.
Both the White House and the Federal Communications Commission were briefed about the transaction before the announcement, according to multiple people familiar with the discussions who asked to not be identified because the talks were private. America’s leadership in wireless services has a been a priority for President Donald Trump, according to a White House official, who said the president believes this deal will accelerate the use of the wireless spectrum.
“We appreciate the productive and ongoing discussions with the EchoStar team,” FCC spokesperson Katie Gorscak said in a statement. “The FCC will continue to focus on ensuring the beneficial use of scarce spectrum resources.”
EchoStar shares jumped as much as 85% to hit the highest level on record after the announcement. AT&T shares were largely unchanged. Bonds in the broader EchoStar universe rallied. Dish DBS bonds due 2029 soared as much as 12 cents on the dollar to 83 cents, and were the biggest gainers in the US junk bond market, according to Trace pricing data. Trading in AT&T bonds was more than 10 times the average for this time of day.
The purchase price is $9 billion more than EchoStar paid for the spectrum and $5 billion more than the appraised value used in securitizing the assets, New Street Research’s Philip Burnett said in a research note Tuesday. While $1.5 billion shy of New Street’s valuation, he said the sale price was “nevertheless a great mark on value.”
Federal regulators have been pushing EchoStar to sell some of its airwaves after concerns it had failed to put valuable slices of wireless spectrum to use, Bloomberg reported in July. The FCC launched an investigation in May into whether EchoStar was meeting its obligations for its wireless and satellite spectrum rights. The company skipped bond payments and considered filing for bankruptcy, saying the probe had stymied its ability to make decisions about its 5G network.
In a June meeting, first reported by Bloomberg, Trump urged EchoStar Chairman Charlie Ergen and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to cut a deal to resolve the dispute. EchoStar shopped the assets to other would-be buyers, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, Bloomberg earlier reported.
AT&T said the acquisition of approximately 30 MHz of mid-band spectrum and 20 MHz of low-band spectrum will strengthen the company’s ability to deliver 5G and fiber services across the US. EchoStar will operate in the US market as a hybrid mobile network operator under its Boost brand, the company said in the statement. AT&T will be its primary network partner for wireless service.
In a separate press release, Ergen called the sale and related agreement to work with AT&T “critical steps toward resolving the FCC’s spectrum utilization concerns.”
The US Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said in a statement posted on X that it has been working with the FCC and other parties for several months on the EchoStar matter and would review the transaction.
On a conference call with investors Tuesday, AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey said regulators shouldn’t be concerned that the transaction was putting too much wireless spectrum in the hands of the largest telecom carriers.
“The dynamics of what’s occurring in the market support the fact that concentration really isn’t an issue,” Stankey said. “Getting more capacity out into the market is ultimately a good thing for consumers over the long haul.”
AT&T has been spending heavily to expand its fiber-optic network across the country and previously said it would use cash savings from Trump’s tax and spending bill to accelerate those plans. In May, it agreed to buy the consumer fiber operations of Lumen Technologies Inc. for $5.75 billion, expanding its fast broadband service in major cities like Denver and Las Vegas.
The company intends to finance the EchoStar deal with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings. AT&T maintained its earlier projections for as much as $20 billion for share repurchases through 2027. Jefferies Financial Group Inc. advised AT&T on the EchoStar acquisition.
EchoStar had $5 billion of cash on its balance sheet, and subsequently committed to resuming bond payments including interest on the defaulted amounts. Its bond prices signaled that creditors weren’t expecting big losses even against the implied threat of a bankruptcy, which may have provided a fast way to get a federal judge to mediate a process that could otherwise drag on.

The market will return its focus to how companies are doing in the middle of the week when we get earnings from several retail names and big tech companies, including Nvidia Wednesday evening. Skinny iPhone? Apple said it will host a product event on Sept. 9, when it is widely expected to introduce the iPhone 17. The upcoming smartphone lineup is expected to feature a slimmed-down version, along with the usual camera and battery upgrades. The 17 will probably be viewed once again as evolutionary versus revolutionary, but newer features are on the horizon. Bloomberg reported Sunday that Apple is planning to release a foldable iPhone in 2026 and a curved glass iPhone in 2027. IPO market keeps humming : Another high-profile initial public offering (IPO) is heading to market next month, which bodes well for investment banking divisions within Club holdings Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo . Swedish lender Klarna is eyeing a valuation between $13 billion and $14 billion for September, according to a Reuters report Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the deal. Shares sold in the IPO could be priced as early as this week at between $34 and $36 apiece. Klarna previously paused its plans to go public in April after President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs caused financial markets to whipsaw. Goldman was named a lead underwriter earlier this year, but it's unclear if that is still the case. If Goldman remains on the deal, this means more revenues for its crown jewel IB division. Zooming out, it's also another good sign for the rebound in Wall Street deals broadly — which was a key reason why we initiated a position in Goldman late last year and swapped out Morgan Stanley. The company derives the majority of its revenues from this division, which also includes advising mergers and acquisitions (M & A), and has maintained its dominance in the industry. Case in point: Goldman was ranked No. 1 in overall global M & A activity for the first seven months of 2025, according to LSEG data. Improvements in IB are favorable for Wells Fargo too because the firm can now expand its dealmaking division even further after regulators lifted its long-standing $1.95 trillion asset cap in June. These efforts diversify Wells' revenues so the company is less reliant on interest-based revenues that are at the mercy of the yield curve. Overall, 2025 is on track to be a far better year for IPOs than last year. There have been 139 IPOs priced year to date, Renaissance Capital said on Tuesday, a 58% increase from 2024. One reason why we've seen an explosion of IPOs versus last year is that many companies have seen their stock prices soar in the first few days of trading. However, the outperformance has been fleeting with many down significantly from their euphoric highs. For example, Figma shares are down nearly 40% since tripling on their IPO day on July 31. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Circle has lost about 50% of its value from the stock's highest close in late June, which was only a couple weeks after its public debut. Up next: Okta , MongoDB , and PVH report after the closing bell on Tuesday. Before the opening bell on Wednesday, we'll see earnings from a bunch of retail and consumer names. Kohl's , Abercombie & Fitch , Williams-Sonoma , and JM Smucker report earnings. The weekly mortgage applications is the only data release.

But he wasn't happy, he said.
""I didn't like the job that I had. I didn't like the degree that I had just finished doing,"" he said. ""I was starting to feel kind of weighed down by a lot of the stuff that I had in my life.""
So, he said, he left it all — his job, his relationship, even his country — to backpack around the world.
Eight months into his journey, Ortega said a chance encounter with a South African yacht deckhand in a Myanmar hostel changed his life.
""I was looking at, you know, working in a bar or … backpacking some more, or teaching English in China,"" he said. ""None of that was as sexy as his job.""
The two traveled together for three months, he said.
""I met more and more of his friends that were also yachties,"" he said. ""Even though I had no boating experience, [I knew] I could do this.""
Ortega has now worked in the yachting industry for more than a decade, first as a deckhand and today as a superyacht captain, he said. The job also led to a stint on Bravo's reality TV series ""Below Deck"" which offers a glimpse into life aboard luxury yachts.
Common misperceptions
People who are interested in working on yachts don't need to be expert mariners or have boating experience, Ortega said.
""The main thing is being really willing to learn,"" he said, along with having ""a customer service or hospitality type of personality.""
Nearly every worker on a yacht works with guests, he said, so being friendly and agreeable are critical traits. ""Some people just don't have that in them,"" he said.
Ortega said being open-minded and humble are key too.
""If you're not someone that is willing to learn, or kind of start from the bottom, or feel stupid again, then that's going to be hard,"" he said.
He also cautioned that, contrary to popular belief, jobs that stray from the classic ""9 to 5"" aren't easy.
""There's a lot of crew, but there's not a lot of good crew,"" he said.
He also said that while physical appearances matter in the industry, things are changing. Young, good-looking people find jobs faster, he said, but crews are becoming more diverse with time.
""Sometimes people get this idea from looking at the magazines and the brochures that, oh, everyone's this one mold,"" he said. ""It's continuing to change.""
Ortega opened up about another difficulty of the job: being away from family, especially on holiday, birthdays and special occasions.
""I've got family in the States, I've got a best friend in Singapore, I've got a brother that lives in Australia, and I've got a lot of extended family in the Caribbean,"" he said.
Ortega said he's often torn between spending his free time with loved ones and the places he likes.
""My heart lies in Asia and in Europe,"" he said.
Entering the industry
Ortega is now focused on mentoring the next batch of yachties through his
""Superyacht Sunday School,"" a course and coaching program he operates with his girlfriend.
""It's basically like a brain dump of everything I wish I knew when I started,"" he said.
Since starting the program in 2022, Ortega said that more than 90% of his students found jobs in the yachting industry. However, only 60% are still employed because some people have changed their minds about yacht life, he said.
The monthly salary for entry-level crew ranges from $3,000 to $4,500, depending on the size and location of the yacht, Ortega said. However, starting salaries can be higher for chefs and experienced crew.
That amount does not include tips, he said. In the summer, people can earn double, or even triple, their regular pay, he said.
As an engineer, Ortega made over $100,000 annually, which was twice the amount he made his first year at sea, when he worked as a deckhand. But, he said, his expenses were far lower on the boat.
""I wasn't paying for a car, I wasn't paying for a house, I was already traveling for work,"" he said. ""I was pretty much saving everything I was making.""
There can also be tax benefits to life at sea, he said.
""It feels like you're making a lot more money than the numbers show. And the numbers are already good, especially at the higher positions,"" he said.
Currently, Ortega earns $10,000 per month, not including tips, which can double that amount, he said. He said captains of 90-meter yachts can make up to $30,000 monthly.
But Ortega cautioned against entering the yachting industry strictly for the money.
""If you're on the fence and thinking about it, just realize that it's not all going to be rainbows,"" he said.
Some people spend 200 days a year on the water, he said.
But for people who feel stuck in their lives, who don't like what they are doing, he said: ""Definitely get out of it.""
""Life is pretty short,"" he said. ""I want to see as much as I can.""

",2025-08-26 22:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"On Aug. 21, Walmart (WMT) released its fiscal 2026 second-quarter results, offering a mix of encouraging trends and short-term pressures. The top line surpassed Wall Street estimates.
The company’s online business continued its streak of double-digit growth, underscoring agility in a retail landscape increasingly shaped by e-commerce. Management also raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling confidence that growth will persist even as tariffs inflate costs.
However, the company’s earnings fell short for the first time since May 2022. The miss was influenced by one-time costs, including restructuring charges, higher insurance claims, and litigation settlements, which weighed on net income despite robust underlying operations.
Investors initially reacted with caution, sending WMT shares down approximately 4.5% on Aug. 21. Nonetheless, Walmart’s strategic emphasis on value, faster home deliveries, and an expanding customer base among higher-income households has helped it outperform many peers.
About Walmart Stock
Based in Bentonville, Arkansas, Walmart operates as a technology-driven omnichannel retailer, spanning brick-and-mortar stores, wholesale clubs, e-commerce sites, and mobile applications. Valued at a market capitalization of $772 billion, the company reports across three primary segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sam’s Club U.S.
Over the past 52 weeks, WMT stock has climbed 28%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX), which has gained 16% over the same period. Year-to-date, WMT has risen 7%, tracking behind the S&P 500’s 10% advance.
WMT stock trades at 38 times forward adjusted earnings, reflecting investor confidence in future profitability, while its 1.15 sales multiple remains slightly below sector averages, indicating relative value.
Walmart has maintained a consistent commitment to shareholders, growing dividends for over 50 consecutive years and ranking among the Dividend Aristocrats. Its annual payout of $0.94 per share provides a 0.97% yield, with the next quarterly dividend of $0.235 per share scheduled for Jan. 5, 2026, for shareholders of record as of Dec. 12, 2025.
A Closer Look at Walmart’s Q2 Earnings
Walmart’s revenue in Q2 2026 increased 4.8% year-over-year (YOY) to $177.4 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $176.16 billion. Comparable sales in Walmart U.S. grew 4.6%, surpassing the projected 4%, while Sam’s Club posted a 5.9% increase, exceeding the expected 5.2%.
The results reflected strong demand across physical stores, efficient operations, and an ability to navigate rising costs. E-commerce continued to be a major growth driver, with global online sales up 25% and U.S. e-commerce rising 26%.
Store-fulfilled delivery of groceries and other items in the U.S. jumped nearly 50% YOY, with roughly one-third of orders expedited, demonstrating the company’s success in meeting fast-delivery expectations.
Advertising revenue also strengthened Walmart’s bottom line. Globally, advertising grew 46% YOY, including contributions from Vizio, the smart TV maker acquired for $2.3 billion last year. In the U.S., Walmart Connect revenue increased 31%, reflecting effective monetization of its digital ecosystem.
The company’s net income jumped 56.1% to $7 billion, while adjusted EPS rose marginally YOY to $0.68. However, it missed the expected $0.74.
Looking ahead, management anticipates net sales growth of 3.75% to 4.75% for fiscal 2026, up from prior guidance of 3% to 4%. Adjusted EPS is projected between $2.52 and $2.62, slightly higher than the previous range of $2.50 to $2.60.
Analysts anticipate Q3 2026 EPS to grow 3.4% YOY to $0.60. Meanwhile, the full-year fiscal 2026 bottom line is expected to grow 3.6% to $2.60, with projections for 2027 pointing to a 12.3% EPS rise to $2.92.
What Do Analysts Expect for Walmart Stock?
Bernstein SocGen Group raised its price target from $113 to $117, maintaining an “Outperform” rating on WMT, signaling confidence in the company’s long-term trajectory. Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman also set a target of $118, emphasizing steady growth potential.
Conversely, JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers lowered his price target on WMT stock to $127 from $130 but retained an “Overweight” rating, noting temporary headwinds from catch-up insurance claims.
Analysts assign WMT stock an overall rating of “Strong Buy.” In total, 37 analysts cover the stock, with 30 assigning a “Strong Buy"" rating, six recommending “Moderate Buy,” and one analyst suggesting “Hold.”
WMT stock’s average price target of $112.50 represent potential upside of 16% from here. Meanwhile, the Street-high target of $130 reflects a 34% potential gain from current levels.

Trump's decision not only put investors and economists on alert, but brought attention to the complicated innerworkings of the U.S. central bank. It also marks the latest escalation of Trump's monthslong pressure campaign against the Fed, historically politically independent, to lower interest rates.
Here are the key facts to know:
Why do we follow the Federal Reserve?
The Federal Reserve manages monetary policy for the United States. Its dual mandate, set out in a 1977 act of Congress that amended the Federal Reserve Act, is to maximize full employment and ensure stable prices. Because the U.S. is home to the world's largest economy, the 111-year-old central bank also helps set the economic tone for all other developed as well as emerging markets. The Fed also supervises and regulates banks and their financial activities through a series of examinations, stress testing and corrective actions, and attempts to identify and mitigate systemic risks.
A 12-person group within the Fed called the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, sets the key overnight borrowing rate, currently set at 4.25% to 4.50%. The fed funds rate is the target interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans to meet their reserve requirements, and helps set the cost of home mortgages, car loans and credit card debt. The FOMC holds regularly scheduled meetings at least eight times a year.
Who is Lisa Cook?
Cook, the first African-American woman to sit on the Fed, has served as governor since 2022, according to her bank biography. Reappointed the following year, her 15-year term is due to expire in 2038.
Before joining the Fed, Cook was a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University. A holder of a PhD in economics from the University of California, Berkeley, Cook was previously director of the American Economic Association Summer Training Program, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and a national fellow at Stanford University.
From 2011 to 2012, Dr. Cook served as senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama.
What is a Fed governor?
The Fed's Board of Governors consists of seven members who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The governors are considered the core of the institution and are permanent members of the closely-watched FOMC. The other five voting members of the FOMC consist of the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a permanent member, and a rotating cast of four Reserve Bank presidents.
Why is Trump firing Cook? Has she responded?
In a social media post, Trump cited allegations that Cook made false statements on mortgage applications. Cook responded by saying he did not have the authority to fire her and that she would sue.
The Fed said in an official statement on Tuesday afternoon that it would abide by any court decision governing the legality of Cook's firing. Although the president can fire a Fed governor ""for cause,"" the law doesn't exactly define what that means. The case is expected to wind up before the Supreme Court.
Is there a secondary motive?
While Trump cited the mortgage issue, the move to fire Cook also comes amid his push for the Fed to lower its key borrowing rate. Earlier this summer, Trump floated the idea of firing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who he has repeatedly blamed for keeping rates unchanged since late last year.
Trump may get his wish: Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 89% likelihood that the central bank cuts rates at its next policy gathering in September, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That market assessment, however, is based more on a weak July labor report and downward revisions to job growth in May and June, rather than political pressure from the White House.
What has the market reaction been?
Following a trend in place since Trump resumed office in January, investors largely shook off any immediate concern that politics would intrude on monetary policy. Stocks rose on Tuesday.
But signs of concern showed up in other areas. An index tracking the U.S. dollar against a basket of foreign currencies slid on Tuesday as investors looked to international alternatives. Gold — traditionally regarded as a safe store of value in times of rising inflation — rose in reaction to the White House move.
What's the dispute mean for Main Street?
Everyday Americans won't feel immediate impacts from Trump's decision on Cook. But it could have longer-term ramifications for economic policy.
If Trump is able to remove Cook, it would create an opening to appoint an FOMC governor likely to vote in favor of lower interest rates.",89eca0e05d222bc26800c9733af24ff8,trafilatura,4880,0

It's a little bit of a dance, with dividend yield usually working conversely with the potential gains for the stock. The higher the yield, the less likely you're looking at high-growth potential.
Realty Income(NYSE: O) is one of the best dividend stocks you can buy, with a high yield and an incredible track record. Even though it's still under pressure from a sour real estate market, it's beating the market this year -- even without its famous dividend. Let's see why.
Oversold and undervalued
Realty Income is a real estate dividend trust (REIT), a classification of stocks that own and lease properties and pay out 90% of their earnings as dividends. Realty Income is one of the biggest REITs in the world, with more than 15,600 global properties.
It makes more money by purchasing more properties, often through acquiring smaller REITs, and creating long-term lease contracts. The model requires a long funding pipeline to buy properties and new properties to buy, and as you might imagine, it's more challenging to do that profitably and successfully when interest rates are high. That's led to market pessimism, and Realty Income stock is about 25% off of its all-time highs.
However, as interest rates have started to decline and the economy demonstrates resilience, the market is climbing, and investors are feeling more favorably disposed toward some of the best real estate stocks. Realty Income has been performing well despite the pressure, with adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of $1.05 in the 2025 second quarter, a penny less than last year, but an increase in AFFO-per-share guidance for the full year.
Realty Income has been looking more like a bargain, and smart investors have been scooping up shares. Realty Income stock is now outpacing the market, with and without dividends included.
A business model that works
Realty Income is a retail REIT, and it leases its properties to 1,600 different tenants in 91 different industries. It works primarily with well-known and established retail chains that are large and reliable, and it signs long-term leases that create a recurring revenue stream.
Although the focus on solid retailers that sell essentials is touted as an advantage, it has recently branched out to other industries, which offers its own advantages in diversification. It's also becoming more diversified by region. Its top three tenants are 7-Eleven, Dollar General and Walgreens, and grocery and convenience stores account for about 20% of paid leases. But other top-10 tenants include Life Time Group Holdings and Wynn Resorts, and U.K. supermarket chain Sainsbury's is No. 11.
There's plenty of opportunity to keep growing. Management has identified an $8.5 trillion market in leasable properties in its current markets and $14 trillion in an addressable market as it expands into new verticals like data centers.
You can't beat this dividend
Realty Income has been paying a dividend for more than 55 years, and it pays the dividend monthly. It raises it quarterly, and it's raised it for the past 111 quarters. That puts it in a league of its own, and it's on track to keep it up.
Often, dividend stocks that are that reliable don't have a high yield; the benefit is in the dependability and the track record. Realty Income's dividend yields 5.4% at today's price, an excellent yield that's more than 3 times higher than the S&P 500 average.
If interest rates come down and the real estate market improves, Realty Income will be in an even better position to deliver value for shareholders. There are bound to be ups and downs over many years, but long-term investors seeking an excellent dividend stock will find it with Realty Income.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/longer-treasuries-fall-trump-moves-054402844.html,3586711ae66d7cd2557448c86c1dc5a4,Long US Bonds Fall as Threat to Fed Cook Spurs Inflation Worry,Long US Bonds Fall as Threat to Fed Cook Spurs Inflation Worry,2025-08-26 18:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"(Bloomberg) -- Long-dated US Treasuries were lagging the market and retained modest losses as President Donald Trump intensified efforts to oust Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, deepening concerns his attacks on the central bank’s independence and lobbying for lower interest rates will fan inflation.
The yield on 30-year bonds rose as much as five basis points to 4.94%, before trimming its rise. In contrast, the two-year yield fell five basis points to a session low of 3.67% after a $69 billion auction of two-year notes drew strong demand.
While the moves were relatively small, investors and strategists were speculating in their morning trading notes that price pressures may heat up if Trump succeeds in replacing Cook with a policymaker more inclined to lower borrowing costs. The President has repeatedly complained that Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have been too slow to cut rates.
“The President is going to remake the Board Governors of the Federal Reserve over the next year, and he’s doing so in very unconventional ways,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. That approach has “essentially usurped” the Fed’s forward guidance function for now, telling markets lower rates are coming, he added.
Trump sought to remove Cook following allegations she falsified documents on a mortgage application. Cook said she will not resign and disputed Trump’s authority to fire her.
A statement late Tuesday from the central bank said Lisa Cook would launch a legal challenge and added, “the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision.”
The push to dismiss Cook “is a good reminder that no institution in Washington can insulate itself from Trump’s bullying,” said Sarah Binder, political science professor at George Washington University. “Nor are claims of ‘independence’ sufficient to protect the Fed from Trump’s ambitions. The Fed needs defenders, especially bond traders.”
What Bloomberg Strategists Say
“The more the Fed cuts rates, the greater the threat that longer-dated yields will stay higher. It’s one thing to loosen policy in the face of well-entrenched disinflation, but quite another when price increases are running above target inflation.”
—Ven Ram, Macro Strategist. Click here to read the full analysis.
Pressure on Cook follows an aggressive campaign by Trump to force Powell — whose term as Chair expires in May — to stand down early, with the search for his replacement already underway. Trump appointed Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran, a long-time supporter, to serve the expiring term of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned early this month.
Two-year yields, which are among the most sensitive to monetary policy, were lower before the auction amid speculation the Fed will cut interest rates as soon as next month. The gap between five and 30-year US yields widened seven basis points to 117 basis points — the steepest since 2021.
While the short-end is gaining on the potential for a “more dovish replacement” for Cook, the long-end yield is “higher on the inflationary potential of that and the loss of Fed independence,” said John Briggs, head of US rates strategy at Natixis North America.
After keeping rates steady so far this year, Powell used his speech at the Jackson Hole symposium last week to indicate a rate cut may be warranted to support the labor market. On Monday, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said the era of low neutral interest rates “appears far from over.”
Simmering tensions
The latest development comes as tensions continue to simmer over the US budget deficit after the House passed a $3.4 trillion fiscal package that cuts taxes and curtails spending on safety-net programs. Traders will be watching to see how this week’s Treasury auctions, which include five- and seven-year tenors, are received by market participants.
When S&P Global Ratings recently affirmed the AA+ credit score of the US, it warned that the country’s ratings “could come under pressure if political developments weigh on the strength of American institutions and the effectiveness of long-term policymaking or independence of the Federal Reserve.”
After falling sharply in the first half of the year, the dollar has largely stabilized since June. But fresh questions over Fed autonomy may test that recent resilience. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dipped 0.2% on Tuesday.
“Challenges to Fed independence pose clear downside risks to the dollar in our view, owing in this case to both concerns around US institutions, and to the read-through to lower front-end US yields,” Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists including Stuart Jenkins wrote in a note.

The firm has cut the use of Chinese chipmaking equipment in its most advanced chip plants to avoid potential U.S. curbs that could impede production, Nikkei reported, citing comments from sources familiar with the matter. FactSet data shows that most analysts are bullish on TSMC. Of the 44 analysts covering the stock, 42 give it a buy or overweight rating, while one has a hold and another has a sell rating. Analysts' average price target is NT$1,354.27, giving it 15.7% potential upside. The spotlight on TSMC has now raised questions about whether those not already invested should buy the stock. A neutral view Tariq Dennison, co-founder and investment advisor at GFM Asset Management, is neutral on TSMC. It's ""notable when an industry leader says something so positive about another company in the same industry,"" he told CNBC Pro . However, Dennison said, he tends to ""get cautious, or even bearish,"" when too many people are bullish on a stock or sector. Dennison attributed Huang's view to TSMC's ""very clear lead"" in the manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors, including 2 to 3 nanometer technology, and the likelihood that it will ""keep that lead for many years to come. He also inferred that Huang expects TSMC to ""keep growing and monetizing that lead for many years to come."" That's a ""much more optimistic assumption than I would make,"" the wealth manager said. He said he believes TSMC is of high quality and its growth prospects are ""well priced in a 23 times forward earnings, versus the 4.25% yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasuries."" However, he cautioned that its valuation underprices the risks of geopolitical uncertainties and unforeseen technological disruptions. The bulls However, Arthur Lai, head of technology research Asia at Macquarie Capital, is bullish on TSMC. Huang's ""comments revalidate our raised CoWoS [chip-on-wafer-on-substrate] forecasts and reinforce that Nvidia's execution is a multi-year demand driver for AI packaging and interconnects,"" he said. CoWoS is an advanced packaging technology developed by TSMC. ""We see continued upside for the advanced packaging and networking supply chain,"" Lai added in an Aug. 26 note. Lai had raised his target price on the stock by 2% to NT$1,310 following the company's second-quarter results in July. He simultaneously increased his 2025 and 2026 net profit forecast for TSMC by 11% and 5%, respectively, given better-than-expected AI growth and gross profit margin impact from foreign exchange charges. That was thanks to TSMC's solid near-term AI demand, even as the company anticipates softness in its revenue in the last quarter of the year in light of ""tariff-related uncertainties and a still cautious consumer segment,"" Lai wrote in a July note. Phelix Lee, equity analyst at Morningstar, is also bullish on TSMC. He has a five-star rating on TSMC and considers it ""attractively valued"" given its quasi-monopoly in manufacturing AI and other premium semiconductor chips, he told CNBC Pro. Morningstar gives stocks a rating of between one and five stars, with a top rating indicating that its shares are undervalued. In July, Lee hiked his fair value estimates for TSMC to NT$1,800 from NT$1,700, after the company raised its full-year revenue growth guidance by about 30% in U.S. dollar terms. He also raised his 2025-2029 revenue estimates by 5% and earnings per share estimates by 9% in anticipation of AI's contributions. ""TSMC is undervalued as the market is overestimating tariff effects and underestimating the longevity of AI investments,"" he wrote in a July note. — CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",6cebef70de7827aa5d127765c62acf20,trafilatura,4713,0

Consumers are increasingly concerned about the state of the economy, and that is affecting yet another real estate sector — student housing.
Rent growth in the sector slowed to just 0.9% in July across 200 colleges surveyed by Yardi. The average advertised asking rent fell to $905 per bed, a 1.4% decrease from the $918 peak in March ""as operators struggle to lease remaining inventory,"" according to the Yardi report.
For perspective, from October through July, rent growth averaged 2.8%, less than half the 5.7% recorded during the same period a year earlier and well below the 6.9% seen a year before that.
""What we're seeing is fall-off at the top and the bottom,"" said Robert Bronstein, founder and CEO of Scion, one of the country's largest owners and operators of student housing.
Scion owns roughly 95,000 beds across 83 schools in 35 states, with over $10 billion in assets under management.
Bronstein said the lower end of the market, that is, students and parents who were struggling most to afford student housing, is now going back to the more historic, cheaper rental homes on the outskirts of campuses. Higher-end students and parents are also changing course.
""I think that people are saying, 'You know what, there's a building that's three years old, and it costs 30% less than a brand new building, and I wasn't going to use the hot tub on the roof anyhow. I'm going to go with the less expensive option,'"" said Bronstein.
Students, he said, are increasingly serious about their living spaces and prefer co-working spaces and remote interview rooms over golf simulators and movie theaters, which were all the rage a decade ago. High-end amenities, he said, no longer drive occupancy. Cost savings are now paramount.
Scion plays in the middle market, acquiring properties mostly at large schools, including the University of Florida, University of Alabama, University of Oklahoma, and University of Mississippi, as well as Texas A&M and Clemson University.
""We were very active last year. We're very active this year. This may turn out to be the most active year,"" said Bronstein.
He said that after Covid, there's been a shift in investment toward large, flagship public universities — and it's accelerating.
""The top-tier, 40, 50, 60,000-student flagship public schools, they're posting year after year after year of record enrollment growth. They're not even coming close to being able to satisfy the housing needs that exist in these markets,"" said Bronstein, adding that they are also taking market share from smaller public universities and private schools.
""I don't think you can be bullish enough about Madison, Wisconsin, or in Ann Arbor, Michigan, or in Athens, Georgia, or Gainesville, Florida,"" he said.
Going big, he said, also gives Scion an acquisition advantage in today's high-interest-rate environment.
""We're looking at it like, OK, this is a market we want to be in. We're not going to be in it with 300 beds. We're going to be in it with three or four assets and several thousand beds and have real operating leverage,"" said Bronstein.
Bronstein said he's bullish because there's been a drop-off in new development due to higher costs for construction and capital. That will increase the value of Scion's existing assets.
In its 2025 student housing outlook report, commercial real estate lender Walker and Dunlop predicted a ""dynamic"" year for the sector.
""After a period of slowed transaction volume due to macroeconomic headwinds, the market is rebounding as interest rates stabilize, institutional capital builds conviction, and enrollment at major universities continues to rise,"" according to the report.
It noted that the Southeastern Conference remains the most active conference for student housing investment, with the Big Ten conference gaining momentum as larger schools see record enrollment growth.
It also highlighted the same shift away from higher-cost buildings stacked with bells and whistles that Bronstein noted.
""While luxury amenities once defined the sector, the latest trend is a shift toward functionality, convenience, and affordability,"" the report said.",2dcaad3dceee7e7a843ef1015108937d,trafilatura,4490,0

Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook said she ""will not resign"" despite President Donald Trump saying he had fired her over allegations that she made false statements on home-mortgage applications. Cook has not been charged with any crime, though the Justice Department is investigating the matter. 2. It's the eve of Nvidia earnings. When the leading AI chipmaker reports tomorrow night, watch for commentary on total cost of ownership and signs that any of the deep-pocketed hyperscalers are cutting back because of price. Watch for what its upgraded GB300 systems can do that its predecessor GB200 cannot. 3. Advanced Micro Devices scored an upgrade at Truist. Analysts believe the chipmaker's AI processors are seeing greater traction at the hyperscalers and are no longer being seen as just a price check on Nvidia. The firm went to buy from hold with a price target of $213 a share from $173. 4. Club name Eli Lilly now has all the data it needs to submit its GLP-1 pill for regulatory review around the world. The latest trial helped Type 2 diabetes patients lose weight and improved blood sugar control, while having a lower discontinuation rate than the disappointing obesity-only trial data released earlier in August. Pills are easier to make, distribute and take than injectable GLP-1s. 5. Gutsy call by Canaccord Genuity, which upgraded identity security provider Okta to buy from hold ahead of second-quarter earnings Tuesday evening. Club name Palo Alto Network's made a big splash in identity security last month with its deal for CyberArk. 6. Constellation Brands was downgraded to a sell-equivalent rating from neutral at Bank of America. Will the Modelo brewer cut its financial guidance before management presents at a Sept. 2 conference? We used to own this perilous stock for the Club. Beer is a bad market, and Constellation's exposure to Hispanic consumers is an added layer of difficultly with lower immigration. 7. BofA started coverage of Oklo , one of the companies developing small nuclear reactor technology, with a buy rating on the stock. Nuclear is attracting a wave of interest thanks to AI power demands. The Air Force is planning to partner with Oklo on a project as well. 8. The most popular stock right now is evidently Ulta Beauty , which landed another price target bump, this time courtesy of Canaccord. The firm went to $630 from $600 and kept its buy rating. There's been a ton of positive research in recent days on the cosmetics retailer, including a Barclays upgrade, ahead of earnings Thursday. 9. On the other hand, people really seem to have given up on Club name Salesforce as evidenced by the wave of PT reductions. This morning, Oppenheimer went to $315 from $370 and BofA went to $325 from $350. Both shops, however, kept their buy ratings. The ""AI is eating software"" theme is a dark cloud on the enterprise software cohort. 10. Interactive Brokers is joining the S & P 500 at the start of trading Thursday, replacing the soon-to-be-private Walgreens Boots Alliance . The brokerage and exchange stocks have benefited from the market environment. I took a look at the exchanges , in particular, a few weeks ago on ""Mad Money.""

Most indexes ripped almost 2% on Friday on hints that a rate-cut cycle could kick off in September. Rate cuts are a tailwind for growth, and tech sits squarely in that lane. Most of the ""Magnificent Seven"" popped on Friday's news, yet the market seems to have overlooked one of the giants: Microsoft — which sets up my trade idea for the week. On the nine-month daily chart, MSFT is stabilizing near its lower Bollinger Band, a range tool many traders use to spot ""garden-variety"" pullback bounces. In normal corrections, price often tags the lower band and then mean-reverts—exactly what I'm watching for here. The trade isn't ""on"" yet, but it could firm up as soon as Wednesday when Nvidia reports. A strong NVDA print tends to lift the entire tech complex — MSFT included. For confirmation, I'm watching: RSI (Relative Strength Index): A versatile momentum gauge that flags overbought/oversold conditions and helps spot reversals (so you're not buying into extremes). On MSFT, RSI is still trending down, so it's a waiting game — look for it to curl higher before considering the entry. MACD (5,13,5): MACD is a classic reversal tool. I speed it up to (5,13,5) instead of the standard (12,26,9) to get earlier reads. The MACD line (blue) hasn't crossed above the signal line (yellow) yet, but it's close. A bullish crossover—or at least a rising histogram—would strengthen the reversal case this week. For my CNBC readers: I'm opening up my options trade scanner for free only for today—grab a few more trades like this while it's live. Here's the scanner . The trade setup: MSFT 500-505 Bull Call Spread To take a bullish shot on MSFT, I'm using a bull call spread — defined risk, defined payoff. With price here, the base setup is: buy the $500 call and sell the $505 call as one unit. If MSFT drifts a few bucks, I'll adjust the strikes to bracket price (e.g., if MSFT is around $507 tomorrow, a $505–$510 spread works). The goal is to keep the stock trading inside the strikes so the risk/reward stays optimal. If MSFT expires at or above the short strike, the spread pays its full $5 value — turning a ~$2.50 debit into a 100% ROI. With 10 contracts, that's $2,500 at risk for a potential $2,500 profit. Here is my exact trade setup based on current MSFT price of $503: Buy $500 call, Sep 19 expiry Sell $505 call, Sep 19 expiry Cost: $250 Potential Profit: $250 -Nishant Pant Founder: https://tradingextremes.com , https://tradewithmaya.com Author: Mean Reversion Trading YouTube, Twitter: @TheMeanTrader DISCLOSURES: None.

The broad market S&P 500 settled up 0.41% at 6,465.94. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also added 0.44% to end the day at 21,544.27. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 135.60 points, or 0.30%, to finish at 45,418.07.
Long-term Treasury yields rose after the Trump move, while short-term yields declined as investors steepened the yield curve on the notion rates may go lower in the short-term, but eventually go higher as a politicized Fed becomes less attentive to inflation. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was last down 0.2%.
Cook plans to file a lawsuit challenging her removal by the president, her attorney said. The Fed said it ""will abide by any court decision"" on the matter.
""President Trump has no authority to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook,"" lawyer Abbe Lowell said in a statement. ""His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis.""
Trump's unprecedented move adds to the pressure the president has been putting on the central bank's independence. By law, a president may only remove a Fed governor ""for cause.""
There are currently six members on the Fed's board, with one seat vacant after the resignation of Adriana Kugler earlier this month. Removing Cook would leave five members, with non-Trump appointees still holding a majority. However, if Stephen Miran is cleared for the Kugler vacancy and the president is successful in removing Cook, it would give Trump a 4-3 majority.
If Fed Chair Jerome Powell leaves his seat voluntarily after his term expires in May, it would give the president a fifth vote.
Investors already appeared hopeful about the prospect of lower interest rates coming in September, as hinted at by Powell last week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. They're additionally looking ahead to Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday, which could bolster the megacap tech trade following its recent slide. The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks rallied Friday, but only after five straight days of losses.
""In the immediate term, markets will probably get over the Cook news fairly quickly (assuming this is a discrete event and Trump doesn't attempt to fire Powell), turning its attention back to Nvidia, the PCE, and jobs, but the Fed's independence is undeniably being undermined, a process with negative long-term consequences,"" said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge.
Also weighing on sentiment, Trump said Monday that he plans to impose ""substantial"" new tariffs as well as export restrictions on chips for countries that do not remove digital taxes.
Sentiment was kept in check, however, by anticipation of Nvidia's earnings report scheduled for after market close Wednesday. Ameriprise Chief Market Strategist Anthony Saglimbene expects the results will be ""good.""
""It all comes down to execution,"" Saglimbene said to CNBC. ""How is Nvidia going to deliver and execute on what I think are pretty elevated expectations right now? Do they guide higher? Do they guide more than what the market expects? Those are things that I think are going to influence how the market reacts.""

The Fed, in a statement from a spokesperson, noted that ""Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.""
The statement was the central bank's first response to Trump's announcement on Monday night that he was removing Cook as Fed governor because of allegations she committed mortgage fraud.
The spokesperson did not explicitly criticize Trump for trying to remove Cook.
But the statement pointedly noted that ""Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, directs that governors serve in long, fixed terms and may be removed by the president only 'for cause.' ""
""Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people,"" the statement said.
Trump separately told reporters on Tuesday that he would abide by any court decision on Cook's fate at the Fed.
""I abide by the court, yeah, I abide by the court,"" he said, while also predicting that the Fed's board would soon be made up by a majority of his appointees after he selects Cook's successor.
If Trump gains a majority of appointees, he might have better success at getting the Fed to lower interest rates sharply, as he has repeatedly demanded.
Any federal court challenge by Cook to her termination is likely to end with the Supreme Court issuing the final word on the dispute.
In the statement Tuesday, the Fed spokesperson said, ""The Federal Reserve System was established by Congress to carry out its statutory mandates — including promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and a well-functioning financial system.""
""The Federal Reserve will continue to carry out its duties as established by law,"" the spokesperson said.
""As always, the Federal Reserve will abide by any court decision,"" they said.
""The Federal Reserve reaffirms its commitment to transparency, accountability, and independence in the service of American families, communities, and businesses.""
Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said Tuesday that Trump ""has no authority to remove"" Cook.
""His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis,"" Lowell said. ""We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.""
Cook said Monday night that she would keep working at the Fed despite Trump's claim he had the power to remove her.
The Fed did not respond to CNBC's query about whether Cook was working Tuesday at the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., or remotely.
White House spokesman Kush Desai, in a statement, said, ""The President exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the federal board of governors for cause under 12 U.S.C. 242.""
""The President determined there was cause to remove a governor who was credibly accused of lying in financial documents from a highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions,"" Desai said.

""State-owned enterprise"" is a term you wouldn't normally bandy about when mentioning the United States — especially not with the country's Republican party, which has been associated with a laissez-faire approach to businesses and the economy.
If White House gets it way, however, it appears that the government's 10% stake in Intel is just the start. U.S. President Donald Trump in a Truth Social post signaled favoring companies that strike similar ""lucrative"" deals with the government.
Earlier in the day, Kevin Hassett, Trump's economic advisor, told CNBC that ""at some point there'll be more transactions, if not in this industry then other industries.""
Even though Intel's stock popped when news of the deal broke, the chipmaker in a filing on Monday warned that its agreement with the Trump administration could draw ""adverse reactions"" from investors, customers and foreign governments.
That's not an unwarranted fear: Recall how China has been urging its local companies to avoid Nvidia chips amid the chipmaker's revenue-sharing deal with Washington, or how consumers have steered away from Elon Musk's Tesla because of his stint in the White House.
Perhaps, it isn't so much ""state-owned enterprises,"" but ""Trump-associated enterprises,"" that might be fueling investor worries.

More deals like Intel's to come, Trump says. Earlier Monday, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said the move is part of a strategy to create a sovereign wealth fund. Intel in a filing warned of ""adverse reactions"" from investors to the deal.
Trump fires Fed Governor Lisa Cook. In a letter Trump posted on Truth Social, the U.S. president said the decision, which he determined has ""sufficient cause,"" is ""effective immediately."" The move will likely lead to a legal clash.

Markets are sure the Fed will cut in September, but the path from there is much murkier
Friday's booming rally turned into Monday's reality check as investors weighed just how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be on lowering interest rates and how the moves might impact the broader business and economic climate.
At this time a year ago, the central bank entered an easing mode that ended up having unintended consequences — an inverse move in Treasury yields and mortgage rates pushed by worries that the Fed might be taking its foot off the brake too soon along with expectations for stronger economic growth.

""They have to give us magnets, if they don't give us magnets, then we have to charge them 200% tariffs or something,"" Trump told reporters after a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung at the White House on Monday.
Trump also said that airplane parts were a key leverage that Washington has to counter Beijing's grip on rare earths: ""200 of their planes were unable to fly because we were not giving them Boeing parts purposely because they weren't giving us magnets.""
Boeing has been working toward a deal to sell as many as 500 aircraft to China, with both sides finalizing the details such as jet models, types and delivery schedules, Bloomberg reported, underscoring the role of airplane jets in a potential U.S.-China trade deal.
Trump's statement comes at a time when China's exports of rare-earth magnets have recovered to levels seen before Beijing imposed export curbs in April, according to the latest government data. Magnets shipped to the U.S. surged more than seven times — 660% — in June from the prior month, with volumes rising 76% on month in July.
China dominates rare-earth magnet production, controlling about 90% of global supply, and maintains a similar grip over the refining of the minerals used to make them.
That dominance has given Beijing significant leverage in its trade talks with the Washington, as the U.S. relies heavily on the rare-earth magnets for its large manufacturing sector, particularly automotive, electronics and renewable energy.
Henry Wang, founder and president of the Center for China & Globalization, a Beijing-based think tank, said Trump's offhand remarks signaled his eagerness to advance trade cooperation with Beijing and move toward sealing a deal.
""He's bluffing. He always talks big on tariffs or potential punishment, but we shouldn't get caught up in the rhetoric,"" said Wang, who is also a former counselor for China's state council, adding the real test should be on both sides' efforts in implementing their agreements.
In June, Washington and Beijing agreed on a trade framework that included easing controls on Chinese rare-earth exports as well as a rollback of some American tech restrictions for shipments to China.
U.S. and China have agreed to lowering tariffs on each other's goods to around 55% and 32%, respectively. That a temporary truce is set to expire in mid-November.
China's embassy in the U.S. did not respond to CNBC's request for comments.
Senior Chinese trade negotiator Li Chenggang is reportedly heading to Washington this week for meetings with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and senior Treasury officials, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.
Whether the trade truce holds beyond its November deadline will hinge on continued bilateral engagement, said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, managing director at advisory firm GreenPoint, adding that Li's upcoming meetings could lay the groundwork for higher-level negotiations and enduring solutions to ease the tensions.",2ac34b8e724e218a94c0ad22eebb9f45,trafilatura,3182,0

This includes a $150 billion investment pledge from South Korean companies, an order of 103 airplanes from Boeing, purchases of South Korean ships and a shipbuilding partnership.
""We really sort of need each other. We love what they do. We love their products. We love their ships. We love a lot of the things that they make, and they love what we have,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said during his press conference with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.
The announcements followed a July trade deal that lowered U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports — including autos — to 15% from 25%.
As part of the deal, Seoul committed $350 billion in investments in the U.S., with $150 billion earmarked for shipbuilding cooperation.
It was not immediately clear if Monday's pledge overlapped with that earlier figure, although Reuters reported that the $150 billion pledge was separate from the $350 billion that the July deal encompassed.
Lee said in his remarks that ""I believe that there is a renaissance taking place not only in the shipbuilding sector but also in the manufacturing industry, and I hope that Korea can be a part of that renaissance.""
Separately, Korean Air announced an almost $50 billion deal to buy aircraft and engines from U.S. manufacturers.
The deal by South Korea's flag carrier consists of a $36.2 billion purchase of 103 aircraft from U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing, as well as aircraft engines and maintenance services from GE Aerospace worth $13.7 billion.
South Korean media outlet Yonhap said this was the largest deal in the airline's history.
Trump also said that the U.S. will partner with South Korea and Japan to develop Alaska's natural gas reserves, although he did not disclose any details of the plan. Seoul had committed to purchase $100 billion of U.S. energy under its July deal.
Back in April, the foreign ministers of the U.S., South Korea and Japan met in Brussels and ""committed to continue strengthening energy security and energy cooperation, underpinned by America's LNG and other energy sources and technologies, in a mutually beneficial manner.""
They also reaffirmed their commitment to regional security, including countering North Korea's nuclear program.
On Monday, Trump had expressed a desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year, saying, ""I get along with him really well. I think he has a country of great potential, tremendous potential.""
Pyongyang did not immediately respond to Trump's remarks, although its state media KCNA put out a statement Monday denouncing an ongoing annual military drill between the U.S. and South Korea, labeling Washington the ""arch criminal threatening humankind with nukes and the main culprit disturbing peace.""
Trump and Kim had met for two summits during the U.S. President's first term in office, but failed to come to any agreement on the North's nuclear and ballistic missile program.",6429662dc2d7f5cad2cf36ce693f109c,trafilatura,3153,0

But many investors don't realize they qualify for 0% capital gains, which is a chance to take some profits without triggering a tax bill.

President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" didn't change the capital gains rates. But new deductions could reduce taxable income for 2025, which could expand eligibility for the 0% bracket, experts say.
Here's what investors need to know about the 0% long-term capital gains brackets for 2025.
Who is in the 0% capital gains bracket in 2025
For 2025, you qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains rate if your taxable income is $48,350 or less for single filers, or $96,700 or less for married couples filing jointly.
But many investors don't realize there's a big difference between gross earnings and taxable income. That gap could be even wider under Trump's new spending package, said Tommy Lucas, a CFP at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo in Orlando, Florida.
You calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.
Trump's legislation increased the standard deduction from $15,000 to $15,750 for single filers and $30,000 to $31,500 for 2025.
For example, if a married couple filing jointly earns $120,000, and you subtract the $31,500 standard deduction, their taxable income is $88,500. That leaves room to harvest gains at 0% before hitting the $96,700 limit.
A 'game changer' for older investors
Trump's law also added a temporary $6,000 tax break ($12,000 for married couples) for older Americans ages 65 and over. The benefit falls once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $75,000 for single filers or $150,000 for married filing jointly.
The new tax break is on top of the regular standard deduction, plus the extra deductions for Americans who are ages 65 and over or blind.
""That's going to be a game changer"" for married couples who qualify for the $12,000 deduction because it further reduces taxable income, Lucas said.
It's a ""golden opportunity"" to sell some assets at 0% capital gains, or other tax strategies, he said.
Investors can also use the 0% capital gains bracket to ""reset their cost basis,"" or the asset's original purchase price, which can reduce future taxes, Herzog said.
You can sell an asset tax-free, ""and then just buy it right back,"" to set the new basis, he said.",ea9d43798d4949edac4666632743659b,trafilatura,3131,0

Effective from 1 September, the new rates aim to more accurately reflect the costs incurred by company car drivers when charging their EVs.
Company car drivers will now be reimbursed at a rate of eight pence per mile (ppm) for electricity consumed during home charging.
This rate is calculated based on an electricity cost of 27.04p per kilowatt-hour and an average electrical efficiency of 3.59 miles per kilowatt-hour, a figure weighted by car sales.
For public charging, the reimbursement rate has been set at 12ppm, acknowledging the higher costs associated with using public charging networks.
The public charging rate uses the same efficiency metric but is based on an electricity cost per kilowatt-hour of 51p.
This figure is derived from the Zapmap public charging price index for slow or fast chargers (less than 50kW), which is then adjusted using the latest ONS estimate of electricity prices.
In addition to the AER changes, HMRC has also updated the advisory fuel rates (AFRs) for diesel company cars, with some adjustments in the ppm rates, while the rates for petrol vehicles remain the same.
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicle rates remain unchanged at 11ppm for vehicles up to 1,400cc, 13ppm for vehicles with engine sizes between 1,401cc and 2,000cc, and 21ppm for vehicles with engines exceeding 2,000cc.
HMRC's quarterly review of rates considers a range of data sources, including manufacturers' information on mean miles per gallon (MPG), adjusted for annual business sales data from Fleet Audits, and for LPG vehicles, a reduced MPG figure to account for the lower energy density of LPG compared to petrol.
The advisory electric rate for fully electric cars is calculated using a combination of data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), car electrical consumption rates from the Department for Transport (DfT), and annual car sales volumes to businesses.
To ensure the rates accurately reflect the changing costs of electricity, the 'pence per kilowatt hour' cost published by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero is updated quarterly with the ONS' Consumer Prices Index for electricity.

With AI still in its early innings, the Invesco QQQ ETF looks to be a great choice.
-
This tech-heavy ETF will give you exposure to the companies leading the charge in AI.
-
The key, though, is to consistently invest in the ETF through dollar cost averaging.
The secret to retiring a multimillionaire isn't a mystery. The key is discipline and consistency. One of the best ways to build long-term wealth is through dollar-cost averaging with exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and you can start with as little as $500.
Over the past few decades, the stock market has largely been driven by companies at the forefront of innovation. That's why investing in an ETF that gives you solid exposure to companies at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies can be a smart move.
One of the best ETFs in that regard is the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ). Here's why.
Why the Invesco QQQ stands out
The Invesco QQQ tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100, which comprises the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Unlike broader market ETFs, like those tracking the S&P 500, the Invesco QQQ has a clear tilt toward technology and growth stocks. Its focus on these areas has paid off, as over the past 10 years, the ETF has delivered a total return of 445%, compared to 260% for the S&P 500 (as of the end of July).
It hasn't just been a lucky stretch either. The fund has outperformed the S&P 500 in rolling 12-month periods 87% of the time in the past decade.
The Nasdaq has long been the exchange on which leading and emerging technology companies tend to list their shares when they go public. That's why the ETF's top holdings are dominated by the world's largest tech companies. At the end of June, more than 60% of its holdings were in the tech sector, while nearly 20% were in the consumer discretionary category.
Many of these companies are at the forefront of AI, advanced semiconductors, robotics, cloud computing, and other technological innovations. With AI still in the early stages of adoption, these leaders are well positioned to keep driving growth for years to come.
Given that the Nasdaq 100 is a market-cap-weighted index, the ETF lets its winners run. That means when companies like Nvidia or Microsoft outperform, their weightings increase, helping lift the entire index. This is one of the main reasons the Invesco QQQ has been able to consistently outpace the broader market.
The power of dollar-cost averaging
Investing $500 in the Invesco QQQ ETF is a solid first step, but it's just that, a first step. The key to building real wealth is investing consistently in the ETF over a long period of time through dollar-cost averaging. That could be every month or every paycheck, but you want to invest a set amount at regular intervals. This eliminates the need to time the market, which often doesn't work out the way you'd expect.",983716f508b6903839b31d9951add1c1,trafilatura,2922,0

According to analysts, the uncertainty surrounding these trade measures is starting to ripple through digital assets, shaking confidence in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and others.
The damage was swift. Nearly $950 million in long crypto positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, per CoinGlass. Ethereum traders suffered the most, with over $320 million in forced sell-offs, followed by Bitcoin at $277 million. Altcoins like Solana (SOL), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) saw $90 million in combined liquidations, per Coinglass data.
ETH dropped from nearly $4,700 to around $4,400, while Bitcoin fell under $110,000. XRP dipped to $2.90. Panic selling sent trading volumes soaring, with Bitcoin’s daily volatility spiking from 15% to 38%, and Ethereum’s from 41% to 70%.
Tariffs stir up fear
While tariffs don’t directly target crypto—since they apply to physical goods—analysts say they’re fueling indirect pressure through inflation, tighter financial conditions, and declining risk appetite.
""The indirect impacts of the tariffs are significantly more dangerous to crypto than the direct ones, and there is already evidence that some harm is happening. The root problem is that tariffs tend to sap an economy's growth and keep inflation running hot, as the additional tax burden they impose on importers is nearly always passed onto consumers in the form of price hikes. Thus, real wage growth tends to be lower under tariffs than it would be otherwise, which in turn means that potential investors have less disposable income to invest. The consequence is that riskier investments get de-prioritized in many investors' allocations, as there's no longer as much excess capital on hand to commit to plays with an uncertain return,"" said analyst Alex Carchidi, The Motley Fool.
With U.S. GDP data due August 28 and unemployment figures expected in early September, traders are bracing for more volatility
Flash crash, big liquidations
On-chain analysts also noted a sharp wipeout in Bitcoin positions following a surprise dump over the weekend.
“Yesterday saw one of the largest Bitcoin long liquidation events since Dec 2024, with over $150M in longs wiped out as price moved lower,” as per onchain analytical firm glassnode
The move followed a 24,000 BTC sale (worth roughly $2.7 billion) by early holders during a period of thin Sunday liquidity, triggering a flash crash that wiped out nearly $500 million in leveraged positions within minutes.
“Longs were delivered (per our magic blue dot) on the recent CRASH to $111K. That’s just the sixth long delivering event in the last year, and at 18%, was larger than anything that occurred during the tariff tantrum,” wrote another analyst Frank Fetter.

An annuity and Social Security both provide guaranteed income in retirement, but they work in different ways and serve distinct purposes.

If you’re considering an annuity while you’re on Social Security, here’s what experts have to say.
Annuity vs. Social Security
An annuity and Social Security are similar in that they both provide guaranteed income that is periodically adjusted for inflation.
“A key difference is that with annuities, you can also use the products to accumulate wealth as you save for retirement,” David Byrnes, senior vice president and chief distribution officer at Security Benefit, a leader in the U.S. retirement industry, wrote in an email.
Annuities also come in various forms, and they can be more complex than Social Security.

“Fixed index annuities, for example, offer a variety of index accounts that allow savers to earn interest credits based on the performance of financial markets,” he added. “You don’t have actual exposure to market volatility, interest is earned tax-deferred and principal is guaranteed.”
On the other hand, Social Security is a government-backed program that provides retirement benefits based on your earnings history. Payments are guaranteed for life, and unlike annuities, you don’t need to purchase Social Security. You do, however, need to qualify by working and paying into the system through payroll taxes.
How Much Extra Income Could Both Provide?
According to Byrnes, how much income both could provide depends on the type of annuity, the amount of money to purchase and other specifics in the contract.
“Some fixed annuities are still paying around 5% for example, so now is a great time to lock in a rate,” he wrote. “Fixed Index Annuities credit interest based on the movement of financial market indexes that could potentially provide even higher returns.”
For your Social Security payouts, the amount you receive depends on factors such as your lifetime earnings, when you start claiming benefits and whether you continue working in retirement.
Is It Right for You?
An annuity can provide a big boost to your income in retirement.
“Let’s take the example of a 65-year-old collecting $2,000 monthly in Social Security. A $100,000 immediate annuity might reasonably bring in about $500 in monthly income for the rest of her life, representing a 25% income boost,” explained Rich Jacoby, CEO at GoldenCrest Metals. “That’s a hugely appealing bonus for a retiree, supplying them with a guaranteed income that they don’t run the risk of outliving.”",5b24f61b6f24806a5c1370e2d6b1aa3d,trafilatura,2906,0

Reacting to the plan, Chartered Accountants Ireland Members and Advocacy director Cróna Clohisey said that the Irish businesses are currently facing “unprecedented” challenges due to US tariffs.
The extensive nature of the plan, which includes more than 100 actions, underscores the significant challenges ahead and the necessity for a unified national approach.
The initiative also reaffirms a commitment to bolstering indigenous enterprises, which the institute supports.
With a substantial portion of the institute’s nearly 40,000 members engaged in business, many are actively involved with Ireland’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
“While foreign direct investment continues to constitute a key part of Ireland’s economic mix, these home-grown businesses (particularly SMEs) form the backbone of the Irish economy. Ensuring they are equipped to diversify, innovate and compete internationally should rightly now be a primary policy objective,” Clohisey stated.
A survey conducted by Chartered Accountants Ireland in May 2025, in collaboration with GRID Finance, revealed that many SMEs find existing government support initiatives either too time-consuming or resource-intensive to access, resulting in lower-than-expected uptake.
“While the breadth of supports is positive, further steps need to be taken to ensure that business reliefs are not overly complex or difficult to claim. Simplifying application processes and reducing administrative burdens will be key to ensuring that any new supports reach the businesses that need them most,” Clohisey added.
The action plan also indicates an intention to expedite visa options to facilitate quicker entry for skilled workers in high-demand sectors.
“Chartered Accountants, already included on the Government’s Critical Skills List, are among the most in-demand professionals whose expertise will be essential to guiding businesses through the current uncertain landscape,” Clohisey remarked.
“Our research consistently shows that in times of economic uncertainty, Chartered Accountants are heavily relied upon to help businesses navigate crises. We fulfilled this important role as trusted business leaders during the Brexit transition, the Covid-19 pandemic, and more recently, during the cost-of-living crisis. Any new fast-track visa scheme should therefore reflect the importance of chartered accountants alongside other in-demand skills.
“Overall, today’s announcement represents a positive step toward safeguarding Ireland’s economic resilience. The challenge now is to ensure that ambition translates into action, and that the supports offered are not only comprehensive but also genuinely accessible and impactful for the businesses that rely on them,” Clohisey concluded.",932e2fe0ac12e579eb2beac06d3e166b,trafilatura,2886,0

The exodus comes amid renewed uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, with trading volumes in exchange-traded products (ETPs) spiking to $38 billion last week, roughly 50% higher than the 2025 average.
Early in the week, investors pulled nearly $2 billion from crypto funds as concerns mounted that the Fed would maintain its hawkish stance on interest rates.
However, sentiment shifted following Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at the Jackson Hole Symposium, which were perceived as more dovish than expected. This reversal sparked inflows of $594 million later in the week, partially offsetting the earlier losses.
Bitcoin Bears the Brunt
Bitcoin products bore the majority of the pain, recording $1 billion in outflows for the week. The world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to face headwinds, with investors cautious about near-term price performance amid macroeconomic volatility.
Month-to-date figures show this divergence: Bitcoin has posted net outflows of $1 billion, reflecting waning confidence, while Ethereum has managed to sustain inflows despite the broader risk-off sentiment.
Year-to-date inflows for Bitcoin stand at just 11% of its total assets under management (AUM), lagging behind Ethereum.
Ethereum Shows Relative Resilience
Ethereum weathered the storm more effectively, with outflows limited to $440 million. Mid-week buying momentum helped offset initial pessimism, driving month-to-date inflows of $2.5 billion, compared with Bitcoin’s losses.
Ethereum’s rebound was reflected in its performance relative to AUM. CoinShares reported that inflows represented 26% of total Ethereum AUM, showing stronger institutional conviction in the asset’s long-term potential.
The relative resilience suggests that investors may view Ethereum as better positioned to benefit from dovish monetary indications and its evolving role in decentralized finance and staking markets.
Altcoins Deliver Mixed Results
Flows into alternative digital assets were varied, reflecting polarized investor appetite. XRP recorded the strongest gains, attracting $25 million, followed by Solana with $12 million and Cronos with $4.4 million. These inflows indicate selective confidence in high-cap projects with active ecosystems and institutional traction.
On the other hand, emerging tokens struggled. SUI suffered the steepest losses, with $12.9 million in outflows, while TON products shed $1.5 million. The contrasting performance illustrates a market increasingly focused on established projects over speculative plays during times of macro uncertainty.

Grieg had been working as interim CEO since March following Andreas Kvame's departure after a ten-year tenure.
Previously, she was the regional director for Grieg Seafood's operations in Norway, known as Grieg Seafood Rogaland.
The new was reported today (26 August) alongside the release of Grieg Seafood's second-quarter results.
The company reported its sales revenue for the quarter rose by 180% in the quarter to Nkr1.01bn.
Harvest volume also saw a substantial rise of 219.3%, increasing from 2,771t GWT to 8,850t GWT.
Second-quarter EBIT increased from NKr28m to NKr33m. However, the company's profit before tax, while improved, remained in the red, with the group reporting a pre-tax loss of NKr65m compared to one of NKr104m in the second quarter of 2024.
First-half sales revenue increased by 20.7% to Nkr1.94bn in 2025 and harvest volume rose by 33.4%, from 12,196t GWT in 2024 to 16,269t GWT in 2025.
Half-year EBIT was NKr9m, down from NKr169m a year earlier. The underlying ""operational EBIT"" was stood at NKr291m, versus NKr368m in the first half of 2024.
Grieg Seafood posted a pre-tax loss of Nkr446m in the first half of this year versus a pre-tax profit of NKr53m in the corresponding period of the year previous.
Commenting on the results, Willumsen Grieg said: “Grieg Seafood entered the second quarter of 2025 with a continued focus on executing our transformational journey, strengthening our balance sheet, and positioning the company for long-term, sustainable profitability.”
Last month, Grieg Seafood agreed to sell three salmon processing facilities to Cermaq for Nkr10.2bn.
The transaction included farming operations in Finnmark, British Columbia, and Newfoundland, as well as associated sales operations in Canada, and a 50% stake in Nordnorsk Smolt.
The divestment is expected to “substantially” strengthen Grieg Seafood's financial position and is anticipated to complete in Q4 2025, subject to regulatory approvals.
Willumsen Grieg said today: “Following the transaction, Rogaland will remain the cornerstone of our operations. The region continues to deliver industry-leading results, with stable growth, high survival rates, and disciplined cost control.”

Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street. On August 20, Citizens JMP analyst Patrick Walravens reiterated a Market Outperform rating on the stock with a $315.00 price target.
The firm came away bullish on Oracle after collecting several positive data points from previous employees, CEOs, etc.
One of the previous employees cite Oracle doing “very well” with meaningful case studies leveraging their platforms well. A GPU reseller believes that Oracle has really found its place in the AI world, while another employee believes that Oracle has the potential to be the next trillion-dollar company.

“We have collected eight positive data points on Oracle. First, the CEO of a private software company and previous Oracle employee commented, “As a company they are doing very well… human capital when I was there, we were the largest revenue stream of apps and I think that’s continued forward. I see a number of good case studies that are meaningful, that are leveraging their platforms well.

It’s more a supply issue in terms of the capacity that’s available to us today to serve all of our customers as that would wish and want to be served… Nevertheless, it has been very clear to us that over the past period of time, the short period of time, two or so years, the customers ask of us what has changed. It’s changed in terms of density, and it’s also changed in terms of megawatt size and scale.” Sixth, a separate CEO of a private software company and previous Oracle employee commented, “They could be the next trillion-dollar company, it’s only a matter of time.” Seventh, an employee from a Neocloud company who had a prior relationship with Oracle commented, “Oracle’s amazing… they have built their cloud service that’s only for this 2.0 era and they aren’t worried about the 1.0 era that tangles AWS and Azure in this web.” Eighth, we note the company was granted a $30B award from OpenAI as a part of the Stargate project on June 30.”",ad1305e0b88a6fbf657ed8115ed47aed,trafilatura,2860,0

ARK brought in $3.7 billion across 13 of its US ETFs earlier this month, but recently, its offerings have seen massive outflows. The company’s flagship funds, like ARKK and ARKW, lost billions in assets last week following record inflows. Its bitcoin ETF — the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) — saw more than $75 million leave on Wednesday despite gaining nearly $200 million in inflows earlier this year, according to the boutique firm Farside Investors. The losses, especially in ARKB, could be due in part to institutional activity as larger investors begin to enter the crypto marketplace.
Invest in Gold
“Institutions are always moving money around… I think it was just [institutions] positioning for what folks think will be the next leg up,” said financial consultant Tyrone Ross Jr. “ARK is always incredibly active and open about what they’re selling, what they’re buying, so I think it was more bark than bite.”

Cathie’s Ark
The source of ARKB’s woes might be industrywide after a week in which total bitcoin ETF outflows topped $1 billion. But some experts pointed to “heartbeat trades,” a term that describes quick inflows and outflows that help defer long-term capital gains, as a probable culprit. Dave Nadig, director of research at ETF Database, wrote on X that such trades are “a well understood part of ETF tax efficiency,” but that ARK’s recent volatility “is probably a record.”
The rapid sell-offs could also be institutional investors “shak[ing] out the weak hands,” Ross said. “What all of us crypto hippies wanted as a space, we wanted all the big institutions in,” he said. “When they’re in, this is what they do. They manipulate the market.” The ones really selling are longtime bitcoin investors who have owned it for a decade plus, Ross added, who sell simply to “buy it all up” again. Other recent outflows for ARK’s products include:
-
The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which saw four straight days of outflows totaling $5.3 billion last week.
-
The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), which saw $715 million in outflows over the same period.
A Drop In the Ocean. Bitcoin swings are unlikely to influence market dynamics going forward, Ross said. “This is what the [crypto] space is right now: It’s $4 trillion. [The outflows are] a pimple on the elephant’s butt, if you look at it in terms of the size of capital markets,” he said. “It’s still susceptible to this kind of stuff.”

Trump on Monday evening claimed to fire Cook ""for cause"" effectively immediately over allegations she made false statements on applications for home mortgages.
It is the first time a president has attempted to fire a Fed governor since Congress established the central bank in 1913, Evercore ISI told clients in a note Tuesday.
""Although we think it could go either way, our guess is that SCOTUS will uphold this move,"" Wolfe Research head of U.S. policy and politics Tobin Marcus told clients Tuesday. ""The legal protections for the Fed chair and for non-chair governors are the same, so a SCOTUS ratification of this move would sharply erode Fed independence, and even the attempt to fire Cook raises obvious concerns.""
For cause, or not for cause
Cook said she would not leave her post, arguing that Trump had no cause under the law to fire her. Cook's lawyer Abbe Lowell said Tuesday that they ""will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.""
The case will likely wind its way through the courts and end up before the Supreme Court, Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills told clients Monday. This is because the Federal Reserve Act gives the president the authority to fire board governors ""for cause"" but what that means exactly is left ambiguous in the statute, Mills said.
""The alleged mortgage fraud occurred before Cook became Governor, and 'for cause' protection is often believed to be limited to causes occurring during one's tenure in office,"" JPMorgan chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli told clients Monday, though he noted that ""for cause"" removals do not have much precedent.
Trump path to Fed majority
In the near term, Cook will seek an injunction against Trump's move and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will likely grant her one, Marcus said. This would preserve the status quo at the Fed until the Supreme Court weighs in, the analyst said.
If Trump gets his way and forces Cook out before the year is over, he will be on a path to gain a majority on the Fed's board before it votes on regional presidents in January, TD Cowen policy analyst Jaret Seiberg told clients on Tuesday.
Trump's replacement for Cook would join appointees Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Chris Waller — and nominee Stephen Miran, who is expected to fill the vacancy left by Adriana Kugler after she resigned earlier this month.
""This matters as the President's majority could reject the picks from the reserve banks in favor of picks that support lower rates,"" Seiberg said. ""This would face hurdles, but if it works it would give Trump more influence over the FOMC and interest rates.""",954bc84acd2a94d65c37a4e456b9e217,trafilatura,2843,0

The Cabinet secretary, in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" revealed the Defense Department's interest in taking those stakes days after the U.S. government acquired 10% of Intel stock in a roughly $9 billion deal.
Lutnick was asked if the Trump administration would repeat that move with other companies that do business with the government.
""Oh there's a monstrous discussion about defense,"" Lutnick replied.
Lockheed, which makes most of its revenue from federal contracts, is ""basically an arm of the U.S. government,"" he said.
""But what's the economics of that? I'm going to leave that to my secretary of Defense and the deputy secretary of Defense.""
""These guys are on it and they're thinking about it,"" he said.
Lutnick added that President Donald Trump is rethinking how the U.S. ought to finance its munitions and other defense capabilities.
""I tell you, the way it has been done has been a giveaway,"" Lutnick claimed. His remark could suggest that the Trump administration is considering a major overhaul of Pentagon appropriations, which are approved annually by Congress.
A Lockheed spokesperson told CNBC in a statement, ""As we did in his first term, we are continuing our strong working relationship with President Trump and his Administration to strengthen our national defense.""
The Pentagon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
Lockheed is the world's top defense company by revenue, according to DefenseNews' 2024 list. Other top U.S. contractors include RTX, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics and Boeing.
Trump's move to take ownership of a chunk of Intel, an embattled chipmaker, is a major escalation in his efforts to achieve his economic goals by exerting more and more government control over the private economy.
Trump said Monday that he would make similar deals ""all day long.""
Lutnick said Friday that the agreement Trump struck with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan ""strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.""
But the move has drawn heated criticism — including from some conservatives, who warn that Trump's action cuts against free market principles and poses risks for both Intel and the economy.
""The most immediate risk is that Intel's decisions will increasingly be driven by political rather than commercial considerations,"" economist Scott Lincicome of the libertarian Cato Institute wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., wrote in an X post, ""If socialism is government owning the means of production, wouldn't the government owning part of Intel be a step toward socialism?""",3b506e64cac6eced242ac253e8d46eb7,trafilatura,2830,0

For You: 10 Genius Things Warren Buffett Says To Do With Your Money
But whether you own gold already, or are wondering if now is a good time to invest, there are a few things you should do when the price of gold skyrockets.
1. Review Your Investments
If you’ve got gold in your portfolio (or even gold ETFs), it’s a good idea to take a look at your investment balances when gold jumps in price. For most investors, gold is a small part of their overall portfolio, and gold jumping in price can boost portfolio returns compared to other assets.
Over the last 20 years, gold prices have outperformed the S&P 500, according to Curvo. If you don’t have any gold in your portfolio, you might be thinking of adding some. With gold at all-time highs, you might be hesitant to add gold right now — and you might be right. Zooming out further, gold prices have a history of dropping when markets are doing well and political tensions calm down.
It can be worth potentially adding gold over time by dollar-cost averaging into gold or gold ETFs. This lets you purchase while gold prices are high, and scoop up more gold if prices drop as well.

2. Rebalance Your Portfolio
If you hold any gold in your portfolio, it might be a good idea to rebalance your portfolio to see why gold jumps significantly in price. Ideally, you’ll have a chosen asset allocation for your portfolio, including defining what percentage of your portfolio is allocated toward gold.
For example, if you have a $100,000 investment portfolio and want to allocate 10% of your portfolio toward gold, that means you should have about $10,000 worth of gold in your investment accounts. But with the price of gold increasing, you might end up with $15,000 worth of gold, meaning your portfolio is now 15% gold.
The process of rebalancing your portfolio involves selling investments that you hold too much of (overweight assets), and buying investments that you hold too little of (underweight assets). So if you now hold too much gold in your portfolio compared to your chosen asset allocation, you’d sell some gold to buy something you hold too little of.
For example, if you now hold $15,000 in gold (15%), you’d sell $5,000 worth of gold and use the proceeds to purchase other investments (such as stocks and bonds). This brings your gold asset allocation back to 10% of your portfolio, and brings the asset allocation of other assets back in line with your preferences.",b782504f9a6f86d09b406671eb4feefa,trafilatura,2826,0

Derby and Ann Saphir
(Reuters) -President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is unlikely to affect the U.S. central bank's path toward cutting interest rates next month, but it creates new uncertainties about what happens after that meeting amid the unprecedented attack on the Fed's independence.
Financial markets still broadly expect the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 4.00%-4.25% range at its September 16-17 meeting, with futures markets on Tuesday placing an 86% probability on that outcome.
After the September meeting, markets are split on whether the Fed can deliver as much as 50 basis points in additional easing by the end of this year. Investors generally took the Cook developments in stride.
""Our base case remains for the Fed to resume cutting policy rates in September,"" Citibank economists said in a research note, although they added they think markets are underestimating the odds that the ultimate path of easing is more aggressive than what's currently priced in.
Trump late on Monday announced he would fire Cook, the first such move by a U.S. chief executive. The president and his allies have accused Cook, the only Black woman to become a Fed governor, of committing mortgage fraud in connection with properties she bought in 2021, before becoming a Fed official.
Cook said she is not leaving her job and has retained legal representation to fight Trump's attempt to fire her.
There is considerable uncertainty whether the president can in fact remove the Fed governor, who by law can only be removed ""for cause,"" as Fed officials' terms are designed to protect them from political interference, facilitating their ability to make potentially unpopular monetary policy choices.
The president has been pressuring the Fed for an extended period to cut interest rates aggressively to levels generally seen as consistent with a recession, which the economy is not currently facing. Trump has repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, although he recently has backed away from that saber-rattling.
With Trump on track to pick a replacement for Powell, whose term as Fed chief expires next May, removing Cook would give the president space to name a new governor who presumably would be more inclined to support his push for sweeping rate cuts. He has already named an ally to take over for former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned unexpectedly earlier this month.
""The market probably isn't going to discount much in the near term, but in the long run the politicization of the Fed should produce higher inflation and higher rates,"" said Andy Laperriere, head of U.S. policy research at Piper Sandler. ""Trump wants an easy money policy that will eventually produce higher inflation.""",c3623e3583982efb93ae320b69fea13a,trafilatura,2820,0

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese banks Mizuho and MUFG are targeting buying or partnering with overseas money managers, they told Reuters, joining other Japanese financial companies aiming for a larger share of the global investing market.
Mizuho is prioritising a tie-up with a private asset specialist in Europe or the United States to give it a foothold in areas such as the booming credit market or infrastructure financing, an executive told Reuters.
MUFG, meanwhile, has identified overseas asset management - particularly in the United States and Europe - as a priority area for potential deals, the company said.
The banks, two of the largest in Japan, collectively manage about $1.3 trillion through their asset management arms, largely for local clients. They declined to comment on whether discussions with target companies had already taken place and there is no certainty transactions will happen.
Japan's largest financial groups have become increasingly acquisitive overseas as they contend with sluggish growth at home due to an ageing and shrinking population.
The government and regulators are also pursuing reforms aimed at establishing Japan as a leading asset management centre, with the relatively stable fee income on offer from money management proving a key selling point.
Nomura acquired Macquarie Group's U.S. and European public asset management businesses for $1.8 billion in April. Insurers Dai-ichi Life and Meiji Yasuda have also acquired or taken stakes in overseas firms this year.
Mizuho and MUFG's investment divisions - which offer a mix of passive and actively-managed funds - currently have limited international operations focused primarily on distributing Japanese equities funds.
""We definitely are keeping an eye on any potential opportunities...

Sharps Technology, a small medical device and pharmaceutical packaging company, announced Monday that it plans to sell $400 million worth of its stock to fund a treasury for Solana, one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Large crypto investment funds like ParaFi, Pantera Capital, and CoinFund contributed to the raise.
The transaction, which would turn the medical device firm’s stock into a proxy for the price of Solana, is expected to close on Aug. 28. Alice Zhang, a venture capitalist and cofounder of crypto smartphone maker Jambo, will join the board of Sharps and become the company’s chief investment officer. James Zhang, another cofounder of the smartphone company, will join as a strategic advisor and consultant.
“We will have a team with deep ties to the Solana ecosystem and proven founder-level experience in scaling institutional digital asset platforms,” Alice Zhang said in a statement.
The more-than-$400-million capital injection positions Sharps to potentially become the largest Solana treasury company on the market. Upexi, its closest competitor, has about $394 million worth of the cryptocurrency, according to its most recent update on its balance sheet. DeFi Development Corp., another public company that amasses Solana, has a bit more than $250 million.
But Sharps’ position as front-runner may be short-lived. Crypto heavyweights Galaxy Digital, Multicoin Capital, and Jump Crypto are in the market to raise $1 billion to start their own Solana treasury company, according to a report from Bloomberg, which cited anonymous sources.
A spokesperson for Jump Crypto declined to comment. Spokespeople for Multicoin Capital and Galaxy Digital did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The investment into Sharps comes on the heels of a slew of announcements from small public companies to establish so-called digital asset treasuries, or pools of cryptocurrency held on companies’ balance sheets.
The strategy was first popularized by data analytics software company Strategy, formerly called MicroStrategy, which started buying up Bitcoin in 2020. Michael Saylor, Strategy’s cofounder and executive chairman, became one of Bitcoin’s biggest boosters as his company added more and more of the token to its balance sheet.
As the price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency increased, Strategy’s share price surged, as traders bought up its stock as a proxy for Bitcoin.
Watching the meteoric rise of Strategy, which now boasts a market capitalization of almost $100 billion, copycats followed suit. Other small publicly traded companies began adding Bitcoin to their balance sheet in the hopes of pops in their stocks. And soon firms started to buy more exotic tokens, including Ethereum, XRP, and Litecoin.",00434e9953781fda9059660f133806cc,trafilatura,2804,0

His portfolio is poised to get a boost if the Fed cuts rates.
-
New disclosures show that President Trump has bought roughly $100 million of bonds since starting his term.
-
These purchases could gain from Fed rate cuts, benefiting Trump's portfolio value.
-
The president has been pressuring the Fed for months to lower interest rates.
While President Donald Trump has grabbed headlines for his meme-stock holdings and forays into crypto, he's also been steadily amassing a large stake in good, old-fashioned bonds.
This is according to a US Office Office of Government Ethics filing from August 19, which showed that Trump has made more than $100 million in bond purchases since starting his second term. The purchases span state, municipal, and corporate bonds with a wide range of maturity dates and yields.
While administration officials have said the transactions are managed completely independent of Trump, it's still relatively unprecedented for an active president to be making these types of moves at all. He's the first commander-in-chief in more than 50 years to not at least have personal holdings put into a blind trust while in office.
Given that bond prices normally rise when yields fall, any decline in the latter would increase the overall value of the president's portfolio. Those yields are likely to decline if the Federal Reserve cuts rates — something Trump has not-so-subtly been imploring it to do for months.
A few caveats: The purchases make up a small portion of Trump's net worth, which Forbes estimates at around $6 billion. It's also unclear how Trump's bond-purchase activity compares to previous periods when he wasn't in office.
Overall, it's difficult to know the exact degree to which Trump would benefit from reductions in the fed funds rate. The benchmark rate impacts short-duration yields the most, while factors like inflation impact longer-duration bonds more. Price action on long-duration bonds specifically in response to rate cuts can also be hard to measure because long-term rates can move in advance of cuts.
Trump has called for the central bank to slash rates by 300 basis points, to the 1.25%-to-1.5% range. He has repeatedly pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates. But Powell has run his own race and stuck to the Fed's internal calculus, even going as far as to say the potentially inflationary effect of Trump's tariffs was part of the FOMC's decision to keep rates unchanged at recent meetings.
Trump's bonds — and the bond market overall — may not have much longer to wait for another rate cut. Investors are currently pricing in an 84% chance of a 25-basis-point reduction at the September Fed meeting, following a weak July jobs report that saw large downward revisions.",f08767fd99639bf881dfacca1a0e6f5f,trafilatura,2799,0

Nauta, an AI-powered logistics orchestration platform for importers, has raised $7 million in seed funding as it looks to simplify one of the most complex pieces of global trade. The round was led by Construct Capital with participation from Predictive. The new funding will support Nauta’s global expansion and help the company build out its sales and partnerships teams.
The New York-based startup, launched earlier this year, was co-founded by Valentina Jordan, who previously led product and engineering teams at Latin American logistics unicorn Rappi, and Rafael Santiago, who ran the Caribbean-based importing logistics company José Santiago before its acquisition by Performance Food Group.
Both founders bring direct experience in navigating the inefficiencies of global supply chains, issues they say Nauta is designed to fix.
Importers, despite handling trillions of dollars in goods annually, still depend heavily on emails, spreadsheets, and disconnected legacy systems to manage shipments. Nauta aims to replace those siloed processes with a single system of action.
By ingesting documents, tracking data, ERP inputs, and even email communications into a unified control layer, the platform automates workflows and gives operators real-time tools to respond to disruptions before they escalate.
“Nauta is built by and for operators,” said Valentina Jordan, CEO and co-founder of Nauta. “We truly understand the variability in their day-to-day work and are focused on helping them control the controllable. In logistics, every container tells its own story, but the systems involved rarely speak the same language. With AI, Nauta helps companies make faster, more proactive decisions about every shipment, reducing risk, improving cash flow, and growing margins.”
Since its launch in the first quarter of 2025, Nauta has already expanded into seven countries and counts importers of major global brands such as New Balance, Ashley Furniture HomeStore, L’Oréal, Modelo, and Moët & Chandon among its customers.
Early results show detention costs reduced by up to 80%, productivity gains of 30%, and container processing times improved by as much as 75%.
Construct Capital partner Camila Saruhashi, who led the round, said the timing is right for AI-native logistics solutions. “Supply chains don’t just move goods, they also move data and money. That complexity increases significantly with cross-border shipments, where every touchpoint adds layers of documentation, compliance, and coordination. With so many stakeholders and systems involved, Nauta’s AI platform is well-positioned to bring structure and visibility to this vital process, connecting the dots between every node, from manufacturers to ports to warehouses.”",49df60088261775f9a6e9d904e31f944,trafilatura,2791,0

10 stocks we like better than Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ›
Following the end of each quarter, investment firms that manage over $100 million are required to file a form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings document the stocks that investment funds bought and sold during the most recent quarter -- providing investors with an idea of where ""smart money"" is looking for value and growth.
In recent years, billionaire money manager Stanley Druckenmiller of the Duquesne Family Office came into the spotlight after the investor admitted he exited semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia far too early -- calling his decision a ""big mistake.""
Since then, Druckenmiller has reentered the chip landscape -- this time plowing into a key beneficiary of the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom beyond the usual suspects like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, or Broadcom.
Over the past year, Duquesne has built a solid position in foundry specialist Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). During Q2, Druckenmiller increased his firm's stake in Taiwan Semi by 28% -- bringing its total exposure to roughly 765,000 shares.
Let's unpack what makes TSMC such a compelling AI chip stock, and assess if now is a good opportunity for you to follow Druckenmiller's lead.
Taiwan Semi is rolling on all cylinders, and...
The chart below highlights revenue and gross profit margin trends throughout the AI revolution for TSMC. With an estimated 68% share of the global foundry market, Taiwan Semi is operating on a level far above rivals like Samsung or Intel -- giving the company the ability to exercise substantial pricing power for its services.
...its momentum isn't slowing down
At first glance, investors might worry that TSMC's steep revenue growth and expanding profit margins are nearing a peak. But the data suggests otherwise.
Enterprise spending on AI infrastructure is accelerating, led by cloud hyperscalers Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, which are in the midst of a historic capital expenditure (capex) spree to acquire GPUs and networking equipment for next-generation data centers. And it's not just the cloud giants. Meta Platforms, Apple, and Tesla are also investing heavily to advance ambitions in robotics, autonomous driving, and consumer electronics.",dd3b5e589898355ac0d1dd615dc8d460,trafilatura,2783,0

(Reuters) -The parents of a teen who died by suicide after ChatGPT coached him on methods of self harm sued OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman on Tuesday, saying the company knowingly put profit above safety when it launched the GPT-4o version of its artificial intelligence chatbot last year.
Adam Raine, 16, died on April 11 after discussing suicide with ChatGPT for months, according to the lawsuit that Raine's parents filed in San Francisco state court.
The chatbot validated Raine's suicidal thoughts, gave detailed information on lethal methods of self-harm, and instructed him on how to sneak alcohol from his parents' liquor cabinet and hide evidence of a failed suicide attempt, they allege. ChatGPT even offered to draft a suicide note, the parents, Matthew and Maria Raine, said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit seeks to hold OpenAI liable for wrongful death and violations of product safety laws, and seeks unspecified monetary damages.
An OpenAI spokesperson said the company is saddened by Raine's passing and that ChatGPT includes safeguards such as directing people to crisis helplines.
""While these safeguards work best in common, short exchanges, we’ve learned over time that they can sometimes become less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade,"" the spokesperson said, adding that OpenAI will continually improve on its safeguards.
OpenAI did not specifically address the lawsuit's allegations.
As AI chatbots become more lifelike, companies have touted their ability to serve as confidants and users have begun to rely on them for emotional support. But experts warn that relying on automation for mental health advice carries dangers, and families whose loved ones died after chatbot interactions have criticized a lack of safeguards.
OpenAI said in a blog post that it is planning to add parental controls and exploring ways to connect users in crisis with real-world resources, including by potentially building a network of licensed professionals who can respond through ChatGPT itself.
OpenAI launched GPT-4o in May 2024 in a bid to stay ahead in the AI race. OpenAI knew that features that remembered past interactions, mimicked human empathy and displayed a sycophantic level of validation would endanger vulnerable users without safeguards but launched anyway, the Raines said in their lawsuit.
""This decision had two results: OpenAI’s valuation catapulted from $86 billion to $300 billion, and Adam Raine died by suicide,"" they said.
The Raines' lawsuit also seeks an order requiring OpenAI to verify the ages of ChatGPT users, refuse inquiries for self-harm methods, and warn users about the risk of psychological dependency.

(NASDAQ:SATS) shares climbed on Tuesday after AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) revealed plans to purchase spectrum licenses worth $23 billion in an all-cash transaction.
The move aims to bolster AT&T’s wireless and fiber network capacity while positioning the company as a long-term leader in advanced connectivity across the U.S.
The acquisition will deliver roughly 50 MHz of low-band and mid-band spectrum nationwide, covering more than 400 markets.

The deal is expected to close by mid-2026, pending regulatory approvals and other conditions.
Through this agreement, AT&T will gain about 30 MHz of 3.45 GHz mid-band spectrum and 20 MHz of 600 MHz low-band spectrum.
These additions will support AT&T’s 5G deployment plans while enhancing its ability to expand home internet offerings such as AT&T Internet Air.
The licenses also provide an avenue for the company to move legacy copper-based customers onto next-generation broadband and wireless services.
As part of the transaction, AT&T and EchoStar agreed to extend their wholesale network services deal. This arrangement enables EchoStar to continue offering mobile service under the Boost Mobile brand while leveraging AT&T’s network infrastructure.
“This acquisition bolsters and expands our spectrum portfolio while enhancing customers’ 5G wireless and home internet experience in even more markets,” said John Stankey, chairman and CEO of AT&T.
He emphasized the company’s strategy of blending wireless and fiber services to create the strongest connectivity platform in the country.
AT&T said it will finance the purchase through existing cash and incremental borrowings.
The company anticipates its debt-to-EBITDA ratio to rise temporarily to about 3x after closing, with a return to its leverage target of 2.5x over the following three years.
AT&T also reaffirmed its 2025 guidance, including a $20 billion share repurchase program spanning 2025 through 2027.
The acquisition strengthens AT&T’s spectrum portfolio as it continues to battle rivals such as Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) and T-Mobile U.S. Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) in the race for nationwide 5G leadership.

The AI rocket ship has turned Nvidia into an investing gold mine.
A $1,000 investment in 2015 would be worth $349,960 today, according to Yahoo Finance data. The same $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) would've yielded $96,190, compared to $3,422 from the S&P 500 (^GSPC).
However, $1,000 into the then-industry leader Intel (INTC) would become only $1,145 as the once-dominant chipmaker misses out on the AI train.
If you have $1,000 to invest in chip stocks today, it's no surprise that the pick for many analysts is still Nvidia.
Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider noted that despite growing talk of ""peak concerns,"" the company has further upside due to its product leadership, diversified customer base, and an ""attractive valuation"" relative to growth prospects. The firm reiterated its Buy rating and $185 price target.
Broadcom (AVGO) is another top pick. The California-based chipmaker has become a leader in custom silicon for hyperscalers like Google (GOOG) and Meta (META). Schneider said Broadcom will continue generating steady, growing profitability in its infrastructure business and estimated AI will account for more than 40% of the company's revenue by 2026.
Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson told Yahoo Finance that Nvidia and Broadcom, whose stock has jumped nearly 3,500% in the past 10 years, have the clearest path to continued growth.
""Nvidia is going to remain the share leader in AI for the next three to five years partly due to the moat they've created,"" he said. ""I think Broadcom is going to remain the key provider in basics.""
AMD has also gained market share and positioned itself as a rival in GPUs. Despite strong execution in traditional computing, AMD's stock upside is likely ""capped"" given its more limited share in AI, Schneider wrote in a recent note.
""I would argue they [AMD] have the greatest growth potential, but also potentially the greatest risk to their growth potential,"" Bryson said.
He noted that AMD's solution is the closest to Nvidia's, but the company would need to grow its AI market share to high single digits to deliver meaningful stock gains.
Meanwhile, some smaller players are hovering under the radar.
Silicon Motion (SIMO) has quietly emerged as a potential AI-era beneficiary. The company designs and manufactures controllers used in solid-state drives (SSDs), smartphones, and automotive storage.
According to Bryson, Silicon Motion has historically traded like a memory company, with lower valuations compared to design-focused peers like Nvidia. But as it expands into enterprise storage controllers, its growth profile could improve, possibly leading to higher valuation multiples.",502a2138ea74196aaed3f88347b779cc,trafilatura,2755,0

ASML is the only supplier of EUV lithography systems.
-
Semiconductor companies use this type of lithography machine to produce advanced AI chips.
Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, artificial intelligence (AI) has been the driving force in the tech market. Most of the major tech companies are incorporating AI into their products, and the AI market is projected to grow to $4.8 trillion annually by 2033, according to a United Nations Trade and Development report.
There are plenty of companies looking to tap into that growth. For my money, Netherlands-based ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) is one of the AI stocks best positioned for long-term success. Here's why.
ASML has a wide moat in the semiconductor industry
AI is a highly competitive space, but a few companies have carved out dominant shares of certain markets. For example, Nvidia is the top semiconductor chip design company and has capitalized on the exponential growth in chip sales to become the largest company by market cap.
ASML is a semiconductor equipment company that manufactures lithography systems that produce those chips. Semiconductor companies use lithography systems during the chip production process. For mass production of the most advanced chips, including AI chips, they use extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems.
ASML doesn't have much competition in this arena. Estimates in 2024 put its share of the lithography market at over 90%. It's also the only company in the world supplying EUV lithography equipment, and this would be an extremely difficult market for a competitor to enter. ASML's EUV machines are highly complex, containing about 700,000 components. For comparison's sake, a typical car has about 30,000 components. In all likelihood, ASML will continue to be the only game in town.
Many of the major chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, and Samsung, rely on ASML's equipment. With its wide moat, ASML is a strong AI company that should deliver strong growth over the next decade.
A good time to buy ASML
Trading at 27 times forward earnings, ASML is reasonably valued compared to other AI stocks. I've been picking up shares throughout the year, and if you're looking for quality AI companies to add to your portfolio, it's one to check out.

LONDON/BEIJING (Reuters) -Prices of two rare earth elements needed for super-strong magnets have surged to their highest in more than two years after U.S. miner MP Materials (MP) stopped raw material exports to leading magnet maker China amid rising demand.
China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, accounting for 90% of refining capacity and around 70% of mined output, but the U.S. has pushed back, signing a deal with its biggest producer MP in July to refine its output domestically.
MP's shipments had in the past three years fed 7%-9% of China's oxide production from mine output of rare earths neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) - vital to magnets that power electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence equipment - consultancy Adamas said.
""MP's shipments were a very material portion of NdPr oxide supply for China's factories, so that's left a big void,"" said Ryan Castilloux, managing director of Adamas.
The Chinese price of NdPr oxide, regarded as a benchmark, has jumped to 632,000 yuan per metric ton or $88 per kg, the strongest since March 2023, from $63 on July 9.
Its 40% rally after several years of weakness will boost prospects for mine projects seeking investment outside China as the West seeks to wean off reliance on Beijing.
Boosting the West's rare earth output became more urgent after China clamped down on exports in April amid a trade war with the U.S., prompting some auto plants to shut.
The U.S. government announced a ground-breaking deal with MP last month stipulating the company halt shipments to China. It also offered price support to MP for the NdPr it produces based on $110 per kg, at the time about twice the Chinese price.
MP had paused shipments to China in April due to high tariffs, but any shortage was masked by weakness in magnet demand due to Chinese export curbs, analysts said. U.S. rare earth ore supply to China slid in May and hit zero in June before jumping last month, probably due to the final MP shipments, they added.
China's exports of rare earth magnets recovered to hit a six-month high in July after Beijing eased its export controls, having agreed a series of deals with the U.S. and Europe.
PEAK MANUFACTURING SEASON
NdPr prices have been weighed down by oversupply in recent years and in March last year, they sank to 345,000 yuan, the weakest since November 2020.
Their recent gains have also been driven by a rebound in demand.
""China is currently in its peak manufacturing season for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and consumer electronics. This cyclical uptick in demand has put additional pressure on available NdPr supply,"" said Neha Mukherjee, research manager for rare earths at consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.",a8f0a06309746dc1724adcfce17eaebc,trafilatura,2744,0

Casey’s General Stores presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by its distinctive business model, strong growth prospects, and effective management strategy. Operating approximately 2,900 locations, Casey’s ranks as the third-largest convenience store chain in the U.S. by store count and the fifth-largest pizza chain. The company differentiates itself through a focus on fresh food offerings, moving beyond traditional convenience store products like gas and cigarettes, which has enhanced both customer experience and profitability.
Employee retention is a standout strength, with the company employing 40% more staff than industry norms, creating meaningful career opportunities in rural communities and fostering a loyal, community-centric customer base. Product innovations, including recent additions such as chicken wings, indicate further upside for sales growth. Casey’s expansion strategy, supported by accretive M&A, has been demonstrated through its acquisition of 200 stores from Fike’s, signaling ongoing potential for unit growth, particularly in high-opportunity markets like Texas. The company’s stock has already appreciated approximately 30% this year, reflecting investor recognition of its unique positioning and execution capabilities.
With a management team experienced in profitable expansion and M&A, Casey’s is well-positioned to sustain long-term growth while maintaining high operational standards. Its combination of innovative offerings, strong human capital, and disciplined strategic execution suggests the company could deliver continued shareholder value, making the current market opportunity attractive for investors seeking a differentiated play in the U.S. convenience and food retail sector. Overall, Casey’s demonstrates a robust risk/reward profile, underpinned by operational excellence, growth potential, and community-focused brand strength.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Casey’s General Stores, Inc. (CASY) by Two Natural Capital in May 2025, which highlighted its rural dominance, fresh food-first strategy, and growth through accretive M&A. The stock has appreciated approximately 8.98% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as Casey’s expands and retains employees.

Analysts and advisers also told the news agency that larger lenders such as Aldermore and Close Brothers may draw interest from buyers as confidence returns.
The August ruling overturned much of a lower court decision on car loan sales practices, with several advisers estimating the final industry bill could be less than half the original £30 billion ($41 billion) projection.
“This is the real activity that will start now,” Hyder Jumabhoy, a partner at White & Case, told Reuters, saying owners now have “enough clarity to begin preparing [lenders] for sale” even as they await details of the final redress scheme.
Cabot Square Capital has already hired BNP Paribas to handle a sale of Blue Motor Finance, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Blue Motor posted an £8.5 million loss on £53 million in revenue in 2023. Startline, owned by US hedge fund The Baupost Group, could also come to market, with its latest accounts showing £100.3 million of income and a £4.25 million loss.
“There’s a series of highly attractive assets which have sat in private equity portfolios for longer than expected,” Elliot Reader, director at Houlihan Lokey, told Reuters, adding that “regulatory or macro reasons” had delayed exits until now.
The ruling has also prompted speculation about larger players. Moody’s analysts noted in June that specialist lenders such as Aldermore (owned by South Africa's FirstRand) and Close Brothers could be acquisition targets. Both firms were closely involved in the legal challenge that led to the Supreme Court’s 1 August decision. Close Brothers’ shares have jumped about 25% since the ruling.
Still, some remain cautious. “Does [the ruling] pave the way for future M&A activity in the motor finance space given recent inactivity? Yes, but I'd expect any meaningful movement to emerge throughout 2026,” Antony Walsh, partner at Eversheds Sutherland, told Reuters.
Benjamin Toms (RBC Capital Markets) cautioned that banks may still hold off until the redress issue is fully resolved.
The Financial Conduct Authority is now designing a compensation scheme for car loans involving discretionary commission arrangements, with mid-range estimates of £9-18 billion now seen as more realistic.
Despite this, the UK motor finance market remains robust. Around 80% of all new cars sold to consumers in the 12 months to April were financed, with total outstanding point-of-sale contracts valued at roughly £86 billion as of June, according to the Finance & Leasing Association.",ddca33a1bd5942e4d732c3cbd012316e,trafilatura,2730,0

Keurig Dr Pepper CFO Sudhanshu Priyadarshi is set to play a key role in the beverage giant’s newly unveiled plans to spin off a separate, publicly traded coffee company.
On Monday, Keurig Dr Pepper announced plans to acquire Dutch multinational coffee company JDE Peet’s in a roughly $18 billion, all-cash transaction. Once that deal goes through, the company plans to cleave its coffee business into its own separate company that would be led by Priyadarshi.
This will be Priyadarshi’s first time as a CEO.
Current Keurig Dr Pepper CEO Tim Cofer, meanwhile, will lead the company’s other division focused on “refreshment beverages,” including Dr Pepper.
The new business to be led by Priyadarshi will be a “new global coffee champion,” Cofer said in a news release.
“Through the complementary combination of Keurig and JDE Peet’s, we are seizing an exceptional opportunity to create a global coffee giant,” Cofer said in the release. “This is the right time for this transaction, with KDP in a position of operational and financial strength, momentum across our evolved portfolio, and increasing coffee category resilience. By creating two sharply focused beverage companies with attractive and tailored growth propositions and capital allocation strategies, we are poised to generate significant shareholder value in both the near and long term.”
By revenue, the coffee side of Keurig Dr Pepper’s business today is notably smaller than its refreshment business. In its 2024 fiscal year, the company’s U.S. coffee division pulled in $3.967 billion, down slightly from $4.071 billion in the prior year. That compares to total revenue of $9.3 billion in Keurig Dr Pepper’s refreshment beverages business. The coffee trade has seen rising prices due to things like inclement weather and shifting supply chains, and its existence as a staple in offices around the U.S. is currently under threat from recent legislative changes.
JDE Peet’s itself is the result of an earlier merger coordinated by Luxembourg conglomerate JAB Holding Co. In 2012, JAB bought predecessor company Peet’s Coffee & Tea. Seven years later, JAB merged Peet’s with Jacobs Douwe Egberts and took the combined company public as JDE Peet’s in 2020.
In an interview with CFO.com earlier this year, Priyadarshi noted that the company was continuing to navigate the effect of tariffs, like many other consumer businesses. “We rely on a global supply chain like everyone else and are not immune to tariffs, but we have a lot of production for both the beverage and coffee business being done in the U.S. already,” he said at the time.",d1c21fb6521b53f6620f1aebe29a58f4,trafilatura,2730,0

By Sabrina Valle
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Two major rail operators have taken themselves out of the merger game that has gripped the industry for the past month, reshaping the competitive landscape and raising the regulatory stakes for Union Pacific's proposed $85 billion tie-up with Norfolk Southern .
Canadian Pacific Kansas City joined Warren Buffett's BNSF Railway BNSF Railway on Tuesday in publicly rejecting participation in any near-term rail industry consolidation.
The move makes it less likely that a proposed $85 billion merger last month between top U.S. railroad operator Union Pacific and Norfolk would lead to more corporate marriages.
The merger would create the first east-west U.S. railroad operator, reshaping the movement of goods ranging from grains to autos across the country. The news raised concerns about market concentration and prompted heated speculation that rivals would need to join forces to remain competitive.
REGIONAL DUOPOLY
The U.S. rail industry has already undergone significant consolidation in recent decades, shrinking from dozens of carriers to six major class I railroads.
The U.S. freight rail industry is dominated by four top U.S.-based carriers - two in the west and two in the east. That means shippers have only two carrier options considering the point of origin.
Top railroad operator Union Pacific, which primarily operates in the west, proposed to join Norfolk, which has a strong foothold in the east. Initially, this prompted speculation that the other two U.S.-based railroad operators - BNSF Railway in the west and CSX in the east - could merge to stay competitive against a coast-to-coast giant.
That game has changed in the past days. First, Buffett-backed BNSF dropped out.
Two large Canadian railroad companies also operate in the United States. Canadian Pacific, the only one with a tri-national network, would be the next viable candidate to merge with CSX. But Tuesday's announcement left CSX without a viable partner for a large merger.
HIGHER REGULATORY RISKS
The reduced chances of a consolidation wave raises the regulatory risks for Union Pacific's attempt to buy Norfolk and go coast-to-coast.
If this was the only deal under review by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board, regulators would have greater concerns because a single large operator could muscle out smaller regional operators.
Expectations were different last month. When Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern disclosed they were in talks last month, board officials were gearing up to review two megamerger proposals, a person close to the discussions previously told Reuters.",f6b7da6e440e06b743a5a181487ba177,trafilatura,2712,0

Shares of the tech giant entered August down 17% for the year due in part to concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump’s sweeping levies, which cost the company $800 million in its fiscal third quarter alone. The US president has long criticized Apple for its reliance on overseas production partners, at one point even threatening to punish the company with tariffs if it didn’t make its iPhones in the US.

Then, at an event in the Oval Office on Aug. 6, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook committed to spending an additional $100 billion on manufacturing in the US. Combined with the iPhone maker’s expansion of a long-standing deal with glass-supplier Corning Inc., the risk of additional Trump tariffs were seen as diminishing and the stock took off, soaring 8.7% in August, putting it on pace for its best month since June 2024. The stock fell 0.7% on Tuesday.
“The picture is a lot clearer from a tariff standpoint,” said George Cipolloni, a veteran portfolio manager. Apple “was in Trump’s crosshairs, but Cook kissed the ring and now it no longer seems to be, which removes a headwind.”
It’s been a strange stretch for Apple. The stock has been a reliable winner for years, soaring more than 240% from 2020 through 2024, putting it among the 20 best performers in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index. But this year has been different. Even with its August run, the shares are still down 10% in 2025, putting them among the worst performers in the benchmark.
In addition to tariffs, the company is facing skepticism about its artificial intelligence plans and sluggish sales growth. The stock also remains relatively expensive. Even with this year’s selloff, it’s trading at 29 times projected earnings, a premium to its average over the past decade of 21 times and to the Nasdaq 100’s multiple of 27.
However, sentiment is clearly improving. Late last month, Apple reported its fastest quarterly revenue growth in more than three years, supported by its iPhone business and strength in the China market.

Here's the Biggest Reason Why There's Still Time.
Key Points
-
Warren Buffett is stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.
-
This may give some investors pause about owning its shares.
-
But Berkshire still has one major advantage versus the market.
It finally happened. Earlier this year, Warren Buffett declared that he would be stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Buffett is widely considered one of the best investors of all time. Experts have been trying to replicate his strategy for decades. But the simplest strategy was to invest alongside Buffett by purchasing Berkshire's shares directly.
Many investors now fear that it's too late to buy Berkshire stock. The truth, however, is that now could be one of the best times in years to buy into this legendary business.
Berkshire Hathaway has a gigantic advantage versus the market
Typically, you don't want the companies you're invested in to hold a huge amount of excess cash. Ideally, that cash would be invested into new growth opportunities rather than sit in a bank account or short-term vehicles with minimal interest rates. Businesses like Berkshire are the exception. Last quarter, the company revealed that it is now sitting on more than $300 billion in cash -- more than any other company in history.
""I've tried to reason my way through this a few different ways,"" Motley Fool analyst Matt Argersinger commented earlier this summer. ""I think the evidence is undeniable that Buffett thinks or thought that valuations were expensive, and he was preparing Berkshire Hathaway for just that.""
While Buffett has long warned against timing the market, he has also urged investors to keep a close eye on valuations. If there isn't an obvious investment worth making, sitting on cash could be the wisest decision. Indeed, that's exactly what Buffett has done in recent years, leaving the firm with a huge cash pile upon his exit.
Right now, Berkshire is arguably better positioned than ever. Its core portfolio of businesses remains intact; yet, it has massive firepower to make huge deals should valuations plummet -- a rare advantage in bear markets. If you're nervous about the market but want to remain invested, Berkshire remains an incredible option, given its huge cash advantage.

""The Japanese agreement, which we're going to announce later this week, that's $550 billion at the hand of Donald Trump,"" Lutnick told the Ingraham Angle show on Fox News on Monday night.
The Japanese funds could be used for the manufacturing of products such as semiconductors, antibiotics or rare earths in the U.S., Lutnick added.
Washington and Tokyo agreed in July to set a reduced 15% tariff on Japanese imports in exchange for a $550 billion package of U.S.-bound investment through government-backed loans and guarantees, but details of its contents remain obscure.
Trump has touted the package as ""our money to invest, as we like"", while Japanese officials have stressed the investments will be determined by whether they will also benefit Japan.
SoftBank Group's $2 billion investment in Intel announced last week was not part of the package at the moment, a Japanese government source has told Reuters.
Japanese broadcaster FNN reported on Monday that Tokyo's top trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa will visit the U.S. as soon as this week to discuss a document to formalize the agreement on the Japanese investment.
Akazawa, speaking at a regular Tuesday briefing, said his next U.S. trip was not decided and declined to comment on Lutnick's remarks. Tokyo will keep pressing Washington to implement the deal to cut U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods soon, he added.
The U.S. has urged Japan to have a written agreement on the investment plans, but Japan prefers to keep the deal less legally-binding, the Nikkei business daily reported earlier on Tuesday.
The lack of a clear document on the trade agreement had created confusion in Tokyo about tariff rates until Lutnick and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified earlier this month that Japanese goods were exempt from overlapping levies and an earlier presidential order would be amended.
Lutnick and Bessent also promised, during Akazawa's previous visit on August 7, that Trump would issue another order to lower tariffs on Japanese cars to 15% from 27.5%, but did not specify when.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has said Tokyo did not seek a written trade agreement with Washington because it wanted a swift resolution and to ensure Trump's tariffs on key Japanese exports such as autos were lowered quicly.
Ishiba's support rate has surged in recent polls thanks in part to the trade deal, even after his ruling coalition lost its majority in an upper house election last month.",474c46a989bdcf6a3fcac3cefbdc7681,trafilatura,2701,0

Trump's comment at a Cabinet meeting came hours after he took the unprecedented step of moving to fire central bank Governor Lisa Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, from the board.
Trump has already appointed two of the Fed board's seven governors, and he is poised to pick another to replace Adriana Kugler, who announced her retirement earlier this summer.
Trump has selected Stephen Miran, one of his top economic advisors, to serve out the rest of Kugler's term, which ends Jan. 31, 2026.
""We'll have a majority very shortly,"" Trump said Tuesday afternoon. ""So that'll be great.""
""Once we have a majority, housing is going to swing, and it's going to be great,"" he said. ""People are paying too high an interest rate. That's the only problem with us. We have to get the rates down a little bit.""
The president had been asked who he was considering as a replacement for Cook.
""Well, we have some very good people for that position, and I think we have some very good people we're down to,"" he said. ""I think I maybe, in my own mind, have somebody that I like.""
He also once again hurled criticism Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has repeatedly rebuffed Trump's demands that he lower benchmark rates by multiple percentage points.
""Because of him and his high interest rates, the housing is less than it could be,"" Trump said of Powell. ""We're going to get that straightened out very quickly.""
Trump said in a letter issued Monday night that he was firing Cook over an investigation launched by his Department of Justice into allegations about her mortgages.
Cook will file a lawsuit to block her ouster, her attorney said Tuesday morning.
In a statement issued while Trump's Cabinet meeting was ongoing, the Fed said that Cook has indicated that she will ask the courts to ""confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities"" as a governor.
The central bank said it will ""abide by any court decision.""
The statement also noted, ""Long tenures and removal protections for governors serve as a vital safeguard, ensuring that monetary policy decisions are based on data, economic analysis, and the long-term interests of the American people.""
When a reporter asked Trump about that statement during the meeting, he said, ""I'd abide by the court.""
Around the same time, White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Trump ""exercised his lawful authority to remove a governor on the federal board of governors for cause.""

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau officially asked for feedback on the so-called “open banking” rule last week. Legacy financial institutions and new upstarts have staked out very different positions, and it’s worth paying attention: One side argues your data security is at risk, the other says you’re being ripped off.

To Fee or Not to Fee, That is the Question
The origin of the “open banking” rule goes back to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which introduced sweeping financial reforms after the Great Recession. The law says financial institutions must provide consumers with their data upon request, and the “open banking” rule sought to clarify the details, notably by permitting consumers to request their data be shared with authorized third parties. It was issued in October 2024 but isn’t scheduled to take effect until June 2026.
The idea was to allow consumers greater financial flexibility: By sharing data with third parties, they could find better rates and services, compare products and obtain credit on better terms. Fintechs and the crypto sector hailed the rule as a breakthrough for potentially opening up more competition to traditional banks and credit unions. The banking industry saw things differently:
-
While the rule contained strict guidelines for third parties wanting to access the data, the banking industry called for it to be scrapped, while the Bank Policy Institute, an industry trade group, sued to block it. Industry advocates argued it was an overreach of the CFPB’s legal powers, that banks would potentially be forced to pass on data to risky third parties more vulnerable to breaches, and that the industry should be compensated for providing access to customer data (JP Morgan advised fintechs they would have to pay up last month).

The fintech and crypto sectors have argued that fees are anticompetitive and erode consumers’ freedom to use their financial technologies of choice, with apps like Coinbase, Venmo and Robinhood at risk of being hit with costs for accessing customers’ bank accounts with their consent. Earlier this month, over 80 fintech CEOs signed a joint letter to President Donald Trump objecting to “exorbitant new ‘account access’ fees” and arguing banks were “advancing a dangerous legal interpretation that a consumer’s right to their account information does not include the freedom to share access to a trusted application acting on their behalf.”",e028ba5b7705cf6172b1ff25605212d7,trafilatura,2677,0

By Nora Eckert
DETROIT, August 26 (Reuters) -Stellantis has shelved its first Level 3 advanced driver-assistance program because of high costs, technological challenges and concerns about consumer appetite, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
As recently as February, Stellantis said its in-house system, which is part of the AutoDrive program, was ready for deployment and a key pillar of its strategy. The company said the system, which enables drivers to have their hands off the wheel and eyes off the road under certain conditions, would allow them to temporarily watch movies, catch up on emails, or read books.
That Level 3 software was never launched, the company confirmed to Reuters. But it stopped short of saying that the program was canceled.
""What was unveiled in February 2025 was L3 technology for which there is currently limited market demand, so this has not been launched, but the technology is available and ready to be deployed,"" a Stellantis spokesperson said.
The three sources, however, said that the program was put on ice and is not expected to be deployed. When asked how much time and money was lost on the initiative, Stellantis declined to say, responding that the work done on AutoDrive will help support its future versions.
Former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares offered a glimpse into the company's plans for AutoDrive in 2021, saying it was one of three core technology platforms that would arrive in 2024.
“Software strategy is one of the key building blocks of Stellantis’ overall strategy,” he said.
Traditional automakers have been spending billions in recent years to engineer software-focused vehicles that can be frequently upgraded, like smartphones, a capability pioneered by Tesla and advanced by a slew of Chinese electric-car brands. Many legacy competitors have run into problems as they try to catch up, impeded by mounting costs, a lack of talent, and the bureaucracy that permeates century-old automakers.
‘HIGH INVESTMENT FOR HIGH RISK’
Stellantis said it is leaning on aiMotive, a tech startup it acquired in 2022, to deliver the next generation of the AutoDrive program. Stellantis declined to say when that program would be ready for market or if it would include Level 3 capability.
AutoDrive is part of a three-pronged technological platform called ""STLA ABC."" It includes Stellantis' in-car software system, SmartCockpit, and its STLA Brain electrical architecture, which is a foundation of software and hardware that allows the vehicles to be frequently updated with new features or fixes.",f03de864546fecc75e2e397cab608c33,trafilatura,2675,0

The reason has nothing to do with profit or cash flow, but the war in Gaza.
The fund said there was a risk the U.S. machinery company had contributed to suffering in Palestinian territories, citing evidence Israeli authorities used its bulldozers to destroy property unlawfully. It is ditching its stakes in four Israeli banks, including the country’s two largest by assets, on similar grounds.

The divestments by Norges Bank Investment Management add to evidence that the war in Gaza is leading to Israel’s estrangement from Western allies.
The fund manages almost $2 trillion in stocks, bonds and other assets accumulated from Norway’s oil wealth, giving it an average stake of 1.5% in all listed companies globally. Run by a former hedge-fund manager, it has a muscular approach to investing, often pushing for changes at companies it owns or selling shares on environmental, social and corporate-governance grounds.
Norway’s fund held a stake of just over 1.2% in Caterpillar, valued at the equivalent of about $2.4 billion, at the end of 2024.
Caterpillar didn’t respond to a request for comment.
The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment.
Earlier this month, the fund said it would sell 11 of the 61 Israeli companies in which it owns shares after a request by Norway’s Finance Ministry to review its investments in the country. The order followed a political outcry over reports that the fund had bought shares of an engine company that maintains Israeli jet fighters.
“Israel’s growing isolation in the international community and within parts of the business community is a serious problem,” said Yohanan Plesner, a former member of the Knesset who is president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a think tank. He notes however, that thus far, Israel’s economy hasn’t been hit by divestment moves.
Investments in Israel by Norway’s oil fund have become a flashpoint ahead of elections due to take place next month. Jonas Gahr Støre’s Labour Party, which faces a stiff challenge from the right-wing opposition, relies on support from smaller parties to govern with a minority of parliamentary seats. Some left-wing politicians have pushed the fund to divest from Israel, or for Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen to resign.",98eab6ec8048746dc89a7f34970aba25,trafilatura,2675,0

The Trial Balance is CFO.com’s weekly preview of stories, stats and events to help you prepare.
Part 1 — The CPA pipeline shrink
Business Insider reported last week that PwC plans to cut U.S. campus hiring by almost a third by 2028, a move the firm confirmed after the outlet obtained part of an internal presentation. The document, shared with an alumni group at a major U.S. college, shows PwC expects to hire 2,197 tax and assurance associates in 2028, 1,045 fewer than in 2025.
For CFOs, that shift matters. Corporate finance teams often rely on Big Four experience and trained alumni to bring not only technical knowledge but also a mindset of grit, rigor and precision. If the firms use outsourcing or technology to do work while changing how new accountants are trained, the downstream effect will be quickly felt in companies’ finance functions too.
In a statement to BI, PwC said the slide the news outlet obtained was real. PwC explained that “the rapid pace of technological change is reshaping how we work, what our clients require and the skills our people need to thrive.” It also cited “historically low” attrition as a reason for the cuts.
The efficiency story is one partners and clients can appreciate, but it exposes a larger challenge for both the profession and CFOs. Those entry-level jobs such as auditing cash, ticking and tying numbers and working through the grind of tax prep were the proving ground for generations of accountants. Many CFOs credit these firms for the development of their technical instincts.
Adding to the disruption, PwC’s AI assurance leader Jenn Kosar also recently told BI that new hires are being fast tracked into managerial roles. Kosar said that within three years “first years are functioning more like fourth years,” overseeing AI doing routine audit tasks and focusing instead on critical thinking and professional skepticism early in their careers.
If new hires are not doing that routine work and are focused on supervising AI outputs, they may struggle to develop the same bedrock skills currently required. The profession risks raising a generation of professionals who understand review and oversight, but lack the depth of experience that comes only from working through the details themselves.
Though outsourcing and agentic AI have helped drive efficiency in many firms, the rapid push to implement these tools could quietly erode the traditional path where accountants built their skills. The benefits are clear, but the long-term impact on talent development is less certain.",24ed326d9e4ca404f2e09664fe5bb010,trafilatura,2674,0

Consider This: 10 Used Cars That Will Last Longer Than the Average New Vehicle
This article explores the six most common toxic spending habits in the United States today that keep people from growing their wealth.
1. You’re Impulse Buy Frequently
Impulse buying will get you in trouble every time. You’re running errands, you’re feeling good, but you need a little pick-me-up. So you hit the Starbucks and drop $6 on a latte. If you’ve got kids in the car, that price point can quickly reach $25.
That’s every single time you stop at the cafe, which can add up to hundreds a month.
Maybe you see a cute purse or a cool set of golf clubs in the window of a store that you’re walking past. Or you’re up late at night, and some influencer convinces you that this new jewelry line is the height of glamour.
And you hit “buy now.”
Every time you buy on impulse, you’re taking money away from your future self. You’re depreciating your real wealth.
Fix it: Make a rule for yourself that you’ll never buy on impulse. Make yourself wait at least one day before you go back to make that purchase. Nine times out of 10, you’ll change your mind. And you can put that coffee money in the market where it belongs. After all, you have coffee at home.

2. Your Credit Cards Finance Your Lifestyle
You applied for a credit card to start building your credit score. And it worked. But now you’re living off your credit cards. The balance gets higher each month, and you don’t really feel the effects because you pay a little off each month.
What happens quite quickly is that your credit limit will be maxed out, and you’ll have to start paying that balance all off, with interest. Now you’re paying interest on those silly impulse buys that you don’t even care about anymore.
Fix it: Only let yourself use your credit card if you plan to pay off the entire balance at the end of every cycle, so you never pay interest. If you can’t pay it off, you can’t afford it.
3. You Ignore Subscriptions and Small Charges
You’ve got an annual membership for an app on your phone that you never use. But it’s only $39 a year. You’re getting magazines you never read. But they’re only $12 per year each. You’re signed up for every streaming service, and you only watch two or three.",c6380eb72aefa7e000825e1fcae9d72e,trafilatura,2666,0

Which Ones Are Worth Investing In?
The truth is that any one of these companies may be worth investing in, but it will ultimately depend on your goals. When you look at this list, some of these are heavily skewed towards finance, technology and retail giants. Of course, there is the exception with companies like UnitedHealth Group and Exxon Mobile.
When deciding what would work best for you, it’s important to assess factors like your financial goals and risk tolerance. Some of these companies may have experienced high growth, for example, and could mean that you have the potential to earn higher returns.
But higher returns could mean that the stock could lose more in value.
There’s also the consideration of how much a stock price will cost. Individual stocks for these companies may cost more. Plus, you’re placing more risk if you’re only purchasing one company stock. But there are ways to invest in these companies with somewhat less of a risk.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas pointed to the trend, tweeting Sunday, ""New filings from 21Shares for an active crypto ETF (something I think we'll see a ton of in the next 12 months) and a 2x Doge and 2x Sui.""
Invest in Gold
The filings show how issuers are trying to stay one step ahead of regulators while preparing for an October window that could see multiple approvals land at once.
Multiple issuers also updated XRP ETF applications, which are “almost certainly due to feedback from SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected,"" Bloomberg's James Seyffart tweeted Saturday.
Industry experts widely agree with Balchunas's assessment of the coming wave.
Charmaine Tam, head of OTC sales and trading at Hex Trust, told Decrypt that the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has “created regulatory precedent, giving issuers confidence to pursue more sophisticated offerings.”
""Active ETFs are a logical next step"" for professional management, while ""leveraged products serve clients seeking more aggressive exposure,” she said.
Bridget Nichols, chief commercial officer at Monochrome, told Decrypt that Balchunas “generally has his finger on the pulse of USA ETF and regulatory developments” and that his outlook “rings true in a fast-moving digital assets landscape.”
Bitcoin ETFs Shed $1 Billion in Five Days Amid Ethereum Comeback
She explained actively managed crypto ETFs face the same issues as their traditional counterparts, noting “taking directional bets is a clear win/lose strategy,” and with Bitcoin’s volatility, passive funds often perform better over time.
“Passive ETFs generally perform better over most time horizons,” Nichols said, adding Bitcoin in particular has “a track record of being very hard to outperform.”
Any edge in crypto markets is ""extremely rare,"" she noted, typically stemming from early token investments that prove “unsustainable.”
ETFs all round
Recent reports revealed JPMorgan is exploring offering clients financing against crypto ETFs, which Tam called ""a profound sign of mainstream acceptance"" that introduces new capital efficiency for institutions.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on MBC. MasterBrand, Inc. 's share was trading at $12.46 as of August 18th. MBC’s trailing P/E was 17.31 according to Yahoo Finance.
MasterBrand (MBC) is the largest manufacturer of kitchen and bath cabinets in North America, serving both new home construction and the repair and remodel (R&R) markets. The company operates through a leading dealer network of over 7,700 cabinet dealers, offering the industry’s broadest product range across pre-built and customized cabinets at all price points. MBC also sells directly to homebuilders and through retail partnerships with Home Depot and Lowe’s, reinforcing its dominant market position.
From 2019 to 2022, MBC delivered impressive growth with sales and Adjusted EBITDA CAGRs of 11% and 17%, respectively, while expanding margins by nearly 190bps. Despite a challenging housing backdrop leading to an ~18% sales decline over the past two years, the company improved margins by an additional 90bps through manufacturing optimization, standardization of components, automation, and strong collaboration with retail partners to balance inventory and demand.
Looking ahead, management targets 5% annual top-line growth, exceeding the industry’s expected 4%, alongside Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 17%, representing ~350bps of improvement from 2024 levels. While FY25 is expected to bring a low-single-digit revenue decline and ~72bps margin compression, if MBC achieves its long-term goals, it could deliver nearly 69% upside by FY30 without any multiple expansion, supported by its undemanding 6.3x EV/EBITDA valuation and a sector-leading 12% free cash flow yield.
Capital allocation remains disciplined, with priorities on reinvesting for growth, modernizing technology, and deleveraging from 2.7x to under 2x net debt/EBITDA by 2025. Management is integrating the July 2024 Supreme Cabinetry acquisition, remains cautious on near-term M&A, and has authorized a $50M buyback (~3.9% of market cap), providing additional shareholder returns.
Previously we covered a bullish thesis on Sleep Number Corporation (SNBR) by Yanky Banash in December 2024, which highlighted its premium positioning, strong margins, and potential for multi-fold returns as the mattress cycle rebounds. The stock has depreciated ~23.46% since then due to housing market weakness. The thesis still stands with expected 2025 recovery. Stock Analysis Compilation shares a similar view, emphasizing MasterBrand’s cabinet leadership, margin expansion, and strong free cash flow.",5fb39c4c5eb8becdf2552d1122e18650,trafilatura,2651,0

10 stocks we like better than Ark ETF Trust - Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF ›
It's clear that artificial intelligence, or AI, is one of the most transformative technologies of our time -- and one of the most exciting investment opportunities. However, many investors are a bit intimidated when it comes to selecting which AI stocks to invest in, and understandably so. After all, there are likely to be some big winners, but not every AI stock will produce stellar investment results.
With that in mind, for many investors, a better approach might be to invest in a AI exchange-traded fund, or ETF, that does the hard work for you. One that looks particularly interesting is the Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (NYSEMKT: ARKQ), a Cathie Wood ETF that aims to find the best opportunities in several AI-related areas.
A portfolio of outside-the-box AI stocks
One of my biggest complaints about investing in artificial intelligence ETFs is that there isn't too much variety, especially when it comes to the largest holdings. In most AI ETFs, you'll find large positions in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).
The Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF certainly has some exposure to the bigger AI names, but they aren't quite as much of a focal point of the fund. For example, Nvidia and AMD are the 13th and eighth largest holdings, respectively.
The largest holding of the ETF, making up 10.7% of the assets, is Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), which might surprise you. But the leading electric vehicle manufacturer has a lot of AI involvement when it comes to developing autonomous driving systems, energy storage products, and more.
Beyond Tesla, the rest of the top five include:
-
Kratos Defense and Security (NASDAQ: KTOS): 9.6% of portfolio.
-
Teradyne (NASDAQ: TER): 7.3% of portfolio.
-
Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR): 6.3% of portfolio.
-
Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR): 5.3% of portfolio.
In short, this is certainly a concentrated portfolio, There are only 35 stocks in the ETF and the 10 largest positions account for 60% of the fund's assets. But as an actively managed fund, it is concentrated in stocks Cathie Wood and her team feel have the best long-term potential, not just the largest AI stocks in the market.",2a87f0d826f1e19b1a513e2899ca97b2,trafilatura,2650,0

(Reuters) -Polymarket said on Tuesday it secured an investment from Donald Trump Jr-backed venture capital firm 1789 Capital, as prediction markets gain traction in the United States.
The Trump brothers, Eric and Donald, have announced a series of new business ventures over the past year, serving as advisers on corporate boards. They have also expanded their investments in a financial firm, golf courses, hotels, telecom and crypto miners - ventures they say reflect U.S. President Donald Trump's policies and agendas.
Polymarket did not disclose the terms of the investment by 1789 Capital, but a source familiar with the matter told Reuters it was in the double-digit millions of dollars. Trump Jr is also set to join Polymarket as a strategic adviser.
America-first investing as a strategy has broadly gained traction under the Trump administration, with fund managers rolling out products that emphasize U.S.-based assets and operations.
1789 Capital, launched in 2022 by Omeed Malik and Chris Buskirk, carries the tagline ""funding the next chapter of American exceptionalism"" on its website. It counts the eldest son of the U.S. president among its partners.
The Palm Beach, Florida-based firm has backed ventures aligned with conservative values and brands itself as an anti-ESG investor.
Malik, a former Bank of America executive, was a prominent donor to U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign.
BURGEONING POPULARITY
Event derivatives trading involves buying and selling contracts tied to specific outcomes and has surged in popularity since the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
While traditional media polls ahead of the election showed Democrat Kamala Harris having a narrow lead, prediction markets consistently priced in a greater probability of a Trump victory.
Proponents of prediction markets say event derivatives provide a more accurate gauge of real-world outcomes by harnessing the collective intelligence of traders with money riding on their predictions.
""Polymarket cuts through media spin and so-called 'expert' opinion by letting people bet on what they actually believe will happen in the world,"" Trump Jr said in a statement.
Some trending markets currently on its platform include ""Fed decision in September?"" and ""Will Trump try to fire Powell in 2025?""
Critics, on the other hand, say prediction markets are little more than gambling, raising concerns about speculation on sensitive topics such as elections and public policy.
Platforms such as Polymarket, once seen as experimental, now draw a wide mix of retail traders and institutional interest, signaling the sector has outgrown its nascent phase.",bb481a9019e728c7ac9488f1f15952d1,trafilatura,2649,0

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Major stock indexes eased on Monday after gaining on Friday when U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a September interest rate cut was likely but not certain, while the dollar gained.
The dollar fell last week following Powell's remarks at the Fed's annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. U.S. Treasury yields were higher on Monday.
Major brokerages, including Barclays, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, now expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in September. Fed funds futures traders are pricing in 84% odds of a September cut, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.
""On Friday there was a lot of enthusiasm about Powell basically indicating that there would likely be a rate cut. The market may have overreacted to his comments,"" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York, said.
""I do believe we will get a rate cut, but I don't think it will be more than 25 basis points, and a lot depends on this Friday's PCE price inflation index.""
Data for August due before the Fed’s September 16-17 meeting could still sway Fed policy. The U.S. personal consumption prices reading, due on Friday, is considered the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.
Hotter-than-expected U.S. producer price data last month raised some questions over the certainty of a cut.
Investors are also keen to hear from AI chipmaker Nvidia, whose results are expected on Wednesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 349.27 points, or 0.77%, to 45,282.47, the S&P 500 fell 27.59 points, or 0.43%, to 6,439.32 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 47.24 points, or 0.22%, to 21,449.29.
Nvidia is among the last of the S&P 500 companies to report on the most recent quarter. Overall results so far have been much better than expected and have helped to support stocks.

The S&P 500 closed 0.4% higher after wavering between small gains and losses for much of the day. The benchmark index finished just 2.6 points below its record high set earlier this month and short of recouping all of its losses from the day before.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average also bounced back from an early slide, finishing with a 0.3% gain. The Nasdaq composite added 0.4%.
The market’s uneven start to the week comes after Wall Street notched big gains last week on hopes for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.
Gains in technology, financial and industrial stocks helped outweigh losses in communication services and other sectors. Chipmaking giant Nvidia rose 1.1% and JPMorgan Chase added 1.2%.
Boeing rose 3.5% for one of the biggest gains among S&P 500 companies after Korean Air announced a $50 billion deal with the company that includes buying more than 100 aircraft.

Treasury yields mostly fell in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.26% from 4.28% late Monday.
The broader market remained subdued following President Donald Trump's escalation of his fight with the Federal Reserve. On Monday, he said that he’s removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Cook's lawyer said she'll sue Trump’s administration to try to prevent him from firing her.
It marks the latest escalation in his dispute with the central bank over its cautious interest rate policy. The Fed has held rates steady since late 2024 over worries that Trump's unpredictable tariff policy will reignite inflation. Trump has also threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, often taunting him with name-calling. Still, he is only one of 12 votes that decides interest rate policy.
“We will continue to monitor rising political pressure on the Fed but expect its decision-making to remain guided by its mandate in the near term,"" said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for the Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Wall Street is still betting that the Fed will trim its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting in September. Traders see an 87% chance that the central bank will cut the rate by a quarter of a percentage point, according to data from CME Group.
The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, slipped to to 3.68% from 3.73% late Friday.",ec52dfe5da8ddd4de3f85f099fdeed69,trafilatura,2640,0

Dear Quentin,
I am a 65-year-old single woman. I plan on working for the next 2 to 5 years and the only debt I have is my home. I have a lot of credit cards, but I pay them off each month if I use them and don’t run a balance. ￼Should I just downsize and keep two credit cards and use those and close all of the others?
I probably have 25 cards — store cards and Visas and Mastercards that I’ve kept for rewards to use for gift cards at Christmas and discounts (5%) or airline miles. ￼I guess I’m getting tired of having all of them and wondered how much it’s really going to hurt me credit-score wise, but I guess I’m not sure that it really makes a difference.

Dear Too Many,
You’re about to get canceled — well, your cards are — and it’s going to feel good.
Without knowing much about your day-to-day activities, I’ll assume you lead a modest lifestyle. Your credit score will take a hit either way, so you can either decide to go for broke and cancel them all at once, given that you have no intention of taking any loans anytime soon, or do as most financial advisers would recommend and rid yourself of the excess cards gradually. Given that you are a homeowner and have no loans in your future, I don’t see a compelling reason to drag this out.
I assume you would benefit from getting rid of the following credit cards: 1) cards that you opened most recently because they have the shortest credit history, 2) cards with high annual fees, unless you’re planning to get rid of a card that, say, gives you bountiful travel rewards and you see a lot of globetrotting in your future, 3) cards that have similar points that overlap, 4) cards that are costing you no annual fee and line them up to cancel at a later date and 5) store cards, which can have exorbitant interest.
Ideally, you want to keep your credit-card usage to credit limit ratio of 25% to 30%, but put those rules on hold during this cancellation period. The main credit bureaus — Equifax EFX, Transunion TRU and Experian UK:EXPN — calculate their scores differently. A FICO FICO score has five categories: payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit (10%) and credit mix (10%). In other words, FICO values consumers who stay on top of their finances.",513ff0ddfd749cb451febf6ed0fab34b,trafilatura,2636,0

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -EchoStar has agreed to sell wireless spectrum licenses for $23 billion to AT&T as it faces scrutiny from government regulators and after President Donald Trump urged a deal.
In June, Trump prodded satellite communications and Dish TV parent EchoStar and Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to reach an amicable deal over the fate of the company's wireless spectrum licenses, the company said earlier.
In May, the FCC told EchoStar it was investigating the company's compliance obligations to provide 5G service in the United States, questioning EchoStar's buildout extension and mobile-satellite service.
Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez raised questions about the agency's role.
""Rather than serving as a neutral regulator, it once again mounted a pressure campaign on a private company, putting the agency’s thumb on the scale in ways that risks distorting the wireless marketplace to the detriment of consumers,"" she said Tuesday.
An FCC spokesperson said the agency appreciates ""the productive and ongoing discussions with the EchoStar team. The FCC will continue to focus on ensuring the beneficial use of scarce spectrum resources.""
The Justice Department's Antitrust Division said it had been coordinating with the FCC on the review and will exercise its jurisdiction as appropriate ""to maximize the benefits to American consumers.""
The deal marks the latest major investment by AT&T to accelerate its fiber and 5G network build-out as the wireless market saturates and internet usage surges.
Shares of EchoStar closed up 70%, while AT&T shares fell by 0.6%
Trump met on June 12 with EchoStar Chair Charlie Ergen and later called Carr to take part in the meeting. EchoStar had been seeking to shield its cache of wireless spectrum licenses from the threat of revocation by the FCC.
EchoStar said the AT&T deal is part of its ongoing efforts to resolve the FCC's inquiries.
""This transaction puts our business on a solid financial path,"" said EchoStar CEO Hamid Akhavan, adding it continues to evaluate strategic opportunities for its remaining spectrum portfolio.
U.S. satellite TV provider DirecTV terminated its agreement to acquire EchoStar's satellite television business last year, which includes rival Dish TV, over a failed debt-exchange offer.
In May, AT&T clinched a deal to acquire Lumen Technologies' consumer fiber operations for $5.75 billion in cash.
AT&T's bundled plans that combine high-speed fiber with mobile offerings have resonated well with customers as rivals like T-Mobile and Verizon double down on promotions.",4940a90b449015f6f3406b11d50dfd22,trafilatura,2634,0

Treasury yields : Trump says he firing Fed Governor Lisa Cook,2025-08-26 09:30:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened on Tuesday with short-term yields falling and long-term yields rising after U.S. President Donald Trump moved to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank's board.
The 2-year yield was more than 4 basis points lower at 3.685%, while the 30-year yield added more than 2 basis points to 4.911%. The 10-year Treasury yield was less than 2 basis points lower at 4.26%. One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.
Investors bet on lower rates in the near future, but higher rates over the long-term after Trump chipped away at the Fed's independence by announcing the removal of Cook from her position via a post on his platform, Truth Social.
The president cited allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook made false statements on one or more of her mortgage agreements.
Cook will sue her removal by Trump, with her attorney saying in a statement Tuesday that the president has ""no authority"" to do so. Cook had said in a statement Monday evening that Trump ""purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so."" Cook, who is the first Black woman to become a Fed Governor, also said: ""I will not resign"" and that she will continue to serve in her role.
""The President is going to remake the Board Governors of the Federal Reserve over the next year, and he's doing so in very unconventional ways – we've had a resignation and now a termination, opening the door to accelerate this change,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. ""Trump has essentially usurped the Fed's forward guidance function for the time being and telling markets lower rates are coming, which is being manifest in a steeper yield curve, with short term treasuries dropping like a rock.""
And so investors bet perhaps the Fed would be less attentive to inflation in the future, making ownership of long-term bonds less favorable and sending those rates lower. The U.S. dollar declined vs. various currencies for a similar reason.
Investors also parsed through a raft of economic reports Tuesday. July's U.S. durable goods orders reading was better than economists polled by Dow Jones had expected. Consumer confidence data for August also came in stronger than expected.
They will now look to the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, later in the week for clues as to whether inflation is in a place where it would make sense for the central bank to lower rates, regardless of the political encroachment by Trump.",9deff22bcc33d4b1e0a2282e112a421d,trafilatura,2632,0

The Bangemall deposits are located in the Gascoyne region.
They cover approximately 1,230km² across the Edmund and Collier basins. These areas are intruded by Kulkatharra Dolerite sills from the Warakurna Large Igneous Province.
In February 2025, Miramar reported the discovery of disseminated nickel and copper sulphides during co-funded reverse circulation (RC) drilling at Mount Vernon.
SMMO managing director Jiro Uesugi said: “We believe the Bangemall project has significant potential for Ni-Cu-PGE [nickel, copper and platinum group elements] mineralisation, and we look forward to working with Miramar's strong technical team as the project operator, as well as looking forward in anticipation to the results that can be delivered.”
The JV agreement includes five exploration licences held by MQ Minerals, a Miramar subsidiary.
As part of the agreement, Sumitomo Metal Mining will reimburse Miramar around A$275,000 ($178,296) for its share of an ongoing magnetic versatile time domain electromagnetic (VTEM) survey, co-funded by the Exploration Incentive Scheme.
Sumitomo Metal Mining must commit to a minimum expenditure of A$600,000 within 36 months before it can withdraw. To earn a 60% interest, Sumitomo Metal Mining plans to invest A$2.5m over three years.
Further investments could allow Sumitomo Metal Mining to increase its stake through staged expenditures and completion of a feasibility study.
Sumitomo Metal Mining, with more than 300 years of experience in mine development and operation, manages the Hishikari Mine in Japan and has interests in various global mining ventures.
Miramar executive chairman Allan Kelly said: “We are looking for mafic intrusion-hosted Ni-Cu-PGE deposits, like the Noril’sk deposits in Russia, which are some of the world’s largest and most valuable mineral deposits of any kind.
“The Edmund and Collier Basins have been recognised by the Geological Survey of WA, Geoscience Australia and the CSIRO as having potential for Noril’sk-style mineralisation; however, Miramar is the first company to specifically target this style of mineralisation in this region.”
Miramar will manage exploration activities under the JV and will be free-carried until Sumitomo Metal Mining opts to commence pro-rata contributions after the earn-in phases. If either party's interest falls below 10%, it converts automatically to a 2% net smelter return royalty.",f6a933f487a91ecb6c56ba3d9b851974,trafilatura,2630,0

Wynn Resorts, Limited (WYNN) presents an attractive investment opportunity due to its premium offerings, growth initiatives in the UAE, and potential upside from Macau as the market recovers. Wynn operates luxury integrated resorts in Las Vegas, Macau, and Boston, with a focus on high-end customers that allows it to command higher room rates and gaming revenue per visitor, providing resilience during macroeconomic downturns.
The company is developing its first UAE casino, Wynn Al Marjan, through a joint venture, featuring over 1,500 rooms, mass-market and VIP gaming, premium dining, and luxury retail. Positioned to serve Dubai residents, Ras Al Khaimah vacationers, and international visitors, the resort is on track to open in early 2027, and current valuations appear to assign minimal value to this project, offering significant upside potential. Wynn also benefits from its Macau operations, where gaming revenues remain below pre-pandemic levels, creating historically low valuations that offer compelling risk/reward. Recent data suggests a rebound, with June gross gaming revenues up double digits year-over-year, indicating improving Chinese tourism and discretionary spending.
The stock’s trough valuations at the time of purchase, combined with underappreciated growth projects like Wynn Al Marjan and the recovery potential in Macau, support a strong multi-year upside, with the potential to double over the next five years. Additionally, Wynn’s high-quality, five-star resorts could be attractive to strategic acquirers, further enhancing the company’s optionality. Overall, Wynn’s combination of premium positioning, underappreciated growth opportunities, and Macau market upside makes it a differentiated and compelling investment in the global gaming and luxury resort sector.

Amid these dynamics, investors are increasingly focusing on dividend yields as a stable source of income, particularly in the volatile retail sector. This backdrop sets the stage for Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) upcoming earnings announcement and its implications for dividend-seeking investors.
Kohl’s will release earnings results for the second quarter, before the opening bell on Wednesday, Aug. 27.
Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at 30 cents per share, down from 59 cents per share in the year-ago period. Kohl’s projects to report quarterly revenue at $3.37 billion, compared to $3.52 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.
On August 21, Telsey Advisory Group analyst Dana Telsey maintained a Market Perform rating for Kohl’s and a $9 price target.
With the recent buzz around Kohl’s, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Kohl’s offers an annual dividend yield of 3.58%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 12 cents per share (48 cents a year).
To figure out how to earn $500 monthly from Kohl’s, we start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months).
Next, we take this amount and divide it by Kohl’s $0.50 dividend: $6,000 / $0.48 = 12,500 shares.
So, an investor would need to own approximately $174,375 worth of Kohl’s, or 12,500 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500.
Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $0.48 = 2,500 shares, or $34,875 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100.
Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.
The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change.
For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60).
Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40).
Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease.",e1dba97c255b087a8fd33798e472c13f,trafilatura,2625,0

""A governor of the Federal Reserve literally signs her name and commits mortgage fraud, right?"" Lutnick said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" a day after Trump told Cook he was ousting her from the central bank.
""It's alleged that she's committed mortgage fraud, and she says 'I'm not going anywhere,'"" Lutnick said.
""Well, the crook always says 'I'm not going anywhere.'""
Cook said Monday night that Trump ""has no authority"" to fire her because he lacked any legal cause to do so.
""I will not resign,"" said Cook, who has not been charged or convicted of any crime.
She has hired high-powered Washington, D.C., attorney Abbe Lowell to fight her ouster. The Supreme Court could end up resolving the dispute.
CNBC has requested comment from Lowell on Lutnick's statements about Cook.
The Justice Department is investigating Cook after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte alleged she made false statements on applications for home mortgages.
Pulte has echoed Trump's criticisms of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the central bank for refusing to lower interest rates. Cook has been among the governors voting to hold rates steady.
Lutnick on Tuesday said, ""The real question should be, did she commit mortgage fraud?""
""Yes or no, and if you did commit mortgage fraud, please get out of the federal government,"" he said. ""Get out of the seat of the governor of the Federal Reserve and go away. You don't deserve to be there if you've committed mortgage fraud, right?""
Lutnick said he did not know who had the authority to halt Cook from being paid, or to turn off her physical access to the Fed.
And he punted when asked if Trump would try to fire Powell for cause if the Fed chair did not cut off Cook's pay and building access.
""These are all 'what-if scenarios,'"" Lutnick said.
""The answer is, the Department of Justice will go take this on and deal with this,"" he said.
""But the fact is, if this woman committed mortgage fraud, she should be respectful to the United States of America, to the Federal Reserve, where she says she cared about them, and she should go off into the sunset and hope to God the police don't follow her, right?""
""I mean, imagine anyone in the Cabinet who did this. You guys would be calling for their head,"" Lutnick said.
""This woman should go away if she's committed to mortgage fraud, and those signatures sure as heck look like hers.""",f9e8b3ba4a8e1ad3871caa442db5846b,trafilatura,2622,0

(Reuters) -The Trump administration's tariffs have raised manufacturing costs for the $50 billion U.S. heavy-duty truck industry, prompting companies to consider sourcing more components from Mexico to benefit from concessions under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
U.S. truck manufacturers currently face 50% tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and copper derivatives under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. In addition, manufacturers like Bellevue, Washington-based Paccar are hit with tariffs on every non-USMCA-compliant part they import.
Rivals including Daimler Truck and Traton sidestep these levies by building in Mexico, giving them an edge on costs over companies that are manufacturing in the U.S.
The USMCA pact allows goods to move duty-free between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, provided they meet certain regional sourcing rules. Under the pact, at least 64% of a heavy truck's value must originate in North America, via parts like engines and axles, raw materials such as steel or assembly labor. That threshold will rise to 70% in 2027.
Sweden's Volvo and its subsidiary Mack Trucks produce their vehicles for the U.S. market domestically at their plants in Dublin, Virginia and Macungie, Pennsylvania, respectively.
""Trucks built in the U.S. are actually disadvantaged today compared to trucks built in Mexico,"" a spokesperson at Volvo's North American unit said.
In April, the company boosted its planned Mexico plant investment by $300 million to $1 billion, aiming to support its U.S. operations.
Tariffs on imported components put trucks assembled in the U.S. at a 3% cost premium compared with USMCA-compliant models built in Mexico, brokerage Bernstein said.
""Companies with a higher manufacturing footprint in the U.S. than in Mexico are at a relative cost disadvantage and this is the complete antithesis of what the Trump administration wants,"" said Chad Dillard, senior analyst, Bernstein.
ACT Research forecast production to dip 11% year-on-year in 2026 to 226,600 units, with economic headwinds and weaker carrier profitability having hit the industry in 2025.
Paccar, which sells trucks under the Kenworth and Peterbilt brands, estimates $75 million in tariff costs in the third quarter. The company said its brands held a 30.4% market share in the first half of 2025.
Daimler's first-quarter gross margin of 21.96% was higher than Paccar's 18.69%.
Paccar declined to comment for this story. CEO Preston Feight said in a recent earnings call that the company was working with suppliers to boost USMCA-certified parts imports to cut long-term tariff exposure.",2cf8bcb5eaf7d9fe0e350f4d1f5c3b7e,trafilatura,2619,0

AER chair Clare Savage noted that the profile of energy generation in Australia has shifted considerably, with rooftop solar output climbing by 13% to 23GW and home battery installations surging by 62% during 2024, compared to 2023.
Savage said: “By the end of the year, renewable technologies including rooftop solar, solar farms, wind, hydro and batteries made up 60% of the National Electricity Market’s generation capacity and contributed 39% of generation output, representing a significant increase over the past decade.”
These developments reflect an evolving system where weather, shifting demand, outages, and a diverse generation mix are increasingly influencing the wholesale market, leading to heightened price volatility.
The report details how wholesale market conditions between July and September 2024 showcased this volatility.
During this period, high wind generation resulted in a record number of negative price events while low generation and network outages led to spikes in prices, compared to the same quarter in 2023.
Concurrently, energy consumers are adapting their behaviour, using less grid electricity, becoming more energy efficient, and generating their own power through solar systems and batteries.
This transition is steering the energy system away from a supply-side focus to one that accommodates two-way electricity flows and distributed generation.
Network operation and maintenance costs, which are passed on to consumers, saw a decrease of A$270m ($175.1m) (2.1%) in the 12 months to 30 June 2024, translating to an average saving of A$36 per electricity customer compared to 2023.
The gas market is also recording a transition, with domestic gas use on a long-term decline. In 2024, households and small commercial customers made up 36% of domestic gas demand.
Gas spot market prices in 2024 were, on average, comparable to those in 2023, with lower prices in the first half of the year and higher prices in the latter half.
Retail electricity price movements varied, with median market offers for residential customers ranging from a 5% drop in South Australia to a 4% increase in Queensland as of 31 March 2025 compared to 31 March 2024. For gas, offers ranged from an 18% slump in Queensland to a 3% increase in Victoria.

The lackluster price action reflected both weak corporate demand and persistent ETF outflows, as Bitcoin ETFs shed $1.2 billion over the week without logging a single day of inflows.
However, fresh signals from Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, suggest this lull in institutional appetite may be close to reversing. In a cryptic post on X published around noon Sunday, Saylor wrote “Bitcoin is on Sale,” accompanied by an image showing his firm’s recent BTC acquisitions.
According to SaylorTracker, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings have now reached 629,376 BTC, valued at approximately $72.3 billion, with profits climbing to $25.9 billion at press time. The possibility of renewed large-scale purchases from Saylor’s firm provides two potential tailwinds for Bitcoin price action.
First, it could restore confidence among retail traders and strategic investors discouraged by last week’s underperformance. Second, the early hint may encourage short-term traders to enter fresh bets speculating on Strategy’s imminent purchase confirmation. If these scenarios materialize, this could considerably boost market liquidity and trigger a positive BTC price reaction.
Bitcoin Price Forecast: Can Bulls Overcome Resistance Below $117,800?
Bitcoin price opened the new week on a cautious note, trading near $114,600 at press time. The daily chart shows BTC consolidating just under the middle Bollinger Band around $116,722, while resistance at the upper band near $121,713 continues to cap upside momentum.
Momentum indicators remain mixed. The Relative Strength Index is holding at 46.53, pointing to a neutral stance, neither overbought nor oversold. This leaves room for directional movement depending on whether buyers or sellers gain control in the coming sessions.
On the bullish side, a sustained close above $117,800, where more than $3 billion in short positions are clustered, would likely validate further upside toward $121,700 and potentially retest $124,000, levels last seen earlier this month. Renewed corporate demand and confirmation of MicroStrategy’s rumored purchases could serve as the catalyst for such a breakout.
Conversely, immediate downside support is seen at $111,700 near the lower Bollinger Band. A decisive drop below this threshold would risk extending losses toward the $108,000 region, where prior consolidation established a temporary floor in late July.",67f37042cc6d605e3e711eb2330469e4,trafilatura,2617,0

At age 60, he has worked hard and invested well — and he’s burned out.
He’s received wonderful guidance from his financial advisor, with whom he’d discussed the viability of his investment portfolio. But as he and I talked, it was clear that the key inputs were more nuanced than his portfolio value and asset allocation. There were lifestyle decisions, too.
Will you continue to work in some fashion?
Working longer wasn’t my friend’s first choice. But continuing to earn an income would help him worry less about his portfolio’s ability to last.
Even if he downshifted into a lower-paying or part-time position and couldn’t save as much, he’d still be forestalling portfolio withdrawals. So, when he did fully retire, he could spend without worry.
It would also help him delay Social Security. If he continued to work in a position with healthcare benefits, he could avoid paying health insurance out of pocket until Medicare coverage kicks in. And as much as his job has been exhausting him, he’s had a wonderful career and his professional life seems intertwined with his identity.
Ultimately, my friend decided to pursue a reduced schedule. At 30 hours a week, he could still maintain his healthcare coverage.
For someone else, a clean break could make sense, especially if continuing to work has implications for physical or mental health.
What lifestyle changes will you make?
We also talked through whether my friend’s spending would change when he retired.
He owns a condo in an expensive part of the US and has considered moving back to the Midwest when he retires. This would free up funds that he could plow into his portfolio but would also take him away from his social network and the center of his industry.
Staying put seems like the right call for now, especially as continuing to work is in the mix.
How flexible can you be with your spending?
This is a major dimension in our retirement income research.
If a retiree can tighten spending when the portfolio takes on losses, that improves the portfolio’s ability to last. The reason is simple: Lower portfolio spending during and after losses leaves more to recover with the market.
Our research also shows that flexible spending strategies increase total lifetime spending relative to strategies that maintain static inflation-adjusted spending, like the 4% guideline.
My friend is willing to adjust his spending as he goes. He’s not a big spender, and years of work travel mean that he’s not interested in expensive globe-trotting, unlike many new retirees.",a6d3e6672a6129bb1f2dfe681c692024,trafilatura,2617,0

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The dollar advanced against major currencies on Monday, bouncing from a steep fall last week that followed remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that boosted expectations for a rate cut next month.
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.49% to 98.32, and was on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since July 30, with the euro down 0.69% at $1.1634, after hitting a four-week high of $1.174225 on Friday.
Major brokerages, including Barclays, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, expect a 25-basis-point Fed rate cut in September following Powell's remarks on Friday when he said risks to the U.S. jobs market were rising, although he also said inflation remained a threat.
""While Powell and company are undoubtedly still leaning toward cutting interest rates next month, the combination of this week’s Core PCE report, next week’s NFP release, and August’s CPI data could still sway the central bank toward holding off if they unanimously point to higher inflation and a weakening jobs outlook,"" said Matt Weller, global head of market research at StoneX.
""In other words, forex traders are realizing that a September rate cut isn’t quite a done deal yet, and traders are hedging their bets against the potential for a split decision to hold rates unchanged for another month, leading to a modest but broad-based recovery in the U.S. dollar.""
Traders were pricing in an 84.3% chance for a cut of at least a quarter-point at the Federal Reserve's September meeting, down slightly from the 84.7% in the prior session, according to CME's FedWatch tool but well above the 61.9% expectation a month ago.
Measured against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar has weakened by more than 9% this year. The euro has been the lead gainer in the basket with a climb of more than 12%.
Samy Chaar, chief economist at Lombard Odier, expects the euro to strengthen to about $1.20-$1.22 over the next six-to-12 months.
Meanwhile, euro zone bond yields moved higher on Monday, reversing a fall from late last week as traders reassessed their expectations for the Fed and the impact on Europe. They also processed data showing an uptick in German business morale.
Germany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, rose 3.9 basis points to 2.758%, nearing a five-month peak of 2.787% hit last week.
U.S. Treasury yields were also slightly higher across the curve as traders calibrated positioning. The two-year Treasury yield, especially sensitive to interest rate expectations, was last up 4 basis points at 3.728%.",fad10fc767e8ceacd34ebef6846bddac,trafilatura,2616,0

According to the asset finance business, the investment will enable the purchase of a Trimble MX60 Pro mobile mapping system, which includes high-resolution dual spherical and pavement cameras, a high-speed scanner, software licences and training.
The transaction was coordinated via GSM Finance broker Roger Wood, who engaged with Thomas Edwards from UTB’s Asset Finance team and senior underwriter Oliver Hobday.
Despite challenges in the credit assessment, including a shortfall in collateral, the bank proceeded with the funding based on the overall strength of the credit proposal and the existing professional rapport between the broker and the bank's representatives.
GSM Finance business development director Roger Wood said: “This wasn’t a typical asset, but once UTB had agreed to consider the proposal, it was a pleasure to work with Thomas and Oliver in getting the deal through.
“The finance was all set up and ready to go when my client wanted to finalise their purchase, and this investment enables them to continue their growth plans.”
Edwards stated: “This is one of the more unusual assets we have funded since expanding our credit appetite to include a much wider range of equipment, media technology and machinery.
“Once Roger and I had discussed what the customer wanted to purchase and established that it was a deal we might be able to support, Oliver Hobday and Roger spoke directly, enabling Oliver to get a full story of the proposal and the customer.”
Last month, the bank completed a refinancing deal valued at £625,000, which was aimed at aiding a transport company's acquisition of a coach operator.
The deal, initiated by Mike Austin of Crystal Business Finance, involved the refinancing of assets from both the client's fleet and the acquired company, with UTB’s Paul Barter playing a key role in the transaction.

Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the Truth Social media platform, announced Tuesday that it was partnering with the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com to form a company that holds CRO, a token created by Crypto.com. A blank check company tied to Yorkville Advisors is another co-founder of the new firm, called Trump Media CRO Strategy.
Trump Media said it plans to purchase $105 million worth of CRO. Yorkville said the total expected funding for the company's treasury will be $1 billion worth of CRO, or about 19% of the token's market cap, plus $420 million in cash and equivalents and as a $5 billion line of credit.
The announcement is part of the hottest trend in crypto, in which a wide variety of companies – many with no obvious ties to the world of digital assets – have made buying and holding cryptocurrency a primary part of their business plan. The model is based on MicroStrategy, a tech firm that first started buying bitcoin in 2020 and has seen its stock price soar.
“Companies of all sizes and sectors are strategically planning for the future by establishing digital asset treasuries anchored by assets that have created a comprehensive value proposition and are poised for even greater utility,” Devin Nunes, the chairman and CEO of Trump Media, said in a statement.
Trump Media said it plans to introduce a “rewards system” on Truth Social that uses Crypto.com digital wallet infrastructure. CRO saw its price jump Tuesday morning by about 30% to 21 cents a token. It’s still far off from its all-time high of nearly 97 cents a token that it hit in 2021.
Expanding Crypto Empire
Since taking office, the Trump administration has pushed for crypto-friendly regulations and laws, while the Trump family has aggressively sought to expand its crypto-related businesses.
That unprecedented dynamic has led to allegations of corruption from Democrats, though the president says he has entrusted the management of his business dealings to his sons.
In May, Trump rewarded top investors in his meme coin with a swanky dinner. Trump launched the coin just days before taking office. Fans of the president have also been able to buy crypto-themed Trump merchandise, including $100,000 watches and pricey sneakers.
Trump Media previously announced plans to hold a significant amount of bitcoin on its books as well as to create an exchange-traded fund tied to the prices of five popular cryptocurrencies.",ee5ca7016244c4bd021453c9cd808605,trafilatura,2603,0

The food and drinks major is moving from five operating ""geographies"" to three to give the company ""even greater focus and agility"", CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique said.
From January, Danone will run its operations through the three regions of EMEA, Asia Pacific and the Americas.
The Activia maker operates through five regions of Europe, Latin America, North America, AMEA (Asia, Middle East, and Africa) and a combined China, north Asia and Oceania business.
In a statement issued today (26 August), the Evian bottled water owner said the reorganisation will improve its “agility and market impact”.
The new structure sees Pablo Perversi, Bruno Chevot, and Henri Bruxelles appointed as presidents of Danone's operations in EMEA, APAC and the Americas, respectively from the start of the year.
All three will report to Véronique Penchienati-Bosetta, one of two deputy CEOs at Danone. She is responsible for geographies and categories.
Bruxelles will also retain his responsibilities for joint ventures and partners, Danone said.
Christian Stammkoetter, the president of Danone's AMEA business, will depart from Danone after 19 years to pursue a “new challenge”.
“As part of the next chapter of our Renew Danone strategy, we have decided to further accelerate our transformation, with a more compact and simpler organisation at the top of the company,” de Saint-Affrique said.
The Danone CEO launched his so-called Renew strategy in 2022 to improve the company's business performance.
Last year, the Alpro maker generated sales of €27.4bn, which represented a like-for-like increase of 4.3%. Recurring underlying EPS grew 2.5% to €3.63.
Free cash flow was €3bn for the 2024 financial year, up €400m from the prior year.
“We want to move to the front foot on acquisitions,” de Saint-Affrique said in February when Danone announced its 2024 results.
Notably, the company has been in a drawn-out process to try and fully acquire Lifeway Foods since last September, when it sought to increase its 23% minority stake.
The US company rejected the offer in November before the Paris-headquartered company upped its price, only to be turned down again.
Earlier this month, Danone signed an NDA with Lifeway Foods to allow it to weigh up whether to make another bid for the US kefir business.
The terms of the NDA “restrict the ability of Danone” to publicly make further acquisition proposals, attempt to remove anyone from Lifeway’s board or participate in any consent solicitation not recommended by the US company.",ba0f471936bc9413169e57836ec5d343,trafilatura,2602,0

JAKARTA (Reuters) -The United States has agreed in principle to exempt Indonesian exports of cocoa, palm oil and rubber from the 19% tariff imposed by President Donald Trump since August 7, Indonesia's top trade negotiator said on Tuesday.
The exemption will take effect once both sides reach a final agreement, but no timeline has been set because the U.S. is busy in tariff talks with other countries, Airlangga Hartarto, who is also the chief economic minister, told Reuters.
The two countries also discussed potential U.S. investment in fuel storage in Indonesia in partnership with the Southeast Asian nation's sovereign wealth fund Danantara and state energy firm Pertamina, Airlangga said in an interview.
""We are waiting for their response, but during the meeting, basically, the principal (exemption) has been agreed for products not produced in the U.S., such as palm oil and cocoa and rubber ... it will be zero or close to zero,"" he added.
The U.S. embassy in Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Indonesia is the world's biggest exporter of palm oil and a major rubber supplier.
CERTAINTY ON TARIFFS
Indonesia, the region's largest economy, was among the first nations to strike a tariff deal with Trump in July, but Jakarta ended up facing the same rate as some other countries, such as Thailand and Malaysia, and just below Vietnam's figure of 20%.
During the talks, Indonesia offered billions of dollars worth of investment in the U.S. and purchases of American crude, LPG, planes and farm products. It also promised zero tariffs on almost all U.S. goods entering its market.
Airlangga said certainty over U.S. tariffs and recent progress in talks about a free trade agreement with the European Union could boost Indonesia's economic growth, helping the government reach a 5.4% target for 2026, up from an estimate of about 5% this year.
""They bring an optimistic perception from the global market since most investors are looking for certainty and Indonesia is one of the countries that provide global certainty,"" he said.
Jakarta wants to draw foreign investors to help develop industrial facilities, particularly in the processing of its key commodities, Airlangga said, replicating the success the country has seen in bringing Chinese investment into nickel projects.
Airlangga said the government is also keen to boost investment in silica sand processing, including the production of solar panels and wafers for semiconductors.

Dive Brief:
-
Macy’s Media Network will launch a pilot with Amazon Retail Ads Service, enabling partners to purchase ads on its website through the Amazon Ads console and other APIs, according to a company announcement.
-
Through the program, advertisers will be able to manage Macy’s sponsored products campaigns alongside other retail media investments using familiar workflows and reporting and measurement tools.
-
The pilot, which will launch in early Q4 in time for the holiday season, will not affect self-serve or managed campaigns already being run through Macy’s Media Network.
Dive Insight:
The collaboration leverages features Amazon introduced in January, enabling it to serve as a third-party provider of ad-serving and reporting capabilities for retailers. Through the offering, named Amazon Retail Ad Service, outside partners can use Amazon’s ad-targeting and measurement tools on their own websites and in their apps, thus providing advertisers better data regarding real-time availability, pricing and contextual information such as search queries and browsing behavior.
Amazon’s Retail Ad Service product was met with some skepticism due to concerns from many retailers about data privacy and control. Macy’s service will operate on dedicated systems with access controls, and the company would maintain full control over its ad experience, per the release.
In addition to enabling campaign management through the Amazon Ads console, the partnership also opens up placements on Macy’s Media Network on retail media platforms like Pacvue. Pacvue President Melissa Burdick called the deal “a pivotal shift in retail media” that will “drive immediate scale, performance and efficiency,” in a statement issued by Macy’s in support of the deal.
Macy’s also said the collaborative partnership was a way for the company to help advertisers seamlessly scale their reach to the retailer’s engaged audience and form more meaningful connections with online shoppers.
Retail media networks play a major role in companies’ holiday marketing strategies. While the market has been cooling, eMarketer predicted U.S. retail media ad spending will hit $62 billion this year. Last year, the channel recorded 75 billion total impressions in Q4, up 4% over the previous year, according to Sensor Tower. However, because Amazon is so large as a media player that it effectively stands in its own category, it was not included in Sensor Tower's data.",7d401b123aa97cb0431e702bd7ee7841,trafilatura,2593,0

The Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration average weekly retail price fell 0.5 cents/gallon Monday, posted Tuesday, to $3.708/g. The total of the five declines is relatively modest, just 10.4 cts/g. That takes the price down to its current level from $3.812/g posted July 21, which at the time had been the highest DOE/EIA price in a little more than a year.
It is just another step in a period of relative oil price stability in the midst of highly volatile markets for equities and other assets. Petroleum has been trading in a fairly tight range for several weeks, with demand soft but not collapsing and the flood of oil from OPEC and non-OPEC countries that has been anticipated not yet showing up in huge numbers.
Brent crude, the global benchmark, settled between $65/barrel and $67/b for 11 consecutive days on the CME commodity exchange, with that streak ending Wednesday. It settled Monday at $68.80/b.
With the usual lag in retail prices, the downward drift in the DOE/EIA number is catching up to a decline in futures prices from late July levels. Ultra low sulfur diesel on the CME commodity exchange settled at $2.4491/g on July 29. That slide bottomed August 15 at $2.2215/g.
But with a settlement Monday at $2.3427/g, the five-week drop may have run its course.
If there is any other concern for higher prices in the market, it is coming from the Midwest. Refinery problems at the 435,000 barrel/day Whiting, Indiana refinery operated by BP is sending retail gasoline prices higher.
Operating issues at Whiting, one of the country’s largest refineries, has sent the price of gasoline soaring in the Midwest. For example, the daily average retail gasoline price posted by the American Automobile Association for Michigan was $3.352/g on Tuesday. A week ago it was less than $3.10/g. It also increased more than 14 cts/g from Monday.
Similar increases were reported for other Midwest states affected by the loss of output from the Whiting facility.
However, that has not spread to diesel. The AAA average for Michigan was $3.711/g a week ago. On Tuesday, it was $3.718/g.
It is unclear why gasoline is being affected to such a large degree while diesel has been unscathed so far. The fires at Whiting were in crude units, the first step in turning crude into products like gasoline and diesel. A problem in a crude unit can cause issues with output of gasoline, diesel and all other refined products.",309a48a41ac4d3d2a73ae9d070207fd2,trafilatura,2586,0

The Fed did not answer CNBC's question about whether Cook is working at her office on Tuesday or remotely.
If Cook does sue, the case could end up being decided by the Supreme Court.
The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 says that a president can fire a member of the Federal Reserve Board only ""for cause.""
That has long been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty while a board member.
The Justice Department last week opened a criminal investigation of Cook after she was accused of making false statements on home mortgage applications by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte.
Pulte pointed to documents that Cook allegedly signed for properties in Michigan and Georgia saying they were each her primary residence, which he claimed was done ""in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.""
The documents would have been signed before Cook joined the Fed.
Trump cited those allegations on Monday night in a letter to Cook notifying her of her removal.
Cook responded Monday, saying in a statement, ""President Trump purported to fire me 'for cause' when no cause exists under the law, and he has no authority to do so.""
""I will not resign,"" she said. ""I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.""

The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
The healthcare solutions provider plans to use this investment to power its expansion in existing markets, particularly Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
The company is also exploring entry into new markets across the region.
Fullerton Health operates in nine markets across the Asia-Pacific.
It owns and manages third-party administrators, health maintenance organisations, primary care, specialist care and ancillary care clinics, diagnostic imaging centres, executive health screening centres, and corporate in-house clinics.
The company expects growth driven by demand from corporate clients and insurers for cost containment and maintaining care standards.
Fullerton Health intends to use its regional footprint and digital and AI capabilities to introduce regional and local solutions via an integrated platform.
The latest move follows a series of minority investments, including that of Far East Drug.
Fullerton Health group CEO and executive director Ho Kuen Loon said: “This partnership reflects strong alignment between Mitsubishi Corporation and our existing shareholders on the long-term value and industry leadership potential of Fullerton Health.
“With a shared commitment to impact and innovation, we are well-positioned to achieve our aim to positively impact 10 million lives in the coming years.
“We will do this by scaling sustainably, strengthening our market leadership, and delivering greater value to all our stakeholders.”
Meanwhile, in a statement, Mitsubishi highlighted Southeast Asia’s societal challenges, including rising healthcare costs due to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases.
With limited public health insurance, employers often provide private health insurance as an employee benefit.
This scenario has made optimising medical expenses while maintaining care standards a priority for companies.

France's CAC 40 index plummeted more than 2% in early deals before paring losses to around 1.6% by the end of the trading session. The country's three main opposition parties said they would not back a surprise confidence vote called by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on Monday for Sept. 8 over his budget plans.
Bayrou argues around 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in budget cuts are needed to reduce the French deficit, which totaled 5.8% of GDP in 2024, with his proposals including freezing welfare spending, pensions and tax brackets.
Erik Nelson, head of G10 FX strategy at Wells Fargo, called the outlook for French assets ""not great"" — but said the outcome for Bayrou's government was not a foregone conclusion.
""I think part of the issue here is that European equities, the euro itself, have been a very popular momentum trade throughout the year. What we're seeing in the last couple of days has been a little bit of unwind.""
""I don't know that Bayrou is definitely out. There's still some uncertainty there. He's got a lot of things he can offer the opposition,"" Nelson continued, including that the French minister could back away from a contentious proposal to cut two public holidays.
""They're walking a very fine line here, and ... given where market positioning is in European assets, there's a lot of risks.""
Fed drama
Broader European markets were also lower as global investors monitored U.S. President Donald Trump's latest attempted intervention in the running of the Federal Reserve.
The U.K.'s FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX were down 0.7% and 0.4%, respectively.
Trump's announcement on social media that he had fired Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook drove Asia-Pacific markets lower overnight. Cook said in a Monday statement that Trump did not have the authority to remove her and that she ""will not resign,"" leaving a legal dispute a potential next step.
It follows months of pressure by Trump on the central bank to lower interest rates, including repeated criticism of and threats to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell.
Markets rallied late last week after Powell gave a speech which spurred investors to price in a September rate cut by the Fed.

I was sad to have missed the Monterey Car Week this year, especially because there were a number of reveals I was interested in, including the all-electric Cadillac Opulent Velocity; the Chevrolet Corvette CX and CX.R Vision Gran Turismo concepts; and Lucid Gravity X reveals. But alas, the sprawling, Champagne-soaked grounds of Quail or the sea of seersucker suits and wide-brimmed hats at Pebble Beach Golf Course were suboptimal landscapes for my newly fractured and boot-encased foot. Next year!
In the meantime, I thought I would reach out to you, dear reader, to get your forecast on what’s in store for automakers and EV sales in the United States once the federal EV tax credit expires September 30.
My prediction? Well I don’t really want to taint the results, but I will say this: Automakers are going to have to do something in the short term to attract customers, and not just because of the expiring EV tax credit.
A little bird
Serve Robotics, the autonomous sidewalk delivery robot company, announced earlier this week that it acquired Vayu Robotics, a startup that has developed AI foundation models and a simulation-powered data engine for robots. The companies didn’t disclose the terms of the deal, but some back-of-the-envelope math and a little bird helped me determine that Serve Robotics paid between $45 million and $50 million for Vayu.

Several weeks ago, I highlighted a deal between Uber, autonomous vehicle tech startup Nuro, and EV maker Lucid. You can read about that here, but the important piece to remember is Uber’s commitment to make an undisclosed “multimillion-dollar” investment into Nuro. (Sources told me it is more than the $300 million Uber invested in Lucid.)
Nuro has now raised more money in a Series E round that has reached $203 million from a group of new investors that includes Nvidia, existing backer Baillie Gifford, Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, and Pledge Ventures. And a portion of Uber’s investment has gone toward the Series E round.

The five-year ETH-USD price chart from TradingView shows a clean, multi-year breakout: ETH has finally vaulted the 2021 high after a long consolidation, leaving no historical overhead levels to lean on.
This is what traders call price discovery — the market is printing new highs with only psychology and order flow to guide it rather than prior chart resistance.
The 5-day view fills in the tape action. After a fast run from the mid-$4,700s, ETH pushed through $4,900 and reached an intraday high around $4,946.90. At the time of the chart snapshot — 6:48 p.m. UTC — the last price was about $4,941.57. That sequence signals buyers absorbed supply near the old ceiling and then forced a fresh high, a classic breakout pattern.
Analyst Miles Deutsher summed up the leadership shift as “BTC is exhausted, ETH isn’t.” In plain English, he is flagging relative momentum: bitcoin’s rallies have stalled near recent highs while ether just broke into price discovery.
When a market says one asset is “exhausted,” it usually means upside attempts are fading, follow-through is weak, and sellers keep meeting pushes higher; “isn’t” means the opposite — stronger follow-through, fresh highs, and active dip-buying. Traders often rotate toward the asset showing higher relative strength when the other leader tires.
Crypto Rover focused on supply on exchanges. “Exchange reserves” refers to coins held in wallets controlled by centralized trading venues.
When those balances trend down, fewer coins are immediately available to sell. If demand rises as liquid supply thins, price can accelerate because buyers must bid higher to coax coins off-exchange back into circulation. That is the mechanic behind his “supply shock” phrasing — not a guarantee of straight-up prices, but a setup where scarcity can magnify moves once momentum starts.
Michaël van de Poppe offered a risk check. He highlighted the unusually large weekly candle and cautioned that weekend breakouts often retrace when liquidity normalizes early in the week.
The idea is simple: weekend order books can be thinner, so moves extend more easily; when fuller participation returns on Monday, prices sometimes retest the breakout area to confirm it as support before trending again. In practice, that means a pullback toward the breakout zone would not, by itself, negate the larger bullish break you see on the 5-year chart.",aa4934fcc5cf5f5857f198126718559b,trafilatura,2541,0

In the UK, Chick-fil-A plans to open its first restaurant in Leeds as part of a commitment to establish five locations by 2027.
The company has announced an investment of more than $100m in the UK market in the decade to 2034.
The Leeds restaurant, to open in autumn 2025, will be led by local owner-operator Mike Hoy, a London native with experience in the restaurant industry.
Chick-fil-A's expansion into Singapore, which marks its entry into Asia, will commence in late 2025, with a projected ten-year investment of $75m.
Chyn Koh, a Singapore native with a career in the restaurant industry, will serve as the local owner-operator.
Chick-fil-A CEO Andrew Cathy stated: “Expanding in both Europe and Asia is a meaningful milestone for Chick-fil-A. The investments we are making in the UK and Singapore not only present opportunities for our business but are also a chance for us to bring what makes Chick-fil-A special to new places – great food and remarkable hospitality, our unique franchise model and the positive impact we have in communities.”
The brand's local owner-operator model is integral to its operational strategy.
These owner-operators are small, independent business owners dedicated to supporting their team members and contributing positively to their communities.
More than 200,000 team members are employed by local owner-operators across more than 3,000 restaurants in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico.
In early 2025, Chick-fil-A announced plans to establish five to seven new restaurants in British Columbia, Canada, by 2030, with the first location expected between late 2027 and early 2028.
The brand aims to open eight restaurants across Ontario and Alberta in 2025 - the highest number of openings in Canada since its market entry in 2019, and has launched 22 restaurants across Canada since 2020.

Under the deal, Energy Fuels will supply high-purity neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) and dysprosium (Dy) oxides to Vulcan later this year for testing and future magnet production. The oxides will be refined at its White Mesa Mill in Utah using mineral concentrates from Florida and Georgia.
Rare-earth magnets are essential for satellites, defense systems, artificial intelligence infrastructure, robotics, and electric vehicles. By securing domestic sources, the companies aim to reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese supply chains. After validation, they expect to negotiate long-term supply agreements.

Energy Fuels operates the only U.S. facility capable of processing monazite mineral concentrates into separated rare-earth oxides. The company began commercial-scale NdPr production in 2024 and is piloting heavier oxides, including Dy and terbium, to expand output.
Vulcan CEO John Maslin said the agreement will onshore one of the most important supply chains for America’s future economy and security. Energy Fuels CEO Mark S. Chalmers described it as a first step toward developing a secure Western rare-earth magnet industry.
Energy Fuels has rallied more than 146% in 2025, fueled in part by Cathie Wood’s investment push into nuclear power as a cornerstone of the future energy mix. Her ARK Invest thesis has drawn fresh attention to the company’s uranium and rare-earth operations, which position it at the crossroads of clean energy and advanced technology.
Energy Fuels is uniquely placed to supply nuclear fuel for power generation and rare-earth materials vital to AI data centers, defense systems, and electric vehicles. This dual capability has strengthened the stock’s bull case.

The order, the largest in the Korean air carrier's history, includes a mix of 787s, 777s and 737 Boeing airplanes worth about $36.5 billion.
Reuters first reported the deal earlier Monday.
Korean Air also announced a separate deal Monday with GE on the purchase and maintenance of engines valued at $13.7 billion.
Many countries negotiating trade deals with the Trump administration have announced or plan to announce significant Boeing airplane orders. Boeing has won a string of major orders in recent months.
Korean Air CEO Cho Won-tae, who recently visited one of Boeing's U.S. factories, told Reuters Monday the record-breaking order will help the largest Korean airline expand to more U.S., Latin American and South American destinations.
Cho said about half of the new order of 103 planes would be 737 MAX 10 planes and the rest would be a mix of 777-9 and 787 airplanes. About 80% of the new Boeing planes would replace existing airplanes in the fleet.
He said the company had faith in Boeing despite prior troubles the planemaker experienced.
The Boeing deal is worth $36.2 billion, South Korea's industry ministry said, in addition to the GE deal.
Boeing said the deal would help Korean Air fully integrate operations with Asiana Airlines, a subsidiary of South Korea's largest airline it acquired last year.
""As Korean Air transitions to a larger unified carrier, we are committed to supporting the airline's growth with one of the world's most efficient fleets,"" said Stephanie Pope, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Reuters the major Boeing and GE deal would boost U.S. aerospace exports.
""The world recognizes that our aircraft are the most advanced in the world, and this administration is committed to reshoring advanced manufacturing jobs for Americans,"" Lutnick said.
In March, South Korea's industry ministry said Korean Air said it would soon finalize a $32.7 billion deal for new Boeing and GE engines. Korean Air last year said it would order 20 777-9 and 20 787-10 planes from Boeing, with options for an additional 10 aircraft. The new order is separate from that purchase.
Korean Air, a founding member of the SkyTeam airline alliance, was established in 1969 when state-owned Korean Air Lines was taken over by South Korean conglomerate Hanjin Kal.",14a97c81de9d7224cec1cc9d5cf740a7,trafilatura,2527,0

Revenue grew by 20.4% year-on-year to $11.2 billion from $9.3 billion, while adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) surged 21.4% to $3.03 billion from $2.5 billion.
Worldwide container volume through the company’s ports and terminals increased 5.6% to 45.4 million twenty foot equivalent units (TEUs) for the period ending June 30.
Dubai-based DP World operates in more than 75 countries and has total container handling capacity of in excess of 102 million TEUs, or better than 9% of global port container throughput. Since 2018 it has acquired a half-dozen non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCCs), giving it freight-forwarding capabilities at 300 locations covering 90% of global trade lanes.
While DP World does not own container terminals in the United States, it is the operator of Fairview Container Terminal at Canada’s Port of Prince Rupert, a key gateway for international shipments moving to the U.S. Midwest via Canadian Pacific Railway. Fairview tonnage through July was 5.15 million metric tons, up from 4.69 million tons for the same period in 2024.
The company’s container volume through the Americas/Australia region grew 7.9% to 6.87 million TEUs in the first half of the year.
EBITDA margin improved to 27% from 26.8% y/y.
Pre-tax earnings (EBIT) rose to $1.9 billion from $1.5 billion, while profit soared to $960 million from $570 million.
“Ongoing geopolitical tensions, the continued closure of the Red Sea route, and rising uncertainty around global trade tariffs have caused significant disruption across the industry,” said DP World Group Chairman and Chief Executive Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, in a statement accompanying the earnings release. “Despite these challenges, our strategy of delivering integrated end-to-end solutions and operating critical infrastructure in key markets has allowed us to continue supporting cargo owners to move their freight and to deliver a strong set of results.”

LONDON (Reuters) -The new head of the Bank for International Settlements on Tuesday stressed the need for central banks to focus on inflation and, amid Donald Trump's escalating attacks on the Fed, for their independence to be protected.
Uncertainty surrounding the world's most important monetary authority, the Federal Reserve, has risen this year as the U.S. President has repeatedly criticised its Chair Jerome Powell and on Monday announced he was firing one of its governors, Lisa Cook.
""A clear price stability mandate, independence and accountability are the anchor, hull and mast of the monetary policy vessel,"" Pablo Hernandez de Cos, who in July took over as General Manager of BIS, often dubbed the central bankers' central bank, said in a speech in Mexico.
In his first prominent speech in the new role, de Cos did not mention Trump or the Fed directly but laid out what he described as the ""foundations"" for central bank credibility.
Independence was vital so central bankers are able to set interest rates and use tools, such as quantitative easing, ""based on economic considerations in the long-term public interest, free from short-term political interference,"" the former Bank of Spain Governor said.
He said there needed to be ""institutional, functional, personal and financial independence, all of which must be underpinned by a robust legal framework"".
Trump's interventions this year, which included him calling for Powell to be replaced and questioning the central bank's refurbishment costs, have marked an unprecedented assault on the Fed's independence.
Monday's proposed firing of Cook triggered a selloff in U.S. longer-term government debt on Tuesday, pushing the gap between 30-year yields and those on 2-year Treasuries to its widest in over three years. [US/]
De Cos also stressed the need for ""accountability"", calling it a key counterpart to independence and the factor that ""underpins the legitimacy of central bank policies.""
He pointed to how central banks had initially underestimated the post-COVID surge in inflation. That had posed a ""major test"" to monetary policy frameworks and their institutional pillars, de Cos said.
They have been largely successful bringing inflation back down since then with ""forceful"" interest rate rises, albeit after a painful cost of living shock.
He also outlined the shared challenges economies face, such as rising geopolitical tensions, debt, trade tariffs, aging populations, artificial intelligence and climate change.",0e02b0903931833c85dd5137af799d2b,trafilatura,2510,0

(Reuters) -Nvidia's business in China will be the focus of investors when the AI chipmaker reports earnings on Wednesday, following an unusual deal with the Trump administration and Beijing's subsequent efforts to stall imports.
Caught in the crossfire of Washington and Beijing's ongoing trade war, the fate of Nvidia's China business hangs on where the world's two largest economies land on tariff talks and chip trade curbs.
The artificial intelligence chip pioneer recently agreed to pay the U.S. federal government 15% of the sales it made it China in exchange for export licenses, a move that has drawn bipartisan criticism.
Beijing - despite huge appetite for Nvidia's chips in China - has urged domestic companies to limit purchases over apparent security concerns.
Reports have emerged that Nvidia has told some suppliers to suspend production of its China-special H20 chips. But Reuters has reported that Nvidia is developing a new and more powerful chip for China.
""We've got to get clarity on these two governments first, whether China wants the chips and whether the administration is going to allow it,"" said Jamie Meyers, senior analyst at Nvidia shareholder Laffer Tengler Investments. ""And if so, how is that going to work?""
Last year, China accounted for 13% of Nvidia's revenue. For the second quarter ended July 2025, many analysts did not factor in any revenue from H20 sales in that country given the US approval came late in the quarter, while China's pushback complicates forecast calculations for the year.
In May, Nvidia had said the curbs would shave off $8 billion in sales from the July quarter. The curbs led to a $4.5 billion charge in the previous three-month period.
Overall, the company is expected to report that second-quarter revenue jumped 53.2% to $46.02 billion, according to LSEG data, a far cry from the triple-digit growth it witnessed for many quarters.
But analysts said the overall AI chip business is booming, with strong demand pouring in from tech giants such as Meta and Microsoft , who have expanded their capital budgets.
Still, positive commentary on demand from CEO Jensen Huang could boost AI stocks that have sold off recently on worries that investors may be valuing them too highly.
Nvidia shares have gained more than a third so far in 2025, a smaller gain for the period than the previous two years. This still outpaces a more than 15% gain in the broader chip index and the benchmark S&P 500 Index's near 10% year-to-date rise.",be6b863c7758ee47870068002d5cb190,trafilatura,2506,0

TORONTO (Reuters) -Canada's big banks are expected to have lowered loan-loss provisions in the third quarter from the prior quarter as U.S. tariffs have likely hurt their loan portfolios less than feared.
Canada's big six banks are expected to set aside a total of C$5.22 billion in loan-loss provisions for the third quarter, compared to C$6.37 billion in the second quarter, according to data compiled by LSEG.
The banks ramped up provisions over the past few quarters, bracing for potential bad loans in the belief that a possible North American trade war would hurt the economy and cause defaults on commercial loans, credit cards and mortgages.
About 92% of Canadian exports by value entered the U.S. tariff-free in June because they were exempt from tariffs under the North American free trade agreement, data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed.
Prime Minister Mark Carney on Friday removed some retaliatory tariffs Canada had imposed on the United States.
""Three months later, we believe cooler heads may be prevailing with manageable reciprocal tariffs implemented between the CUSMA-bound countries,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Matthew Lee said, referring to the Canada, U.S. and Mexico trade zone.
Lee and other analysts expected the banks to benefit from a sequential decline in loan-loss provisions but for loan growth to remain weak due to low demand.
The Canadian banks will kick off earnings season on Tuesday beginning with Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia.
Net interest income - the difference between what banks make on loans and pay out on deposits - is expected to grow between 9.3% and 57%.
Analysts expected the banks to get a boost from capital markets and wealth management segments, which benefit from fee income and rising demand.
The Canadian banks, traditionally some of the most well capitalized banks in the world, have built excess capital but have limited options to invest at home. They have turned to stock buybacks, deploying about C$4 billion cumulatively in the third quarter.
""Given the robust capital positions, we look forward to commentary on capital deployment plans by the banks' management teams that can help the bank meet its medium-term financial targets,"" Veritas analyst Shalabh Garg said.
The banks have expanded in the U.S. over the years as growth at home is limited in a saturated market and have also invested to build their wealth management business.

Asda, the UK’s third-largest grocery retailer by sales, has teamed up with banking group Lloyds on an initiative to “drive sustainability progress and performance within its supply chain”.
CFO Michael Gleeson said the scheme offers suppliers “competitive financing that rewards progress and encourages transparency across our supply base”.
Sustainability ratings platform EcoVadis will the ESG performance of Asda’s suppliers. Asda said it already asks its largest suppliers – companies accountable for around 80% of its product carbon emissions – to share sustainability data with EcoVadis.
The retailer said it will “provide access to preferential rates for numerous suppliers on a tiered basis, dependent on sustainability performance against a range of KPIs”.
Suppliers that meet the programme’s requirements can benefit from October. Companies that “choose not to engage will remain on current payment terms and default rates”, Asda added.
Lloyds head of consumer Aled Patchett said: “We’re proud to have supported Asda for many years in its work to build further resilience in its supply chain. Our existing programme has successfully supported suppliers over the years and converting it to reward sustainability efforts will not only deepen support for British businesses, it will also support Asda in meeting its own ESG ambitions.”
According to Asda’s corporate website, the retailer’s stated aim for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions is “delivering net zero operations by 2040”.
On Scope 3, Asda says: “We have developed a carbon transition plan, aligned with science-based targets to support the delivery of net zero by 2050.”
It adds: “With 98% of our emissions from Scope 3, working collaboratively with suppliers and partners to drive climate action is imperative.”

The Fed's press office and Cook's high-powered lawyer, Abbe Lowell, did not reply when CNBC asked if she was working Tuesday, and if so, where.
Security at the central bank's headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., likewise would not say whether Cook was in the building.
On Monday night, Cook said that she would remain in her job despite Trump having told her in a letter posted on Truth Social earlier in the evening that he was removing her ""for cause.""
The president cited allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte that Cook had made false statements on home mortgage applications, which are being investigated by the Justice Department.
""I will not resign,"" Cook said in a statement late Monday. ""I will continue to carry out my duties to help the American economy as I have been doing since 2022.""
Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, said that Trump did not have the authority to remove her because there was no legal cause for him to do so.
Pulte as evidence has pointed to documents that Cook allegedly signed for properties in Michigan and Georgia, which claimed they were each her primary residence. He accused Cook of ""falsifying residence statuses ... in order to potentially secure lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms.""
It is unclear how Pulte acquired the applications, and Cook has not been charged with any crime.
Lowell, in his own statement Monday, said, ""We will take whatever actions are needed to prevent his attempted illegal action.""
The Federal Reserve's media office has not commented on Trump's announcement.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Tuesday that he did not know who had the authority to halt Cook's paycheck or her access to the Federal Reserve buildings.
Lutnick demurred when asked if Trump could fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for cause if Powell continued to authorize Cook's paycheck and access after the president had said she was fired.
""These are all 'what-if scenarios,'"" Lutnick said in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
""The answer is, the Department of Justice will go take this on and deal with this,"" he said.
If Trump succeeds in removing Cook and confirming her successor, then the majority of the seven members of the Fed's board would be Trump nominees.",d1e5921de2652bc027fcd9d407cd735a,trafilatura,2475,0

The program will be conducted at the company's Fremont, California, facility using its FOX-XP production system. Stock surged after the announcement.
The initiative includes a custom WaferPak contactor designed for high-power devices. It will compare wafer-level burn-in results to the supplier's existing production process. Aehr expects the evaluation to last three to six months.
""We believe this represents a significant step forward in our engagement with this top-tier AI processor supplier,"" said Gayn Erickson, president and CEO of Aehr Test Systems. He added that while there is no guarantee of future production orders, the evaluation marks an important milestone for next-generation products.

Aehr said wafer-level screening allows defective chips to be identified before being packaged with high-bandwidth memory or other processors. The company said this process helps improve yields and reduce costs compared to traditional package-level testing.
The FOX-XP system can process up to 18 wafers at once and has already been used on devices such as silicon carbide power semiconductors and photonics chips. Aehr said growing demand for high-performance processors in data centers and cloud computing underscores the need for reliable large-scale testing solutions.
The order comes amid strong interest in AI hardware. Aehr shares recently surged after a major cloud giant placed a separate order for its test systems, highlighting momentum in the sector.
Broader exposure to the sector is available through the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX).

In a recent video, money expert George Kamel highlighted the key signs that show you’re on the right track and building lasting stability.
Not Living Paycheck to Paycheck
Kamel mentioned that 53% of Americans report that they are living paycheck to paycheck.
Having money left over at the end of the month from a paycheck or having other sources of income means that there is extra money to put aside for retirement, an emergency fund, savings or other investments.
Some other ideas to avoid living paycheck to paycheck and earn money on the side are investing, starting a YouTube channel, cashing in on collectibles, or even doing minor repairs to household appliances or electronics as a part-time job.

Not Stressing About Money Every Day
Out of people living in the U.S., 40% said that their finances cause them to lose sleep, and a third admitted that they are distracted at work due to financial stress, according to Kamel.
Controlling expenses and living within your means is a good way to be less financially stressed. Having three to six months’ worth of expenses saved for an emergency fund helps to provide a financial cushion and worry less about finances.
When a person is able to watch where the money is going, it helps them be able to stick to a budget. And sticking to a budget takes away the stress of worrying because the bills will get paid.
Actually Saving for Retirement
Investing at least 15% of household income in some type of retirement fund like a Roth IRA or a 401(k) is what Kamel recommended.
According to LendingTree, in the first quarter of 2025, Americans had an average unpaid credit card balance of $7,321. Reducing high-interest debt, which includes paying off credit cards and loans, will help free up available funds to put toward a retirement fund and is an indicator that one is in a better money position than most.

“We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. We said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain,” the company said in a statement posted on social media.
Shares of the restaurant operator rose about 8% in trading on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the stock had closed more than 6% higher after President Trump called on the company to change its logo back following a redesign it unveiled last week, which sent shares tumbling amid broad customer backlash.
After changing its logo back, Trump congratulated the company on the decision.
""Cracker Barrel should go back to the old logo, admit a mistake based on customer response (the ultimate Poll), and manage the company better than ever before,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social Tuesday morning.
""They got a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity if they play their cards right. Very tricky to do, but a great opportunity. Have a major News Conference today. Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again.""
Cracker Barrel stock fell more than 14% last week after the company announced the fifth evolution of its logo to a more minimalist look, removing the image of Uncle Herschel, or Old Timer, from its logo.
Cracker Barrel initially backed its redesign, writing in an Instagram post on Monday that it ""could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.""
The company added that Uncle Herschel is ""not going anywhere — he's family"" and will be featured on its menu, road signs, and in the store. Alongside the changed logo, the company also leaned into ""refreshed restaurant remodels"" that have an ""enhanced brand look and feel.""
The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., previously weighed in on the logo change on X, reposting from an account called Woke War Room, whose complaints included CEO Julie Felss Masino's ""woke regime"" and Cracker Barrel's LGBTQ+ Alliance employee resource group. Trump adviser Alex Bruesewitz has also been critical on the platform in recent days, also sharing an image of the LGBTQ group's logo and a picture of Masino.

The 39% US tariff on Switzerland is the highest imposed on any developed nation and poses a major threat to businesses and the economy. Swiss officials are trying to remedy the situation with a new offer to the US, aiming to get a new deal by October. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the US wants to wrap up outstanding negotiations with countries by then.
“We are currently in a dangerous downward spiral, and the knock-on effect is being accentuated by the US tariffs,” Swissmem Director Stefan Brupbacher said. “This is a dramatic situation for the affected companies, employees and regions.”
While economists still forecast growth for the Swiss economy, businesses and executives have struck a more cautious tone, and a number of them have started implementing emergency plans. Lindt & Spruengli AG, for instance, is weighing moving production of its world-famous, gold-wrapped Easter bunnies.
In addition to the tariffs, Swiss exporters also have to contend with a strong currency. The franc has gained more than 12% against the dollar this year, one of the best performers versus the greenback.
The economy is highly dependent on exports, and runs a large goods trade surplus with other nations. That is partly driven by its pharmaceutical sector, dominated by giants Roche Holding AG and Novartis AG. The drugmakers discussed the situation with the Swiss government earlier this month.
Swissmem, which represents the export-oriented mechanical and electrical engineering industries, called on the government to do all it can to reduce costs for businesses. It also said Switzerland should focus on building trade ties with the EU, which already accounts for almost half the country’s exports. The body represents more than 1,000 companies from small and midsized firms to large corporations.",b85fbab696ced9d742c95aaf5ed45b9a,trafilatura,2449,0

Narrowing the focus, PSA’s underperformance is also apparent compared to the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE). The exchange-traded fund has declined slightly over the past year. Moreover, the ETF’s 4.1% gains on a YTD basis outshine the stock’s dip over the same time frame.
On Jul. 30, PSA reported its Q2 results, and its shares closed down more than 5% in the following trading session. Its core FFO of $4.28 per share surpassed Wall Street expectations of $4.23 per share. The company’s revenue was $1.20 billion, topping Wall Street forecasts of $1.19 billion. PSA expects full-year FFO in the range of $16.45 to $17 per share.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect PSA’s FFO per share to grow marginally to $16.81 on a diluted basis. The company’s FFO surprise history is mixed. It beat the consensus estimate in two of the last four quarters while missing the forecast on two other occasions.
Among the 22 analysts covering PSA stock, the consensus is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 13 “Strong Buy” ratings, and nine “Holds.”
This configuration is more bullish than two months ago, with 12 analysts suggesting a “Strong Buy.”
On Aug. 21, Smedes Rose from Citigroup Inc. (C) maintained a “Buy” rating on PSA with a price target of $325, implying a potential upside of 10.7% from current levels.
The mean price target of $326.47 represents an 11.2% premium to PSA’s current price levels. The Street-high price target of $378 suggests an ambitious upside potential of 28.7%.

(NASDAQ:AMWD) shares plunged after it reported fiscal first-quarter 2026 net sales of $403.0 million, down 12.2% from the prior year and below analyst estimates of $413.28 million.
Net income fell 50.7% to $14.6 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared with $29.6 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, a year earlier. Adjusted EPS was $1.01, missing the $1.24 consensus estimate and down from $2.14 in the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased 32.8% to $42.2 million, representing 10.5% of net sales versus 13.7% last year.

The company said results reflected lower sales volumes, an unfavorable mix shift toward value-based offerings, increased product input costs, including tariffs, $2.0 million in ERP support costs, $2.8 million in merger-related expenses, $1.8 million in higher interest expense, and $0.8 million in restructuring charges.
These were partially offset by an $8.9 million favorable mark-to-market adjustment on foreign exchange forward contracts and controlled discretionary spending.
Cash provided by operating activities was $33.1 million, and free cash flow totaled $24.9 million. During the quarter, the company repurchased 209,757 shares for $12.4 million.
As of July 31, 2025, American Woodmark had $54.9 million in cash, $315.2 million in additional availability under its revolving credit facility, $196.3 million in term loan debt, and $173.4 million drawn on its revolving facility, resulting in a net leverage ratio of 1.69.
“Our teams are executing well despite the lower volumes and delivered Adjusted EBITDA margins of 10.5% for the first fiscal quarter,” said Scott Culbreth, president and CEO. “Demand trends are expected to remain challenging in both markets, but I am confident in our team’s ability to navigate the current macroeconomic environment.”
In light of its proposed merger with MasterBrand, Inc., announced Aug. 6, 2025, the company said it will not hold a conference call to discuss results and will not provide or update financial guidance.
Price Action: AMWD shares were trading lower by 1.55% at $65.99 premarket.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Oil prices fell 2% on Tuesday, erasing gains from the previous session, as investors watched developments around U.S. tariffs, the war in Ukraine and the potential disruption of Russian fuel supplies.
Brent crude was down $1.58, or 2.3%, at $67.22 a barrel, a day after hitting its highest price since early August. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost $1.55, or about 2.4%, to $63.25.
""Given the huge amount of uncertainties in the oil market caused by the Ukrainian conflict and the tariff war, investors will remain unwilling to commit themselves to either direction on a prolonged basis,"" said Tamas Varga, an analyst with PVM Oil Associates.
Brent prices could be bound to a trading range of $65-$74 for the foreseeable future, he added.
Oil's rally on Monday was primarily driven by supply risks after Ukraine strikes on Russian energy infrastructure and the possibility of further U.S. sanctions on Russian oil.
Ukraine's attacks in response to Russia's advances in the conflict and its pounding of Ukrainian gas and power facilities have disrupted Moscow's oil processing and exports and created gasoline shortages in some parts of Russia.
Russia has revised up its crude oil export plan from western ports by 200,000 barrels per day in August from the initial schedule after Ukrainian drone attacks disrupted refinery operations and freed up more crude for shipment, three people familiar with the matter said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed his threat to impose sanctions on Russia if there is no progress towards a peace deal in the next two weeks.
However, sources have told Reuters that U.S. and Russian government officials discussed several energy deals on the sidelines of this month's negotiations to seek peace in Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Indian exports could face U.S. duties of up to 50% - among the highest imposed by Washington.
""Front and center in this week's trade is the possibility that U.S. tariffs on India could be doubled to 50% as early as tomorrow ... further restricting Russian export flows that are already being inhibited by recent Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil refineries,"" analysts at energy advisory firm Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note.

Before a company reports earnings, implied volatility is usually high because the market is unsure about the outcome of the report. Speculators and hedgers create huge demand for the company’s options which increases the implied volatility, and therefore, the price of options.

After the earnings announcement, implied volatility usually drops back down to normal levels.
Let’s take a look at the expected range for these stocks. To calculate the expected range, look up the option chain and add together the price of the at-the-money put option and the at-the-money call option. Use the first expiry date after the earnings date. While this approach is not as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate.
Monday
PDD – 7.9%
Tuesday
Nothing of note
Wednesday
NVDA – 6.9%
SNOW – 11.4%
CRWD – 8.6%
Thursday
MRVL – 10.4%
DELL – 9.0%
Friday
BABA – 6.5%
Option traders can use these expected moves to structure trades. Bearish traders can look at selling bear call spreads outside the expected range.
Bullish traders can sell bull put spreads outside the expected range, or look at naked puts for those with a higher risk tolerance.
Neutral traders can look at iron condors. When trading iron condors over earnings, it is best to keep the short strikes outside the expected range.
When trading options over earnings, it is best to stick to risk defined strategies and keep position size small. If the stock makes a larger than expected move and the trade suffers a full loss, it should not have more than a 1-3% effect on your portfolio.

(NASDAQ:META) is one of the Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street. On August 20, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan reiterated an Overweight rating on the stock with a $920.00 price target. The rating affirmation highlights growth in Meta’s Reels feature across its platforms.
Based on a recent filing by META for its defense in the FTC Antitrust case, Reels as a percentage of total time spent on “FB and IG has increased by 25-pts and 35-pts, respectively, between 2023-25E.”
Moreover, the daily time spent per daily active user on Reels has grown estimatedly threefold on Facebook and fourfold on Instagram. This has contributed majorly to overall engagement increases across Meta’s platforms.
Meanwhile, under or unmonetized surfaces faced the sharpest decline, helping Meta attain healthy impression growth for its advertising business.
“3) Under- or unmonetized surfaces, such as profile views, groups, photos, etc., saw the sharpest decline in time spent (both on % and # basis) – which likely helped META achieve healthy impression growth. In FY22, FB feed monetized at the highest rate on a per-minute basis, ahead of IG Stories and IG Feed, and ~5x that of Reels (Exhibit 5). 5) Lastly, based on recent commentary from META on monetization, we estimate that Reels (FB and IG) likely represents ~45% of US ad revenues in FY25E.”
The disclosures are a testament to META’s successful efforts over the last three years, with trends anticipated to continue as the company integrates advanced AI models “further into its surfaces.”
“These disclosures point to META’s successful efforts over the last three years to increase engagement on commercial surfaces, in addition to driving monetization higher. As META integrates advanced AI models with reasoning capabilities further into its surfaces, we see plenty of runway for these trends to continue. META remains our favorite megacap stock.”

Over the 23-hour window from Aug. 25 at 11:00 through Aug. 26 at 10:00, HBAR traded in a $0.014 range between $0.242 and $0.228, amounting to a 5.83% intraday move. The most notable volatility came during the 19:00–20:00 hour on Aug. 25, when the token fell from $0.237 to $0.228 in a steep selloff.
That decline, however, coincided with a surge in volume to 169.5 million tokens, suggesting large buyers stepped in at the $0.228 level. The sudden influx of demand stabilized prices and set the stage for a rebound, with HBAR retracing back toward $0.237 by the session’s close. Market observers point to this dynamic as an example of capitulation-driven selling creating opportunities for accumulation.
By the final hour of trading on Aug. 26, momentum tilted modestly back in favor of bulls. HBAR edged up 0.11% from $0.237359 to $0.237396 despite intraday dips as low as $0.236270. Price resilience above $0.236300 highlighted an emerging support zone, where buying activity consistently absorbed downward pressure.
The consolidation between $0.236300 and $0.238270 established a clear short-term range. With institutional flows appearing to reinforce the lower bound, analysts suggest the market may be preparing for its next decisive move. Whether HBAR can break beyond resistance at $0.238270 could determine if this rebound evolves into a broader uptrend.

Wall Street, collectively, may be wondering about the future growth prospects of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as they invest in artificial intelligence but burn cash in the process and question whether business and customers are willing to pay for the technology.
But as artificial-intelligence chipmaker Nvidia Corp. NVDA prepares to report quarterly results on Wednesday — amid questions about its ability to meet demand and drama between the U.S. and China — analysts keep getting more bullish.
Most Read from MarketWatch
As MarketWatch reported last week, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald said AI demand was “seemingly insatiable,” as its Big Tech customers heap potentially hundreds of billions into building out the technology and its infrastructure. But as the focus shifts to so-called AI inference — or making new observations or predictions when presented with data — Wall Street may have questions, as they have in the past, about whether Nvidia can supply enough chips to meet that demand.
Wall Street’s focus will also likely center on China, where things have gotten a bit messy, as the two nations try to elbow each other out of the AI race and as each claim the other represents a security threat.
Nvidia said last month that the U.S. would allow the company to sell its less-sophisticated H20 AI chips — made specifically for China to comply with export controls — to the nation, after the U.S. effectively banned them in the spring. But the U.S., as part of a recent deal, will also get 15% of Nvidia’s AI chip sales from China to get the license to sell there.
Meanwhile, China has discouraged businesses there from using Nvidia’s chips, with state media claiming they were a security risk, according to reports. The Information reported that Nvidia, in turn, ordered a stop to the production of H20 chips.
Elsewhere, after Walmart Inc. WMT put up a rare profit miss amid lofty expectations and Target’s TGT investors fled over its new CEO pick, smaller retailers report quarterly results this week. Expectations are low. The prevalence of the usual suspects for why — tariff anxieties, higher costs of living, the flight to value, weaker clothing and home-goods demand, competition in prestige beauty — is still high.",4f755b622fd29e74d8c1fce0da8b0781,trafilatura,2351,0

This infrastructure will minimize the use of combustion engine buses, with four new e-buses joining in 2025 and two more planned to enter service in 2026.
“This project is a shining example of how innovation creates a cleaner, smarter energy future. We’re proud to support Fremont USD and school districts across California as they convert to better, electrified student transportation,” said Mike Delaney, Vice President, Utility Partnership and Innovation, PG&E.
This marks the second school district participating in PG&E’s commercial fleet Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) pilot. This program follows the company’s first successful deployment with Zum and Oakland Unified School District in 2024.

The firm has upgraded the stock based ahead of Snowflake’s August 27 earnings based on improving demand trends and long-term growth prospects in AI and data services.

“We upgrade Snowflake to Buy from Neutral, and raise our estimates, and PO to $240 (53x CY26FCF/1.9x growth adj, from $220, 48x/1.7x), given three distinct proprietary data sources which point to momentum in Snowflake’s data warehouse and emerging Cortex AI and Snowpark developer businesses.

Snowflake does face competition and risks stemming from its consumption-based revenue model, but the growing $155 billion addressable AI software market highlights a key opportunity for the company.
“While we believe that Q2 earnings (8/27) will be a catalyst for the stock given multiple positive data points outlined below, our call is for outperformance over the long term given incremental traction with products addressing a significant larger addressable AI market for software of $155bn.”

Dive Brief:
-
Burlington Stores is halfway done with refreshing its chain of 1,115 locations, according to a press release. Remaining locations are expected to be completed by the end of 2026.
-
The ongoing reimagining of the off-price retailer’s in-store experience favors an open layout with a format that is designed to enhance the customer experience, per the company.
-
The refresh includes organized aisles and signage that showcases trends.
Dive Insight:
Burlington Stores intends to maintain its relevance and compete with the likes of TJX and Ross by streamlining and updating its chain of stores.
The company is calling the effort Store Experience 2.0.
”Now, instead of a difficult-to-navigate and endless sea of racks, you’ll find a store layout that’s much more welcoming, inviting, exciting,” CEO Michael O’Sullivan said on a recent call with analysts. Burlington’s store, merchandising and marketing teams have all collaborated on the new layout and design. “We’re really excited about it. It reinforces who we are.”
O’Sullivan said feedback from customers on the new store layout “has been overwhelmingly positive.”
Burlington intends to open 100 net new stores this year and another 100 in 2026, according to O’Sullivan. Burlington earlier this year acquired the leases from 46 former Joann locations following its bankruptcy.
The company remains bullish on its 2.0 store merchandising and operations initiatives, which have instituted new systems, processes and tools to give the company’s buyers more flexibility and control over external events like fluctuating tariffs.
“A couple of years ago, we would not have had the transparency and the agility to make these kinds of adjustments,” O’Sullivan told analysts in May. “We expect that as the year goes on, the environment will continue to be volatile and dynamic. Our Merchandising 2.0 capabilities are going to be very important for our buyers and planners to manage through this external volatility.”
Burlington’s Q1 results saw a 6% total sales increase, while comp sales were flat and net income increased 28% year over year to over $100 million.",cbccf0c320e4b21cd18ec9823325fc6d,trafilatura,2260,0

The existing scheme, currently managed by Lex Autolease, covers around 4,000 vehicles. Under the new arrangement, employees can pay a fixed monthly amount from their salary for an electric car of their choice, including premium models. The payment is taken before tax and National Insurance, making it more affordable while also reducing employer NI costs.
Employees will also benefit from enhanced lifestyle protections, allowing continued vehicle use in circumstances such as maternity leave or long-term sickness. These protections will extend to existing scheme members with vehicles provided by Lex Autolease.
Both Tusker and Lex Autolease are part of Lloyds Banking Group’s Transport business. The transition reflects the Group’s strategy to position Tusker as a specialist in salary sacrifice vehicles, while Lex Autolease will focus on company cars, light commercial vehicles, and personal leasing.
Colin Tozer, Head of Policy and Propositions for Employees at Lloyds Banking Group, said car salary sacrifice schemes “offer an affordable way to get the keys to a fully insured and maintained car” and noted they are “an effective way to support the transition to more sustainable transport.”
Kit Wisdom, Managing Director at Tusker, added that the scheme will allow Lloyds Banking Group colleagues to “experience firsthand the service we offer” and highlighted Tusker’s growth, with its fleet nearly tripling since joining the Group in 2023 to over 70,000 vehicles.

Shares of Nio have surged in recent weeks and rallied further after the company unveiled its ES8 SUV on Aug. 21. The model, which clocks in at 308,800 yuan, or $43,000, under a battery subscription plan, is much more affordable than Nio's premium SUVs, which typically come in between 338,000 yuan and 768,000 yuan. Deliveries for the new vehicle will begin in late September. NIO YTD mountain NIO YTD chart But despite Nio's surge, Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao stuck by his overweight rating on the stock. The analyst's price target of $6.50 per share is less than 3% above the stock's Friday close. ""NIO's share price has risen 90%+ from the trough in June (vs. HSI +9%), reaching our price target of US$6.5/HK$50.7,"" Hsiao wrote in the Monday note. ""The stock upward movement has been self-reinforcing as investors believe NIO's share price performance is correlated to capital markets' willingness to finance its operation and strategic ambitions, which is also linked to its operational value and ability to navigate the accelerating auto industry shakeup."" The analyst also pointed out that the trading value of Nio shares has grown above $2.5 billion over the past two days. This is equivalent to the stock's cumulative value over the past two weeks. In the note, Hsiao underscored robust ES8 pre-orders are the main catalyst for the stock's rally. ""Our checks suggest ES8 pre-orders (with Rmb5k refundable deposit) may have surpassed 30k at the weekend and kept rising,"" he said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said on Tuesday the budget carrier is seeing an opportunity to grow its market share, thanks to financial troubles at rival Spirit Airlines and Southwest Airlines' decision to end its policy of allowing free checked bags.
To cash in on the opportunity, the Denver-based carrier has announced 20 routes it plans to start this winter. It is also rolling out a host of offers to cultivate loyal customers and poach passengers from rival airlines.
The measures are aimed at making Frontier the number one low-fare carrier in the top 20 U.S. metro areas, Biffle said in an interview.
""There are ... things that are taking place that have kind of opened the door for Frontier,"" he told Reuters.
Southwest's decision to start charging for bags has created a ""level playing field"" in the low-fare airline industry as customers are now choosing airlines primarily on price, Biffle said.
Meanwhile, Spirit's future remains uncertain as its finances remain shaky just months after emerging from bankruptcy. Earlier this month, the company warned that it might not continue to operate if its financial results failed to improve rapidly.
The financial troubles have forced Spirit to shrink operations, enabling Frontier to swoop in some of its key markets like Fort Lauderdale in Florida. Beginning in November, Frontier will start service to Fort Lauderdale from Detroit, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, and Charlotte.
""ULCC capacity is going down. And we think we can fill that void,"" Biffle said.
The airline, however, would adjust capacity on some of its existing routes to serve the new routes, he added.
Frontier, like other U.S. carriers, has been grappling with soft travel demand in the domestic market. The company has forecast a wider-than-expected loss for the current quarter and has been betting on network changes, capacity cuts and improved product offerings to lift its earnings.
On Monday, it unveiled loyalty matching programs to grab customers from other airlines. Biffle said Frontier is aiming to double its loyalty revenue to $6 per passenger by next year.

-
DISH TV operator EchoStar announced the sale of low- and mid-band spectrum allocations to AT&T for $23 billion.
-
The two firms also agreed to change their earlier network services deal to create a hybrid mobile operator relationship.
-
EchoStar said the transaction resolves issues with federal regulators, who have been investigating whether it was meeting it wireless and satellite rights obligations.
Shares of EchoStar (SATS) skyrocketed 70% Tuesday as the satellite TV provider, under pressure from federal regulators, sold 50 megahertz of its nationwide low- and mid-band spectrum allocations to AT&T (T) for approximately $23 billion.
The operator of DISH TV, Boost Mobile wireless service, and other properties said the deal includes its 3.45-gigahertz and 600-megahertz spectrum licenses, which it explained gives AT&T the ability to rapidly deploy ""the purchased spectrum to U.S. consumers across the country, as AT&T has the option to lease the spectrum, pending the closing of the spectrum sale. This arrangement benefits both AT&T and Boost Mobile subscribers.""
In addition to the sale, EchoStar and AT&T have amended their previous network services agreement, creating a hybrid mobile operator relationship.
AT&T CEO John Stankey added the the acquisition ""bolsters and expands our spectrum portfolio while enhancing customers' 5G wireless and home internet experience in even more markets.""
EchoStar noted that the agreement is part of its ""ongoing efforts to resolve the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) inquiries."" In May, the FCC launched an investigation into whether the company was meeting certain requirements for both its wireless and satellite rights. President Donald Trump reportedly intervened, calling on EchoStar Chairman Charlie Ergen and FCC head Brendan Carr to strike a deal.
The transaction is expected to close by the middle of next year.
Heading into Tuesday’s session, EchoStar shares were up 30% year-to-date. Shares of AT&T slipped close to 1% but have added one-quarter of their value in 2025.

SEOUL (Reuters) -A top South Korean official said on Monday that the U.S. and South Korea had decided to establish a non-binding agreement to define the operation and structure of $350 billion in investment funds agreed as part of a July trade deal.
Seoul agreed with Washington last month on a trade deal to cut U.S. tariffs in exchange for pledging the investments, though differences emerged on how the sides interpreted details of the plan, including how profits would be distributed.
Presidential policy adviser Kim Yong-beom said on Monday the two sides were making progress in reaching an agreement in broad terms during his visit to Washington for the summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.
During his trip, Kim said he had held a separate meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for two hours.
Kim said that the U.S. hoped to agree a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to oversee the investment plan as soon as possible.
The ""financial package"" would be used to support strategic industries such as key minerals, batteries, chips, pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, Kim said. He reiterated that up to $150 billion had also been earmarked for shipbuilding.
Seoul would create a task force to work on detailed implementation plans, led by the finance ministry and joined by state-funded banks, Kim said.
South Korean officials previously disputed Lutnick's remarks suggesting the U.S. would take 90% of the profits from the investments. Officials in Seoul also said equity investments would account for a small part, while loans and guarantees would make up a majority of the funds.
In July, Trump said South Korea would invest in projects ""owned and controlled by the United States"" and selected by him.
South Korean officials have said a safety mechanism would be added to reduce financing risk, including U.S. commitments to buy products from the projects and invest in commercially feasible projects.

Investors were also impressed by the fact that BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:BWXT) raised its revenue guidance. Here is what Cramer said about the firm in February:
“That’s nuclear. You know, look, the bloom is off the rose. Nuclear, it was never really there. We don’t have any sort of initiative that really makes nuclear the right thing. Small modular nuclear power’s still not happening. It’s going to be 2033 before we see anything new in nuclear and that is just too far for me. But I’m telling the truth now. I mean, I’m, I’m done with it. I, I don’t wanna hear about it anymore.”
More recently, Cramer was rather sarcastic about BWX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:BWXT):
“Alright, that’s nuclear. And again, like you know, nuclear, I’m not going to fight anyone who wants to enter a nuclear stock. I’m going to bless it even though it’s up very, very big.”

The budget airline on Tuesday announced 20 new routes beginning in late fall, many of which overlap with Spirit Airlines’ major markets. The new routes will include departures from Fort Lauderdale, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston, Charlotte, and Dallas. Introductory fares will start at $29.
In a press release, the company said the move is part of its commitment to becoming the number one low-fare carrier in the top 20 U.S. metro areas. “As industry capacity adjusts, we want to ensure consumers in those markets continue to have affordable flight options,” CEO Barry Biffle said in the release.
Meanwhile, Spirit Airlines is facing a bleak year — and possible extinction. Months after emerging from bankruptcy, the airline raised some major concerns about its ability to stay in business. In its second-quarter earnings, the company reported a $245.8 million net loss on $1.02 billion operating revenue.
Spirit pointed to adverse market conditions, elevated domestic capacity, and continued weak demand for domestic leisure travel as major obstacles moving forward. The company is attempting to address these concerns by enhancing products and furloughing pilots, among other measures, but if these steps are unsuccessful, Spirit’s management said it’s likely the company could halt operations within the next year.
Frontier has attempted to merge with Spirit multiple times. The first attempt came in 2022 , but Frontier was outbid by JetBlue, whose merger with the budget airline also failed. Last October, reports surfaced that Spirit and Frontier were again discussing a merger , which at the time sent Spirit stock soaring.
Both airlines have struggled the past few years and have adjusted their models to attract more customers. Spirit, famous for being bare-bones, added first class seating in 2024. Frontier followed suit , announcing in December that its airplanes will have first-class seating by late 2025.

AT&T said Tuesday that the licenses cover virtually every U.S. market — more than 400 total — which the company plans to deploy as soon as possible to lure more home internet subscribers and meet its growth goals.
The deal also fortifies the long-term services agreement between AT&T and EchoStar, enabling the latter to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator providing wireless service under its Boost Mobile brand. AT&T will be the primary network services partner to EchoStar.
Shares of EchoStar, based in Englewood, Colorado, soared 76% at the opening bell Tuesday.
“This acquisition bolsters and expands our spectrum portfolio while enhancing customers’ 5G wireless and home internet experience in even more markets,” said AT&T CEO John Stankey. ”We’re adding fuel to our winning strategy of investing in valuable wireless and broadband assets to become America’s best connectivity provider.”

AT&T said Tuesday that the licenses cover virtually every U.S. market — more than 400 total — which the company plans to deploy as soon as possible to lure more home internet subscribers and meet its growth goals.
The deal also fortifies the long-term services agreement between AT&T and EchoStar, enabling the latter to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator providing wireless service under its Boost Mobile brand. AT&T will be the primary network services partner to EchoStar.
Shares of EchoStar, based in Englewood, Colorado, soared 76% at the opening bell Tuesday.
“This acquisition bolsters and expands our spectrum portfolio while enhancing customers’ 5G wireless and home internet experience in even more markets,” said AT&T CEO John Stankey. ”We’re adding fuel to our winning strategy of investing in valuable wireless and broadband assets to become America’s best connectivity provider.”

“We continue to take CEO Lip Bu Tan at his word — this will be a challenging turnaround with no quick fix, while the stock mostly reacts to quick fix narratives.”
Intel is going to be facing several challenges for a turnaround. However, the desire of a quick solution doesn’t align with the reality of Intel’s challenges.
For instance, while Intel’s microprocessor roadmap demands significant improvement, its foundry strategy has drawn skepticism from analyst Joseph Moore, who highlighted that the company has struggled with this approach over multiple decades.

Moreover, foundry customers have been assessing the limitations of Intel’s products, particularly those built on the Intel 4 node. Since older nodes like Intel 7 and Intel 10 are sold out, which are considered better value, Intel faces challenges in its current offerings.
Analysts on Wall Street currently have a consensus “Buy” rating on the stock. The average price target of $22 implies a 10.55% upside; however, the Street-high target of $28 implies an upside of 13.84%.

Launched in 2020, Polymarket lets traders place bets on a number of future events, such as election results, the Fed's decisions, box office results, crypto prices, etc., using cryptocurrency. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund recently valued the prediction market upwards of $1 billion.
1789 Capital, which Trump Jr. joined as a partner last year following his father Donald Trump's re-election as the U.S. president, has invested ""double-digit"" millions of dollars into Polymarket, Axios reported. Trump Jr. will also join Polymarket's advisory board.
Axios cited a source to report that 1789 Capital founder Omeed Malik and Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan have been discussing the deal for the last 18 months, but the VC fund waited until there was a clear legal path for the prediction market's entry into the U.S. market.
In 2022, the company was charged with offering illegal event-based binary options to U.S. users and operating as an unregistered market maker. It agreed to pay a $1.4 million fine and restrict the platform's access to American users.
As reported earlier, the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) informed Polymarket in July that federal investigations into the market have been officially shut down. The development, along with its acquisition of the derivatives exchange QCX, could open the U.S. market for Polymarket.

Tokyo-listed shares of Nissan declined as much as 6.7% before paring some losses to trade 6% lower.
Mercedes-Benz's pension trust will divest its stake worth roughly $346 million in Nissan Motor, a company spokesperson reportedly said on Monday.
The spokesperson added that Nissan holdings, which were moved into pension assets in 2016, were not strategically significant while framing the sale of the remaining 3.8% stake as part of a portfolio cleanup. Nissan stake makes up 2.7% of the company's total holdings, with Diamler Truck constituting nearly 93%.
Mercedes-Benz is Nissan's second-largest shareholder after Renault — 35.7% stake — LSEG data showed.
The move puts further strain on the Japanese automaker's stock that has been under pressure from U.S. tariffs, declining sales and the transition to electric vehicles amid steep global competition, in particular from Chinese rivals.
Late last year, the firm entered short-lived discussions with Honda over a possible partnership that would have formed the world's third-biggest carmaker, but negotiations fell apart in February.
In May, the company announced plans to slash 11,000 jobs and shut down seven plants. Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa said in June that the company's short-term focus was to fix the struggling automaker as it undergoes major restructuring.
In July, U.S. auto tariffs were lowered to 15% from the previously announced 25% in some relief for Japanese automakers including Nissan. The original 25% tariff was halved to 12.5%, before adding a 2.5% ""Most Favored Nation"" base tariff, taking the total to 15%.
Nissan shares have declined more than 29% so far this year.",8eadace50e5161512a90a3b3168da1bd,trafilatura,1774,0

In a market note, Jefferies raised its price target for Tilray Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) to $2 from $1.5 previously, while maintaining a “buy” recommendation on expectations that a potential rescheduling of cannabis to Schedule II from I at present would largely benefit the company moving forward.

Drugs under Schedule II are classified with a high abuse risk but also have safe and accepted medical uses in the United States. These include certain narcotics, stimulants, and depressant drugs.
Meanwhile, Schedule I drugs, where cannabis currently falls under, are those with a high abuse risk, which means that it has no safe, accepted medical use in the United States.

Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ:RR) jumped by as much as 23 percent at intra-day trading on Monday before paring gains to end the day at $2.38 apiece after sealing an agreement to support automation and robotics adoption of one of the largest retailers in the world.
In a regulatory filing on Monday, Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ:RR) said it entered into a two-year master services agreement with an undisclosed retailing giant under which it will provide support to the latter’s automation and robotics needs.
The agreement will automatically renew for one year unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 60 days before the contract ends.
The deal comes amid the growing adoption of robotics and automation globally, as businesses seek to lower costs and improve operational efficiency.
In the retail industry alone, giant operators such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target, among others, have heavily adopted automation to streamline logistics networks.
Amazon alone committed earlier this year to invest $25 billion for the deployment of 1 million robots by 2030 as it aims to generate $10 billion in annual savings.

Shares of the company were up nearly 5% in extended trading.
The Alpha rocket suffered a technical problem while ascending on its sixth flight, causing a Lockheed Martin satellite it was supposed to place into orbit to crash into the Pacific Ocean.
The space tech firm said it conducted an independent review into the incident, along with the FAA's investigation, adding ""The findings confirmed Firefly's flight safety system performed nominally through all phases of flight...and the launch posed no risk to public safety.""
Alpha's upper rocket body fired for several minutes and ascended an altitude of 320 km (198.84 miles), but failed to reach its intended orbit and was pulled back into the atmosphere, it said.
With the steps to address the issue put in place, Firefly said it is now working to determine the next available launch window for Alpha Flight 7.
Since 2021, four out of six Alpha flights have failed, including the mishap in April. This mission was the first under an agreement between Firefly and Lockheed for up to 25 flights through 2029.
Firefly secured a valuation of $9.84 billion after its shares surged 55.6% in their Nasdaq debut earlier in August, as investors continue to pour capital into companies aiding expansion of the U.S. space and defense program.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The completed merger between Capital One and Discover Financial weighed down bank profits in the second quarter, as the sector reported $69.9 billion in profits, down 1% from the quarter prior.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said accounting rules required the merged institution to set aside a relatively large amount of provision expense. Absent that one-time cost, industry profits would have been up for the quarter on higher net interest and noninterest income, the regulator said.
The merged bank, which completed its deal in May, was the main contributor to a 33.7% increase in provision expenses for the quarter, which rose $7.6 billion. Bank profits were down $677.3 million for the quarter.
In a prepared statement, Acting FDIC Chairman Travis Hill noted that domestic deposits increased for the fourth straight quarter and loan growth accelerated. The FDIC said asset quality metrics for banks remained fairly good, but noted continued weakness in some portfolios, most notably commercial real estate and credit cards, which have overdue rates higher than the pre-pandemic average.

BERLIN (Reuters) -Canada is working with its allies to potentially fund critical mineral transactions, similar to what the U.S. government did with MP Materials to diversify the supply chain from China, Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson told Reuters on Tuesday.
The key target, Hodgson said, would be minerals subject to China's export restriction, which is challenging the production of important types of mineral products in G7 and NATO countries.
""I think you'll see us looking at similar types of transactions, working with our allies,"" Hodgson said.
""The difference between the MP Materials deal is all of the output goes to the United States there. We are interested in doing these sorts of deals in partnership with our allies to share the output with our allies,"" he said.
MP Materials said on July 10 that it had entered into a public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense to build out a domestic rare earth magnet supply chain and reduce foreign dependency.
