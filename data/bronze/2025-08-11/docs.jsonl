Experts interviewed by CNBC pointed out that the current AI boom is swiftly becoming one of the largest wealth-creation waves in modern history.\nSeveral massive funding rounds this year have skyrocketed the valuations of startups like OpenAI and Anthropic. According to data from the global market research platform CB Insights, there are 498 AI \"unicorn\" companies globally—referring to unlisted AI companies valued at $1 billion or more.\nTheir total valuation? It has reached a staggering $2.7 trillion, with a full 100 of these companies founded after 2023, indicating that many of them are still quite young. Notable examples include:\nMira Murati, the former Chief Technology Officer of OpenAI, left her position in September last year and founded a new company, Thinking Machines Lab, in February this year. In less than half a year since its inception, the company secured $2 billion in seed funding in July, reaching a valuation of approximately $12 billion.\nMeanwhile, another AI startup, Anthropic AI, is reportedly in talks for a new funding round of $50 billion, which could push its valuation to $170 billion. According to sources familiar with the matter cited by CNBC, the company's CEO, along with its six co-founders, are now likely among the ranks of billionaires.\nBeyond the funding frenzy in AI startups, the stock prices of AI-related tech giants like NVIDIA, Meta, and Microsoft have also soared in the secondary market. Additionally, companies involved in building data centers and computing infrastructure have seen significant profit growth, while the salaries of AI engineers have surged in tandem.\nAmong the rising stars in this wave of tech innovation, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has undoubtedly captured the most attention. Recently, OpenAI unveiled its latest model, ChatGPT-5, marking another significant leap in AI development.\nIt's been just a weekend since the model's release, and it has already sparked polarized reactions across the industry and the general public. On one hand, industry insiders remain optimistic.\nAaron Levie\nBox CEO\n\"GPT five is a breakthrough in being able to work through that information, not only quickly, but now with a way greater degree of accuracy.\"\nOn the other hand, American netizens have expressed significant dissatisfaction with the new model. On the popular U.S. forum Reddit, a post titled \"GPT-5 Is Horrible\" has garnered nearly 6,000 upvotes, with many users complaining that GPT-5's performance is inferior to older models.\nIt's worth noting that OpenAI has yet to turn a profit. Regarding this, Sam Altman has stated that he remains focused on growth and is unbothered by losses.\nSam Altman\nOpenAI CEO\n\"I think we should be willing to keep growing, to keep investing in training compute for a long time...I think the rational thing to do is to just be willing to run at a loss for quite a while and continue to do that...\"\nFinally, from the broader AI industry perspective, CNBC's latest All America Economic Survey reveals a complex public sentiment. While the capital markets are optimistic, the American public harbors mixed feelings about AI. On one hand, over half of respondents reported using AI tools, but they also expressed wariness.\nThe survey shows that 53% of American respondents have used AI software in the past 2–3 months. However, when it comes to their attitude toward AI, 68% admitted feeling uneasy, primarily due to concerns about AI's impact on jobs.", "content_hash": "3318f7864ce6d0b653e1013d5634cc7f", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That's a 45% jump from $550, its previous annual cost.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nPaying for college gets increasingly difficult as tuition rises\nTrump's 'big beautiful bill' slashes this tax break for high earners in 2026\nCredit card debt reaches $1.21 trillion\nOther credit cards have been changing terms to access perks like airport lounges. Earlier this summer, Capital One announced that, starting in February, customers using its Venture X Rewards and Venture X Business cards — each of which have $395 annual fees — will no longer be able to bring guests to the lounges free of charge.\nThat follows news from American Express that travelers who have an American Express Platinum card — which costs $695 a year — must spend $75,000 in eligible purchases before they can bring up to two guests to an airport lounge. Previously, there was no minimum spend and cardholders could bring up to two guests for free, according to NerdWallet.\nHere's how to decide if a travel credit card is worth the investment.\nOne habit will 'easily diminish' travel card value\nA travel rewards card isn't likely to be a good value if you're carrying a balance from month to month, experts say.\n\"Any interest that you owe will easily diminish the value of any of these benefits,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at NerdWallet.\nIt may also be harder to pay down debt. While the average annual percentage rate for credit cards is about 20.13%, the typical rate on premium travel cards can be closer to 25% to 30%, according to Rossman.\n\"Generally speaking, rewards cards charge higher rates,\" he said.\nDecide: Broad travel card, or brand specific?\nYou'll come across two kinds of travel credit cards. Co-branded credit cards are usually tied to specific airlines, hotels or even cruise chains, and provide benefits that are more valuable at that brand, French said.\nIf you frequently use a specific airline or tend to stay with a certain hotel chain, a co-branded credit card may be worth it, experts say.\nAn airline credit card, for instance, might have benefits like free checked bags, priority boarding, premium status tiers and sometimes discounts or points for spending at that airline.\n\"It's only free [checked] bags on that airline,\" said French. \"Your Southwest credit card won't get you anything on United.\"\nSome airlines belong to partnership networks such as Star Alliance, Oneworld or SkyTeam. If you're looking at a brand-specific card, see if the company has partnerships that allow you to transfer points or miles to allied brands.\nOn the other hand, general travel credit cards are \"really good for people who don't want to be married to a specific brand,\" as you can earn and use rewards more broadly, French said.\nSome travel credit cards do not charge annual fees; for those that do, the cost can range from $95 to upward of $500 a year, according to NerdWallet. Keep in mind that travel credit cards with little to no fees may not offer the same level of benefits and rewards as paid cards.\nBoth kinds of travel cards tend to have a set of similar perks, including credits for TSA PreCheck and other pre-screening memberships, and big sign-on bonuses when you spend a certain amount of money on the card within a short period of opening it. As a frequent traveler, such benefits can help make the card fee worth the cost, experts say.\nTo assess the benefits of the card, look at a detailed list of the perks on the issuer's website, said French. A card might charge an annual fee, but say it includes one free checked bag for you and a certain amount of guests. With just that perk, the card could pay for itself within a trip or two for a family.\nHow to know what card is best for you\nWhile some of the perks and rewards can seem enticing, it's important to consider your travel habits and lifestyle, said Rossman. Also consider what your credit habits are like, experts say.\nFor those who do not travel often, a travel credit card without an annual fee is probably going to be the best option, said French.\n\"You don't want to be paying an annual fee on a credit card that has benefits that you might not use,\" she said.\nIf you travel frequently in a given year and typically with a specific airline, a co-branded credit card can make sense, French said.\nIf you currently hold a card with a high annual fee, but realize you're not getting the most use out of it, you may be able to downgrade to a less expensive or free card offered by the issuer, Rossman said.\nDoing so will be better for your credit rather than closing out the card altogether, he said.", "content_hash": "42f3ded2f6b992f7e87d67c04098427a", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The bank upgraded the mining stock to overweight from equal weight but cut its price target to $48 from $54. That updated target implies more than 14% upside from Friday's close. In late July, Trump signed an order that imposed a universal 50% tariff on copper imports , a move that should benefit Freeport-McMoRan, analyst Carlos De Alba said. That's because most of the company's North American sales are copper rod, and the U.S. is a net importer of that metal, he said. \"We believe the market is not appreciating the benefits that will accrue to FCX from S232 copper tariffs,\" the analyst wrote in a Monday note. \"We expect that FCX will be able to raise pricing in its annual copper rod contracts for 2026, which account for the majority of the company's North America sales volumes.\" Seeing that the U.S. is a net importer, De Alba said Freeport-McMoRan will have the ability to increase prices for copper rod in the country. He predicted that the company will raise the all-in price of copper rod by 40% from the first quarter of 2026 to the fourth quarter of 2028. The analyst also thinks the recent reaction in the stock price is \"overdone,\" adding that the company will \"still benefit from hefty 50% tariffs on a majority of its U.S. volumes.\" FCX 1M mountain FCX, 1-month Shares initially rose on July 30, the day the Trump administration announced the copper tariffs, but then rolled over when the Trump administration clarified that the tariffs don't apply to \"copper input materials\" such as ores.

Driving the improved forecast are expected benefits from the tax bill signed in July, strong quarterly profits and an improved tariff outlook. \"At the post Liberation Day lows, our work suggested that the tariff proposal at that time would essentially take current year growth to essentially flat (in a worst case),\" strategist Scott Chronert wrote. \"From that point, tariff negotiations, Q1 earnings results (with renewed conviction in the AI infrastructure build out), OBBBA tax reforms, and now Q2 results all support higher index level earnings growth expectations.\" The U.S. has announced several trade deals since the April stock market low, including one with the European Union and another with Japan. On top of that, second-quarter earnings have largely beaten expectations. FactSet data shows that nearly 82% of S & P 500 companies have topped analysts' estimates. Chronert said corporate profits should remain strong. \"After steady downward revisions to consensus over the past year, we are now seeing a positive inflection.

It's now forecasting its second consecutive quarter of top-line growth.\nWhile the apparel company's customer file is still shrinking, its average order value has grown for seven consecutive quarters and every client cohort it's acquired since last summer has stayed with the company for longer, and spent more, it said.\nThe company, which charges a $20 styling fee for all \"fixes\" it sends, saw revenue per active client grow to $542 during its most recent quarter, up 3% from the year-ago period.\n\"It's been really affirming to us that, you know, with this return to growth, with this increase in engagement, with this increase in average order value, that we do have the right strategy,\" Baer told CNBC in an interview. \"We've got the right team and we're executing against it at a high level as well.\"\nStitch Fix hasn't posted an annual profit since 2019 but for three straight quarters, its year-over-year losses have narrowed. It regularly generates free cash flow and its balance sheet is free of debt.\nTo be sure, Stitch Fix's sales growth in its fiscal third quarter was modest, up just 0.7%, but it expects those gains to continue in its current quarter with sales projected to be flat to up 1.7% year over year.\nAnd the company's stock price is still down more than 95% from its pandemic high in January 2021. So far this year, it's up more than 3% as of Friday's close.\nThe rise and fall\nRetail and restaurant consultant Katrina Lake founded Stitch Fix in 2011 with the mission to combine data with personalized styling to develop a shopping experience that actually felt individualized at scale.\nIn a world where shoppers regularly groan about the banality of modern-day shopping, Stitch Fix sought to be the panacea by offering accessible personal stylists that could design and ship outfits specific to a customer's unique needs and preferences.\nBetween its IPO in 2017 and 2021, the company was able to acquire customers cheaply online and regularly posted revenue growth north of 20%.\nBut then the market grew crowded and suddenly, customers found themselves overwhelmed by all of the companies looking to sell them a monthly subscription box, whether it was a package of clothes, beauty products or dog treats.\nThe pandemic had changed the way customers were shopping for clothes, and Stitch Fix struggled to hang on to the customers it acquired. Some shoppers found the company's service clunky and confusing, and the assortment started to feel stale and out of style. The company's main value proposition, its personalized styling service, began to feel generic to some and disconnected from their personalized needs and style.\nWithin four years, the company went from an $11 billion buzzy startup to a tiny business that's now worth just under $600 million.\nIn January 2023, StitchFix announced that CEO Elizabeth Spaulding would be stepping down and Lake would return to the helm as its interim CEO and lead the search process for a new top executive.\nThe road to a comeback\nBefore joining Stitch Fix, Baer spent four years as a vice president on Walmart's e-commerce team during a critical phase of its online growth. He later joined Macy's as its chief customer and digital officer, where he remained until Lake hired him to revive the subscription styling service.\nBut Baer's career in retail started long before that: At 16, he started working in his family business, Baer's Furniture & Interior Design, a small chain of furniture stores dotted along the Florida coasts and founded by his great-grandfather in 1945.\n\"Growing up in a retail family business, when your name's on the door, it might mean a little bit extra,\" Baer said. \"At a very young age, I was also front and center with our clients. I was greeting them when they would walk into a showroom. I was asking them what it is that they were looking for. I was able to understand their needs and translate that into an exceptional service that we could provide.\"\nBaer said his first order of business after taking over at Stitch Fix was to understand the company's primary client and how that shopper was experiencing the service.\nWithin a few months, he was attending client focus groups, styling \"fixes\" — the curated shipments of clothes that go out to customers — and identifying parts of the process that could be improved for both shoppers and the company's roster of stylists.\nHe said he learned that customers liked the flexibility of Stitch Fix's model but wanted more of it, along with more head-to-toe styling that included accessories and footwear.\nIn Stitch Fix's early days, customers had one option – five items in a box at a recurring cadence with one discount mechanism – but these days, there's less rigidity. Customers can order a fix on demand, opt in for regular deliveries or shop through Stitch Fix's \"freestyle\" catalog, which allows them to instantly select and buy pieces based on their style profile.\nThese changes, along with larger fixes that can include eight items, is what's fueling Stitch Fix's growth in sales and average order value, said Baer.\nBehind the scenes, Baer said, he also sought to infuse \"retail best practices\" into every facet of the business, which has a model that comes with steep operational challenges. With no physical retail presence, Stitch Fix's online customer acquisition is expensive and the company has to manage the headaches of packing individual boxes and then processing the stream of free returns that come when clients don't like the items that came with their fix.\nUnder Baer's direction, the company has worked to streamline merchandising, pricing, transportation and warehouse operations. It exited the U.K. market, closed two fulfilment centers and cut staff to get costs closer in line with the size of the business. That work is still ongoing but has cut more than $100 million in annualized general and administrative expenses out of the business, Baer said. An additional $80 million in cost savings is slated for fiscal 2025, research firm William Blair said in a July note.\nAnother primary area of focus was adjusting Stitch Fix's assortment and revamping its private brand portfolio, which comes at a higher margin and makes up between 40% and 50% of sales, according to Stich Fix. The company has launched new private brands, and one of its men's lines, The Commons, is now a top 10 brand within the overall portfolio, said Baer.\nThe company has deployed generative artificial intelligence for product design and development and on Monday announced plans to expand its use of AI to improve its styling.\nA new AI \"style assistant\" will allow customers to talk to a chatbot that can recommend AI-generated outfits based on their individual preferences. It also plans to deploy a service that will allow clients to see themselves in the outfits suggested for them based on their stylist's insights and other data, which could reduce returns and boost conversion.\nFor those more eager for a human touch, the company is also launching a new platform that'll allow shoppers to connect directly with their stylist if they need fashion advice or help with their fix.\nMore than two years into his tenure, Baer said he's still attending monthly client focus groups and styling fixes for customers \"nearly every day,\" which he said allows him to stay close to customers.\n\"One client, she lives in Letcher, South Dakota, population 159, and it's only because of Stitch Fix that she has access to these brands, that she has the ability to wear product and clothes that are differentiated, unique and special within her community,\" said Baer. \"That feels great when I give her that confidence, when I'm able to create that joy for her.\"\nMore work ahead\nStitch Fix's turnaround comes at a difficult time for the apparel industry. Shoppers are more selective than ever with their discretionary dollars, and Stitch Fix's $20 styling fee can feel unnecessary when customers can purchase many of the same items the retailer offers right off the rack and directly from the brand.\nIn a June research note, financial firm Mizuho Securities said Stitch Fix's growth in average order value is expected to dissipate in fiscal 2026 as it laps its expansion into larger fixes. Its active client base is still declining, even as marketing expenses creep higher as a percentage of revenue, the firm said.\n\"While management attributed outsized growth to more opportunistic spend and some natural investment cycle, we caution whether it's becoming more expensive to keep the active customer base engaged,\" Mizuho analyst David Bellinger wrote.\nIn the note, Bellinger maintained his underperform rating on the stock and price target of $3.\nMeanwhile, William Blair analyst Dylan Carden upgraded his rating on the stock in July to outperform after meeting with Baer and the company's CFO. Carden contended the largest headwinds to the stock \"despite clear improvement in fundamentals\" are the idea that Stitch Fix is a niche product, its total addressable market is small and active customers are expected to eventually stall.\nCarden noted \"the model likely works for some but nowhere near any sort of critical mass of consumers.\"\n\"This would suggest it is less about Stitch Fix returning to active customer growth and more about being able to string together several quarters of growth at improving margin (i.e., healthy growth) before a skeptical market will start giving it credit,\" he wrote.\nNeil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, agreed the company is now on a better trajectory.\n\"The consumer economy hasn't been conducive to the growth of subscription platforms, but many of the improvements and enhancements Stitch Fix has been making are starting to pay dividends,\" said Saunders. \"It is becoming a stickier proposition which should drive some future growth.\"", "content_hash": "fe98da45ae90398a4e047a7ba7942bea", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Melius Research's Ben Reitzes downgraded Adobe to sell from hold, arguing that an AI-driven multiple contraction phase is in the early innings for software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies. That includes the likes of Atlassian and Club stock Salesforce . It can still get worse for these names, Reitzes said. Huge call. 2. The U.S. government is reportedly going to take a 15% cut on Nvidia and AMD chip sales to China, in exchange for Washington approving export licenses. Why such an unusual agreement? Is it to make sure China knows who is boss? Nvidia shares were slightly lower this morning. 3. Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is going to see President Donald Trump at the White House today, The Wall Street Journal reported . Can he talk Trump out of his demand that Tan be fired? Tan's venture capital firm Walden International did investment in hundreds of Chinese companies as well as American firms. 4. Wall Street is set for a modestly higher open this morning after a winning week, thanks in large part to Club name Apple's historic rally. I explored what drove that and where it goes from here in my Sunday column for Investing Club subscribers . 5. A few post-earnings price target cuts for Under Armour , including at UBS, which went to $7.50 a share from $8. The analysts, who kept their buy rating, acknowledged tariffs are really hurting the apparel maker. But they expect a strong fundamental turnaround next fiscal year. Citi is more circumspect. 6. Deutsche Bank is the latest shop to slash its price target on Club name Eli Lilly after last week's obesity pill data letdown. The analysts went to $900 from $1,010 but maintained their buy rating. Still reeling from that disappointment. Lilly shares fell another 2% Friday after Thursday's 14% tumble. 7. Susquehanna axed its price target on Fortinet to $80 from $110 following the cybersecurity company's earnings report contained some disappointing commentary on the firewall refresh cycle. Club-owned cyber firms CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are much better companies. 8. Shares of TKO Group and Paramount Skydance rose this morning after announcing a media rights deal. Fresh of its Skydance merger, Paramount said it's paying $7.7 billion over seven years for the U.S. rights to UFC. 9. Citi is bullish on AI computing provider CoreWeave ahead of earnings Tuesday and its share lockup expiration on Friday. Analysts argued CoreWeave's strong fundamentals will be able to absorb the additional stock that could enter the market. 10. Morgan Stanley upgraded e.l.f. Beauty to an overweight buy rating from equal weight, arguing consensus profit estimates look too low. The cosmetics maker is expanding its presence across the Sephora footprint and earnings could get a nice boost.

The Fed's rate also impacts how much interest you earn on cash and short-term bonds. If you're looking to stash away cash, you'd be smart to act before the Fed moves rates down, says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.\n\"If you want an interest rate that starts with a four, you're going to have to act quick,\" he says. \"Because that door is starting to close.\"\nWho should lock in a rate now\nIf you're stashing away cash for a short- to intermediate-term goal — say, five years or less — the first thing to ask yourself is when you are going to need the money.\nIf you're putting money into emergency savings or just aren't sure when you might need it, your first priority is being able to access the money freely, says McBride.\n\"You'd want to keep the money in something completely liquid, like a high-yield savings account,\" he says. Here are a couple of options.\nHigh-yield savings accounts\nYou can currently earn an annual percentage rate as high as 4.35% on a HYSA at online banks, according to Bankrate.\nThe problem with these, though, is that rates are subject to change, says McBride. Should the Fed lower rates in the fall, he says, the rate you get on a high-yield savings account is likely to come down with it.\nCertificates of deposit\nIf you have a more defined timeline for when you need the money, consider taking advantage of a certificate of deposit. These savings vehicles offer a fixed interest rate over a set period of time, such as six months, one year or two years.\nTypically, longer-dated CDs offer higher rates than shorter term ones, and overall, CDs tend to offer more attractive rates than HYSAs. You can currently buy a 10-month CD with an APR of 4.5%, according to Bankrate.\nThe tradeoff for the boost in yield is that you're generally required to leave your money in a CD for the duration of the fixed term. Take your money out early, and you'll generally owe the equivalent of several months' worth of interest in fees.\nTreasurys\nAnother option for short-term savers: bonds — debt issued by governments or corporations that investors can buy in exchange for a fixed interest rate over a set term. Similar to a CD, you can buy a bond with a set maturity date that lines up with when you'll need the money.\nPut your money into a 3-year Treasury — a U.S. government-backed bond that comes with virtually no risk of defaulting — and in three years you'll get your money back, plus whatever interest rate you locked in when you bought it. That makes these an appropriate pick for people looking to lock in a rate before the Fed turns the dial down, says McBride.\nWhen weighing whether a Treasury or a CD might be a better bet, do a little back-of-the-napkin math, he says.\n\"Treasuries are exempt from state and local taxes, whereas income on CDs is generally taxable at those levels,\" he says. \"The top-yielding CDs beat treasuries by a fairly healthy margin, but the state and local tax exemption could tilt the scales depending on where you live.\"\nWant to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

But recent updates boost our confidence that the ambitious satellite internet initiative could soon be a new cog in the tech giant's money-making machine. \"There's so much to like here\" with Amazon, Jim Cramer said in the wake of its second-quarter earnings report . \"Right now, we have [Amazon Web Services], advertising, and then we have retail. I think two years from now, we're also going to have Amazon Home and Kuiper.\" Perhaps it's not surprising that Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, is going after a market now dominated by Starlink and SpaceX, which was founded by his commercial space competitor, Elon Musk. Starlink launched its first satellites in 2019, the same year that Amazon signaled its intention to build a constellation of satellites to provide internet service. After years of development, Kuiper's first full deployment was earlier this year and they've continued since then, including on Monday. The power of these types of satellites has been on display during Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine. In a country devastated by war, Starlink has been used to provide internet in Ukraine. Starlink has also been used in the U.S. to help coordinate natural disaster relief efforts, including last month's deadly floods in Texas. Any rivalry between the billionaire space cowboys aside, delivering broadband via satellite to 400 million to 500 million households worldwide without access to high-speed internet is big business. The kicker for Amazon? Getting new people and businesses connected to the internet in hard-to-reach places gives the company a chance to bring new customers to its Prime ecosystem and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. \"Amazon is as strong as it's ever been,\" Jim added. Despite delivering a better-than-expected top and bottom line, Amazon shares fell more than 8% the day after earnings on Aug. 1. The decline stemmed from a modest revenue beat from AWS and mixed third-quarter guidance. Jim called the drop a buying opportunity for investors. Shares have recovered some of their losses since then. Beyond the headlines were promising developments for Kuiper. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on the earnings call that Kuiper has already signed enterprise and government contracts, even though it has not yet launched commercially. That's expected to happen later this year or early 2026. The company plans to launch a network of over 3,000 satellites into low Earth orbit. The rollout is happening fast. After launching its first satellites in April, Kuiper sent up its third batch in mid-July — using rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket to carry 24 Kuiper satellites into orbit. Additional satellites were sent up Monday morning after some weather-related launch delays, bringing the size of Amazon's constellation above 100. Kuiper must have 1,600 satellites in orbit by the end of July 2026 to meet a deadline set by the Federal Communications Commission. Starlink currently leads the satellite internet market with roughly 8,000 satellites and about 5 million users globally. Still, Jim sees Kuiper as a formidable challenger, predicting that \"Kuiper is going to rival Starlink.\" Some on Wall Street agree the venture could strengthen Amazon's so-called flywheel. \"Kuiper will be a compelling offering and easy add for consumers (Prime), enterprises (AWS), and governments,\" BMO Capital Markets wrote in a recent note, echoing Jim's analysis. To be sure, analysts see the end of 2027 as the earliest Amazon could see any meaningful revenue contribution from Kuiper. With that long runway comes a high price tag. Kuiper requires significant upfront capital investment to scale its network and acquire customers. That cash burn, which is estimated to total more than $10 billion , can be seen by investors as affecting Amazon's profitability. While that may be the case in the near term, Jassy previously said that Kuiper \"has really good return on invested capital.\" In a \"Mad Money\" interview in late June, Jassy likened Kuiper to having \"a lot of the same financial characteristics as AWS,\" which Amazon has built into the world's largest cloud provider by revenue. While new ventures carry risk, we take comfort in Amazon's proven track record in taking self-started internal ventures and turning them into thriving businesses. AWS was one for sure, but Amazon also successfully launched Kindle, which disrupted the publishing and eBook industries. Prime Video is another example, and the list goes on and on. So, Kuiper might be costly upfront, but Amazon has shown it can manage capital efficiency and scale with discipline. Following its latest earnings report and an upbeat update on Kuiper, we reiterated our buy-equivalent 1 rating on Amazon stock and increased our price target to $250 from $240.

Analysts estimate earnings per share (EPS) of 98 cents on revenue of approximately $14.63 billion, reflecting 7.3% year-over-year revenue growth and about 16% year-on-year free cash flow growth to just under $4.1 billion. The company's performance has been influenced by trends in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, cybersecurity demand and enterprise digital transformation. Cisco's year-to-date total return is nearly more than 23%, outperforming QQQ by ~11% as of Friday. However, macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential tariffs and competitive pressures, introduce risks. Bull case: The bullish outlook for Cisco centers on its positioning in high-growth areas such as AI infrastructure and software-centric services, which are expected to drive sustained revenue expansion and margin improvement. On the May 14 earnings call, the company highlighted that they had received over $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders year to date, exceeding their fiscal year target early. (Cisco’s fiscal year runs from Aug. 1 to July 31). Cisco has “three pillars” in their AI opportunity: AI training infrastructure for webscale AI inference/enterprise clouds AI network connectivity. Additionally, Cisco announced a partnership with Nvidia to create a unified architecture and secure AI solutions. Cisco's valuation remains relatively attractive, trading at 18.9x FY estimates and 17.8x forward adjusted earnings estimates. This multiple is more in keeping with a cyclical/hardware-based business, while Cisco's been shifting towards recurring revenue streams, with software subscriptions now comprising over 50% of total revenue. Not only do technology services tend to be more consistent than hardware sales, but the cost of providing them is considerably lower. Product revenue is estimated to be ~48% of the total, while associated costs are ~75% of the total for the trailing 12 months. Put differently, services are more consistent AND have a higher margin. The company's FY free cash flow estimate of $13.4 billion represents a free cash flow yield of about 4.7%, Bear case: Cisco's traditional networking hardware faces commoditization risks, and while AI orders are promising, the greater than $1 billion in AI orders the company highlighted in May represented between 2%-3% of the company’s total FY-to-date revenues of more than $40 billion. One could argue that the stock's significant year-to-date outperformance reflects significant optimism, and the aforementioned cost of revenue from the product/hardware side could lead to margin compression in the event of inventory overstocking. Analysts are also forecasting $4.03 in adjusted EPS for FY2026, only 6.3% annually. That's not only less than many AI technology companies, but actually well below the rate of earnings growth exhibited by the S & P 500 generally, although these two are closely related, admittedly due to the outsize effects of technology behemoths like Nvidia. Earnings related implied move (options): The options market is implying a move of approximately 5%, which is in line with the historical average. One way to play a modestly bullish view in Cisco is by purchasing a longer-dated December 72.5 calls financed in part with the sale of a nearer-dated strangle, such as the September 67.5/80. This would maintain a longer-term bullish perspective while seeking to capitalize on the “vol crush” that frequently follows earnings in the nearer-dated September options. DISCLOSURES: None.

That vehicle launch is slated for 2027.\nExecutives had teased the announcement on the company's latest earnings call as its next \"Model T moment.\" Ford said the starting price of the new EV truck, $30,000, will be roughly the same as the famed Model T, when adjusted for inflation.\nFord noted that lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for the new family of EVs will be assembled in the U.S. and not imported from China.\nFarley said during an event in Louisville on Monday that the announcement comes as the automotive industry is at a crossroads because of new technology and competition.\n\"We knew that the Chinese would be the major player for us globally, companies like BYD, new startups from around the world, big technology has their ambition in the auto space. They're all coming for us, legacy automotive companies,\" Farley said. \"We needed a radical approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle.\"\nThe changes also come as Ford and other U.S. manufacturers are navigating shifting EV policies under President Donald Trump, including an end to EV tax credits that will take effect after Sept. 30.\nFord said Monday that the Louisville plant will \"secure\" about 2,200 jobs, but noted that once it's retooled for EV production, it will employ about 600 fewer workers than in its current configuration.\nAccording to the Ford website, the plant employed more than 3,000 employees as of April 2024.\nFarley told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during an interview with \"Squawk on the Street\" on Monday that the automaker continues to add new jobs elsewhere.\n\"Ford's the only car company in America that's added 13,000 jobs since the recession.

The Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) recorded its biggest one-day gain on record, rising more than 26%.\n\"We're looking at reclassification,\" Trump told reporters Monday during a press conference to announce the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C. \"We'll make a determination ... over the next few weeks.\"\n\"It's a very complicated subject,\" he added.\nPenny stocks\nMany stocks in the sector now sell for less than a dollar per share, meaning a move of just a few cents can lead to a large percentage change. Despite Monday's rally, many of these stocks are far below their all-time highs.\nShares of publicly traded pot growers and distributors surged before the press conference after a Wall Street Journal report late Friday, citing people familiar with the matter, said Trump was considering changing marijuana to a less-dangerous drug classification. Trump disclosed he was considering such a move during a fundraiser at his New Jersey golf club earlier this month, the people said.\nUnder federal law, cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug in a group that also includes heroin and cocaine. Previously, reclassification discussions have centered on moving the drug to Schedule III, a class that includes steroids and Tylenol with codeine.\nReclassification would allow marijuana companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment interest, among other benefits.\nYearlong process\nTilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC he expects the process of reclassification to take about a year. Trump discussing the matter publicly, and saying he plans to make a decision in coming weeks, is cause for optimism in the industry, Simon said.\n\"Trump gets things done,\" Simon said. \"He wouldn't be talking about it ... if he's not going to get something done.\"\nTrump's backing can brighten the outlook, but technically he cannot reclassify the drug alone. The Controlled Substances Act places that authority under the Attorney General, who historically has delegated it to the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.\nA move from Schedule I to Schedule III would be \"a game changer\" for the roughly $80 billion market, Tim Seymour, investing chief at Seymour Asset Management, said on CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\" on Monday. He noted that such a change seems to have bipartisan support.\n\"It does not mean that it won't be a complicated trade,\" Seymour said. \"But it does mean that you're investing now well ahead of a lot of institutional capital if you are, in fact, investing into this sector.\"", "content_hash": "8a4f39cc6b8bf26351a968180d243c73", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Nvidia's Huang visited Trump in the White House on Friday.\n\"I said, 'listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country,'\" Trump said at a news conference in Washington.\nTrump said that Nvidia's H20 is an \"old chip that China already has\" and is \"obsolete.\" He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance.\n\"The Blackwell is super-duper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that,\" Trump said, adding that it was possible to make a deal for a \"somewhat enhanced in a negative way\" version of Blackwell.\n\"That's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years,\" Trump said.\nOne reason for the U.S. export controls is fear that providing advanced chips to China could allow the foreign power to leapfrog the U.S. in AI capabilities. Many have said that could pose a threat to the national security of the U.S.\nTrump said that China already has chips with some similar capabilities to the H20.\nHuang has said that it is better for U.S. national security if Chinese AI developers use U.S. technology, and that denying them access to Nvidia chips would actually encourage the Chinese chip industry to develop and catch up.\n\"He's selling a essentially old chip,\" Trump said. \"Huawei has a similar chip.\"\nThe H20 is a Chinese-specific chip that has had its performance slowed down. It is related to Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S. The H20 was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on AI chips in 2023.\nIn April, the Trump administration said it would require a license to export the H20 chip, and in May, Huang said that \"effectively closed\" the market off to Nvidia. Huang said that Nvidia was expecting to sell about $8 billion in H20 chips in the July quarter before sales were stopped.\n\"While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,\" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday.\nTrump on Monday also said that Huang plans to visit him again to negotiate export licenses for the Blackwell chips.\n\"I think he's coming to see me again about that,\" Trump said.\nA White House official confirmed to CNBC that Advanced Micro Devices, the second-place AI chipmaker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308.", "content_hash": "29393a67623294dadea24eeb68832e32", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The head of public policy and municipal strategy at Hilltop Securities has been warning investors that a \" window of opportunity \" may close fast once the idea that the Federal Reserve is destined to cut interest rates gains in popularity. Now, he's seeing signs that may have started. \"The ship is leaving the port, and investors should stay alert to avoid missing this opportunity,\" Kozlik wrote in a note last week. Yields on municipal securities declined recently, reinforcing this view, the strategist noted. July's disappointing jobs report , showing signs of a potential slowdown , further strengthened the argument. Bond yields move inversely to prices. Plus, recent economic data, Traders now see a about an 86% chance of a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve, according to the CME FedWatch tool , which uses 30-Day fed funds futures prices to determine the odds. \"A combination of either the market and/or the Fed could cause yields to drop, further closing that window of opportunity,\" Kozlik said in an interview with CNBC. The average municipal bond yielded 3.9% late last week, down from 4% the week before, helped by a rally in the Treasury market, said Cooper Howard, fixed-income strategist at Schwab Center for Financial Research. For instance, the Schwab Municipal Bond ETF recently had a 30-day SEC yield of 3.78% and a 0.03% expense ratio. SCMB YTD mountain Schwab Municipal Bond ETF year to date Those yields are before taxes are taken into consideration. Interest earned from muni bonds is free from federal tax and, if the bond holder lives in the state where the bond is issued, exempt from state and any local tax too. For investors in the top tax bracket, the tax-equivalent yield is around 6.5%, Howard said. In addition, municipal bond yields are even more attractive on a relative basis when compared to Treasury yields, especially at the longer end of the yield curve, he noted. The municipal-to-Treasury ratio for 10-year bonds is about 75%, meaning munis yield about 75% of what similar Treasury bonds yield. While Treasurys are free of state taxes, they are not exempt from federal taxes. \"The longer portion of the yield curve, if you're an investor who can stomach a little bit of interest-rate risk, we think that that can make sense,\" Howard said. Yet that relative value can soon come down as well, Kozlik said. Over the last couple weeks, cross-over —or nontraditional — buyers have been investing in municipal bonds, he said. \"Those non-traditional and non-regular buyers have been pretty active, and when those non-traditional buyers jump in, that's one of the things that oftentimes brings down that relative value,\" he explained. The municipal-to-Treasury ratio hasn't fallen quickly because there has been heavy primary issuance, he said. \"So on the one hand, that means that the opportunity for municipal-to-Treasury ratios being very attractive could continue for a couple of days — but I'm saying days, I'm not saying weeks,\" Kozlik said. \"So this is something that when individual investors see this, they can't wait.\" Where to find opportunity Kozlik largely recommends high-grade, well-rated state and local general obligation bonds and revenue-authority bonds. \"Municipal credit is still very, very strong,\" he said. \"It's stronger than it was before the Covid crisis.\" In addition, there can be some value found in beat-up higher-education bonds , he said. While some in the sector are suffering, bonds from a large state system or large organization that isn't having an enrollment problem look good, he said. Howard doesn't focus on general obligation bonds versus revenue bonds, or any specific sector over another. \"It's important to look at what is backing that bond, and where are they driving their revenues from,\" he said. Creating a ladder of varying duration can also make sense, he said. He suggests an average duration of six years. \"It really takes the guesswork out of trying to time interest rates,\" he said.", "content_hash": "aee17296ea8457c3e9f107828efb1882", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Still, it's too early to determine a valuation for a potential deal, they added.\nAt the same time, Sinclair is also looking to spin off or split its ventures unit, which includes pay-TV network the Tennis Channel and marketing technology business Compulse. In 2023, Sinclair reorganized its company into two operating unites — local media, or the broadcast stations, and ventures, which also can act as an investment vehicle.\nThe company has already received board approval to explore its options. While Sinclair has had significant discussions with potential merger partners, there is no assurance a deal or spinoff will ultimately take place.\nSinclair shares were up nearly 13% in after market trading.\nThe media industry broadly expects deregulation under the Trump administration, particularly in the broadcast space, which could usher in a wave mergers and acquisitions.\nFederal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has publicly said in recent months that he would support getting rid of broadcast station ownership rules and caps.\nSinclair has 178 TV stations, which are affiliated with major broadcasters like ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW across 78 markets.\nThe company reported second-quarter earnings last week in which total revenue declined 5% to $784 million and total advertising revenue dropped 6% to $322 million.\nBroadcast TV station group owners have suffered in recent years as consumers continue to cut their traditional pay-TV bundles. Most stations make the bulk of their money from so-called retransmission fees, which are paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors, like Charter Communications and DirecTV, for the right to carry the stations.\nAdvertising, particularly political advertising during local elections, also drives revenue for the companies.\nSinclair has a market capitalization of roughly $875 million, with an enterprise value of more than $4.3 billion, according to FactSet. Its market value has dipped significantly as pay-TV subscribers decline.\nLast year, CNBC reported that Sinclair was working with Moelis and looking to sell more than 30% of its broadcast TV footprint, or more than 60 stations. CEO Chris Ripley has said in recent earnings calls that the company was open to offloading parts of its business or exploring deals.\nOther broadcast station deals may be in the works, too.

Beneath the Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports on consumer and producer prices will be simmering questions over the data's validity. Those concerns have accelerated as budget cutbacks have forced the agency to change the way it collects data. On top of that, President Donald Trump's decision to fire the BLS commissioner after the July nonfarm payrolls data was released raised worries that the bureau could be politicized. Doubt over the accuracy and integrity of the data is a serious issue considering how much BLS work is used to formulate policy, calculate Social Security payments and inform any number of other political and economic decisions. \"I feel like this data that is coming out is getting much less reliable, and this has been building for a long time,\" DoubleLine CEO Jeffery Gundlach said last week on CNBC. Staffing and funding is one issue. Trump's decision earlier this month to fire Erika McEntarfer as the BLS chief is another. The move \"has raised questions about whether and by how much the quality of official data produced by official U.S. government agencies could be compromised,\" Morgan Stanley economist Michael Gapen said in a note. \"Official U.S. data has never been perfect, but has been of high quality, compiled impartially, and useful in the setting of policy.\" Questions on multiple fronts Gapen's sentiments mirror those around Wall Street, where written commentary has broken down the various issues the BLS has already faced in terms of budget cuts that have pushed it to alter the way it collects some data. Also, notable revisions the BLS has applied to its critical monthly payrolls count have raised concerns, including accusations from Trump that the McEntarfer-led BLS was manipulating the data for political purposes. BLS officials weren't immediately available to respond to CNBC requests for comment. Outside political circles, there are few on Wall Street who place credence in the notion that the BLS is doing anything nefarious with the data. However, the bureau's often primitive way of collecting jobs data — largely through phone calls and written surveys — has fed into caution about the reliability of pre-revisions data releases. Survey response rates have been steadily sliding, forcing the BLS into bigger revisions. \"Significant downward revisions to job growth and increased imputation for CPI have raised questions about the reliability of the official statistics,\" Bank of America senior U.S. economist Aditya Bhave wrote. \"We argue the data remain reliable, though we would recommend being careful with the initial jobs data.\" Looking for inflation clues On the market's plate this week, though, are the two key inflation readings, first with the consumer price index on Tuesday, then the producer price measure, considered a gauge of costs at the wholesale level, on Thursday. At issue for the BLS is its move to stop collecting CPI data from several cities due to staffing limitations, as well as the growing use of imputed data, or estimating price movements in areas where it can't get exact information. In those cases, the BLS will try to use data from another source, preferably somewhere near the locale it is surveying, but sometimes it has to use prices from other urban areas as assumptions. When the imputed data comes from a local source it has a higher degree of reliability. But Gapen and other economists worry that if the BLS has to rely on \"different cell\" imputation, the chances for higher variance increase. Estimates are that some 35% of BLS data for its price reports is affected in some way by imputing. Bank of America estimates that a combination of different-cell imputation and the varied impact of tariffs likely will alter the headline CPI reading by only a basis point or two — 0.01 or 0.02 percentage point. It's still a consideration, though. \"In more normal times, that may be too small to matter, but in today's environment every basis point counts,\" Bhave said. \"Still we do not think the BLS' decision to reduce the CPI sample is enough to warrant alarm over the signal from the inflation data.\" Impact on Fed moves Precision will matter as the Federal Reserve closely monitors inflation data and charts its monetary policy course. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the all-items CPI to show a 0.2% increase for July, putting the 12-month inflation rate at 2.8%, up 0.1 percentage point from June. Excluding food and energy, the respective forecasts for core inflation are 0.3% for the month and 3% for the year, the latter up 0.1 percentage point from a month ago. The Fed targets inflation at 2%. Beyond those numbers, Wall Street will be poring through the data for readings on tariff-sensitive items. Should those goods and services not point significantly higher, it would encourage the Fed to cut rates in September. However, higher readings could keep policymakers in the wait-and-see posture that has dominated the year so far. \"Sequential firming in inflation is one key factor behind our view that the Fed will remain on hold at the September meeting despite recent employment data that point to a sharp slowdown in labor demand,\" Morgan Stanley's Gapen wrote. Traders widely expect the central bank to cut the fed funds in September, then at least once more before the end of the year, but Wall Street economists are in multiple camps. For instance, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America both see no cuts this year, while JPMorgan Chase anticipates three — equal to one at each of the remaining meetings. Those forecasts could change, though, depending on what the data says — and how the BLS data is viewed. \"Taken at face value, the new procedures implemented by the BLS should not introduce systematic bias into its estimates of CPI inflation, but it will increase volatility in future CPI prints,\" Gapen wrote. \"That said, the devil is in the details.\"", "content_hash": "b41e151959bf116d402d38dd68304318", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It may seem silly to buy digital coins that are traded on a very expensive global network of number-crunching computers. Legendary investor Warren Buffett doesn't see any real-world value in Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) at all, because the darn thing doesn't actually make anything or provide a service. And besides all that, Bitcoin will likely never get back to the skyrocketing gains seen in the early years.\nSo I completely understand if you're skeptical about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2025. But the times, they are a-changin'. You may want to set up a small Bitcoin stake as part of a larger, diversified investment portfolio, preferably before the end of the year. Here are three interconnected reasons why.\n1. First and foremost: Regulatory progress\nOne of the biggest hurdles for cryptocurrencies has always been the murky legal landscape. Without a clear legal framework for buying, trading, and owning cryptocurrencies, large investors like billionaires and financial institutions are unlikely to enter this market. That's bad news for the Bitcoin community's ambition of becoming a digital version of wealth-storing gold.\nHold those thoughts; I'll get back to them in a minute.\nBut in 2025, there is finally some meaningful progress as governments and regulators clarify the rules for buying, selling, and holding Bitcoin. The Trump administration is not only exploring firm crypto rules, but also set up a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a United States Digital Asset Stockpile to manage cryptocurrencies under a federal banner.\nThis new transparency is helping to tame the wild west reputation of crypto and giving investors more confidence that they're operating on solid ground.\n2. Result: Bitcoin is becoming a better \"digital gold\"\nLet's get back to the wealth-storage train of thought.\nWith the regulatory fog lifting, Bitcoin's original pitch as \"digital gold\" is starting to look a lot more credible. The asset will never have more than 21 million coins on the market, and 19.9 million of them have already been created. This fixed supply and Bitcoin's decentralized design have always made it attractive during periods of inflation or currency turmoil.\nNow, with official recognition and improving oversight, it's easier to see Bitcoin as a legitimate long-term store of value -- one that isn't just for tech enthusiasts or risk-takers, but for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio.\nFor example, noted growth investor Cathie Wood noted that the Bitcoin supply is now growing slower than the amount of new physical gold mined each year. Therefore, Wood sees Bitcoin as a better inflation hedge than gold bullion, and suggests holding more Bitcoin than gold in a risk-hedged and diversified investment portfolio.\n3. Last but not least: Clearer rules inspire large-scale investors\nAnd that brings me back to the idea of large-scale investors motivating any asset's long-term price moves -- including Bitcoin's.\nWhen the rules are clear, the big players feel more comfortable joining the game. In fact, they may have felt legally obliged to leave Bitcoin alone until the trading manual cleared up.\nIn 2025, that's exactly what's happening. Pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors -- once worried about regulatory uncertainty -- are beginning to allocate capital to Bitcoin. The presence of Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) makes a big difference, and the leading iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF(NASDAQ: IBIT) already has $85 billion of assets under management. That's a record-breaking growth story, just 19 months after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs.\nThe institutional investor participation boosts market stability and also signals growing mainstream acceptance. And that starts the tick-tock motion of a financial flywheel -- broader market acceptance drives Bitcoin prices higher, which throws more fuel on the digital asset's marketing fires.\nSo the pieces of the Bitcoin puzzle are coming together in 2025. I can't guarantee a smooth ride to the moon, but it looks like a sensible idea to include at least a little bit of Bitcoin in your long-term portfolio. Whether you buy the cryptocurrency directly or rely on ETFs like the easily available iShares fund, you don't have to go all-in.\nJust a dab could do a lot of good, as long as the bullish Bitcoin trends I see today continue to play out. And I think starting to get in on Bitcoin before the calendar turns to 2026 is a good idea. Keep it small enough that you'll be just fine if Buffett's Bitcoin skepticism turns out to be more accurate than Wood's bullish view.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

But thanks to Joby Aviation(NYSE: JOBY), the idea of catching a flying taxi is slowly edging into reality.\nThe company's electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft are designed to carry passengers over congested cities at speeds upwards of 200 mph. And they are quieter than a helicopter and have zero emissions. This vision isn't theoretical. Joby has already demonstrated eVTOLs in New York and Dubai and is moving through the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA's) certification process as I write.\nWith major strategic partners, a strong cash position, and an aggressive market expansion plan, Joby could be one of the first to make commercial flying taxis a real business. The question for investors is whether this growth stock is ready for takeoff today, or might it be wiser to wait until the company has a little more grounding?\nFrom blueprints to boarding passes\nJoby is trying to solve a problem that most city drivers face everyday: traffic. And not just any traffic. Horribly congested traffic, the kind that makes you wish you were anywhere (even at the DMV, with slow internet) but stuck in it.\nTo get there, however, Joby needs a few things to work in its favor. The first is full FAA-type certification, the regulatory green light that will let it fly passengers in its eVTOLS. The second is the infrastructure to make its vision practical, that is, a network of vertiports, charging stations, and terminals in the right locations so customers can board, fly, and land without the experience feeling like more hassle than just staying in the car.\nSo far, the company has checked off some big early boxes. It already holds FAA Part 135 certification, which means it's cleared to operate as an air carrier with approved aircraft. It's also moving to lock down prime real estate for takeoff and landing, from Manhattan heliports to Dubai's planned aerial taxi hubs.\nBut that doesn't mean the company is smooth flying -- yet. Its biggest \"unknown\" is time. Every month that slips by without full FAA certification pushes profitability that much further into the future. Add in the fact that it's burning cash each quarter, and you start to see why patience -- and a deep cash cushion -- are non-negotiable.\nBig names, big bets\nSpeaking of cash, where is Joby getting money for research and development?\nWell, here's where the story gets interesting.\nAlthough Joby is pre-revenue, it has an impressive ecosystem of backers and partners. Back in 2022, Delta Air Lines(NYSE: DAL) invested about $60 million in Joby, with the expectation that Joby would eventually create a premium service for Delta customers. More recently, Toyota(NYSE: TM) committed $894 million to helping Joby with certification and commercial production of its electric air taxis. In perhaps its boldest move, Joby plans to acquire Blade Air Mobility(NASDAQ: BLDE), which would help it gain access to central terminals in New York, Southern California, and Europe.\nMeanwhile, international expansion is already underway. In Dubai, Joby signed an exclusive six-year agreement with the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) to launch aerial tax services there in 2026. Finally, Joby recently announced that it's partnering with L3Harris to develop hybrid eVTOLs for defense applications, with demonstrations planned in 2026.\nThings seem to be rolling. But before we get too bullish, let's look at its finances.\nThe numbers under the hood\nHere's where reality checks in.\nOver the last 12 months, Joby generated just $110,000 in revenue, essentially none, while recording a net loss of about $596 million. Just in the first quarter of 2025, it posted a loss of $82 million, or $0.11 per share, driven largely by spending in research and development. To add fuel to the fire, cash burn was $111 million for the quarter.\nThe balance sheet, however, is a strength, largely because of partners. Joby holds about $813 million in cash and short-term investments. That net cash position gives the company some runway to fund operations without immediate dilution.\nStill, with a market cap near $17 billion, the stock is priced well ahead of fundamentals. It's price-per-book (P/B) ratio -- which measures how richly the market values the company relative to the net assets on its balance sheet -- sits around 20. That's steep compared with the S&P 500's median of about 3. Even Archer Aviation(NYSE: ACHR), Joby's primary competitor, is trading at roughly 5.6 times book value. That doesn't mean Joby can't grow into its valuation, but it does underscore how much future success is baked into today's price.\nVerdict: Should you hitch a ride?\nWhen people talk about Joby's risks, they usually circle the big ones: FAA certification, steady cash burn, competition. But there's a second layer of risks -- call them structural -- that could make investing in Joby choppy in the short term.\nStart with the skies themselves. Urban airspace is already a juggling act, and air traffic control in cities like New York and LA runs hot most days. If regulators decide to keep eVTOL traffic on a tight leash, Joby's flight schedule could end up thinner than its business plan assumes.\nOn the ground, vertiports have to be built, and convincing neighborhoods to welcome them is another story entirely. Costs could also be a problem: insurance, pilot pay, and battery charging might keep fares higher than commuters are willing to swallow.\nStill, if you believe Joby can navigate these headwinds and execute on time, the payoff could be big. For long-term investors who can tolerate volatility, this is a speculatve bet on a market that doesn't exist yet but could make ground transportation look radically different ten years from now.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Joby Aviation right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Joby Aviation, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Joby Aviation wasn’t one of them.

Meanwhile, its second-quarter results easily soared past its earlier cautious guidance. The company grew its Q2 revenue by 31% to $2.68 billion, which was well ahead of the $2.55 billion analyst consensus, as compiled by LSEG.\nGross merchandise volume (GMV) on its platform also jumped 31% to $87.8 billion, led by a 42% increase in international GMV. Europe was particularly strong, with GMV soaring 49%. The company's consumer-facing Shop App, meanwhile, saw GMV skyrocket 140%, helped by artificial intelligence (AI) enhancements.\nOverall merchant solution revenue climbed 37% to $2 billion, helped by GMV growth and the increased penetration of Shopify Payments, its payment processing platform. Shopify Payments has expanded into 60 new countries just this year, with multi-currency support now available in 20 countries.\nSubscription revenue, meanwhile, increased by nearly 17% to $656 million, helped by higher-priced subscription plans.\nShopify continues to add more large brands to its platform, including Starbucks, Canada Goose, and Signet Jewelers, among others. It said the type of clients it serves keeps expanding, as seen by it adding Boart Longyear, a global leader in mining and drilling services. That's a far cry from the small, drop-ship businesses that Shopify was once known for serving as its primary customer base.\nLooking ahead, Shopify forecast third-quarter revenue growth at a mid-to-high twenties percentage rate. That's above the 21.7% growth that analysts were forecasting, according to StreetAccount.\nThe company said it has not seen any major changes in demand or buyer behavior related to tariffs, although many of its merchants have raised prices. It said any potential effect from the elimination of the de minimis exemption by the U.S. is still early, but that only 4% of its GMV globally is currently shipped under the exemption.\nMeanwhile, it is turning to AI to help drive growth. It's created a Shopify Catalog that simplifies the process for apps and AI agents to search and pull product data to make sure results are up to date. It also just launched a Universal Cart, where customers can hold items from multiple stores all in one place.\nIs it too late to buy the stock?\nShopify continues to demonstrate strong growth. It's done a great job of moving upmarket, showing the power of its platform. At the same time, it's starting to grow with its customers, as Shopify Payment adoption continues to increase. The company is also constantly innovating, which helps drive revenue for both it and its customers.\nIt's expanding into new areas, as seen with the addition of Boart Longyear as a customer. Newer areas like offline and business-to-business, which saw its GMV double in the quarter, also continue to show strong growth.\nInternational markets, particularly Europe, were a standout in Q2. With 68% of its revenue coming from the U.S. and Canada, the company has a massive opportunity to continue expanding internationally.\nWhile the company is not immune to a consumer slowdown, thus far, it hasn't seen any effect from tariffs. That's a good sign.\nLooking at valuation, Shopify now trades at a more than 18 times forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio based on 2025 analyst estimates and 15 times 2026 estimates. That's much higher than the 8 to 12 times multiple it has traded at in recent years.\nWhile I like the strides that Shopify is making, I would not chase this recent rally, given its valuation and the weak U.S. job market.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Shopify right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Shopify, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Shopify wasn’t one of them.

As such, this uncertainty has resulted in Q3 production cuts and negative revisions to second-half 2025 RD earnings.\nOverall, the analyst expressed optimism about Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO)’s core refining strength despite the RD segment’s upcoming challenges. Piper Sandler believes the stock remains a solid long-term investment.\nOperating across the U.S., Americas, Europe, and the rest of the world, Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) deals in petroleum-based and low-carbon transportation fuels and petrochemical products.\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of VLO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

For instance, Ofgem has recently required energy suppliers to disclose their internal audit capabilities in its updated Financial Responsibility Principle Guidance.\nThe letter concludes: “Setting a clear regulatory expectation for broadband companies to have appropriate internal audit arrangements would strengthen independent oversight of how key risks are managed, improve organisational resilience, build investor confidence, and support the growth of the UK’s digital economy.”\nAdditionally, both the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have made internal audit a requirement in the financial services industry.\nFurthermore, the Independent Water Commission chair Sir Jon Cunliffe recently recommended the dissolution of Ofwat, advocating for improved governance and oversight in the water sector.\nIn light of these issues, the Chartered IIA has urged Ofcom to take immediate steps to enhance governance and oversight for broadband providers, given their critical role in the UK's digital infrastructure.\nChartered IIA chief executive Anne Kiem said: “Broadband companies are now essential to daily life and the economy. Yet, nearly half of the UK’s major broadband providers are operating without internal audit.\n“This is a serious audit and governance weakness. We’ve seen time and again the damage caused when companies collapse due to failures that might have been prevented with proper internal controls.

The U.S. side said the decision was up to President Donald Trump. So far there has been no formal announcement about whether he will endorse an extension or push ahead with the higher tariffs.\nThe uncertainty has left businesses in limbo and a decision to raise the import duties could jolt world markets.\nSILENCE FROM WASHINGTON AND BEIJING\nTrump has repeatedly shifted deadlines and tariff rates, and neither side has indicated what it plans for Tuesday. Extending the Aug. 12 deadline for reaching a trade agreement with China would forestall earlier threats of tariffs of up to 245%.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump was deciding about another 90-day delay to allow time to work out details of an agreement setting tariffs on most products at 50%, including extra import duties related to illicit trade in the powerful opiate fentanyl.\nHigher tariffs are aimed at offsetting the huge, chronic U.S. trade deficit with China, which hit a 21-year low in July as the threat of tariffs bit into Chinese exports.\nIt's not unusual for the U.S. to give hints on where talks stand, but it's rare for China to make announcements until major decisions are set. So far, Beijing's refrained from commenting ahead of Tuesday's deadline.\nIn an interview with Fox News taped on Thursday but aired on Sunday, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Trump was considering additional tariffs on Beijing because of China's purchases of Russian oil. But he said Trump “hasn't made any firm decisions.”\nCHINA RESISTED CUTTING AN EARLY BARGAIN\nProhibitively high tariffs on Chinese exports to the United States would put huge pressure on Beijing at a time when the Chinese economy, the world's second largest, is still recovering from a prolonged downturn in its property market. Lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have left millions of people reliant on “gig work,” crimping the job market. Higher import taxes on small parcels from China have also hurt smaller factories and layoffs have accelerated,\nBut the U.S. relies heavily on imports from China for all sorts of products, from household goods and clothing to wind turbines, basic computer chips, electric vehicle batteries and the rare earths needed to make them. That gives Beijing some powerful leverage in the negotiations with Washington.", "content_hash": "5581fb2365e78ae6e36b58e75d0a40da", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Gold prices have been on a run lately, and what more convenient place can you find to buy a commodity?\nIn fact, the club store sells gold bars, silver coins, and platinum bars — three precious metals that many investors use to diversify their wealth.\nLearn more: How to invest in gold in 4 steps\nThe club store first offered gold bars in 2023, then added silver (SI=F) and platinum over the next year or so. Meanwhile, gold is hanging around its all-time high. Gold, silver, and platinum are all up more than 22% so far in 2025.\nIntrigued by Costco's precious metals offering?

The precious metal was in a growth phase from 2009 to 2011. It then trended down, failing to set a new high for nine years.\nIn those lackluster years for gold, your position will negatively impact your overall investment returns. If that feels problematic, a lower allocation percentage is more appropriate. On the other hand, you may be willing to accept gold's underperforming years so you can benefit more in the good years. In this case, you can target a higher percentage.\nThe precious metal has been in the news lately, and many analysts are bullish on gold. In May, Goldman Sachs Research predicted gold would reach $3,700 a troy ounce by year-end 2025. That would equate to a 40% increase for the year, based on gold’s January 2 opening price of $2,633. Rising demand from central banks, along with uncertainty related to changing U.S. tariff policy, are the factors driving the increase.\nIf you are interested in learning more about gold’s historical value, Yahoo Finance has been tracking the historical price of gold since 2000.", "content_hash": "d1eaee7986e99bef700bb37915a11e76", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n-\nPhillip Securities upgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Neutral from Reduce with a price target of $127, up from $112. The firm cites stabilizing travel demand for the upgrade. It sees \"modest\" sales growth through 2025 for Airbnb, driven by stable travel demand and growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America.\n-\nMorgan Stanley upgraded Elf Beauty (ELF) to Overweight from Equal Weight with a price target of $134, up from $114. The firm contends that consensus \"looks materially too low,\" noting that its forecasts are 18% above consensus in terms of FY27 adjusted EBITDA.\n-\nSeaport Research upgraded Paramount Skydance (PSKY) to Neutral from Sell with no price target. A \"broad, technologically forward strategy\" has been announced, as expected, but without significant details or updated financial projections, which the firm believes will be lower than when the merger was announced last year.\n-\nWolfe Research upgraded Cummins (CMI) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $480 price target following the Q2 report. The firm believes that with growing data center exposure and leverage to an eventual truck upcycle, Cummins is \"very well positioned right now.\"\n-\nJefferies upgraded Generac (GNRC) to Hold from Underperform with a price target of $200, up from $150. The firm views the company's strategic shift away from underperforming clean technology investments as a positive, which should increase margins.\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n-\nMelius Research downgraded Adobe (ADBE) to Sell from Hold with a $310 price target. The firm believes the software-as-a-service companies are in the \"early innings\" of multiple contraction given the shift to artificial intelligence, and cuts Adobe's 2026 and 2027 estimates.\n-\nHSBC downgraded Trade Desk (TTD) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $56, down from $84. The company's Q2 report points to \"structural issues,\" the firm says, adding that Trade Desk is seeing a deceleration in growth despite a strong advertising market overall. Jefferies also downgraded Trade Desk to Hold from Buy with a price target of $50, down from $100.\n-\nLake Street downgraded Tandem Diabetes (TNDM) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $12, down from $75, following a transfer in analyst coverage. While the firm appreciates \"the valuation is compelling\" and thinks the company should probably demand a higher multiple, shares may be range-bound until faster U.S. growth, competitive share-taking and gross margin improvement to support AEBITDA profitability are seen.\n-\nRaymond James downgraded Haemonetics (HAE) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $78, down from $105. The firm also removed the shares from its Analyst Current Favorite list. Haemonetics' interventional technologies franchise declined in Q2 due to issues around selling execution, the firm says.\n-\nBofA downgraded Lineage (LINE) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $42, down from $47, citing ongoing demand challenges, persistent macro uncertainty, cautiousness about occupancy growth, and limited visibility into multiple headwinds impacting the sector, including tariffs, interest rates, excess capacity, GLP1 drugs and government benefit reductions.", "content_hash": "9a2c8f847f03de984db8c4fff7d01159", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share rose from $0.39 to $0.41, which matched estimates.\nHowever, guidance called for revenue to decelerate, driving fears that the company was struggling with competition.

Ford is investing nearly $2 billion in the plant, which produces the Escape and Lincoln Corsair, retaining at least 2,200 jobs, it said in a statement.\nChinese carmakers such as BYD have streamlined their supply chain and production system to produce EVs at a fraction of the cost of Western automakers. While these vehicles have yet to enter the U.S. market, Ford CEO Jim Farley said they set a new standard that companies like Ford must match.\n\"I can't tell you with 100% certainty that this will all go just right,\" Farley told a crowd at Ford's Louisville assembly plant on Monday, noting that past efforts by U.S. automakers to build affordable cars had fizzled. \"It is a bet. There is risk.\"\nFord has been developing its affordable EVs through its so-called skunkworks team, filled with talent from EV rivals Tesla and Rivian. The California-based group, led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke, has set itself so much apart from the larger Ford enterprise that Farley said even his badge could not get him into its building for some time.\nEVs sold for an average of about $47,000 in June, J.D. Power data showed. Many Chinese models sell for $10,000 to $25,000.\nAffordability is a top concern of EV shoppers, auto executives have said, and the global competition for delivering cheaper electric models is heating up.\nEV startup Slate, backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is aiming for a starting price in the mid-$20,000s for its electric pickup. Tesla has teased a cheaper model, with production ramping up later this year. Rivian and Lucid are also planning to roll out lower-priced models for their lineups, although price points are in the $40,000s to $50,000s.\nSince rolling out plans earlier this decade to push hard into EVs, Ford has pulled back as the losses piled up. It has scaled back many of its EV goals, canceled an electric three-row SUV, and axed a program to develop a more advanced electrical architecture for future models.\nFord last year announced it would start building its midsize truck from the skunkworks team in 2027.\nThe automaker earlier this year estimated losing up to $5.5 billion on its EV and software division. It lost nearly $10 billion combined on those operations from 2023 to 2024.", "content_hash": "f03c839e027e39edf5991717d31c2791", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here’s the Freddie Mac data on mortgage rates for the past 52 weeks as of Sept. 4, 2025:\n-\n30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 6.08% to 7.04%\n-\n15-year fixed-rate mortgage: 5.15% to 6.27%\nIf you just go by the numbers, rates on both 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages remain mostly below the highs noted above. So, yes, mortgage rates have decreased incrementally over the past year. Will they keep dipping? That remains to be seen.\nDive deeper: Will mortgage rates go back up to 7%?\nSo, will mortgage rates go down at all this year?\nIf you’re looking for a substantial interest rate drop in 2025, you’ll likely be left waiting. The latest news from the Federal Reserve and other key economic data point toward steady mortgage rates on par with what we see today.\nThe latest from the Federal Reserve\nWhen the Fed — the common nickname for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) — held its July 2025 meeting, it voted to keep the federal funds rate the same for the time being. After cutting its rate three times at the end of 2024, it has yet to slash the rate in 2025.\nThat federal funds rate tends to directly influence rates on shorter-term lending. While mortgage rates aren’t directly based on the fed funds rate, they typically mirror fed fund rate trends. So, if the fed funds rate goes up, mortgage rates will likely follow. The inverse is also true.\nThe next Fed meeting is set for September 16 and 17. According to the CME FedWatch tool, there’s roughly a 98% chance that the fed funds rate will decrease at this meeting. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean rates will follow suit. When people anticipate a fed funds rate cut, mortgage rates usually fall in the weeks leading up to the meeting.\nSo, mortgage rates might not fall much more significantly in 2025.\nLearn more: How the Fed rate decision impacts mortgage rates\nThe latest on 10-year Treasury yields\nWhile short-term lending rates closely follow the fed funds rate, mortgage rates more closely follow the 10-year Treasury yield. As of Sept. 2, the 10-year Treasury yield sat at 4.28% — up from 3.84% a year prior.\nYou’re probably wondering why today’s mortgage rates aren’t in the 4% range, right?\nTo determine current mortgage rates, lenders add a “spread” to the 10-year Treasury yield. The spread is simply the difference between the rates consumers pay and the rate on the 10-year Treasury. Without getting too much into the weeds, charging a spread helps mortgage lenders cover costs associated with making loans to the public and the risk of providing such loans.\nFor example, the current average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.5%, and the 10-year Treasury yield is 4.28% — a spread of 2.22%.\nRead more: When will mortgage rates finally go back down to 5%?\nShould you wait to buy until mortgage rates go down?\nIn short, no. You probably shouldn’t wait to buy a home until mortgage rates drop. Mortgage rates are just one part of the affordability equation. You also have to consider home prices, a factor of housing supply and demand.\nThe current housing market is in a crunch. To put it simply, buyers outnumber homes for sale, especially homes in price ranges accessible to the first-time home buyer. When supply and demand are out of balance like this, home prices tend to remain high since sellers know they’ll have multiple buyers interested.\nAccording to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the median sale price of single-family homes has generally trended upward since Q1 of 2009. At that time, the median sale price was $208,400. The median price had risen to $410,800 by Q2 2025.\nWhile recession chatter has recently increased, prospective buyers likely won’t see much relief in a true recession. If interest rates drop like they tend to do in recessions, that will increase the number of people looking to buy and lock in a lower interest rate. That drives up demand for the already limited supply of homes.\nTo truly save, buyers need both interest rates and home prices to drop. Mortgage rates are inching down this month, and housing prices are stagnant or even lowering in certain parts of the country. Still, rates are higher than they were this time last year, and prices are still increasing in many cities. Situations may be improving for buyers, but there’s a lot of work to be done.\nKeep reading: Do mortgage rates go down in a recession?\nThis embedded content is not available in your region.\nStrategies for buyers in today’s mortgage market\nIf you crave the comforts of homeownership, the best strategy in today’s market may be to buy what you can afford. Whether that means a smaller house or a condo instead of a single-family home, owning something puts you in a position to start building equity.\nYes, shopping for the best mortgage lenders with low rates and fees is crucial when getting a mortgage. But to help you find your ideal home that balances affordability and desirability, it pays to adopt a curious mindset and consider lesser-discussed financial tools.\nGet curious\nThere’s no better time to learn more about your local real estate market than today. By adopting a sense of curiosity, you could discover that your city has more to offer housing-wise than you previously thought.\nYou may want to take weekend excursions to lesser-known neighborhoods and suburban developments beyond the city limits. You never know what you’ll find that could expand your idea of what “home” looks like — including new developments, school districts, and types of homes.\nLearn more: This map shows average mortgage rates by state\nConsider a fixer-upper\nIf you’re looking to spend less on a home in today’s mortgage market, a house needing a bit of TLC could help you do just that. Loans like the FHA 203(k) mortgage can roll your purchase and renovation costs into one convenient loan. When you qualify and have an accepted offer, your lender immediately funds the home’s purchase price and puts the cost of renovations into an escrow account. As you make repairs, funds get dispersed.\nRethink your commute\nHow would it feel to have a longer commute yet come home to a house you love? Master-planned communities tend to crop up outside major cities, offering amenities like parks, shopping, and top-notch schools — all in exchange for a longer commute. These areas could look a lot more palatable if they offer commuting options like park-and-ride or commuter rail. Dare to consider parking the car and taking public transit if it could get you into the home of your dreams.\nGo condo\nWhile shared walls, floors, and ceilings might not immediately scream “dream home,” they could help you find an affordable home in a terrific area. Condominiums come in various shapes and sizes, from apartment-style flats to townhomes. Depending on the area, you might even score a small backyard. However, be sure to consider HOA fees when calculating your monthly payment.\nConsider a 15-year mortgage\nWhile the monthly payment on a 15-year mortgage will be higher than the typical 30-year, these loans have plenty of upsides. Not only will you pay off your home on a speedier timeline, but you’ll also likely score a lower interest rate and save a ton on interest over the life of your loan.\nExplore rate buydowns\nTo make today’s mortgage rates more palatable, look into rate buydown options. An interest rate buydown lets you pay cash up front in exchange for a reduced interest rate on your mortgage. Buydowns can be permanent or temporary (for your loan's first one to three years, for example). Even a few years of lower rate relief can make today’s home prices more affordable.\nLearn more: What will mortgage rates do over the next five years?\nWhen will mortgage rates go down? FAQs\nHow soon will mortgage interest rates go down?\nMortgage rates probably will not drop significantly before autumn. The August Fannie Mae Housing Forecast predicts that rates will continue to decrease gradually but will stay above 6% throughout 2025 and 2026.\nIs 7% a high mortgage rate?\nCompared to historical mortgage rates, 7% isn’t considered a high rate. While it might be high compared to pandemic-era rates that were sub-3%, it’s on par with mortgage rates in the 1990s, and considerably lower than the double-digit rates seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\nIs it impossible to get a 3% interest rate on a mortgage?\nIt’s not impossible to get a 3% interest rate, but doing so requires the perfect set of circumstances. You’d need to find a homeowner with an assumable mortgage — one that can be passed to a new owner at the same interest rate as the original loan. Assumable mortgages are generally government-backed loans from agencies like the VA, FHA, or USDA.\nLaura Grace Tarpley edited this article.", "content_hash": "c9e8e1d9634e267864cc804b674dad46", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

While some have downplayed concerns, others have noted their interest in working towards certain proposals, like platforms for direct-to-patient drug sales.\nHealth policy and management expert Dr Mariana Socal studies the dynamics behind drug pricing in the US, and the different stakeholders involved in this space. She is an associate professor in health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In an interview with Pharmaceutical Technology, she unpacks what the latest news could mean for drug prices in the US.\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\nManasi Vaidya (MV): How do you think they might this latest 15% tariff on EU drug imports could impact drug prices in the US?\nMariana Socal (MS): The US already pays much higher prices than any other country for branded drugs; on average, we pay an estimated three to four times higher prices than other countries pay for the same drugs. In addition to that, the most concerning part is that Americans consistently report being unable to afford the drugs they need. Surveys consistently show that about one in every four Americans has had trouble affording a medication because of the cost. So, through that lens, any additional price increase would be very detrimental to access for the American public.\nAdditionally, the most expensive drugs in the US are for those conditions where there's only one drug manufacturer. If the drug manufacturer is faced with a tariff and raises the price, they are absolutely authorised to do so. They have autonomy in setting the price in the US market. There is no way to find another producer elsewhere because the drug is under patent, and that is a real big problem with respect to affordability.\nThe second thing is that even if the consumer can afford a drug, the health insurance plan will be paying the price, and this can result in higher premiums in the following year. So, it's not only about the very immediate effects of higher prices, it's also about the medium-term to long-term impact that it can have on our system.\nMV: Earlier this year, pharma companies announced manufacturing plans in the US in response to potential tariffs. Is this latest tariff on EU companies enough to convince them to manufacture drugs in the US?\nMS: It is hard to make a prediction, but we can talk about the incentives here. We know the US is the biggest pharmaceutical market in the world, so that's a big incentive. We also know that these drug manufacturers have a monopoly, which means, if they choose to relocate [manufacturing] or not, they will still hold the rights to produce that drug. Each drug manufacturer will calculate how much the US market represents to them, and what the likelihood is that any drug utilisation would go up or down under the scenario of a tariff or under the scenario of relocating manufacturing to the US.\nAnother thing is that these tariffs have been proposed and renegotiated many times, and I think there is still a very significant uncertainty around them. No drug manufacturers like uncertainty because manufacturing, developing and producing a drug require very long-term investments. If a drug manufacturer wants to relocate production, this is a years-long activity. The uncertainty about the tariffs is a disincentive to [making] these investments, because it's unclear whether those efforts would pay off in the long term or if the tariffs would be renegotiated.\nMV: And that can happen if the administration changes and the next one decides to go a different way?\nMS: Exactly, things can change anytime, as they have in the last few months. And, so I think any decision would depend on how much certainty they have with respect to what the market will look like, at least in the next 5–10 years. If we're talking about building a new manufacturing facility, that's a very long-term investment. But even if a facility is already present, and it's only about expanding or shifting production to a different drug, everything has to be FDA-approved. And at the very minimum, an approval by the FDA takes time, let alone the time needed to create the production lines, a building, and things like that.\nMV: For conditions where multiple manufacturers produce similar drugs, will the tariffs now mean that US-based companies will have a pricing advantage over European manufacturers?\nMS: Once a tariff is implemented, a product that is manufactured in a tariff-affected country would have higher costs than before the tariff. Meanwhile, US products will not have the added cost from the tariff. To what extent this would translate as a \"pricing advantage\" for the US product is unclear, however. Production costs are typically higher in the US than in other countries - e.g., higher labour costs, higher tax burden, etc. While the US-made product is not subject to a tariff, it remains to be seen on a product-by-product basis whether the tariff added to the foreign-made product is high enough to result in a price that is higher than the price of the US-made product.\nMV: Soon after the tariffs on the EU drug imports were announced, the administration doubled down on the MFN executive order for international reference pricing for drugs in the US. What do you think could change in terms of drug prices in the near future?\nMS: I think the administration has a point in questioning why our prices are so much higher than other countries. But the answer to that question is not to just impose on drug manufacturers and require them to pay. Our market today allows drug manufacturers to do that [set prices]. Other countries have, for example, value-based pricing in which they allow the price, up to a certain point, according to the actual value that the drug brings to the market.\nIn this country [US], we have a market-based system, where the drug manufacturer is allowed to set the price of the drug, and drug manufacturers will set the price to the level that the market can bear. The most immediate effect from these conversations is probably that drug manufacturers are now making these calculations and thinking about what will happen if they follow the administration’s requirements versus not, and they will adjust their prices accordingly.\nMV: Another factor mentioned in the latest MFN news is the direct-to-patient sales. Could such approaches impact drug prices?\nMS: We don't currently have this incentive of allowing the drug manufacturer to sell directly to the consumers structured into the market. There is a lack of clarity on how it would work in practice. How big would the market be for this type of direct-from-manufacturer sales? Drug manufacturers will want answers to this so they can know the optimal pricing point for their drug.\nAnother scenario could be just increased drug prices in anticipation of tariffs. There's enough empirical information to show that in these moments of external shocks, manufacturers, in general, can use them as a justification to increase prices, even if their products were not directly affected. That's an unintended consequence, which is unfortunately also possible.\nMV: We've seen manufacturers try to sell diabetes and obesity drugs to consumers through third-party online pharmacies. Can we glean trends from that?\nMS: If a person gets their drug from a hospital, clinic or a pharmacy, these providers must protect the patient's personal information. But drug manufacturers are not bound by patient protection or privacy protection laws. So part of the problem here is that even the legislative framework to protect patients in situations when patients are sharing their personal information and buying drugs directly from the manufacturers is not prepared. And that's a big problem in my opinion. On paper, this may look like an interesting idea, but in practice, we may be exposing patients to providers who are not equipped to grant them the safety in the delivery of the products.\nOn top of all the other questions, we should also be talking about how to protect patients who choose to engage in those direct-from-manufacturer purchases.\nNavigate the shifting tariff landscape with real-time data and market-leading analysis.\nRequest a free demo for GlobalData’s Strategic Intelligence here.\n\"Uncertainty around tariffs is a disincentive for pharma onshoring in the US\" was originally created and published by Pharmaceutical Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

The bestselling author and renowned financial expert understands how easy it is to feel crushed by your debt. Fortunately, she also understands that, if you follow a few simple steps, it’s possible to start crushing your debt in return.\nDon’t Get Overwhelmed\nShame and anxiety aren’t exactly the best motivators. Orman doesn’t want you to succumb to either of these emotions — they won’t spur you to take action, unless you count burying your head in the sand (which she doesn’t). Resigning yourself to thinking that your situation is hopeless can only turn those thoughts into reality. Orman wants you to get up, dust yourself off and make a plan.\n“You have the power within you to take more control of the situation. But that requires kicking shame and blame out the door. They aren’t going to help you,” she said. “When did beating yourself up ever help?

If you’ve been in the habit of paying the minimum amount due on your credit cards every month, then you know that this amount will decrease over time. But, as Orman explained on an episode of her show, not soon enough.\n“If you only pay the minimum payment due, chances are you are not going to be out of credit card debt for a really long time,” she said.\nTo further prove her point, she offered a hypothetical: Let’s say you have three credit cards that totaled $5,000 in debt and you’re paying 21% interest. At the start, your minimum payment is $150 each month, but this goes down as you pay it down. All good, right? Well, no.\nOrman broke down the math: If you only covered your minimum monthly payments as they went down, it would take you 19 1/2 years to pay off your debt. As if knowing that a whole human being could be born and reach voting age in the time it would take you to be debt-free weren’t bad enough, you might want to sit down before looking at what you’d pay in interest: $6,500. That’s right, more in interest than the original amount you owned.", "content_hash": "929afff39e41d98ceed8d6fc5174f162", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(NASDAQ: CRVO), a clinical stage company focused on developing treatments for age-related neurologic disorders (CervoMed or the Company), today reported its financial results and corporate updates for the second quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n“With the reporting of both 16- and 32-week Extension phase data from the Phase 2b RewinD-LB trial, we have solidified the evidence for slowing clinical progression in DLB associated with neflamapimod treatment. This proof-of-concept, combined with the notable reductions seen in plasma levels of GFAP, an important blood-based biomarker of the underlying neurodegenerative process in DLB, provide us with valuable results and a deeper understanding that further increases our confidence in Phase 3 success and neflamapimod’s potential to make a meaningful difference for patients if approved. We are actively preparing for discussions with the FDA, which we expect to take place in the fourth quarter of 2025, to align on the design of our planned Phase 3 trial,” said John Alam, MD, Chief Executive Officer of CervoMed.\nRecent Highlights and Anticipated Milestones\nIn July 2025, the Company presented 32-week results from the open-label Extension phase of the Phase 2b RewinD-LB trial at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto, Canada. Based on the primary endpoint of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), patients treated with neflamapimod showed 54% risk reduction in clinically significant worsening compared to control at Week 32 of treatment (p=0.0037). This risk reduction improved to 64% (p=0.0001) among patients who have minimal evidence of AD co-pathology (ptau181 < 2.2 pg/mL at screening).\nIn July 2025, the Company also announced that at Week 32 of the Phase 2b RewinD-LB Extension phase, there was a statistically significant reduction (p<0.0001) from baseline (i.e., start of Extension) in GFAP plasma levels in patients who received active neflamapimod for all 32 weeks, with a mean change of -18.4±4.0 pg/mL in all participants (N=107) and -21.2±4.4 pg/mL in participants with screening plasma ptau181 below 2.2 pg/mL (N=91). In contrast, placebo-recipients in the initial, double-blind phase of the trial had a mean increase from baseline to Week 16 of +1.1±3.0 pg/mL in all participants (N=74) and +1.1±3.3 pg/mL in the subset with screening plasma ptau181 below 2.2 pg/mL (N=65). The full details of these results can be found here.\nIn June 2025, the Company announced that Marco Verwijs, PhD joined CervoMed as Executive Vice President, Technical Operations, a key senior leadership role to oversee the Company’s Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) division and advance the development of neflamapimod through Phase 3 testing and preparation of commercial batches.\nIn April 2025, the full 16-week results from the Extension phase of the Phase 2b RewinD-LB trial, demonstrating a meaningful beneficial impact on clinical progression in patients treated with neflamapimod compared to controls, were presented at the 19th International Conference on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases and Related Neurologic Disorders (AD/PD™) in Vienna, Austria. The full details of these results can be found here.\nThe Company plans to meet with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2025 to align on the design of the Company’s planned Phase 3 trial, which it plans to initiate in mid-2026 subject to available funding.\nInitial safety, biomarker and pharmacokinetic data from an ongoing trial in patients with mild-to-moderate DLB evaluating a twice daily regimen (80mg BID) of neflamapimod are expected to be available in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nIn the second of quarter of 2025, CervoMed enrolled the first patients in a Phase 2a trial of neflamapimod in patients recovering from acute stroke and initiated a Phase 2a trial of neflamapimod in patients with the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) – a subtype of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) – in mid-2025. In November 2024, the FDA granted neflamapimod Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of FTD.\nSecond Quarter 2025 Financial Results\nCash Position: As of June 30, 2025, CervoMed had approximately $33.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as compared to $38.9 million as of December 31, 2024. Based on its current operating plan, CervoMed believes its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as of June 30, 2025, along with remaining funds to be received from the Company’s grant from the NIA, will enable the Company to fund its planned operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the third quarter of 2026.\nGrant Revenue: In January 2023, CervoMed was awarded a $21.0 million grant from the NIA to support the RewinD-LB trial and, in August 2024, CervoMed was awarded an additional $0.3 million under the grant. Grant revenue was approximately $1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to approximately $3.3 million for the same period in 2024. The decrease is due to the completion of the initial, double-blind phase of the RewinD-LB Trial and transition to the Extension phase in December 2024.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, were approximately $5.1 million, compared to approximately $3.8 million in the same period in 2024. The increase of $1.3 million was primarily due to an increase in costs related to CMC activities, increased non-clinical studies, increased headcount costs, and outsourced CRO costs related to clinical work for neflamapimod, including costs related to our Phase 2a clinical trials of neflamapimod in recovery from acute stroke and with the nonfluent/agrammatic variant of PPA, both of which were initiated in the second quarter of 2025.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A) Expenses: G&A expenses were approximately $3.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2025, versus approximately $2.5 million in the same period in 2024. The increase of $0.8 million was primarily due to headcount costs and outsourced services.\nNet Loss: Net loss was approximately $6.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to net loss of approximately $2.3 million for the same period in 2024.\nAbout the RewinD-LB Phase 2b Trial in Dementia with Lewy Bodies The initial phase of RewinD-LB was a randomized, 16-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating oral neflamapimod (40mg TID) in 159 patients with DLB, followed by a 32-week neflamapimod-only treatment Extension phase. Patients with AD co-pathology, as assessed by plasma ptau181 levels, were excluded from the trial. Compared to patients with “pure” DLB – who may comprise up to 50% of the total diagnosed DLB patient population at any given time – DLB patients with AD co-pathology have significant, irreversible neuronal loss in the hippocampus that limits response to treatment. The primary endpoint in the trial is change in the CDR-SB, and secondary endpoints include the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study — Clinical Global Impression of Change, the Timed Up and Go test, and a cognitive test battery. The RewinD-LB trial is funded primarily by a $21.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute on Aging, which is expected to be disbursed over the course of the trial as costs are incurred. The trial includes 43 sites across in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. The initial phase of the study did not effectively evaluate the clinical activity of 40mg TID neflamapimod compared to placebo because the batch of neflamapimod capsules utilized during the placebo-controlled phase of the study did not lead to the plasma drug concentrations expected with such a dose. However, in the Extension phase, a portion of patients were administered a more recently manufactured batch of capsules that achieved targeted plasma drug concentrations, allowing the effects of 40 mg TID neflamapimod treatment to be effectively evaluated during the Extension phase, with patients receiving the newer capsules serving as an active drug arm. Outcomes in these patients were compared with those in the subset of patients who continued to receive the older batch of capsules during the Extension phase, which served as a control arm.\nAbout CervoMed CervoMed is a clinical-stage company focused on developing treatments for age-related neurologic disorders. The Company is currently developing neflamapimod, an investigational, orally administered small molecule brain penetrant that inhibits p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase alpha. Neflamapimod has the potential to treat synaptic dysfunction, the reversible aspect of the underlying neurodegenerative processes that cause disease in DLB and certain other major neurological disorders. Our recently completed Phase 2b trial evaluated neflamapimod in patients with DLB.\nForward-Looking Statements This press release includes express and implied forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, regarding the intentions, plans, beliefs, expectations or forecasts for the future of the Company, including, but not limited to: the Company’s cash runway; the therapeutic potential of neflamapimod, including the degree of sustainability of any therapeutic effects; the anticipated timing and achievement of clinical and development milestones, including the Company’s announcement of additional data, if any, from the RewinD-LB Phase 2b clinical trial and any meeting or correspondence between the Company and the FDA; any other expected or implied benefits or results, including that any initial clinical results observed with respect to neflamapimod in the RewinD-LB trial will be replicated in later trials; and the timing of the initiation of any potential future trials or interactions with regulatory authorities, including the Company’s need to acquire sufficient funding for any Phase 3 trial of neflamapimod in DLB.

Still, any signs that lead investors to suspect data is being politicized could exacerbate concerns about CPI data collection.\nIn that case, investors are likely to demand higher compensation to hold TIPS, or Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, whose value is linked to the CPI, and raise the federal government's cost of funding itself, analysts said. Rises in TIPS yields could be exacerbated by poorer liquidity compared to the much larger market for nominal Treasuries.\n\"This isn't just an academic discussion about getting the right numbers - these numbers matter for TIPS,\" said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase. \"There's real money on the line here.\"\nA White House official told Reuters, \"historically abnormal revisions in BLS data over the past few years since COVID have called into question the BLS’s accuracy, reliability, and confidence,\" and that Trump plans to restore trust in the BLS. The bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump ordered McEntarfer's removal on August 1 after data showed a surprise weakening in the U.S. labor market last month. The BLS employment report revealed meaningful revisions to job figures for the prior two months that raised investor worries that the Federal Reserve may need to play catch-up with interest rate cuts.\nThe BLS is also responsible for the CPI report - a key data point for the Fed and investors to assess inflation dynamics that influence monetary policy decisions.\n\"That's a problem if you're a policymaker, (and) if you're an investor - TIPS are indexed to changes in the CPI. The Fed needs to know what inflation is,\" said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley.\n\"It could be a situation where the signal is less credible, which could affect term premiums in the markets, but it may also worsen your ability to conduct not only good policy, but good policy in a timely fashion,\" he said.", "content_hash": "dd92e47c89f886640e4973f9e34d5ab2", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Also, expectations that the US and Russia are working toward an agreement to end the Ukraine war are weighing on crude prices as it eases concerns that the US will ramp up additional export sanctions on Russian energy supplies. However, losses in crude are limited after comments from Ukrainian President Zelenskiy dampened hopes for a quick end to the war when he rejected any talk of Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.\nMore News from Barchart\nCrude prices are under pressure on hopes for an end to the Russian-Ukrainian war. President Trump is set to meet Russian President Putin on Friday in Alaska to discuss an end to the war, which could boost global oil supplies as sanctions on Russian energy exports could be lifted, which would add crude supplies to the global market.\nCrude has support after President Trump recently said that he would impose new tariffs on countries buying Russian energy unless Russia reaches a ceasefire with Ukraine. Last Wednesday, President Trump doubled tariffs on Indian exports to 50% from 25% because of India's purchases of Russian crude. JPMorgan Chase warned that if enforced, oil markets would be unable to ignore the impact of triple-digit tariffs on Russian oil, given the significant scale of Russian exports and limited OPEC spare capacity, which could potentially lead to a supply shock.\nConcerns about a global oil supply glut are weighing on crude prices after OPEC+ on August 2 endorsed an additional 547,000 bpd increase in its crude production for September 1. OPEC+ is boosting output to reverse the 2-year-long production cut, gradually restoring a total of 2.2 million bpd of production by September 2026. After the August 2 meeting, the group said it will closely monitor demand and may maintain production levels, restart halted supplies, or reverse recent production increases. OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. The International Energy Agency said inventories have been accumulating at a rate of 1 million bpd and that the global crude oil market faces a surplus by Q4-2025 equivalent to 1.5% of global crude consumption. OPEC July crude production fell -20,000 bpd to 28.31 million bpd.", "content_hash": "8d969662c63b1d5cce9e6c44bbbab26d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

After months of discussions and rumours, the firms were again made one in a ceremony in Shanghai.\nThe new CSSC will control as much as 21% of the global shipbuilding industry, and Beijing hopes the new megacompany will be a more efficient challenger across the civil, military, and offshore energy sectors. As competition is likely as fierce as it has ever been in the Asian shipbuilding market, the aim of this merger is to cement China’s place above South Korea as the dominant force in the region.\nOver the 25 years the shipbuilders have been split into the northern Dalian-based CISC and the southern Shanghai-based CSSC, a domestic rivalry developed, according to China Decoded.\nReducing this internal competition and focusing on growth compared to international rivals is increasingly vital for the Chinese industry as the US has become more assertive in anti-China policies during the second Trump administration.\n“This merger marks the largest strategic restructuring in China’s shipbuilding history, aimed at optimising resource allocation and enhancing competitiveness in the global market,” said Xu Yi, an analyst at Haitong Futures told South China Morning Post.\nIt is understood that Tuesday 12 August will be the final day CSIC shares will be available for market trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, before the company is folded into China CSSC Holdings.\nThe move has several potential downsides for the Beijing government and the new larger company. Firstly, it will almost certainly attract the ire of international anti-monopoly bodies. While these regulators do not have the power to break up the Chinese megafirms, they could recommend countermeasures to other governments which could restrict the business CSSC can do.\nThe move could also consolidate military and civilian shipyards, which could lead to further international restrictions or tariffs aimed at the industry, such as increased port fees for Chinese vessels, or even higher tariffs.\n\"China will merge CSSC and CSIC to create shipbuilding giant\" was originally created and published by Ship Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

Concern about smaller sugar supplies from Brazil is boosting sugar prices. Covrig Analytics said last Friday that reports of smaller cane yields from Brazil's sugar farmers may knock Brazil's 2025/26 sugarcane production below 600 MMT, much lower than Brazilian government crop forecasting agency Conab's forecast of 663.4 MMT.\nAn excessive short position by funds could exacerbate any short-covering rally in sugar futures. Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) data showed funds increased their net-short positions in NY sugar futures by +25,923 positions to 151,004 short positions in the week ending August 5, the most in almost 6 years.\nLast Tuesday, sugar prices fell to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. On July 31, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.\nThe outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported Tuesday that cumulative monsoon rain in India was 500.8 mm as of August 4, or 4% above normal. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\nSugar prices have retreated over the past four months, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low last month and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.\nSigns that the recent slide in sugar prices to 4-year lows has sparked a pickup in demand are positive for sugar prices. China's June sugar imports soared by 1,435% to 420,000 MT. Also, Coca-Cola agreed to use cane sugar in Coke beverages sold in the US instead of high-fructose corn syrup, which could boost US sugar consumption by +4.4% to 11.5 MMT from 11 MMT currently, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\nSugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.\nThe outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.\nThe International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.\nThe USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

According to leading data and analytics company GlobalData, some of Abbott’s high-volume product lines declined in average selling price (ASP) in the first six months of 2025, when compared to reporting from the same period last year. However, Abbott’s top revenue product lines maintained consistent ASPs across 2024 and 2025, which suggests that the company remains well-positioned and resistant to economic pressures, including those related to evolving tariff policies.\nWhen analysing Abbott’s highest-volume products, some nuances emerge. Products that ranked highest by volume of sales in 2024 experienced modest increases in ASPs while those leading by volume in 2025 showed no change or a slight decline in ASPs. This pattern may reflect changing purchasing strategies among US healthcare facilities, potentially arising due to evolving priorities in public health and cost considerations.\nAccording to its recent financial report, Abbott delivered a strong first half in 2025, with its US medical device sales growing by 14.8% compared to H1 2024.

Ethereum (ETH-USD) touched 2021 levels on Monday, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged roughly 190% since the April market lows.\nCompanies have been adding ethereum to their balance sheets as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets, such as stablecoins.\nThe move higher in crypto also comes as stocks hover near record highs on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September and that President Trump's next Fed chair pick will likely bring looser monetary policy.\n\"If the Fed is cutting into an economy that is still growing, with unemployment in check and inflation elevated, that is a macro cocktail that should favor allocation to crypto,\" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote on Friday.\nFarrell also noted that Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran to serve on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors is also bullish for crypto assets, given that he has called for weaker dollar policy in the past, which typically drives up asset prices.\nAt the same time, regulatory tailwinds have also pushed the price of bitcoin higher.\nLast week Trump issued an executive order asking the Labor Department to look into allowing 401(k) plans to hold cryptocurrencies, among other alternative assets. The move would open the door for more investors to get involved in crypto.\nEven Trump's son Eric Trump has noted crypto's surge, writing recently, \"Stop betting against BTC and ETH — you will be run over.\"\nStrategists note the administration's crypto push is a major tailwind for the industry.\n\"The administration is pushing crypto.

That's partly related to the lofty 5.8% dividend yield, but the real linchpin is the company's diversified energy business. Here are 10 reasons why I own Enbridge and why you might want to own it, too.\n1. Enbridge has an attractive dividend yield\nI'm a dividend investor, so Enbridge's dividend yield is important to me. At 5.8%, it is high on an absolute basis. But it is high on a relative basis, too. For example, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) is offering only a scant 1.2% yield. And the average energy stock's yield is just 3.3% or so. If you like dividends, as I do, Enbridge is going to be attractive.\n2. Its dividend is reliable\nI learned the hard way that buying stocks based on their yield alone is a mistake, which is why I also focus on dividend history. Focusing on companies that regularly increase their dividends quickly weeds out many poor-quality businesses. Enbridge has hiked its dividend (in Canadian dollars) for 30 consecutive years. It has proven to be a reliable dividend stock.\n3. Enbridge has a strong financial foundation\nEven historically reliable dividend payers sometimes cut their dividends. So, it is also important to check the balance sheet. Enbridge has an investment-grade credit rating. That means it not only has a strong financial foundation but also has access to affordable capital when it taps the debt markets.\n4. It has a solid business model\nOn top of the foundation here, Enbridge has built a highly reliable and boring business. That's great news because it operates in the highly volatile energy sector. Essentially, it owns the infrastructure assets, such as pipelines, that move oil and natural gas around the world. It charges fees for the use of these assets, which generates the income it uses to pay that fat dividend. Given the importance of energy to modern life, demand for Enbridge's services tends to be robust regardless of commodity prices.\n5. Enbridge is big enough to be an industry consolidator\nThere are plenty of companies that do something similar to what Enbridge does. But Enbridge happens to be one of the largest players in the midstream sector in North America. Being a roughly $100 billion market cap industry giant not only provides the company with scale but also means that Enbridge can buy up smaller peers to augment its business or expand into new businesses (more on this below). That's helped along, of course, by the company's financial strength.\n6. It has plenty of levers to pull\nNot only can Enbridge grow via acquisition, but its vast portfolio of assets also affords it plenty of opportunity for capital investment. In fact, internal growth is a core focus as the company looks to upgrade assets and expand capacity. And when it buys new assets, it often looks for situations where it can add value over time via additional capital investment, helping to create a virtuous and ongoing cycle of growth. Which brings up the next point: the other assets Enbridge owns.\n7. Enbridge is getting regulated in a good way\nEnbridge's core business is moving oil and natural gas. However, its big-picture focus is to provide the world with the energy it needs. Which is why the company has been shifting more and more toward natural gas and other cleaner energy sources.\nFor example, it recently bought three regulated natural gas utilities from Dominion Energy(NYSE: D). Not only are these regulated assets reliable cash-flow generators, but they also shift the business toward a cleaner fuel and provide ongoing investment opportunities. This move solidifies the company's growth prospects and makes additional dividend hikes more likely.\n8. Its future isn't just about gas\nThe shift toward natural gas is one key reason why I like Enbridge's energy business. But the hidden value here is the company's modest exposure to renewable power.\nEnbridge has been investing in clean energy for a while now and understands the business well. It owns some large offshore wind farms in Europe and other, more modest renewable power assets. This toehold prepares Enbridge for a future in which meeting the world's energy needs means focusing more on clean energy. I expect it to increase the scope of this business slowly over time, which is what I expect the world to do, too.\n9. Enbridge is easier than an MLP\nEnbridge has peers that offer similar positives, most notably Enterprise Products Partners(NYSE: EPD). But Enbridge is a traditional corporation, while Enterprise is a master limited partnership (MLP), which is significantly more complex to own. I prefer to keep my financial life as simple as possible, and dealing with the K-1 tax forms that MLPs require every year just isn't worth it to me if I can get all the benefits without the hassle from a great business like Enbridge.\n10. I can skip the tax headache from owning a Canadian stock\nThere's one problem with Enbridge that is a bit more nuanced. As a Canadian company, U.S. shareholders have to pay Canadian taxes on the dividend income they collect. But there's a workaround: A tax treaty allows U.S. investors to avoid Canadian taxes if the shares are owned in a tax-advantaged account, such as a Roth IRA.\nThe ability to take advantage of this depends on your broker, who has to fill out some forms to make it happen (call them and ask about this). However, my broker has done their homework, and I can happily avoid the Canadian tax issue. The only dividend negative that I can't avoid is that the dividends U.S. investors receive will vary along with interest rates.\nEnbridge checks almost all the boxes\nWhen I look down the list of positives with Enbridge, I am very happy to be a shareholder. Is it a perfect investment? Of course not. But no company is. The balance of positives to negatives, however, is so compelling that I almost had no choice but to buy the stock. And I plan to hold it forever now that I have.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Enbridge right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Enbridge, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Enbridge wasn’t one of them.

It has been edited for length and clarity.\nI'm the CEO and founder of MyOutDesk, a virtual assistant company that has served more than 8,000 companies. I'm also the founder and CEO of the nonprofit MOD Movement, a nonprofit dedicated to equipping communities with the essentials in education, housing, and economic empowerment.\nGrowing up in poverty fueled my career resilience as a serial entrepreneur. I founded MyOutDesk in 2008 after working in real estate and realizing that business owners were drowning in necessary administrative tasks. While initially a real-estate professional, contractor, developer, and mortgage broker, I sold and divested my other businesses to focus solely on MyOutDesk.\nMy net worth is around $100 million, and I make more than $1 million a year in salary. I'm both saving money for my children, ages 4, 9, and 12, and teaching them how to invest properly.\nI share my entrepreneurial tenacity to help guide my children's futures\nI've learned the importance of time and compounding interest. If I could go back to my 18-year-old self, I would've put part of every check into a brokerage account, like an IRA. Had I done that, my net worth would likely be double what it is.\nAll three of my children have brokerage accounts with Roth IRAs. They also have their own bank accounts and opportunities to earn money. They have their own savings accounts where they save their money: 1/3 for savings, 1/3 for spending, and 1/3 for a charitable cause.\nI believe the Roth IRA serves as an exercise to teach the kids to set aside money and see how fast it will grow with compound interest over time. We discuss as a family how this creates significant gains over time.\nThey already make investment decisions to set them up for long-term success\nEach year since starting the accounts for them, I've contributed the maximum allowed for a Roth IRA, which is $7,000 for 2025. Since our kids were young, they have created ways to earn money. Our job as parents is to show them slowly how to manage money and investments.\nMy eldest, for example, has invested in Disney since she was 5. She also owns shares of Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway. When she receives her paycheck, I sit with her to invest in her Roth IRA and discuss her next investment.\nBy about the age of 13, we'll start allowing our children to take over some of their finances and make decisions with parental guidance. (We don't allow them to invest in companies we don't agree with as of now.) This will help give them the autonomy they crave and teach them to make financial decisions and mistakes on their own so they're prepared when they reach adulthood.\nHere's my best advice for parents setting up investment accounts for their kids\nPrioritize togetherness and education, both financial and emotional. While creating a financial umbrella can be helpful, it's far more beneficial to teach them strong core values, ensuring they know how to work hard and be good people. Social, intellectual, relational, and emotional capital are vital to raising independent and successful children who can properly manage their money.\nFinancial education is also important. Wealth can be a weapon or a tool, and without the proper knowledge, it can be very destructive. When I set up investment accounts for my children, I spent time helping them understand what to do with their money and how to use this wealth to serve others, making sure they use money as a tool that meets their values.\nMake sure your kids know their investment options, too\nThe most common mistake I see parents make is failing to educate their kids on the choices they're making and the accounts they're selecting.\nFirst, parents have to understand the account they are making. A Roth IRA, for example, is in the kid's full control when they turn 18. If they aren't educated on wealth management, they can easily blow through their investments.\nConversely, a trust in which the parent has complete control can feel too restrictive for your child as they enter adulthood. Ultimately, it's important to include and inform your children from an early age to ensure a smooth transfer of wealth and that they honor this incredible gift.\nWe started an annual daddy-daughter trip with our kids at six, customizing each trip to our child's interests\nMy eldest is intellectual, but my middle child is more experiential, so I meet them where they are. This trip is a chance to connect and have these early — and regular — conversations about money that are age-appropriate. As they get older and become more self-actualized, I increase the level of conversation.\nMy oldest invested in Disney when she was 5, and I took her to her first shareholders' meeting and introduced her to the stock market. Here, she was able to ask Bob Iger a question, which piqued her interest in investing.\nWe do talk about investments that are in their Roth IRA as a family. We have an annual trip to Disneyland, where they can act, touch, and feel the company, and give us a chance to discuss the stocks and investments.\n10 years ago, I knew nothing about generational wealth\nI was determined to raise my children to be responsible humans who were empowered to pursue what they loved while being contributing members of society. I also didn't want my wealth to hinder their future.\nSince then, I've read many books on wealth, such as \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" and \"The Richest Man in Babylon,\" listened to every podcast I could find, such as \"Acquired\" and \"All-In-Podcast,\" and met with peer groups of ultra-high-net-worth individuals through R360 Global. In the beginning, I was looking for a shortcut, but I kept coming back to education.\nWhile there are no shortcuts, one of the most important lessons I've learned is that a financial umbrella will only take your children so far. Embracing those core values, spending time with them, and teaching them what to do with their money when they have it is far better than simply creating an investment account.", "content_hash": "b836afdc80ed1934042d42c35eafb3fa", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

However, for middle-class households already feeling financially stretched, financial preparation remains a smart policy.\nExplore More: I’m an Economist — Here’s How Likely a Recession Is for the Second Half of 2025\nTry This: The New Retirement Problem Boomers Are Facing\nHere’s what’s keeping the economy afloat, and what you can do today to stay ready just in case conditions change.\nWhy a Recession Isn’t a Sure Thing\nAlthough risks remain, recent data and expert insight suggest the U.S. economy may avoid a full-scale recession in the near term.\nJob Growth Is Strong\nThe labor market continues to add jobs across multiple sectors, albeit at a gradually slowing pace. Unemployment ticked up to 4.1% in June, according to Reuters. While this is still low by historical standards, employers added 147,000 jobs.\n“Recession probability estimates range from [33% to] 40%, reflecting ongoing risks such as elevated inflation and global headwinds,” said Tracy Shuchart, senior economist at NinjaTrader.\n“Although steady consumer income, a projected GDP rebound and continued (if uneven) job growth continue to support the broader outlook.”\nFind Out: 8 Smart Ways Frugal People Are Living Like There’s Already a Recession\nConsumers Are Still Spending\nConsumer demand, particularly for services and travel, remains resilient, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Essential goods and services, such as groceries, utilities and healthcare, have remained steady, while discretionary spending on categories like travel and dining out remains active.\n“Consumer spending has held steady; and GDP is expected to rebound in Q2 2025 after a single quarterly decline,” Shuchart said. “If inflation begins trending back toward the Fed’s 2% target and corporate earnings remain stable, these would further support a soft landing rather than a recession.”\nInflation Is Cooling\nAfter spiking in recent years, inflation is showing signs of slowing. Price increases have moderated since last year, and forecasters expect that trend to continue through 2025.\nCPI inflation is expected to average 2.6% in Q3 and 2.5% in Q4, according to the July 2025 Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly survey of top private-sector economists.", "content_hash": "16b1f666ae7f7b533bd1cc1d5f9a2ded", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

(NYSE: LTM; SSE: LTM) have renewed their strategic alliance for another five years, consolidating over three decades of collaboration. This partnership has enabled the development of the most recognized loyalty program in the Chilean market, connecting millions of people with travel-related benefits and LATAM Pass program services.\nOver the past 30 years, the alliance has consistently received high customer appreciation. To illustrate the scale of the partnership, an average of around 2 million airline tickets are redeemed each year through miles accumulated via the bank’s products. This is equivalent to operating 3,415 A320 aircraft exclusively with alliance passengers. In addition, alliance members have enjoyed an enhanced flying experience thanks to the benefits offered by the affiliated credit cards.\nAndrés Trautmann, Country Head of Banco Santander Chile, stated: “With more than 30 years of history, this alliance has become a cornerstone of our daily relationship with customers. Its renewal is a strategic decision aimed at strengthening and projecting into the future a value proposition that has proven to be relevant and widely appreciated by those who place their trust in us.”\n“We are thrilled to renew this alliance with Banco Santander, a strategic partner for LATAM Pass, with whom we aim to continue creating value for customers. This milestone continues a historic relationship and reaffirms our commitment to elevating the travel experience of every one of our members. At LATAM Pass, we will continue working to offer unique benefits and unforgettable experiences through the region’s leading loyalty program,” said Roberto Alvo, CEO of the LATAM Group.\nCurrently, the LATAM Pass program has over 51 million members worldwide and has grown by 40% since 2019, making it the fourth-largest loyalty program in the Americas and the seventh-largest globally.\nMeanwhile, the Santander LATAM Pass alliance currently has more than 688,000 customers, making it the most established, valued, and important loyalty program in Chile.\nPhoto caption (from left to right): Cristian Ortiz, CEO of LATAM Pass; Roberto Alvo, CEO of the LATAM Group; Andrés Trautmann, CEO of Banco Santander Chile; and Ángel García, Payments Manager.", "content_hash": "641a7a6b2ab3c37bb45975a5d12397f3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Considering home values rise over time, more home sellers could face the fact they could be on the hook for capital gains taxes.\nResearch by CoreLogic found that homeowners who have mortgages have an average of $303,000 in home equity. High cost of living areas like San Francisco and Hawaii could see higher home equity values.\nAccording to data by Realtor.com, around one in three of homeowners are over the exclusion amount if they sell their home. The outlet also looked at data of the percentage of homeowners that will be over the exclusion by 2030, which is outlined below.\nHow Capital Gains Tax Work on Home Sales\nThe current tax law stipulates that profits about the exclusion amount will be taxed at long-term capital gains rates. So if your home sale profit was $350,000, as a single filer you would only be taxed on $100,000. Depending on your taxable income, you could be taxed anywhere from 0% to 20%.\nThese homeowners who are above exclusion amounts could save a significant amount but that’s assuming their taxable income is higher to where the tax actually kicks in.\nHere’s a simplified example: As a single person, your taxable income is $45,000 and you sold your home at a $300,000 profit. Since you profited $50,000 above the exclusion, you’re responsible for long-term gains tax. But since your income sits below $48,350, your tax rate is 0%.\nWhat this spells out is that those who are high-income earners and have significant home equity will most likely benefit from the proposed tax cut that’s not in effect yet.\nEditor’s note on political coverage: GOBankingRates is nonpartisan and strives to cover all aspects of the economy objectively and present balanced reports on politically focused finance stories.

Despite the market being on its way to recovery, Cuban’s story from the 2000 crash is still worth noting.\nDon't miss\n-\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n-\nI'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast)\n-\nRobert Kiyosaki warns of a 'Greater Depression' coming to the US — with millions of Americans going poor. But he says these 2 'easy-money' assets will bring in ‘great wealth’. How to get in now\nIn 1999, Cuban and his business partner Todd Wagner decided to sell their online streaming company, Broadcast.com, to internet giant Yahoo. The firm was acquired for $5.7 billion, and since Cuban held roughly one-third of the company, he was instantly a billionaire.\nThere was only one problem — Yahoo had not paid Cuban and Wagner in cash. Instead, the deal involved Yahoo stock, which was surging while the mania surrounding tech companies grew. It seems Cuban was spooked by the inflated valuations, predicted the bubble would burst at some point, and decided to take steps to protect his payout.\n“I did a hedge,” Cuban told Stern. “I sold calls, bought puts, so I protected my stock … It went up in value some more, and went up to where my hedge was and cashed me out.”\nIn other words, Cuban effectively locked in the value of his Yahoo stock at the time. Six weeks later, he says, the market crashed.\nCuban’s move highlights how wealthy investors think about downside risk. And while the markets may already be bouncing back from the most recent crash, it is smart to be prepared should it happen again.\nHere are three ways regular investors can work to protect their wealth from another crash and help mitigate the damage done by the most recent one.\nKeep cash and stay invested\nCash and cash equivalents (savings, checking and money market accounts, and short-term investments) are thought to provide liquidity and safety. A robust emergency fund protects you from having to sell your investments at a possible loss when the market is struggling. According to the U.S. Bank, a general rule of thumb is that cash and cash equivalents should comprise between 2% and 10% of your portfolio.", "content_hash": "6c67bd79b732f4fcd8bf67f60dce2123", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

That’s naturally kept multiple would-be sellers on the sidelines, while impacting buyer affordability.\nInventory is creeping higher, but demand still remains scarce.\nJune existing-home sales dropped 2.7% month-over-month, despite median prices hitting a record $435,300.\nTo make matters worse, builders aren’t plugging the gap with single-family housing starts slipping to an annualized pace of 883,000 units in June.\nOn the flipside, builder sentiment, measured by the National Association of Home Builders Housing Market Index, is deeply in the negative at 33, hampered by costly financing and materials.\nOn the rental end, new multifamily supply has weighed down asking rents, especially for older, more affordable units.\nNationally, rents are flat year-over-year, offering some relief from inflationary pressures, but that hasn’t made homeownership any easier.\nBill Ackman’s big housing finance pitch: merge Fannie & Freddie\nMaverick investor Bill Ackman just revealed arguably the boldest housing market proposals in years.\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) this past weekend, he advocates merging Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, then taking the combined mortgage giant public.\nHis idea comes as the Trump administration reportedly weighs IPOs for the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), potentially valuing them near the $500 billion region.\nAckman feels that a single platform will cut costs and streamline oversight while lowering mortgage rates.\nThese GSEs purchase mortgages from lenders, package them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and then sell them to investors.\nThis cycle efficiently recycles capital back to lenders so they can continue making loans.\nThese entities have been under federal conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis and have proven to be critical in keeping the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage widely available.\nWith that said, it’s imperative to assess the potential impacts of a merger/IPO, of which some include:\nRates & g-fees: Cost savings will only lower mortgage rates if the merged entities capital requirements and profit goals facilitate it. The Urban Institute estimates the guarantee fees (“g-fees”) could potentially change by 10–25 basis points with just a few tweaks to these assumptions. However, IPO uncertainty will likely cause mortgage-backed securities (MBS) spreads to widen for a while, pushing borrowing costs up in the near-term.\nLiquidity: Since 2019, both GSEs have already issued a single “Uniform MBS” in pooling liquidity, so merger-related gains may likely be a lot smaller than the headlines show.\nMarket structure & risk: Merging into a uniform (GSE) will effectively club the operational and financial risk in a single place. Hence, if something goes wrong, the entire housing finance system might be affected. Consequently, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and the Treasury will need to step in and efficiently balance keeping mortgages affordable while meeting shareholder profit goals.\nOf course, with mortgage rates around 6.63% straining affordability, even modest g-fee relief could help at the margin. However, it's unlikely to solve inventory shortages or macro headwinds, which is why the FHFA/Treasury need a detailed plan of action.\nTrump’s “one big GSE” pitch turns up the heat\nOver the weekend, President Donald Trump tossed gasoline on the housing finance debate, floating an idea that is right up Bill Ackman’s alley.\nTrump floated the idea of folding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into a single, publicly traded “MAGA” giant.\nTo be fair, it’s not the first time D.C. has discussed the idea of a sweeping GSE overhaul. Back in 2019, Trump’s Treasury wanted to take Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac out of government control and rebuild their finances.\nHowever, the talk didn’t dovetail into potentially merging the two GSEs. Outside of Washington, though, the idea has crept up on multiple occasions.\nEarlier in April, University of Maryland professor Clifford Rossi suggested that merging the two entities before making them private could cut costs and significantly reduce the risk of a system-wide failure.\nSimilar “one combined company” plans were also suggested by major think tanks as far back as 2016.", "content_hash": "4e30f271fa64e390be96614913f79a7e", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Give Your Spending a Year-End Tune-Up\nBefore the holiday rush takes over, look closely at your monthly expenses. Compare your income to how much you’re actually spending, and separate essentials from “nice-to-haves.”\nIf you find areas where money is slipping away like unused subscriptions, impulse purchases or high dining-out costs, redirect that cash toward savings or debt payoff. Rules of thumb, such as spending no more than half of your take-home pay on essentials, can help you keep balance in your budget.\nGetting your spending under control now means you can go into 2026 with more cash flow, fewer money leaks and stronger habits.\nDiscover More: Never Do These 3 Things With Your Money, Says Personal Finance Pro Humphrey Yang\n2. Strengthen Your Safety Net\nAn emergency fund isn’t just a “nice to have.” It’s your personal financial shield.\nIf you don’t have one yet, start small with a $1,000 cushion, then work toward covering three to six months’ worth of essential expenses. Automating transfers from each paycheck or moving cash-back rewards into savings can help you build your fund faster without much effort.\nWhen life throws an unexpected expense your way next year, you won’t have to derail your goals or rely on costly credit.\n3. Tackle Your Most Expensive Debt First\nHigh-interest credit card debt can quietly drain your finances, so prioritize getting it off your plate. List your balances from the highest to lowest interest rate and focus your extra payments on the top of that list.\nYou might also explore options like balance-transfer cards with an introductory 0% rate or a lower-interest consolidation loan. Just make sure to factor in any fees. Every dollar you save in interest is a dollar you can redirect to saving, investing or enjoying life in 2026.\n4. Check on Your Retirement Savings\nIf you have a workplace plan like a 401(k) plan or 403(b) plan, double-check that you’re contributing enough to get the full employer match it’s essentially free money.", "content_hash": "205b8f399edb1c94ffbf1f9ad13fbb3d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Apple had previously announced a $500 billion investment in the U.S. weeks after Trump’s inauguration, and after the latest announcement, its commitment has increased to $600 billion.\nCook and Apple didn’t leave the White House empty-handed, and Trump said that the company will be exempt from future tariffs on chip imports. iPhone imports from India are already exempt from the 50% tariff that Trump has imposed on the world’s fourth-largest economy, and the exemption from the proposed chip tariffs takes away some further uncertainty.\nIs Apple Stock Out of the Woods Yet?\nApple was due for a catch-up trade, and the White House optics were just the kicker it needed to decisively reclaim its $3 trillion market cap. Apple has also been able to address some of the other issues that have been putting pressure on its stock price.\nThe company’s sales in China gained traction in May and June, and even though it was partially on account of its subsidy scheme, the company has done relatively well.", "content_hash": "c7ef4d3e9f99524c11062517fefbb4b5", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Traders were readying for the release of consumer price index figures on Tuesday, a key data point before the Fed’s meeting next month.\nPolicymakers and investors have been monitoring that data for signs of whether trade tariffs result in higher prices for consumer and companies, which could alter the Fed’s path on rate cuts. Bets on a reduction in September picked up momentum after a report showed weakness in the US labor market. There’s now a roughly 80% of a cut next month.\n“The market is watching inflation with an intense focus because you have a data-dependent Fed,” said Amar Reganti, fixed income strategist at Hartford Funds. “That is being constrained by its dual mandate, which right now shows a weakening labor market and stickier inflation.”\nFederal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, on Saturday, said she favors three rate cuts this year and urged fellow policymakers to reduce borrowing costs. Still, economists see inflation remaining sticky, with a Bloomberg poll showing that they expect CPI excluding volatile food and energy rose 0.3% in July, quickening from a 0.2% increase the prior month.\nThe inflation report “is important in determining the pass through of tariffs and markets continue to try and figure that out,” said Michael Cudzil, senior portfolio manager at Pimco.\nTreasury yields have been whipsawed since the start of the month, rising last week as the Fed came under continued pressure from President Donald Trump to cut rates, while sluggish bond auctions raised concerns about demand.\nAt the same time, the weak payrolls reading has reignited speculation that the economy will require policy easing soon.\nActivity in options markets has shown continued buying in a position that would benefit from a 50-basis-point reduction at the September meeting.\nThe dollar, meanwhile, has lost more than 1% so far in August, though it gained on Monday.", "content_hash": "2c33180aa7798e0f57cc9884e0de12ca", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

A missing POD? Delayed payment. A lost rate con? No detention. Bad compliance files? Fines or shutdowns. And here’s the hard truth—most small fleets and owner-operators are bleeding cash because their documents are scattered across emails, glove boxes, and dispatch group chats.\nIn 2025, staying organized isn’t a nice-to-have—it’s a business survival skill. This guide breaks down a clean, tactical document system that keeps your cash flow moving, your files audit-ready, and your drivers in sync. No software to buy. No VA required. Just structure, discipline, and a simple weekly routine. Let’s get into it.\nWhy Document Organization Is Non-Negotiable in 2025\nWhen these documents go missing or get filed in the wrong place, your business starts leaking money. You don’t get paid. You fail audits. You lose trust with brokers and customers. One missing POD can snowball into weeks of delays and unnecessary phone calls.\nExamples of what goes wrong:\n-\nA missed detention fee because there’s no signed rate con.\n-\nA delayed invoice because the POD is still in a driver’s cab.\n-\nA failed DOT audit because your driver file is incomplete.\n-\nA lost fuel receipt that throws off your IFTA filing.\nThere’s no profit margin for disorganization in a one-truck or five-truck operation. When cash flow is tight, every delay, fine, or lost dollar matters.\nStart With One Rule: Centralize Everything\nAction Plan:\n-\nCreate a shared cloud folder: “Trucking Docs 2025.” Use Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.\n-\nInside that, make five subfolders:\n-\nRate Cons\n-\nPODs\n-\nFuel Receipts\n-\nMaintenance\n-\nCompliance\n-\n-\nStandardize file names like this: 2025-07-15_RateCon_Load12345.pdf\n-\nUse scanning apps (CamScanner, Adobe Scan) to upload clean, legible files. No blurry photos.\n-\nInclude a shared master tracker (spreadsheet) that logs every document uploaded by date, load #, and type.\nTip: Give your admin “edit” access. Drivers get “view only” so they can’t delete or overwrite files.\nOnce you build this central hub, it becomes your business command center.\nDriver Buy-In: Train It or Lose It\nHow to train your team:\n-\nWalk them through the upload process during orientation.\n-\nShow drivers how to scan and upload docs before they leave the dock.\n-\nRequire uploads within 24 hours of delivery—not later.\n-\nReview file quality weekly—blurry scans, missing load numbers, or unsigned PODs don’t get paid.\nWhat to enforce:\n-\nUpload = paid. No upload = no settlement until the POD is in.\n-\nOffer small bonuses for consistent compliance.

But it underperformed the S&P 500, which returned 25% for the year, by a wide margin.\nLee's thesis was straightforward. At the beginning of 2024, small-cap stocks were trading at their lowest price-to-book (P/B) valuations relative to large caps in 25 years. And last time the gap was so large, small caps went on to outperform for more than a decade. But his thesis was predicated on something that didn't happen to the extent Lee expected -- falling interest rates. The Federal Reserve was widely expected to start cutting rates early in 2024 and continue to do so, but it waited until the end of the year and ended up pausing after just 75 basis points of rate cuts.\nWhy this could be the year\nI'm going to make the bold prediction that the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (NASDAQ: VTWO) could rise by as much as 50% over the next 12 months. (Note: I'm writing this on Aug. 8, 2025.)\nSince Lee first made his call, not only have interest rates not moved as much as expected, but the valuation gap between small caps and large caps has widened even further. In all, since the beginning of 2024, the S&P 500 has outperformed the Russell 2000 by 24 percentage points. One eye-popping statistic is that the average stock in the S&P 500 trades for 4.9 times book value. Meanwhile, the average Russell 2000 component has a P/B ratio of just 1.8.\nTo be sure, I'm not saying the gap should narrow entirely. The S&P 500 is disproportionately weighted to asset-light tech giants and should command a somewhat higher price-to-book ratio. But that's a big gap and, as mentioned, by far the biggest disparity since the late 1990s tech boom.\nIt's looking like the Fed is finally set to start cutting rates in September. And when it starts, the cuts are likely to occur for a while. In fact, the median expectation, according to the CME FedWatch tool, is a total of five interest rate cuts over the next year.", "content_hash": "c8a9918fdf1f655617596b957b1b9001", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

The company just reported its third straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth as its platform strategy takes shape following earlier additions of product features like session replay, which allows clients to see how customers move through their websites, and guides and surveys, which let clients add a pop-up bubble to prompt customers as they go through the website.\nWith the help of those products, Amplitude reported its strongest growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in several quarters, up 16% to $335 million, and it had its highest net-new ARR in nearly three years at $15 million, showing that the business is building momentum. Its dollar-based net retention rate in the second quarter was also the strongest it has been in at least six quarters at 104%, showing it's moving past the post-pandemic churn that had hampered its growth earlier in its history.\nOn a reported basis, revenue in the quarter rose 14% year over year to $83.3 million, which topped the consensus at $81.3 million. The number of customers with an ARR of $100,000 or more was up 16% to 634.\nOn the bottom line, Amplitude is also gaining traction. The company reported an adjusted profit of $0.01 per share, up from breakeven in the quarter a year ago, which matched estimates. Better yet, free cash flow in the quarter nearly tripled, jumping from $6.8 million to $18.2 million.\nAmplitude's AI playbook\nThe company made several acquisitions over the last year to round out its platform and launch its new suite of AI agents. It acquired Command AI last October, which laid the groundwork for its guides and surveys product, which CEO Spenser Skates said had the fastest adoption the company has had with a new offering.\nIt acquired June, another product analytics tool known for AI-powered analysis, last month; Kraftful for its AI-native Voice of Customer product; and Inari, another feedback analytics tool.\nThose moves will help beef up Amplitude's talent and offerings as it pushes deeper into AI following the launch of its AI agents in June. Those are currently in beta, being tested by customers, and the company expects to begin selling them later this year.\nAt an event in June, Amplitude introduced several new AI agents, and according to Skates, two of the most promising are Experiment, which generates a variant of an existing website based on the data Amplitude has, and Insight Generation, which looks at a client's dashboard and generates insights -- pinpointing, for example, a drop in traffic and a remedy for it.\nCustomer response to the AI agents has been strong so far, and Amplitude shared a demonstration of some of its capabilities, showing that the company has the potential to add significant value for its customers at a time when there's a lot of hype swirling through the AI sector.\nThe company also got some validation from Forester in its first digital analytics solutions report, rating Amplitude highest in the strength of offering, and it was also rated as a customer favorite, underscoring management's recent efforts.\nIs Amplitude a buy?\nThird-quarter guidance was also better than expected, calling for revenue of $85 million to $87 million, up 17.3%, showing revenue growth is likely to accelerate again.\nAmplitude is still a small company with a market cap of just $1.6 billion, and its revenue growth is already accelerating without the benefit of the new AI agents. Those could be a real difference-maker for the stock as it pioneers the digital product analytics market and takes on legacy providers like Alphabet's Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics.\nThe building blocks seem to be coming together for Amplitude to thrive. If its growth continues to accelerate and the AI agents take off, the stock could soar.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amplitude right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Amplitude, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amplitude wasn’t one of them.

(MSFT) generated impressive free cash flow (FCF) growth and higher FCF margins in the June quarter, and said capital expenditure (capex) growth would moderate. That could lead to a +28% upside in MSFT's price over $668 per share. This article will show why.\nMSFT closed at $522.04 on Friday, Aug. 8, 2025, which was lower than the pre-release high of $535.64 on Aug. 4. In a prior Barchart article (\"Analysts Keep Raising Microsoft Stock Price Targets - Time to Buy?), I had set a price target of $618 based on its FCF margins.\nAfter Microsoft's fiscal Q4 earnings for the June 30 quarter and management's outlook and guidance for the next fiscal year, I am raising this target to over $668 per share.\nThat is a 15% higher price target, based on Microsoft's stellar operating cash flow (OCF) margins and its lower growth in its capex. That will lead to significantly higher free cash flow (FCF) and FCF margins next year. Let's look at this.\nHigher Operating Cash Flow Margins and Lower Capex Growth Will Propel FCF Higher\nMicrosoft's operating cash flow (OCF) for the June quarter (fiscal Q4) was $42.647 billion, +14.7% higher than the prior year. However, the OCF margin was significantly higher than the past 2 quarters, implying that it has squeezed out more cash from its operations.\nFor example, the fiscal Q4 ratio of OCF to revenue was 55.79% (i.e., $42.647 billion/$76.44 billion), compared to 52.8% in fiscal Q3 ending March 31 (i.e., $37.044 b/$70.066 b), and in Q2 it was 32%. For the full year, Microsoft generated $136.16 billion in OCF on $281.7 billion in revenue, or 48.3% of revenue, on par with 48.4% in the prior year.\nAs a result, if Microsoft keeps generating high operating cash flow margins with higher revenue, and if capex growth moderates, its FCF could rise significantly.\nRevenue Forecast. Here is why I think this will happen. First, management projects that revenue growth will be in “double digits.”\nThat is seen on page 6 of its outlook deck. Last year, sales were up 14.9% and in Q4, +18% Y/Y. Moreover, analysts are now projecting almost 15% growth next year.\nFor example, 54 analysts surveyed by Seeking Alpha have FY 2026 revenue at $322.04 billion (+14.3%) and the same forecast at Yahoo! Finance.\nOCF Forecast. Therefore, let's assume that Microsoft will generate at least 53% OCF margins next year (lower than the 55.79% margin in Q4, but higher than the 48.3% OCF margin in FY 2025):\nCapex Forecast. In the outlook deck, management indicated that it expects that FY 2026 capital expenditure growth will moderate. That has already started. In fiscal Q4, capex rose just 2.0% from the prior quarter to $17.079 billion from $16.745 billion in fiscal Q3. That compares with the full-year 45% growth in capex from $44.48 billion to $64.55 billion in FY 2025.\nAs a result, let's assume capex rises +10% in FY 2026, slightly faster than the annualized 8.0% Q4 2025 growth rate (2.0% x 4). That puts the full year FY 26 capex at $71.00 billion.\nFree Cash Flow Forecast (FCF): Free cash flow is OCF minus capex. Here is how that works out for FY 2026:\n$170.68b OCF FY 2026 est. - $71.0 billion capex est. = $99.68 billionFCF\nThat works out to be $28 billion higher than the $71.611 billion generated in FY 2025 (see table below), i.e., a 39% year-over-year increase for FY 2026.\nMoreover, it represents a significantly higher FCF margin for next year:\n$99.68 FCF FY 2026 est. / $322.04 billion FY 2026 revenue est. = 31.0% FCF Margin\nLast year, Microsoft's FCF margin was 25.4% (i.e., $71.6b/$281.7 billion - see table above).\nAs a result, given this higher FCF forecast, the market will likely give MSFT stock a higher valuation over the next 12 months. Let's look at that.\nMSFT Price Target\nOne way to value a stock like this is to use a FCF yield metric. For example, Yahoo! Finance says the market cap on Friday was $3.88 trillion (i.e., $3,880 billion).\nTherefore, its FY 2025 FCF of $71.6 billion represents 1.845% of that market value. That is the same as a multiple of 54x (i.e., $3,880b/$71.6b = 54.19).\nJust to be conservative, let's use a lower multiple of 50x, i.e., a 2.0% FCF yield:\n$99.68b FCF est / 0.02 = $4,984 billion target\nIn other words, given our assumptions, Microsoft's value could rise over $1 trillion over the next 12 months, or an upside of +28.5%:\n$4,984 / $3,800 b mkt cap today = 1.2845 -1 =+28.5% upside\nLet's lower that to 28%. As a result, our price target is $668.21 per share:\n$522.04 p/sh today x 1.28 = $668.21 target price\nSummary of the Valuation\nHere is a summary of what that means. If analysts' +14.3% revenue forecast comes to pass, and if Microsoft generates a 53% operating cash flow margin with 10% higher capex growth, its FCF will rise to almost $100 billion.\nThat will represent an annual FCF margin of 31%, vs. 25.4% last year. As a result, using a 2.0% FCF yield metric, MSFT stock could be worth over 28% more.\nOne way to play this is to set a lower buy-in target price and get paid while waiting. This can be done by selling short out-of-the-money (OTM) puts in nearby expiry periods.\nShorting OTM puts\nFor example, I discussed this play in my last Barchart article, where I suggested shorting the $470 put strike price for expiry on Aug. 8.\nThe investor made an immediate yield of almost 1.5% (i.e., $6.80/$470.00 = 0.01447 = 1.447%) for 38 days until expiry at a strike price that was over 4.3% below the trading price (i.e., out-of-the-money). That option expired worthless, and the investor had no obligation to buy shares at $470.00.\nThis play can now be repeated. For example, look at the Sept. 12 expiry period. It shows that the $505.00 strike price, over 3% below the trading price, has a midpoint premium of $5.18.\nThat represents about a 1% short-put yield for the next month (i.e., $5.18/$505.00 = 0.010257 = 1.026%).\nThis means that an investor who secures $50,500 in cash and/or buying power with their brokerage can earn an immediate income of $518.00 in their account. As long as MSFT stays over $505.00 in the next 34 days, the price of the put will degrade (i.e., time decay).\nAs a result, the investor may end up having the $50.5K collateral assigned to buy 100 shares (i.e., $50,500 = 100x $505.00).\nThe bottom line is that this is a good way to set a lower potential buy-in point. For example, the breakeven investment price would be below $500:\n$505.00 strike - $5.18 income received = $499.82 breakeven\nThat is 4.26% below today's price, so this provides good downside protection. As a result, if MSFT rises to the target price of $668.21, the investor has a potential upside of 33.7%.\n(Investors can study Barchart's Options Learn Center Tutorials and various options webinars to study the risks associated with options investing.)\nThe bottom line is Microsoft stock looks deeply undervalued here. Investors can set a lower potential buy-in by shorting OTM puts in nearby expiry periods to play it.\nOn the date of publication, Mark R.

The developer of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered software announced an IPO price of $33 per share on July 30, 2025. Its stock opened the next morning at $85 and soared as high as $142.92 the following day.\nGranted, Figma subsequently gave up some of its tremendous gains. However, its stock remains more than 170% higher than the IPO price.\nFigma appears to fit the profile of previous tech stocks that have become huge winners for long-term investors. Could buying $10,000 worth of this hot AI stock make you a millionaire?\nWhat Figma does\nBrown University students Dylan Field and Evan Wallace founded Sigma in 2012 to make the design of digital applications more collaborative. It took a while for their idea to catch on: Some designers were reluctant to give up their creative control and were afraid they'd be micromanaged. That initial hesitance faded over time, though, as design teams experienced the benefits of collaboration.\nFigma didn't limit its focus to design. In 2021, the company launched an online whiteboard for collaborative brainstorming called FigJam. Two years later, it introduced Dev Mode, a platform that helps translate design ideas into real software products. Figma rolled out Figma Slides in 2024 to facilitate the creation of collaborative presentations.\n2025 has been an especially busy year for the company. In addition to conducting its IPO, Figma launched four new products. Figma Sites enables users to design and publish a website. Figma Make harnesses the power of generative AI to create fully functional prototypes from text prompts. Figma Buzz allows users to create social media posts, ads, and other marketing materials. Figma Draw helps create digital illustrations with vector brushes and other editing effects.\nToday, 76% of Figma's customers use at least two of its products. The company's customer base also includes 95% of the Fortune 500 and 78% of the Fortune 2000. Figma's customers are a virtual who's who of online companies, from Airbnb and Atlassian to Netflix and Zoom.\nA massive opportunity\nFigma estimates that its current total addressable market is around $33 billion. It generated revenue of $749 million last year -- less than 2.3% of that total. But this market should grow rapidly.\nInternational Data Corporation (IDC) projects that over 1 billion new apps will be added worldwide by 2028. This explosive growth presents a massive opportunity for Figma.\nThe company has a clear plan to capitalize on this opportunity. Figma is working to convert both new and existing users into paid customers. It's encouraging current customers to use more of its products and extend usage to more of their staff. Figma is also expanding internationally.\nPerhaps the most important component of its growth strategy, though, is adding new products. Figma continues to invest heavily in research and development. The company is also making strategic acquisitions that boost its capabilities. For example, Figma recently bought a tech company that has a self-hosted content management system.\nCould Figma turn $10,000 into $1 million?\nTo turn an initial $10,000 into $1 million, Figma would need to deliver a 100x return. Is that possible? Sure. Is it probable? I don't think so.\nFor one thing, expectations of significant growth are already baked into Figma's share price. The stock currently trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 49.3, according to LSEG. Even with Figma's impressive 46% year-over-year revenue growth, that's a steep valuation.\nThere's also another mathematical hurdle. Let's assume that Figma captures every penny of its estimated total addressable market of $33 billion. Heck, let's even say that the market size doubles to $66 billion. But we'll also need Figma's price-to-sales (P/S) multiple to be more realistic. The current average P/S ratio for application software companies is around 8.8.\nMultiplying $66 billion in sales times a P/S ratio of 8.8 gives us $580.8 billion. That's a far cry from the market cap of a little over $4 trillion that Figma would need to have to grow $10,000 into $1 million.\nFigma is, without question, a hot IPO stock. If you're looking to become a millionaire, though, you'll probably need to find other stocks to buy.\nShould you buy stock in Figma right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Figma, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Figma wasn’t one of them.

Even though short-term movements in the market can create noise that distracts even the most seasoned of investors, keeping your focus on your long-term investing horizon is key.\nIf you have cash to put to work in stocks, money that you don't need for financial obligations like bills, it's always a great time to put capital into shares of quality companies. On that note, here are three stocks that have soared over the last year, but look like they still have considerable room to run and reward long-term shareholders.\n1. Monday.com\nMonday.com(NASDAQ: MNDY) is a subscription-based cloud platform for task management. Its core offering is a customizable visual work platform that is low-code or no-code and allows teams to manage projects, track workflows, and collaborate effectively without software development expertise needed. The platform is used by clients across a diverse range of industries including technology and finance to ensure the cohesiveness of their various teams and effectively keep on top of their organization's projects.\nThat seamless value proposition has enabled Monday.com to quickly grow its client base while delivering rapidly improving financials.\nIn the company's first quarter of fiscal 2025, Monday.com exceeded expectations on numerous key metrics, with revenue increasing by 30% year over year to $282.3 million. The company's seeing strong performance thanks to numerous catalysts, including its growing multiproduct offering, adoption of various artificial intelligence (AI) features, and continued success in expanding its enterprise client base.\nThe company's Q1 operating income was $9.8 million compared to a loss of $5 million one year ago, while adjusted free cash flow came in at $109.5 million, up from $89.9 million in the year-ago quarter. A couple of other points worth mentioning: Monday.com's Q1 net dollar retention rate was 112%, while its cohort of paid customers with more than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR) was 1,328, up 46% year over year. This stock might be well worth a second look for growth-oriented investors.\n2. Toast\nToast (NYSE: TOST) is a cloud-based restaurant management platform offering a suite of software and hardware solutions for the food service industry. Its business model revolves around providing an all-in-one platform that combines point-of-sale (POS) systems, online ordering, payments, payroll, and other essential services that restaurants require to serve customers and pay their staff.\nToast generates revenue through a combination of subscription fees for its software, transaction fees from payment processing, and sales of hardware like its POS terminals. The company is actively expanding its reach to include other food and beverage retailers outside of restaurants, like convenience stores, grocery stores, and bottle shops. Toast aims to offer a comprehensive platform for these businesses to modernize operations and improve guest experiences, with recent new onboarded clients ranging from Topgolf Callaway Brands to Applebee's.\nApplebee's was the single largest deal in Toast's history. As of Q1, Toast had added over 6,000 net new locations in the three-month period alone, while its annual recurring run rate was $1.7 billion, up 31% year over year. Total locations increased 25% year over year to approximately 140,000, while gross payment volume spiked 22% year over year to $42.2 billion.\nImportantly, the company is now profitable under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), reporting net income of $56 million in Q1 2025 compared to a net loss of $83 million one year ago. Toast also delivered positive free cash flow of $69 million in Q1 2025, compared to a negative figure of $33 million in the year-ago period. With shares up more than 100% in the last year alone, if the company keeps strengthening its financial chops, there's no reason it can't rocket higher.\n3. Dutch Bros\nDutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) is known for its wide variety of customizable, hand-crafted beverages, including flavored and blended coffee drinks. The company primarily operates compact drive-thru kiosks or stands rather than larger cafes with seating, reducing the need for extensive real estate or elaborate interior design. That drive-thru model also allows for a smaller, more focused staff, primarily consisting of what Dutch Bros calls its \"Broistas,\" who manage the order-taking and drink-making processes.\nThe smaller footprint and purpose-built nature of Dutch Bros locations contribute to lower overhead costs compared to traditional coffee shops. Meanwhile, Dutch Bros is rapidly expanding its store footprint, testing out new food and drink offerings, and has aggressive expansion plans in the coming years. Management is aiming to reach upward of 2,000 system shops by 2029 (almost double its current store count), but thinks the company has a total addressable market of 7,000 shops.\nIn Q1, Dutch Bros' revenue grew 29% year over year to more than $355 million, while net income increased to $22.5 million from $16.2 million in the same period of 2024. Dutch Bros opened 30 new shops across 11 states, bringing the total to 1,012 locations at the end of the quarter, and its Dutch Rewards program contributed to 72% of system transactions, a significant increase from the previous year and indicating strong customer engagement.\nThe company's newly launched mobile order program now accounts for 11% of transaction mix, and should represent a growing opportunity for Dutch Bros to attract and retain customers. With shares up more than 60% over the trailing 12 months, about 3 times the return of the broader market in that same period, now could be a good time for investors to take a second look at this top restaurant stock.\nShould you buy stock in Monday.com right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Monday.com, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Monday.com wasn’t one of them.

One of the people said the suspension came after the company failed to extend a key mining permit which expired on Aug. 9.\nCATL didn’t immediately respond to questions from Bloomberg outside business hours.\nThe lithium industry has been buffeted in recent weeks by extreme volatility in the spot, futures and equity markets, and the Jianxiawo operation has been in particular focus, given questions over its permit renewal. Last week traders flew drones over the mine, forecast to account for about 3% of the world’s mined production, in the hope of gauging the current state of output.\nA second person briefed on the matter said affiliated refineries in nearby Yichun had been informed of the closure. The first person added the company was still in talks with government agencies to secure a renewal but was preparing for the halt to last months. The people asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly.\nCATL’s permit trouble and suspension come as Beijing cracks down on overcapacity across a host of industries and increases scrutiny of mining operations. For an industry that has been plagued by a glut for more than two years, however, the pause in output from a significant link in the supply chain will be a boon.\nCATL saw revenue from its battery mineral resources business plummet 29% in 2024, a drop that underscores challenges facing the Chinese company’s upstream investments including a precipitous decline in lithium prices. These were originally intended as a way of securing supply and managing costs, and CATL had aggressively pursued mining stakes, even overseas.\nThe most-active lithium carbonate futures contract touched more than 80,000 yuan ($11,128) in July on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange, which moved to rein in speculative trades afterward.

But beneath the surface, Amazon has quietly built up a multiengine empire, spanning cloud computing, advertising, and entertainment.\nThis article will explore one of Amazon's underappreciated strengths and one real risk that long-term investors should keep in mind.\nRed flag: E-commerce growth is slowing, and margins remain thin\nFor years, Amazon's e-commerce has been its bedrock for growth, slowly capturing market share from offline retailers and other incumbents. It has been wildly successful, making it a giant of its own.\nBut here's the thing: For all its dominance, Amazon's core e-commerce business is maturing. Worse, it is increasingly facing pressure on multiple fronts, and that's reflected in its recent numbers.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, North America segment sales rose just 8% year over year while the international segment's revenue grew by only 5%. That's a far cry from the breakneck growth rates of the 2010s. More concerning, the company's core commerce revenue (online sales, physical stores, and third-party services) grew at around 5% to 6%, much lower than the numbers above after excluding advertising and subscription revenue.\nAnd despite its gigantic size -- net sales reached $126 billion in the first quarter of 2025 -- it had an operating profit of just $6.8 billion, or 5.4%. That margin might be acceptable for a grocery store. But for a tech giant with massive infrastructure costs, it limits how much the retail engine can contribute to long-term earnings power.\nTo make things tougher, Amazon faces growing competition from low-cost, well-positioned challengers like Temu and Shein. These newcomers are leveraging ultra-lean supply chains and social virality to win younger consumers -- and they're increasingly encroaching on categories like apparel, beauty, and home goods.\nThe silver lining? Amazon isn't standing still. Its logistics network is becoming more efficient, with faster delivery speeds and lower costs per package. It's also pushing hard on its own low-cost e-commerce (Amazon Haul) to overcome Temu and Shein.\nStill, investors will want to see Amazon prove it can sustain even modest growth -- and expand margins over time for its commerce segment. Otherwise, this red flag could remain a drag on the stock, even as other business lines post better numbers.\nGreen flag: Amazon's advertising business is quietly exploding\nIf retail is showing signs of fatigue, advertising might be Amazon's next growth engine.\nIn Q1 2025, Amazon's ad revenue jumped 18% year over year to $13.9 billion, making it one of the largest digital advertising platforms globally. Moreover, advertising is a high-margin business, meaning it may eventually contribute more to the bottom line than the retail business.\nWhat makes Amazon ads unique isn't just impressions. It's intent. Amazon reaches customers at the moment they're ready to buy -- giving it higher conversion rates than search or social platforms. And with its massive trove of first-party purchase data, Amazon offers brands a powerful platform for targeted marketing.\nBut advertising doesn't end on Amazon's shopping sites. The recent move to introduce ads in Prime Video has opened a new chapter. With hundreds of millions of global Prime members, Amazon now runs one of the largest ad-supported streaming platforms in the world.\nEven Google and Meta Platforms can't fully match this.\nThat's because Amazon owns the entire customer journey -- from ad exposure, to product search, to purchase -- all within its ecosystem. This closed-loop attribution model allows brands to track precisely how ads turn into sales.\nFor example, a user might see a product placement on Prime Video, tap an ad on their Fire TV, and complete the purchase on Amazon's app -- all while feeding Amazon's flywheel of shopping and behavioral data. That kind of end-to-end visibility is gold for marketers.\nWhat does it mean for investors?\nAmazon isn't just an e-commerce company anymore.\nWhile retail remains a critical piece of its empire, it's becoming clearer that Amazon's long-term profit engine will come from high-margin businesses like cloud computing and advertising. In particular, the ad business is gaining real momentum, with unique advantages that could drive years of growth.\nYes, retail faces challenges. But if Amazon can stabilize commerce and let other faster-growing segments do the heavy lifting, the stock could still compound over time.\nFor long-term investors, understanding which parts of Amazon are growing -- and which are not -- may be the key to seeing the company's future.\nDo the experts think Amazon is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

But there are ways that you can reduce the effect of emotion on your decision-making process.\nStocks that pay dividends can help take some of the emotion out of the equation, since they pay investors passive income simply via them holding the stock. That way, investors can get a return and raise some money without having to sell anything.\nUnited Parcel Service(NYSE: UPS), Freeport-McMoRan(NYSE: FCX), and Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN) have high yields, but they are in the bargain bin despite the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) hovering around an all-time high. Here's why all three dividend stocks are worth buying now.\nBig Brown presents a big bargain opportunity for investors to earn major passive income\nScott Levine(United Parcel Service): After sinking 28% since the start of the year as of this writing, United Parcel Service stock's poor performance is even more disconcerting in light of the 8.3% rise in the S&P 500.\nAs a result of the fall, shares of the leading logistics company are now sitting in the bargain bin, giving investors a great opportunity to pick it up -- along with its 7.2% forward-yielding dividend -- at a discount to its historic valuation.\nThe stock's decline reflects how investors are skittish about the company's year-over-year declines in revenue and earnings stemming from higher costs. A lack of clarity about how international trade policy will affect the company's financials represents another major concern raised during the second-quarter 2025 financial results presentation.\nWhile these issues are valid, prospective investors shouldn't assume that higher costs in the near term and questions about tariffs will keep UPS from returning to growth. For one, management projects to achieve $3.5 billion in cost reductions in 2025, thanks to its network reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined initiatives.\nWith respect to the dividend, skeptics may question the payout's sustainability, considering the challenges that lie before the company. Management, however, has taken a judicious approach to rewarding shareholders. Over the past five years, UPS has averaged a 76.9% payout ratio, so investors can be confident that management is prioritizing the company's financial health.\nThere may be some further bumps in the road in the near future, but investors with long investment horizons who are comfortable with enduring some near-term volatility should be rewarded in the long term with a UPS investment today.\nThe pick of the copper mining sector\nLee Samaha(Freeport-McMoRan): This leading copper company's stock sank recently after the Trump administration exempted imports of refined copper from 50% tariffs. The tariff will be applied to semi-finished products, but not to refined copper. That's bad news for Freeport-McMoRan, a company that has about a third of its copper in the U.S. and produces more than 70% of the refined copper in the U.S.\nIt's also bad news for speculators who had bid up the U.S. price of copper to a more than 25% premium over the international price in anticipation of tariffs on refined copper imports. The announcement sent Freeport's stock price down, and the premium disappeared.\nStill, investors shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the stock is still a great value. For example, management argues that it will generate $8.5 billion in operating cash flow in 2026/2027 at a copper price of $4 per pound, and $11 billion at a price of $5 per pound.\nThe update from the Trump administration sent the U.S. copper price tumbling from above $5.75 per pound down to about $4.35 per pound. Plugging that figure into Freeport's model implies an operating cash flow of about $9.55 billion in 2026/2027. Based on the current market cap of $56 billion, it implies a price to operating cash flow of 5.9 times.\nThat's cheap on an absolute and historical basis.\nAs such, this 1.5%-yielding stock looks like a great value, whether refined copper imports are tariffed or not.\nTexas Instruments is a buy during this cyclical slowdown\nDaniel Foelber (Texas Instruments): Texas Instruments, commonly known as TI, underwent a significant sell-off after reporting second-quarter 2025 earnings. The headline results were solid, including a 16% jump in revenue and earnings per share (EPS). However, the semiconductor stalwart is seeing weakness across key end markets, especially automotive. Tariff risks also continue to cast a cloud over TI's ability to forecast near-term growth.\nDespite the choppy outlook, TI remains an excellent passive income opportunity, especially for investors interested in the semiconductor industry. TI makes analog and embedded processing products that are essential components across the economy. Applications include automation for factories and industrial customers, medical equipment, smart grids, automotive sensors and systems, personal electronics, and more.\nTI is unique in that it does most of its own manufacturing, which is a stark contrast to fabless semiconductor companies like Nvidia, which relies on foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing to make its chips. TI's vertically integrated approach makes it a more capital-intensive business, but it also gives it greater control over its supply chain.\nOverall, TI's business model is well-positioned for steady growth over time, but it won't offer the kind of breakneck growth potential found in companies on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence. However, TI could be a great stock for dividend investors.\nTI sports a 2.9% dividend yield, which is hard to find in the tech sector. For context, another well-known dividend-paying chip stock -- Qualcomm -- yields 2.1%, and Applied Materials, Lam Research, and Broadcom now yield less than 1%.\nTI is also a good value relative to its earnings growth. It's a cyclical company, so its valuation will look expensive during slowdowns and more expensive during expansion periods. Despite earnings being around their lowest level in five years, TI still sports a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.8. But TI's valuation could look a lot cheaper if the stock price continues to stagnate.\nConsensus analyst estimates call for $6.65 in 2026 EPS -- which would give TI a 28.4 P/E ratio based on its share price at the time of this writing. But again, because TI is cyclical, it's best not to read too much into short-term changes in its valuation. Rather, look at the long-term potential of its earnings growth.\nTI is a good buy for dividend investors because it plays a foundational role in global connectivity and stands to benefit from innovation in automation and robotics.\nShould you invest $1,000 in United Parcel Service right now?\nBefore you buy stock in United Parcel Service, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and United Parcel Service wasn’t one of them.

What started as a small team has grown to more than 100 full-time employees specializing in software and data engineering, business analysis, data and cloud platforms, and many internal functions.\nRather than pursue rapid offshore expansion, West Monroe has prioritized building a nearshore team that works in real time with U.S. colleagues and clients. This thoughtful approach, anchored in shared time zones, close collaboration, and cultural alignment, helps the firm deliver integrated consulting services while maintaining the same level of quality, speed, and connection.\nWest Monroe's Costa Rica team plays a critical role in delivering high-impact and efficient outcomes for clients across industries. As demand rises for specialized skills—particularly in Salesforce and Databricks development—the firm is investing in creative training and upskilling programs to ensure a steady pipeline of future-ready talent.\n\"Early on, we saw the incredible talent and potential in the Costa Rica team,\" said Brian Paulen, head of offices and global enterprise services at West Monroe. \"What started as a smart and strategic bet has evolved into a vital part of our business. Reaching 100 employees is a big milestone—but even more impressive is how seamlessly our Costa Rica and U.S. teams partner together, support each other, and genuinely enjoy the work, despite being separated by thousands of miles.\"\nWest Monroe hosted a celebration at its Costa Rica office on July 30, attended by Costa Rica-based employees and several West Monroe leaders, including the firm's Costa Rica office lead, Cristhian García. The event marked a moment of momentum for a team that has already made a significant impact across the firm. In West Monroe's internal pulse survey, the Costa Rica team consistently reports the highest fulfillment scores—a testament to the strong culture, sense of purpose, and opportunity they've built since day one.\n\"I'm incredibly proud to lead this team and to witness the impact we've made together,\" García said. \"We've built a high-performing culture that delivers real value to clients—and our fulfillment rate is a reflection of that. Clients consistently ask for more of our Costa Rica talent because they're engaging, problem-solvers, and becoming true extensions of our clients' teams. It's exciting to see where we're headed as we continue to grow.\"", "content_hash": "58ada29b9eb22780fb5017febffbb426", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

He had already become the wealthiest person in the world, reaching centibillionaire status briefly in 1999. He slowly stepped back from the company he founded over the next 20 years, ultimately resigning from its board in 2020.\nGates' focus over the last 25 years has shifted from building a leading technology company to solving some of the world's toughest health, equality, and educational challenges through the Gates Foundation. In that time, he and ex-wife Melinda French Gates donated about $60 billion of their wealth, making them two of the biggest donors in history. Their philanthropic giving is only outdone by Gates' friend Warren Buffett, who has been a longtime donor to his foundation.\nWhile Gates' fortune was built on Microsoft, he's mostly followed Buffett's investing style when it comes to his personal portfolio and that of the Gates Foundation trust fund. Buffett is a big proponent of the idea of putting a lot of your capital to work in just a few outstanding companies. As a result, over two-thirds of the Gates Foundation's trust's marketable equity portfolio is held in just three marvelous stocks all reflecting the combined influence of Gates and Buffett.\n1. Microsoft (33%)\nThe majority of Gates' wealth comes from his stake in Microsoft, the company he co-founded in 1975. After his most recent donation to the Gates Foundation in 2022, Gates' stake in the company fell to less than 1%. Of course, 1% of a $4 trillion company is still $40 billion.\nThe Gates Foundation still holds a significant stake in Microsoft as well, even though it regularly sells shares to fund its operations. As of its most recent 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Gates Foundation held 28.5 million shares of Microsoft. Those shares are worth $14.8 billion as of this writing.\nMicrosoft's seeing strong results across its cloud computing business, Azure, as well as its core enterprise software. Both are benefiting from growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI).\nAzure is now a $75 billion business, up 34% over the past year, generating a strong operating margin for Microsoft. Not only that, but Azure revenue is accelerating, as demand continues to outstrip supply. Microsoft is investing tens of billions of dollars in building capacity for AI training and inference.\nOn the software side of the business, management is seeing strong adoption of its Copilot AI agent. Management said it surpassed 100 million monthly active users across its family of Copilot apps. Moreover, its Copilot Studio, which enables businesses to harness their own data to develop custom AI agents, saw customers create 3 million new agents over the past year.\nThat's resulted in revenue acceleration over the past year (up 18% last quarter) as well as margin expansion. Earnings per share climbed an impressive 24% last quarter. While the stock responded positively, increased earnings expectations for the stock mean shares trade for about 34 times earnings estimates. That's an attractive price for the stock with accelerating earnings growth and tens of billions in quarterly free cash flow it can use to invest in future opportunities or return to shareholders.\n2. Berkshire Hathaway (17%)\nWarren Buffett makes an annual donation of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) shares to the Gates Foundation every summer. Buffett earmarked 10 million Class B shares for the foundation in 2006, or 500 million shares after adjusting for splits. Every year, Buffett donates 5% of the remaining earmarked shares as long as the Gates Foundation's total giving from the previous year is equal to the amount donated in the previous year plus 5% of the foundation's other assets.\nDespite that stipulation, the foundation has managed to hold onto a good chunk of Berkshire shares. It counted 17.2 million shares as of the end of March this year. Those shares are worth about $7.9 billion as of this writing. The foundation received another 9.4 million shares on June 30, according to SEC filings.\nShares of Berkshire Hathaway suffered since the company's annual meeting in May, when Buffett announced his resignation as CEO effective Jan. 1. While some of that is due to a loss of the \"Buffett premium\" some shareholders may have put on Berkshire Hathaway, the company has also faced some challenges.\nThe insurance business saw outstanding results in 2024, but that's normalized in 2025. Price increases haven't added meaningful revenue while increases in payouts in the first quarter led to worse underwriting results.\nAdditionally, Buffett hasn't seen very many opportunities to invest Berkshire's capital, leading him to leave a lot of cash on the sidelines even as stock prices continue to rise. In fact, Buffett's been a net seller of stocks for 11 consecutive quarters. Berkshire ended the second quarter with $344 billion in cash and equivalents, significantly more in value than its marketable equities.\nBuffett hasn't even found Berkshire shares particularly attractive, passing on the opportunity to buy back shares with Berkshire's cash hoard. Even after the pullback in price, shares trade for roughly 1.5 times book value. That's around the valuation where Buffett initially stopped repurchasing shares.\nHowever, if the stock falls meaningfully below that 1.5-times-book-value threshold, Buffett might resume buying shares, and investors should consider buying up the stock at that price as well. Berkshire's operations remain strong and the opportunity for Buffett or his team of investment managers to make a move with $344 billion at their disposal holds a lot of potential value.\n3. Waste Management (17%)\nWaste Management(NYSE: WM) is a boring stock that the Gates Foundation Trust has held in its portfolio for decades. In fact, it's added to its stake in the company, and it now holds 35.2 million shares (up from 1.2 million shares in 2002). Those shares are worth about $7.5 billion as of this writing.\nThe waste collection and disposal company has seen strong organic growth over the last few years, with revenue climbing 6% per year from 2022 through 2024. That's continued in 2025, growing 5.4% in its most recent quarter.\nOn top of that organic growth, management has made strategic acquisitions that have been accretive. Its most recent acquisition, Stericycle, pushed Waste Management into the medical waste space. Rebranded as WM Healthcare Solutions, the business contributed about 10% of Waste Management net operating revenue in the second quarter.\nThe company managed to produce strong operating margins despite taking on the lower-margin medical waste business. Last quarter's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 29.9% was essentially in line with last year's margin without the Healthcare Solutions business. As management unlocks synergies in the acquisition and scales the business, it should see strong improvements in profitability over time.\nThat margin expansion is supported by Waste Management's incomparable position in the industry thanks to its landfill portfolio. New entrants face high barriers to entry as regulatory hurdles make it impractical to develop new landfills. Additionally, Waste Management's scale gives it a better margin profile as it's able to develop denser routes and benefit from economies of scale.\nDespite Waste Management's dominant position in the industry, the stock trades at a lower valuation than its two biggest competitors. At an enterprise value of 15 times forward EBITDA estimates, it's a fair price to pay for a company with expanding EBITDA margins and strong organic revenue growth.\nShould you buy stock in Microsoft right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

The company enjoyed a vaccine windfall during the COVID-19 pandemic, but revenue and profits cratered as the pandemic eased and those tailwinds stopped blowing. The stock has tumbled, sending Pfizer's dividend yield to a whopping 7.3%.\nBut Pfizer's stock price recently bounced on its second-quarter earnings. Investors have been looking for a glimpse into Pfizer's future, and there is a lot to like as things begin to come into view.\nHere is why Pfizer's newfound momentum could set the stock up to soar in 2026.\nPrudent financial management secures a generous dividend\nPfizer's generous dividend has become a big reason why many people consider owning the stock. It's not easy to find a 7.3% dividend yield, and oftentimes, stocks that do are yield traps with significant underlying risks.\nWhile the market's negative sentiment toward Pfizer and the company's post-pandemic struggles have driven the share price down and the yield higher, the dividend itself is on solid footing. Management has raised the dividend for 15 consecutive years, so losing those pandemic-related profits didn't force a dividend cut. Additionally, the current dividend of $1.72 per share is well below the mid-point of management's 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $3 per share.\nIn other words, Pfizer is still earning plenty of money to afford its dividend, and is using that cushion to, wisely, pay down debt to improve its balance sheet. That's prudent financial leadership, and should give investors some confidence that they can count on the stock's robust 7.3% yield as a nice baseline for the stock's future returns.\nIs Wall Street sleeping on Pfizer's growth?\nIt seems the broader market is cautious toward healthcare stocks at the moment. Not only could tariffs raise costs for drug companies, but there is also pressure from the Trump administration to cut prescription drug prices for Americans.\nHowever, Pfizer seems to be increasingly confident that it can navigate these headwinds and grow its business. Management recently raised its 2025 adjusted earnings guidance from a range of $2.80 to $3.00 per share to $2.90 to $3.10. The company has focused its growth efforts on oncology and specialty drugs, which are less likely to face pricing pressure. And that's precisely where Pfizer is growing the most; the company's specialty drug sales are up 6% year over year, and oncology sales are up 9% through six months of 2025.\nAs specialty and oncology drug sales increase, they should have a greater effect on Pfizer's overall growth. These two segments combined for approximately $16.5 billion through six months of this year. Pfizer's primary care drug sales, totaling $11.2 billion, are down 8% year over year as COVID-19 sales continue to fall off. Six-month sales of Pfizer's COVID-19 drugs are now less than $2 billion, so their impact on the numbers is drying up. Additionally, Pfizer's top seller, Eliquis, faces patent expiration but likely won't face generic competition until at least 2028.\nAnalysts only anticipate Pfizer earning $3.10 per share next fiscal year, but that could be too conservative, given Pfizer's momentum in oncology and specialty drugs and the resulting boost to this year's guidance. It seems tariff and political concerns are weighing on short-term expectations. If you zoom out, analysts anticipate Pfizer growing earnings at an annualized rate of 9% over the next three to five years, which seems to underline the good things happening in the business.\nThe conditions are ripe for a dramatic sentiment boost, making Pfizer a coiled spring at its current price\nSo, what does this all mean? There's an argument that Pfizer's stock could face a boost in sentiment if the dark clouds (tariffs and political pressure) clear out, allowing investors to refocus on Pfizer's growth in oncology and specialty drugs.\nToday, Pfizer trades at just 8 times the midpoint of its 2025 earnings guidance. That valuation resembles a company on the verge of going under, not one that could grow at a high-single-digit pace over the coming years. Even if the valuation stays the same, Pfizer needs very little growth to generate double-digit investment returns because the dividend starts you off at over 7%.\nIf things do go well and Wall Street warms up to Pfizer, the stock could produce some seriously outsized returns from a lucrative trifecta of:\nA 7.3% dividend\nPotential high-single-digit growth\nA valuation that could soar with some positive sentiment\nIt makes Pfizer a fantastic choice for income-focused investors, as well as bargain hunters looking for some upside in a market already trading at all-time highs, chugging toward 2026.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

That was made up of 48% revenue growth and 46% adjusted operating margin.\nThere's no doubt that that's an impressive result and helps show why Palantir stock continues to soar. However, Palantir didn't have the best Rule of 40 score in the software sector this quarter.\nUpstart (NASDAQ: UPST), the artificial intelligence-based lending platform, beat Palantir in the Rule of 40. With revenue growth of 102% and an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin of 21%, giving it a Rule of 40 score of 123.\nUnlike Palantir, which rose after its earnings report, Upstart actually tumbled despite that blowout Rule of 40 score. Should investors buy the dip on Upstart? Let's take a closer look.\nAbout Upstart's quarter\nA year after Upstart unveiled its improved screening model, Model 18, the company is delivering blistering growth, and that model has improved its conversion rates as the company predicted.\nTransaction volume jumped 159% to 372,599 loans approved, with a 23.9% conversion rate, meaning applications that became loans, up from 15.2% in the quarter a year ago.\nRevenue from fees, its core business, rose 84% to $241 million, and total revenue of $257.3 million was well ahead of the average analyst estimate at $225.4 million.\nUpstart impressed on the bottom line as well, as it flipped an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss of $9.3 million to a profit of $53.1 million. It also reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit of $5.6 million, or $0.40 per share on an adjusted basis, up from a loss of $0.17, and better than the estimate of $0.25.\nUpstart's outlook was strong as well, as it raised its full-year forecast and third-quarter projection was ahead of expectations.\nHowever, the reason the stock fell, according to analyst commentary, was that Upstart's take rate shrank, a sign that it could be getting harder for the company to convert origination volume into revenue. In the second quarter, originations reached $2.8 billion, and revenue was $257 million, giving it a take rate of 9%, which was down from 12% in the quarter a year ago.\nIs Upstart a buy?\nAlthough the critique about the take rate may be valid, that seems to be a result of Upstart moving into the super prime loan market, where risk and default rates are typically lower, so it's worth the trade-off.\nAdditionally, Upstart is just starting to tap the vast home and auto loan markets.\nAuto loan originations jumped more than sixfold from a year ago to $114 million, and home loans reached $68 million, up ninefold from the same quarter a year ago.\nThose categories are still small and contribute just a fraction of total revenue, but they have the potential to be huge in the future.\nFurthermore, Upstart's surge in revenue and return to profitability has come without any help from lower interest rates. If interest rates fall, demand for loans through its platform could soar even faster.\nOverall, the sell-off in Upstart looks worth taking advantage of given the rapid growth, improving profitability, and its opportunity in the home and auto markets.

The chips — Nvidia’s H20 AI accelerator and AMD’s MI308 chips — were earlier banned by the Trump administration and require export licenses to sell.\n“To call this unusual or unprecedented would be a staggering understatement,” said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator now with the Singapore-based ISEA — Yusof Ishak Institute. “What we are seeing is in effect the monetization of US trade policy in which US companies must pay the US government for permission to export. If that’s the case, we’ve entered into a new and dangerous world.”\nThe chip-payment arrangement may face legal challenges because it could be construed as an export tax, something that’s not allowed under the constitution, trade experts said. The proposal is the latest direct government intervention into business and finance since Trump returned to the Oval Office in January. As well as a chaotic tariff campaign and persistent criticism of a sitting Federal Reserve chairman, Trump has used his Truth Social platform for everything from calling on CEOs to resign to offering commentary on corporate advertising campaigns.\nTrump’s transactional policy approach saw him approve the sale of United States Steel Corp. to Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp. in a $14.1 billion deal that included caveats such as agreeing to US national security rules and a “golden share” for the US government. Japan, South Korea and the European Union all pledged to invest billions in the US, helping secure tariff rates of 15%, while companies such as Apple Inc. have also skirted levies by promising to invest hundreds of billions of dollars.\nTrump signaled on Monday that he’d be open to allowing Nvidia to sell a scaled-back version of its most advanced AI chip to China. Trump said he would consider a deal that would allow Nvidia to ship its Blackwell chips to China if the company could design it to be less advanced.\n“It’s possible I’d make a deal” on a “somewhat enhanced — in a negative way — Blackwell” processor, he said in a briefing with reporters. “In other words, take 30% to 50% off of it.”\nThe Nvidia and AMD revenue-sharing deals may now prompt the White House to target other industries and goods, according to Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore.\n“The sky is the limit,” she said. “You could come up with all sorts of company-specific, country-specific combinations that would say, ‘No one else can trade, but if you pay us directly, then you get the ability to trade.’”\nAlthough Nvidia and AMD agreed to the terms, there are questions about the legality of the agreement, Elms said. The arrangement looks like an export tax, which is forbidden by the US Constitution.\nThe Trump administration is already in the midst of a lawsuit related to his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on the world. On Friday, Trump warned of a “GREAT DEPRESSION” if US courts ruled that his tariffs were illegal.\nChips are at the heart of the US-China battle to dominate industries of the future such as AI and automation. The Biden administration restricted the sale of advanced chips to China, prompting Nvidia to develop the H20 to comply with those restrictions. Trump administration officials tightened export controls in April by barring Nvidia from selling the chips without a permit.\nLast month, however, the White House decided to allow Nvidia and AMD to resume sales of chips designed specifically for the Chinese market, which are several rungs below the most advanced artificial intelligence accelerators. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the administration wanted Chinese developers “addicted” to American technology.\nChina has grown increasingly hostile to the idea of Chinese firms deploying the H20, particularly after the US called for the chips to be installed with tracking technology to better enforce export controls. Yuyuantantian, a social media account affiliated with state-run China Central Television that regularly signals Beijing’s thinking about trade, on Sunday slammed the chip’s supposed security vulnerabilities and inefficiency.\nStill, Chinese companies could use the H20s because domestic firms can’t produce enough AI chips to meet demand. That potentially provides an opportunity for Nvidia and AMD to sell more — and now for the US government to earn additional revenue as well.\nTrump extended a pause of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for another 90 days into early November, stabilizing trade ties between the world’s two largest economies.\n“There’s clearly a shift by the administration to take a lighter national security stance as these negotiations are ongoing,” said Drew DeLong, lead in geopolitical dynamics practice at Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm.\nChina Draws Red Lines on US Chip Tracking With Nvidia Meeting\nWhile the US has intervened before, including by taking stakes in private companies after the 2008 financial crisis, a similar deal like the one struck with Nvidia and AMD is hard to remember and — without proper oversight — could lead to a “crony capitalism state,” according to Scott Kennedy, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\n“It represents a huge shift in the way the American economy is supposed to operate,” Kennedy said. “It won’t make anyone happy except maybe the Chinese, who will get their chips and watch the US political system go through gyration and domestic tensions.”\n(Updates to include reference to Blackwell chip sales in sixth and seventh paragraphs, extention of trade truce in 16th.)", "content_hash": "b8df5f3e079e17779a07cc68a61494a3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It’s pretty hard to miss it coming.\nCheck Out: 8 Smart Ways Frugal People Are Living Like There’s Already a Recession\nRead Next: 3 Reasons Retired Boomers Shouldn't Give Their Kids a Living Inheritance (And 2 Reasons They Should)\nHowever, Ashley Morgan, a debt and bankruptcy attorney and owner of Ashley F. Morgan Law, PC, said that some indicators that you could be on your way to declaring bankruptcy are subtler than you might think. GOBankingRates connected with Morgan to talk about the hidden signs that you’re at risk of bankruptcy.\nYou’re Only Paying Minimums\nYou’re doing what you can in a tight time. You’d rather pay the minimum amount on your bills and avoid collections. It happens, and if you’re only paying minimums in the short term, Morgan said that you’re probably doing what you need to get by during a brief, unfortunate moment. But if you’re still only paying minimums for six months or longer, you might be in a position to consider bankruptcy.\n“It is a big red flag if you are paying minimums on your cards and then turning around and using that available credit to make ends meet,” she said. “If your budget is so tight you are not paying down your debt even a bit each month, you need something to change.”\nCheck Out: 8 Frugal Habits Americans Are Ridiculed for — and Why You Shouldn’t Care\nYou’ve Been Hit With a Major Life Event\nNone of us are immune from truly catastrophic life events, like going through a job loss or divorce. To add insult to injury, these moments that already make you want to hide in bed all day can leave you in a financially vulnerable position — including future bankruptcy.\n“With job loss, especially unexpected job loss, [comes] a reduced income, [which] can shock someone’s budget if you do not have a stable emergency fund or find another job quickly,” Morgan said.\nThe best offense against a hard time is truly a good defense, and your first line of defense should be a well-stocked emergency fund kept in a high-yield savings account. Having an emergency fund in place can protect you from being financially blindsided while you’re already dealing with a painful situation, like divorce.\n“Similarly, a divorce is often financially detrimental. Divorce can be expensive since it often involves dividing assets and legal fees,” she said. “Additionally, divorcing typically will result in the same income now being divided by two households. As a result, many people consider bankruptcy after a divorce.”", "content_hash": "e6cce02d470e2768f6a9fb71b12ab50d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Rather than needing to save up a big lump sum and then investing, you can steadily add to your position over time. This also avoids the temptation of trying to time the market and worrying about whether it's a good time to invest. By investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), you can also minimize your risk over the long term, since you can have a position in not only multiple stocks but dozens and even hundreds of them, all through just a single investment.\nVanguard has many solid ETFs that can be suitable for growth investors, as they charge low fees and offer some great diversification. One particularly attractive Vanguard fund that I'm going to focus on is the Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSEMKT: VUG). As its name suggests, it focuses on growth. And below, I'll show you how investing $270 each month into this ETF can potentially put you on track to creating a million-dollar portfolio.\nWhy the Vanguard Growth Index Fund is an ideal option for growth investors\nThere are a lot of ETFs to choose from in the markets, which can make it overwhelming and challenging to try to find the right one for you. But two things you'll want to consider are costs and quality.\nIdentifying low-cost funds is easy, as that can be measured through the ETF's expense ratio; anything less than 0.1% is pretty low. The Vanguard Growth Index Fund has an expense ratio of 0.04%, making it an incredibly cheap option. By keeping your fees minimal, you can ensure unnecessary costs aren't chipping away at your gains over the years.\nThe more challenging criterion is the quality of the ETF. After all, what good is a low-cost fund if it invests in stocks that you don't want? This is where targeting Vanguard ETFs is important. Those ETFs are among the best and most well-diversified investments to choose from. The Vanguard Growth Index ETF tracks the best growth stocks in the country. There are 165 stocks in the fund (as of June 30), and its top holdings are highly recognizable names that you'll likely be very familiar with -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and many other top stocks. These companies are all focused on growing their businesses. With well over 100 holdings, the Vanguard fund does a great job of diversifying, but not so much that your exposure to individual stocks is minimal.", "content_hash": "0a1d3a7d8b5d664ec7c0dd2ef8186d1c", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Here’s how it works.\nHow Senior Deduction Works\nThe new senior deduction, which is retroactive to January 1, 2025, runs through 2028 and allows individual seniors aged 65 and older to claim an additional $6,000 deduction. For taxpayers filing jointly, that deduction goes up to $12,000.\nThere are income caps, however.

Trump instituted a baseline 10% on those trade partners, followed by a series of additional tariffs for some countries, while decreasing tariffs for others, or even pausing tariffs for certain countries to allow for further negotiation.\nIn America, the looming threat of tariffs has created a fair amount of buyer concern — tariffs mean higher consumer prices here at home, and both shoppers and businesses alike have spent the summer waiting for the near-inevitable price-hikes.\nSo it comes as no surprise that Trump’s somewhat shocking Liberation Day announcement immediately caused global markets to crash in response to such a bold move. The markets eventually absorbed the news and righted themselves. That said, has the continued yo-yoing of tariff threats slowed the stock market?\nThe Impact of Tariffs on the Stock Market\nThe answer is yes.\nFirst, there was the initial market crashes in response to the news. Trump’s announced tariffs were far more extreme than what experts and analysts predicted, and the April announcement was seen was a “worse than the worst case scenario” by economists — the Dow Jones fell 3.98%, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.97% and the broad market index collapsed by 4.84%, the worst showing for each since the summer of 2020 when COVID ravaged the country and its economy.\nThat isn’t the only time Trump’s tariffs have torpedoed the stock market, though.

This directly influences the amount you can receive, as the SSA uses the best 35 earning years of your work history.\nWhen you claim impacts the amount, too. Full retirement age (FRA) is currently 67 years of age, although retirees can claim benefits beginning at 62.

That's what makes it one of the best ways to increase your wealth. However, putting your money in the right stocks is crucial. Some companies may turn out to be terrible investments, as they significantly lag behind the market and may even cease to exist. Investors can avoid that fate by investing in ETFs that track major indexes or by selecting stocks that have the potential to outperform broader equities over extended periods.\nThese are typically well-established, highly profitable companies with solid businesses, excellent prospects, and strong competitive edges. Here are two brilliant examples: Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Intuitive Surgical(NASDAQ: ISRG). Here's why putting $1,000 into either of those stocks would be a great move.\n1. Alphabet\nAlphabet has been one of the more undervalued among the trillion-dollar tech leaders of late. In fairness, that's because it faces some potential headwinds related to antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. Regulators want the company to relinquish its Chrome browser, a key component of its advertising business. While that's worth keeping an eye on, Alphabet continues to impress with its financial results. The company's second-quarter earnings were no different.\nThe tech giant grew its revenue by 14% year over year to $96.4 billion, while its net earnings per share (EPS) of $2.31 were up 22.2% compared to the year-ago period. Some of Alphabet's current growth drivers, including cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), should remain so for many years to come. The company pointed out that its cloud division, Google Cloud, now has a revenue run rate of more than $50 billion.\nThough Alphabet's advertising business remains its main cash cow, cloud and AI could take over in the next decade. Investors should be excited about that since it will mean that the company will become far less reliant on its advertising business, which would take the biggest hit if Alphabet loses Chrome. So, the more diversified the business becomes, the less of a risk this potential worst-case scenario of losing Chrome is.\nFurthermore, Alphabet is exploring other potential opportunities, including streaming through YouTube, a leader in that niche, and self-driving cars through its subsidiary, Waymo. Lastly, Alphabet has a strong competitive edge from multiple sources, including Google's network effect and strong brand name, as well as the switching costs associated with its cloud solutions. Alphabet is firing on all cylinders, and the company's long-term prospects remain bright.\nEven if regulators in the U.S. succeed in forcing the company to relinquish its Chrome browser, Alphabet should recover due to having multiple lucrative opportunities and significant amounts of free cash flow -- to the tune of $5.3 billion as of the end of the second quarter. That's significantly lower than the $13.5 billion it had as of the end of Q2 2024, but that's partly because Alphabet is reinvesting substantial amounts, including a projected $85 billion this year, into capital expenditures to support various growth opportunities.\nThis investment could pay for itself several times over in the long run as the company makes further progress in cloud, AI, and other areas. Alphabet remains well-positioned to outperform the market over the next decade. Investors can get five of the company's shares for $1,000.\n2. Intuitive Surgical\nIntuitive Surgical, the leader in the robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) market, has struggled this year. Trump's aggressive tariffs could take a bite out of the company's earnings, which is why many investors are choosing to stay away from the stock.\nHowever, the medical device specialist's outlook is still strong, at least for investors willing to be patient. For one, Intuitive Surgical continues to record excellent financial results. The company's second-quarter revenue was $2.44 billion, 21% higher than the year-ago period, thanks to a 17% year-over-year increase in the number of procedures performed with its crown jewel, the Da Vinci System.\nIntuitive Surgical's adjusted EPS came in at $2.19, 23% higher than Q2 2024. The company has had little competition in the RAS field, and although that's about to change, several factors should allow it to perform well over the next decade. First, it will be challenging for newcomers to catch up, as Intuitive Surgical has been earning indications for the Da Vinci System for years. It is approved for use in general surgeries, bariatric procedures, urologic procedures, gynecologic procedures, and more.\nSecond, since the Da Vinci System is expensive and requires a learning curve, after putting considerable time and money into acquiring one and training medical staff on it, healthcare facilities will need a lot of convincing to switch to a competitor. In other words, Intuitive Surgical benefits from high switching costs. Third, the company is an innovator. It earned clearance for the fifth generation of its crown jewel last year and will undoubtedly continue to improve the device.\nLastly, there is significant whitespace in the RAS market. Intuitive Surgical will benefit from the world's aging population, as older individuals are more likely to require many of the procedures performed with its Da Vinci system. Even with the current volume of surgeries, RAS procedures have captured only 5% of those eligible for robotic surgery. That points to a massive opportunity, and as a leader in the market, Intuitive Surgical should benefit.\nThe stock may be down this year, but it could deliver superior returns over the long run.

That's a huge change and one that is directionally similar to the changes taking shape throughout the world. Some energy companies are sticking to their oil and natural gas roots.\nOthers, like TotalEnergies(NYSE: TTE) and Enbridge(NYSE: ENB), see the writing on the wall and are preparing now. If you have $2,000 to invest today, getting ahead of the curve could be a good call for your portfolio.\nWhat do TotalEnergies and Enbridge do?\nTotalEnergies is what is known as an integrated energy company. It has operations in the upstream (oil and natural gas production), the midstream (pipelines), and the downstream (chemicals and refining). Each of these segments of the broader energy sector operates a little differently through the energy cycle. And, thus, having an integrated business model helps to soften the peaks and valleys inherent to this commodity-driven business.\nEnbridge is focused on the midstream space. It essentially collects tolls from customers that use its energy transportation assets, including things like pipelines and storage. This model provides reliable cash flows as the volume passing through its midstream system is more important than the price of oil and natural gas. Focusing on the midstream is a good call for investors who want energy exposure but who would rather avoid commodity risk.\nWhat are TotalEnergies and Enbridge doing differently?\nBasically, the core of both of these businesses is still oil and natural gas. That's not a bad thing. Although there is an energy transition taking place, it is likely to be a decades-long affair. They are, thus, using profits from dirtier energy sources to fund their investment into cleaner energy sources, like renewable power.\nFor example, both TotalEnergies and Enbridge have been investing in renewable power like solar and wind. TotalEnergies has also been buying electric utility businesses. Enbridge, meanwhile, has also been focused on increasing its exposure to reliable natural gas businesses, like regulated natural gas utility operations, which are expected to be important transitional assets as the world moves in a green direction.\nTo be fair, neither TotalEnergies nor Enbridge is jumping in with both feet here. They are dipping their toes in, slowly building businesses as the world begins its transition away from carbon fuels. The idea is to change with the world, while many of their peers are simply sticking it out as long as they can with carbon fuels. If you like the idea of hedging your bets, however, TotalEnergies and Enbridge will be good choices for you. With $2,000, you can buy around 33 shares of TotalEnergies and 42 of Enbridge.\nYou'll be rewarded with big yields, too\nThe energy transition angle is interesting on its own. But the big story is that TotalEnergies has a lofty 6.5% dividend yield while Enbridge's yield sits at 5.9%. The average energy stock's yield is around 3.4%. And both have long histories of supporting dividends through the market cycle. Enbridge's record is better, with 30 annual increases. TotalEnergies' resilience shone through during the coronavirus pandemic when it maintained its dividend even as its European peers cut their dividends.\nThere is one caveat here. Both Enbridge and TotalEnergies are foreign companies, so investors have to pay foreign taxes (a portion of which U.S. investors can claim back come tax time). And the actual dividends collected will vary along with exchange rates. But if you want to have energy exposure, collect large dividends, and prepare today for a future that's \"cleaner\", these two energy giants should be on your radar right now.\nDo the experts think Enbridge is a buy right now?\nThe Motley Fool’s expert analyst team, drawing on years of investing experience and deep analysis of thousands of stocks, leverages our proprietary Moneyball AI investing database to uncover top opportunities.

That raises the possibility of a stock split. While stock splits have become less common in 2025, they can come in bunches. They also stir up interest in a stock, and that could be helpful for the struggling ASML, which is down 18% over the past year.\nLet's explore why companies split their stock, review ASML's track record with the practice, and consider whether the stock is worth buying at its current price, with or without a future share split.\nWhat's a stock split?\nA stock split is a corporate action that increases the number of a company's outstanding shares while reducing the share price proportionally, leaving the overall market capitalization and investor ownership unchanged. For instance, in a 10-for-1 split, one $700 share becomes 10 shares worth $70 each.\nAlthough stock splits leave a company's fundamentals untouched, they often improve liquidity and make shares more approachable for retail investors. Despite the growing availability of fractional shares, some brokerages still lack this feature, and steep share prices can remain a psychological barrier for potential buyers. In addition, stock splits offer companies more flexibility when structuring stock-based compensation.\nFinally, a high stock price can limit eligibility for price-weighted indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, where share prices directly influence weighting. Companies like ASML, with elevated stock prices, are less likely to be included because they could disproportionately impact the index.\nASML has a history of stock splits\nASML has executed four stock splits in its history -- three traditional splits and one reverse split. After going public in 1995, ASML carried out 2-for-1 splits in 1997 and 1998, followed by a 3-for-1 split in 2000. In 2007, ASML reversed course with an 8-for-9 reverse split to simplify its capital structure and return cash to shareholders. A similar plan in 2012 resulted in a 77-for-100 reverse split.\nFactoring in its past stock splits, an investor who purchased one share of ASML in 1997 would now hold roughly 8.21 shares. However, it's been nearly 20 years since the company last did a traditional stock split, and ASML's share price has climbed significantly. With shares now trading at a high price point, ASML could be a strong candidate for another split, although management hasn't indicated any plans to move in that direction.\nData source: Companies Market Cap.\nASML's fundamentals are strong\nASML sits at the center of one of the world's most critical technology supply chains. It is the only company that produces extreme ultraviolet lithography machines -- tools that enable chipmakers to produce the smallest, most powerful, and most efficient semiconductors available.\nIn its most recent quarter, ASML reported 7.7 billion euros ($9 billion) in revenue, a 23% increase compared to the same period last year. Net income rose 45% to 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion), highlighting the company's strong profitability despite uncertain trade policies. Perhaps even more impressive is ASML's order backlog, which stood at more than 33 billion euros ($38.5 billion), signaling continued demand from its customers.\nManagement reiterated full-year revenue guidance of approximately 32.5 billion euros, or 15% growth compared to 2024. Additionally, it projects gross margin, a key profitability metric, to come in at 52% for 2025, an improvement from 2024's gross margin of 51.4%.\nASML prioritizes returning capital to shareholders\nBeyond its expanding business, ASML continues to reward shareholders through consistent dividends and stock buybacks. With $4.2 billion in net cash, the company is well positioned to return capital while continuing to invest in future growth.\nASML currently pays a quarterly dividend of 1.60 euros, which equates to a 1% annual yield. Since ASML is a Dutch company, U.S. investors hold shares through American depositary receipts, meaning dividend payments fluctuate based on currency exchange rates.\nIn addition to the dividend, ASML has steadily reduced its share count, lowering shares outstanding by 6.3% over the past five years. In its most recent quarter, the company spent 1.4 billion euros, or approximately $1.6 billion, on share repurchases, further enhancing long-term shareholder value.\nIs ASML a buy, sell, or hold?\nStock splits often generate buzz, but they should not be the reason to buy a stock. What matters more are ASML's financial results and whether the stock is attractively valued. Currently, ASML trades at 25.4 times trailing earnings, which is well below its three-year median of 36.3 and marks its lowest level in that period.\nGeopolitical uncertainty and tariff concerns may be pressuring the valuation. Still, ASML's strong market position and the continued surge in AI spending from major tech companies make the stock a compelling buy with or without a stock split.\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

President Trump has intensified criticism of Powell's cautious approach to monetary policy, while reports emerge that the administration has widened its search for Powell's potential successor, with former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, and Fed Governor Christopher Waller among the names under consideration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is reportedly leading the search process and conducting initial interviews, adding uncertainty to an already complex policy environment. The week delivers a comprehensive inflation assessment through Tuesday's Consumer Price Index and Thursday's Producer Price Index, while Friday's retail sales data will provide insights into consumer spending patterns that account for approximately two-thirds of GDP.\nHere are 5 things to watch this week in the Market.\nFed Leadership Uncertainty and Policy Implications\nThe Trump administration's expanded search for Powell's replacement creates uncertainty about monetary policy direction, potentially influencing market reactions to this week's economic data and corporate earnings. Reports that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is conducting initial interviews with candidates including James Bullard, Kevin Hassett, and Christopher Waller suggest the administration is serious about leadership change amid ongoing disagreements over rate policy. This political pressure comes as markets already grapple with mixed economic signals and questions about the appropriate pace of monetary policy adjustments. The uncertainty could impact bond markets, the dollar, and rate-sensitive sectors as investors attempt to gauge potential policy shifts under new leadership. Fed independence concerns may also influence how markets interpret upcoming inflation data, with any signs of political interference potentially affecting long-term credibility and market stability.\nInflation Data Double-Header\nTuesday's Consumer Price Index at 8:30am takes center stage as the week's most important economic release, providing insights into July inflation trends amid ongoing concerns about price pressures and Fed policy direction. Both headline and core CPI readings will be scrutinized for evidence of continued disinflation progress or potential re-acceleration in price growth. Thursday's Producer Price Index at 8:30am will offer a forward-looking perspective on wholesale price pressures and potential future consumer inflation trends. The timing of these reports amid Fed leadership uncertainty creates potential for amplified market reactions, particularly if inflation data contradicts current policy expectations or provides ammunition for either side of the rate cut debate. Energy prices, housing costs, and services inflation will be key components to watch, especially given recent volatility in commodity markets and ongoing labor market changes.\nConsumer Spending Reality Check\nFriday's July retail sales data at 8:30am represents a crucial test of consumer resilience, providing insights into spending patterns that drive the largest component of economic growth. With consumer spending accounting for roughly two-thirds of GDP, this report takes on heightened significance amid questions about economic momentum and the sustainability of recent growth trends. The data will be particularly important for assessing whether consumers are maintaining spending despite labor market weakening and ongoing inflation concerns. Core retail sales, which exclude volatile automotive purchases, will provide additional insight into underlying consumer demand trends. Thursday's initial jobless claims will complement the spending picture by offering the latest snapshot of labor market conditions, creating potential for significant market moves if employment and consumption data collectively suggest strengthening or weakening economic fundamentals.\nTechnology and Global Earnings Focus\nWednesday's Cisco (CSCO) earnings will provide crucial insights into enterprise technology spending and networking equipment demand amid ongoing questions about corporate IT investment priorities. The results will be closely watched for commentary on AI infrastructure spending, cloud migration trends, and the health of business technology budgets. Thursday brings a diverse international lineup with JD.com (JD) offering perspective on Chinese e-commerce trends, Applied Materials (AMAT) providing insights into semiconductor equipment demand, and Nu Holdings (NU) delivering Latin American fintech trends. Tuesday's Sea Limited (SE) earnings will offer perspective on Southeast Asian digital trends and gaming markets. These results will provide a global view of technology adoption and consumer behavior across key international markets.\nEnergy and Commodity Market Dynamics\nWednesday's crude oil inventories report at 10:30am will provide the latest snapshot of energy market conditions amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainties and seasonal demand patterns. The report comes as markets assess the impact of recent OPEC+ decisions and global economic growth concerns on oil demand and pricing. Energy sector earnings this week, including Thursday's Petrobras (PBR) results, will offer perspective on global oil and gas market conditions and production strategies. The intersection of energy prices with inflation data creates additional complexity, as commodity price movements could influence both CPI readings and Fed policy considerations. Energy companies' capital expenditure plans and production guidance will be closely watched for insights into supply dynamics and future price trends, particularly important given energy's role in both inflation calculations and broader economic sentiment.\nBest of luck this week and don't forget to check out my daily options article.\nOn the date of publication, Gavin McMaster had a position in: SPY.

These actions should be taken as a warning sign with the stock market reaching elevated valuation levels in recent months.\nAs the market and Berkshire Hathaway stock soar, Buffett is pulling back and building a huge cash position. Should you follow his lead? Here's what Buffett's moves could mean for the stock market as well as Berkshire Hathaway itself.\nHuge cash pile and halted share buybacks\nTwo actions from Berkshire Hathaway indicate a level of caution for Buffett at the moment: a rising cash pile and the halting of share buybacks. Last quarter, Berkshire Hathaway's level of cash and equivalents reached $344 billion, which is larger than the market capitalizations of all but 27 publicly traded companies in the world.\nBuffett keeps selling stocks in his portfolio such as Apple, reducing his cumulative position to $267 billion as of the end of the second quarter. This means Berkshire Hathaway has more of its capital sitting on the sidelines than invested in the stock market.\nIn recent years, Buffett has used his excess cash to repurchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock. No longer. In the second quarter of 2025, Buffett completely halted share repurchases, which is a huge slowdown compared to a quarterly rate in the billions of dollars back in 2020 to 2022. Berkshire uses the cash to reduce its shares outstanding, but only when Buffett believes his own stock is trading at a discount.\nIn the second quarter, Berkshire Hathaway's price-to-book value (P/B), a good metric for evaluating an insurance and investment company, grew to a 10-year high of close to 1.8. Slowing share buybacks with the P/B rising like this indicates that Buffett does not believe Berkshire Hathaway stock is a bargain for investors at the moment.\nSoaring valuations should make investors nervous\nEven though Buffett has a record high cash pile and brought in $25 billion in operating earnings through the first six months of 2025, he has still sat on the sideline and declined to purchase more stocks -- an indicator of what Buffett thinks of the stock market in general.\nHistorically, Buffett has increased his cash position and exited stocks when valuations got overheated, such as 1968 and 1999. In the near term this can look foolish, but over the long run buying stocks at an elevated price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) will lead to worse forward results, all else equal. Today, the S&P 500 index trades at a P/E ratio of 30, which is well above its long-term average. Fast-growing stock Nvidia trades at a P/E of 59, while even slower-growing Walmart trades at a P/E of 42.\nUnsurprisingly, Buffett is finding it tough to identify bargain stocks to buy in this market environment. Instead, he would rather sit on a cash equivalent and earn guaranteed interest income, waiting for his opportunity to strike. This patience is why Buffett has crushed the market over the decades as one of the best investors of all time.\nWhat should you do?\nInvestors should heed Buffett's actions. He is getting increasingly cautious with Berkshire Hathaway's balance sheet as the market soars.\nWhat you do about it entirely depends on your personal financial situation, however. If you are a younger person under the age of 40, you do not necessarily need to worry about high P/E ratios from stocks in your investing portfolio, as long as the money is being saved for retirement or many years into the future.\nOn the other hand, older investors should pay much closer attention to Buffett's actions. You do not want your entire portfolio in stocks if you are drawing down money for retirement or plan to use it for any upcoming expenses with P/E ratios at such elevated levels. There is a major risk of a correction and regression to the long-term mean.\nInstead, put money into cash equivalents like Treasury bonds, or cheaper dividend-paying stocks. Buffett's example with Apple is a good lesson in this regard. He greatly trimmed his position with the low-growth technology giant's P/E ratio between 30 and 40, which does not inspire confidence for strong forward returns.\nStay cautious, and do not get over your skis with the stock market chugging to all-time highs. Take Buffett's historical lessons to heart and keep a balanced investment portfolio for your personal financial situation.\nShould you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

That's not a surprise, given that the cruise line business was decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the company is on much better footing these days as it serves robust demand from consumers.\nIn the past 12 months, shares have soared 104% (as of Aug. 6), showcasing heightened bullishness. Despite this monster performance, here are three reasons why investors should still consider buying this travel stock like there's no tomorrow.\nDurable demand\nCarnival's business has benefited from tremendous momentum. During the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended May 31), the company reported record revenue of $6.3 billion. This figure was up 9.5% year over year and 164% higher than the same period of fiscal 2022. There's clearly strong demand from travelers. Carnival had a whopping $8.5 billion in customer deposits in Q2, a record.\nNet yields, a measure of a cruise line's pricing power, came in at a record $200.07, after increasing by 7.2% during the second quarter. This was \"driven by close-in strength in ticket prices and continued strong onboard spending,\" CFO David Bernstein said on the Q2 2025 earnings call.\nThe demand for Carnival has been impressive in the years following the pandemic's disruption. Investors might think that the good times will come to an end soon. While the rapid growth the business has registered won't continue indefinitely, there's still reason to remain optimistic over the long term.\nThe cruise industry faces some favorable tailwinds. For instance, younger travelers are more interested in these vacations. There are also more first-time passengers coming aboard.\nAs it pushes to capture the opportunity ahead, Carnival is investing in building new cruise ships. It just opened a new private destination, called the Celebration Key, in July. What's more, Carnival is upgrading its rewards program, which will launch in 2026. This can boost customer loyalty and drive repeat cruise trips.\nFinancial improvements\nDuring the pandemic, Carnival was forced to pause its operations. To survive the revenue hit, management had to take on more debt to fund the business. It's understandable if, at the time, investors were worried that Carnival would never get out of its predicament.", "content_hash": "d2c3379ed5b666b0ef5e8e39a3745f4d", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, Wall Street’s most vocal crypto skeptic for nearly a decade, delivered a stunning reversal that’s sending shockwaves through both traditional finance and digital asset markets.\n“I’m a believer in stablecoin and a believer in blockchain,” Dimon said in a recent CNBC interview, though he maintained he’s “not personally a believer in Bitcoin itself.” For retail investors watching from the sidelines, this isn’t just corporate posturing—it’s a seismic shift that could reshape how mainstream America accesses cryptocurrency.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nThe same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n-\n‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\nThe Partnership That Changes the Game\nDimon’s evolution isn’t happening in a vacuum. JPMorgan Chase just announced a groundbreaking partnership with Coinbase that allows the bank's customers to link their bank accounts directly to Coinbase wallets, making it dramatically easier to move money between traditional banking and crypto platforms.\nThis matters because JPMorgan Chase isn’t just any bank—it’s America’s largest by assets, serving over 80 million customers. When it makes crypto more accessible, the bank is essentially building a bridge between Main Street and digital assets for millions of Americans who’ve been sitting on the fence.\nWhat’s Really Driving This Shift\nThe timing isn’t coincidental. Bitcoin recently crossed $118,000, continuing its relentless march higher even as other major cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana pulled back. But more importantly, the regulatory landscape is finally crystallizing in ways that traditional financial institutions can work with.\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nThe White House just released its comprehensive crypto policy framework, which positions digital assets as a cornerstone of U.S. economic competitiveness.

It was the second anniversary of his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on trumped-up charges. Thanks to General Asim Munir, the Army’s Chief of Staff, Khan has been held in solitary confinement in a six-by-eight “death cell” for two years. Anyone less that “Captain Pakistan,” as Khan is known, would have met the Grim Reaper long ago.\nThe last time I spoke to Khan was on April 2, 2023. We spoke for an hour-and-a-half via Zoom. I was at my residence in Baltimore, and Khan was in Lahore. We had an intense discussion that went on until past midnight in Lahore. What did we talk about?\nThe cricketer and the currency board\nThe focus of our conversation was economic policy. Not for the first time, we grappled with what needed to be done to extract Pakistan from its economic doom loop. Our point of departure was the rupee, which had shed 48% of its value against the U.S. dollar since June 2021. To pull Pakistan out of its doom loop and establish stability, I recommended the medicine that I had successfully prescribed in Estonia (1992), Lithuania (1994), Bulgaria (1997), and Bosnia-Herzegovina (1997). In all those cases, a currency board did the trick, as they always do. Indeed, since the first currency board was established in Mauritius (1849), there have been over 70 currency boards, and none have failed. Even the currency board that John Maynard Keynes installed in Archangel during Russia’s civil war (1918) worked without a glitch.\nJust what is a currency board? A currency board issues notes and coins convertible on demand into a foreign anchor currency, such as the U.S. dollar, at a fixed exchange rate. It is required to hold anchor-currency reserves equal to 100% of its monetary liabilities.\nA currency board has no discretionary monetary powers and cannot issue credit. It has an exchange-rate policy but no monetary policy. Its sole function is to exchange the domestic currency it issues for an anchor currency at a fied rate. A currency board’s currency is a clone of its anchor currency.\nA currency board requires no preconditions and can be installed rapidly. Government finances, state-owned enterprises, and trade need not be reformed before a currency board can issue money.\nThe Bulgarian and Lithuanian examples\nKhan and I spent a great deal of time on our April 2023 Zoom call discussing the currency board that I installed in Bulgaria, when I was President Petar Stoyanov’s Chief Economic Adviser. In 1997, Bulgaria faced a raging hyperinflation of 24% per month and a banking crisis. Once the currency board was installed in July, hyperinflation stopped immediately. By 1998, the banking system was solvebnt, money-market interest rates had plunged from triple digits to an average of 2.4%, a massive fiscal deficit turned into a surplus, a deep depression became economic growth, and Bulgaria’s foreign-exchange reserves more than tripled. Today, thanks to its currency board, Bulgaria has the second lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the EU, behind only Estonia.", "content_hash": "944ba540d3a2e4e6becfe52ca33295e3", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

It surged because of a limited float in the offering, and a perception that the stock would benefit from the Trump administration, as its politics and media coverage are aligned with President Donald Trump.\nSince then, the stock has gradually faded, and it now trades just above $12 a share, hovering near its all-time low.\nNow that the initial euphoria from its debut has passed, is Newsmax a buy? Let's take a closer look at the key details.\nWhat NewsMax offers investors\nThe landscape for digital media companies has been challenging for years. People have plenty of places to get their news and entertainment, and it's been difficult to find growth.\nDespite the weakness in the industry, Newsmax seems to be outgrowing its peers based on its latest results.\nIn the first quarter, the company reported revenue growth of 11.6% to $45.3 million. This shows that Newsmax is still a small company, even though it's the fourth-highest-rated cable news channel, with more than 33 million quarterly viewers.\nGrowth was balanced across advertising, affiliate revenues, and subscriptions, though advertising made up nearly two-thirds of total revenue.\nNewsmax reached a record of 33.6 million viewers in the quarter, up 50% from the quarter a year ago, though that may be a response to Trump's inauguration and the beginning of his term more than anything that Newsmax is doing.\nThe company also saw strong growth in social media, topping 20 million combined social media followers.\nOn the bottom line, Newsmax reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $1.2 million, down from a profit of $3.2 million in the quarter a year ago, due to costs associated with the IPO and covering Trump's inauguration. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company reported a loss of $17.2 million in the quarter, or $0.49 per share.\nNewsmax sees a number of opportunities for growth, including in both linear and digital channels like streaming. It also has a small product business, selling promotional products through its advertisements.\nNewsmax's financials\nAfter pulling back, Newsmax stock is trading at a more reasonable valuation, but the company is still unprofitable and has a price-to-sales ratio of 9.", "content_hash": "6c40069dc279a5d07e32afe6a12cc91b", "extract_method": "trafilatura"}

Financing new equipment or opening another location could be more rewarding than ever.”\nMaximize SALT Deductions\nIf you’re a business owner, there are two ways you can handle your state and local taxes (SALT). One way is to list them on your personal tax return or you can let your business pay them for you using the Pass-Through Entity Tax (PTET).\n“Now is the time to think strategically about how you handle state and local tax (SALT) deductions,” Richards said. “With new itemized deduction thresholds in play, comparing that route to the Pass-Through Entity Tax (PTET) election might open the door to greater federal savings — if you structure things wisely.”\nInvest In Real Estate for New Passive Loss Benefits\nTrump’s bill provides additional tax benefits to real estate investors, making acquiring real estate more attractive.\n“Owning your office building or investing in short-term rentals could unlock major tax benefits, especially if you can treat losses as active and offset other income,” Richards said.\nUse QSBS Rules To Plan a Tax-Free Exit\nThe Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption is a special tax rule that helps entrepreneurs save on taxes when they sell their shares later. The QSBS exemption now goes up to $15 million under certain conditions\n“Plan ahead if you’re starting a new venture,” Richards said. “This isn’t something you want to miss.”\nFor the more advanced, there’s also a way to “stack” QSBS benefits across shareholders.

While many top stocks have risen above the fray during periods of market recovery, others haven't followed that upward trend. As always, when you're putting cash to work in stocks, it's important to understand your own investing goals, risk tolerance level, and personal investment horizon and incorporate that approach into each business you buy.\nIf you're looking at a stock to buy on the dip, it's also important to understand the factors that have driven those movements, and whether those downtrodden shares represent a potentially sound investment opportunity or a glaring red flag about the underlying business.\nHere are two beaten-down stocks that long-term investors might want to consider buying on the dip and holding for several years at least.\n1. Pfizer\nPfizer (NYSE: PFE) has been underperforming as a stock in the last few years due to a combination of factors, including declining COVID-19 product sales and muted expectations by some investors as key patent expiration dates approach. While the stock is trading at levels last seen a decade ago, and is down about 20% over the last year, things aren't nearly as bleak as they might appear if all you did was look at share prices.\nIt's true that Pfizer faces several patent expirations in the coming years for key drugs like Eliquis, Ibrance, and Xtandi. Patent expirations mean generic versions can enter the market, eroding sales of the original branded drugs. The good news is that Pfizer's many acquisitions in the last few years, plus its own internal pipeline, have produced an impressive number of newly launched drugs or candidates that can more than offset its patent and COVID-19-related losses as we get into the latter part of the decade and beyond.\nPfizer's acquisition of Seagen was one move that significantly strengthened its oncology portfolio, particularly in antibody-drug conjugates for targets like bladder, breast, and lung cancers. Its medicines like Vyndaqel (for a rare heart condition) and Padcev (for bladder cancer) are exhibiting robust sales increases, while Pfizer is actively pursuing growth in drug target areas, including immunology and rare diseases.\nAnother key move Pfizer made in the last few years to plan for this shift in sales volume as the pandemic waned and key patent cliffs approached was its purchase of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals. This acquisition significantly strengthened its overall position in the neurology market. Notably, Pfizer acquired Nurtec as part of the purchase of Biohaven. Nurtec was already a top-prescribed medication in its class, approved for both acute treatment and preventive treatment of episodic migraines, and it continues to hold a significant market share.\nIn 2025, Pfizer anticipates at least four regulatory decisions and up to nine Phase 3 readouts. In terms of Pfizer's financial growth story, while first-quarter revenue declined by 8% compared to the prior-year quarter to $13.72 billion, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 12% to $0.92 and exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Growth from products like the Vyndaqel family, Padcev, Nurtec, and Lorbrena were key drivers here.\nThis follows full-year 2024, where revenue totaled $63.6 billion, up 7% from the prior year. Pfizer is undoubtedly in a period of transition, but as one of the world's oldest pharmaceutical companies with an incredibly impressive portfolio and pipeline, it could be a time for smart investors to buy shares on the dip. Pfizer has also maintained a consistent dividend payment record since the 1980s and has increased its dividend each year since 2010. That dividend, which currently yields about 7%, could just be icing on the cake.\n2. Target\nTarget (NYSE: TGT) shares are down about 25% over the past year. Shifting consumer sentiment and some negative public backlash have pressured the business, causing investors to respond in kind. Unlike some competitors with a stronger focus on essentials like groceries, a substantial part of Target's merchandise falls into the discretionary category (electronics, apparel). As consumer confidence wanes and inflation rises, shoppers are prioritizing essential items, affecting sales of discretionary goods across the board, and Target has been no exception.\nLooking ahead, Target's management is focused on using durable growth levers to get the business back on track. The retailer aims to achieve more than $15 billion in profitable sales growth by 2030, including by expanding its third-party marketplace Target Plus from approximately $1 billion in 2024 sales to over $5 billion in sales by the beginning of the next decade.\nIt also plans to double the size of its in-house media company Roundel by 2030. Management says Roundel drove nearly $2 billion in value for the company in 2024. Target's same-day services were its fastest-growing choice for customers shopping in 2024, and the company plans to continue investing in this area.\nTarget aims to add more than 300 stores over the next 10 years. It intends to open around 20 new stores and invest to remodel many more in the U.S. in 2025. Over 13 million members joined the Target Circle loyalty program in 2024 alone, and Target plans to triple that membership base over the next three years through new perks, benefits, and other enhancements. Right now, people are spending more on essentials and less on discretionary items that typically have higher margins for Target.\nTarget continues to pivot its focus to historically more durable and accessible spending categories for customers. It launched 45 new beauty brands earlier this year and added 2,000 new items, with 90% priced under $20.\nAlthough a significant portion of Target's sales come from its physical stores, there's a growing contribution from its e-commerce business and omnichannel initiatives like curbside pickup and delivery services. In Q1, comparable sales decreased by 3.8% from one year ago, driven by a 5.7% decline in stores-originated comparable sales. However, digital comparable sales rose 4.7%, partially helped by 35% growth in same-day delivery powered by Target Circle 360.\nOn another positive note, net earnings totaled more than $1 billion for the three-month period, up 10% year over year. Target has a long history of paying dividends, having paid them faithfully every quarter since it became publicly held in October 1967. The company has also consistently increased its dividend, and 2025 is set to be the 54th consecutive year in which the company has raised its annual dividend.\nWith the stock offering a dividend yield of about 4.6% and trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just around 11, now could be a time for forward-thinking, income-seeking investors to buy these shares on the dip.\nShould you buy stock in Pfizer right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

The good news is, long-term investors are in a better position to weather these storms. By holding investments for an extended period, you allow your stocks time to recover from downturns and benefit from the overall upward trajectory of the market over time.\nAs you focus on a long-term horizon, you can ride out the natural ups and downs of the market with confidence while continuing to bolster your positions in quality companies. This also makes near-term market movements less impactful on your investing mindset and the overall health of your portfolio.\nOn that note, if you have cash to put into stocks right now, here are three of my favorite companies to consider for your basket of buys.\n1. AbbVie\nAbbVie(NYSE: ABBV) has long been known for its immunology drugs like Humira, which at one point was the top-selling drug in the world. Humira's key patents have expired, which has paved the way the last few years for competition from biosimilars.\nWhile Humira losses are still impacting earnings to a certain extent, AbbVie is actively transitioning its growth story toward other key immunology drugs like Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Imbruvica (cancer), Vraylar (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), Ubrelvy (acute migraine attacks), Qulipta (preventative treatment for migraine headaches), and Botox (for cosmetic and medical uses) are other key products for AbbVie right now.\nAbbVie had a strong second quarter, with revenue reaching $15.4 billion, a 6.6% increase year over year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $2.97, a 12% increase. AbbVie's solid Q2 results were driven by strong performance from the immunology and neuroscience portfolios, despite the ongoing impact of Humira's sales declines.\nSales in the immunology portfolio reached $7.6 billion, a 9.5% year-over-year increase, driven by a 62% sales surge for Skyrizi and a 42% sales jump for Rinvoq. AbbVie's neuroscience portfolio delivered 24% revenue growth to $2.7 billion, while key products Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta delivered respective sales growth of 16%, 14%, 47%, and 78%.\nAbbVie is actively expanding its pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. Key Q2 developments included the acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics for its CAR-T therapy candidate for autoimmune diseases and a collaboration with ADARx Pharmaceuticals for small interfering RNA therapeutics in neuroscience, immunology, and oncology target areas. The company also entered a licensing agreement with Ichnos Glenmark Innovation for ISB 2001, a T-cell engager for multiple myeloma.\nAbbVie remains a faithful dividend payer that yields 3.3% at the time of this writing, too. That could be icing on the cake for long-term investors.\n2. Costco\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) continues to demonstrate its ability to thrive even in challenging macro times when consumer spending remains in flux. The company relies heavily on membership fees for its profits, allowing it to offer low prices on merchandise and maintain relatively modest margins for product sales. This model creates customer loyalty and a predictable, recurring revenue stream, making earnings exceptionally stable even in uncertain economic climates.\nDuring economic downturns or inflationary periods, consumers become more focused on finding the best value for their money. Costco excels at offering accessible prices on bulk goods and a limited selection of high-quality items, which resonates well with budget-conscious shoppers. The company then leverages its massive scale to negotiate favorable pricing with suppliers, passing those savings on to its members. Costco consistently boasts high membership renewal rates as well (around 90% globally, including 93% in the U.S. and Canada).\nCostco's fiscal third quarter (ended May 11) exceeded Wall Street's estimates with a 13% increase in diluted EPS to $4.28 and an 8% revenue bump to $63 billion. Total comparable sales increased 5.7%, while e-commerce sales delivered growth of 14.8% from one year ago. The company also saw robust membership growth, with a 6.8% increase in paid household members and a 9% increase in executive memberships.\nShares are up about 20% over the past year, which is roughly in line with the S&P 500's broader performance in that same time frame. Costco's dividend yields less than 1%, a pattern often associated with stocks that have a steady habit of delivering favorable share price appreciation. Notably, the company has increased its dividend every single year for over two decades and counting at this point, and occasionally pays special dividends.\nInvestors searching for a value-oriented stock with a defensive hedge even in tough market environments may want to build a position in Costco.\n3. Uber Technologies\nUber Technologies(NYSE: UBER) achieved its first full-year profit in 2023, marking a significant milestone after years of operating losses. This profit was driven by increased demand for ride-hailing and delivery services, as well as cost discipline and new growth initiatives. That trend has continued in the series of financial reports the company has delivered since, and the stock has received a bump of about 51% over the trailing 12 months alone.\nUber continues to experience double-digit growth in both its ridesharing and food delivery segments, with the company's membership program, Uber One, gaining strong traction that is driving higher user engagement and cross-platform usage. Trips during Q1 grew 18% year over year to 3 billion, bolstered by an increase in monthly active platform consumers of 14%. Uber's gross bookings grew 14% from one year ago to $42.8 billion, driving revenue up 14% to $11.5 billion.\nThe company also reported net income of $1.8 billion in the three-month period, compared to a loss of $654 million in the year-ago period. Uber generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Its advertising platform, while relatively small compared to its core segments, grew more than 60% year over year in Q1 2025.\nThe company is also focusing on building an autonomous vehicle ecosystem through partnerships with companies like Waymo, Lucid Group, and Nuro, rather than developing proprietary hardware. This strategy could reduce its operational costs and even regulatory risks while paving the way for future revenue and efficiency gains through autonomous deliveries and ridesharing.\nNow could be a smart time for investors to take a slice of the action by investing in this top ridesharing stock.\nShould you buy stock in AbbVie right now?\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AbbVie wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $1,119,863!*\nNow, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 1,060% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.

Under the agreement, Autel will embed Nayax payment solutions directly into an estimated 100,000 EV chargers set for deployment by the end of 2026.\nElectric vehicles are a growing segment for Nayax, a company known to convenience services operators for its cashless payment solutions and management systems for the vending industry.
