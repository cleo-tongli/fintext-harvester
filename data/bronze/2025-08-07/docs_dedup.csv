Rachel Warren: Tariffs and Trade wars can't slow big tech momentum. Motley Money starts now. I'm Rachel Warren, joined today by Motley Fool analysts Lou Whiteman and Jon Quast. Today, we're talking Mag 7 spending plans and tariff turmoil, but we have to start with the big macro picture first. We learned Wednesday that the US economy returned to growth in Q2. US gross domestic product, which is a measure of the value of goods and services produced across the economy, rose by 3% in the second quarter. That's up from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter of the year, and it's actually ahead of the consensus estimate. We also saw that consumer spending rose by more than 1% in Q2. Now, this was as exports declined single digits, and imports fell by more than 30%, reversing a major surge that we saw in Q1 of 2025. Jon, the big takeaway for me is consumer spending seems to be holding up well even as businesses have turned cautious. But the question is, with all the headwinds the economy is facing, do you think that this can continue?
Jon Quast: Yes, this can absolutely continue. Rachel, consumer spending can hold up. Now, listen, I could give you so many reasons on why to be skeptical on why the opposite is true. First and foremost, there's 1.2 trillion in credit card debt out there right now. That's up 30% in just the last three years. It would seem that consumers are spending, yes, but it also seems like they're spending on credit. So that's a party that the music is going to end, eventually, it would seem, and when that music ends, there could be a contraction to consumer spending. That said, I do say it can hold up because there's almost always a reason to be skeptical, and yet consumer spending almost always holds up. We will probably see shifts in consumer spending, and I think that is playing out. You take, for example, a company such as Kellanova. This is the company that was spun out from Kellogg's. It makes Pringles, Pop-Tarts. It reported financial results this morning on July 31, and it saw a softening of demand, and that is playing out for a variety of snacking companies right now. That's kind of a pervasive trend. People trending away from snacks. That's interesting. On the other hand, you have a company such as Carvana. They're selling 41% more cars in the most recent quarter compared to a year ago. There is this incredible shift of consumer spending, and it doesn't always make sense, from snacks to cars. But yeah, overall, I think that consumer spending can hold up.
Lou Whiteman: Jon's right. You have to be crazy to bet against the American consumer. But you know what? I'm feeling a little crazy right now, Rachel. I'm more worried about the consumer right here than I'm business. I think businesses can snap back as the companies adjust to whatever the new normal is with tariffs. But heading into back-to-school and then the holiday season, I do think Main Street is going to feel the pushback of higher prices, maybe more so than tariffs have just been creeping in. My guess is, if GDP does continue to push higher in the second half, and I do think it'll push higher in the second half, I think it'll be a reverse at the second quarter with business, not the consumer doing the heavy lift.
Rachel Warren: A healthy job market with low unemployment rates and rising wages. That's a primary driver of sustained consumer spending, and wage gains have been outpacing inflation. Consumers, in some cases have more disposable income to spend. Rising asset values can contribute to that wealth effect. and that can also make consumers feel more confident to spend. We've seen this dynamic where lower and middle-income consumers might be more vulnerable to economic shifts, but those in the top third of the income distribution area are thriving and account for a significant portion of spending. Now, it's worth noting the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged at its meeting on Wednesday. Now we know the Federal Reserve is likely to lower interest rates in September. You've got some economists predicting a further cut in December, according to recent reports. While the Fed held rates steady at their July meeting, the decision was not unanimous. There were two dissenting votes advocating for a rate cut. With tariff policy seemingly changing by the minute, it's hard to know what to expect. More on tariffs and big tech in a minute. You are listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back. We might not yet know the final tariff rates for various US trade partners, but we are beginning to see an impact from the aggressive moves. India has reportedly overtaken China to become the top source of smartphones sold in the US, and that's fueled by Apple's shift to assemble more phones in the country. Vietnam now ranks second, and China has fallen from first to year ago to third. Now, Lou, the White House wanted to move smartphone assembly out of China, but I don't think India was the destination it had in mind. Does Tim Cook have to worry about backlash from Washington, and what are your thoughts on the tariff Mayhem?
Lou Whiteman: I think Tim Cook probably believes he can outlast the tariff push, and I think he's probably right. Look, this was the inevitable outcome of raising tariffs on China. There was never much of a chance that large corporations were just going to overnight shift manufacturing to the US. They'd have to build an entire supply chain, manufacturing footprint. There's just so much complexity, and they'd have to do it largely from scratch. It's just not going to happen. It didn't make sense for companies like Apple to do that. It made sense for them to lean into other markets where they are established. If tariffs do shift manufacturing back to the US, it'll take time. For now, the message from Washington, with all of this chaos has been things shift so fast, there's no reason for corporations to make any real massive CapEx moves. The chaos this week that just reinforces it, I think. The best move if you're a CEO is to roll with it and not make too many big company-altering decisions. That's what Apple's doing in India, and I think that makes sense. It's what honestly, they should be doing.
Rachel Warren: We are now just hours away from the White House's August 1 deadline for countries to strike trade deals or face higher tariffs, and we've seen a flurry of activity, we appear to be in deals with Taiwan, Thailand, and Cambodia. The UK led the charge on trade agreements with the US. They struck one as early as May. Vietnam was the second to ink a deal with the Trump administration. President Trump announced a trade agreement on July 2nd that saw the tariff imposed on Vietnam slash from 46% to 20%. Japan was the second major Asian economy to come to an agreement with the US after China. They saw their tariff rate cut to 15%. They were also the first to see a lower preferential tariff rate for their key automobile sector. Now, the EU's agreement with the US was struck just days ago, and that was after lengthy negotiations. EU goods are now facing a 15% baseline tariff rate. South Korea is the latest country to reach an agreement as well on Thursday, with the terms being somewhat similar to the one Japan received. It's worth noting, though, the US has managed to make only about eight deals in 120 days. Some of our key trading partners remain without a deal so far. That includes Canada, Australia, and India. Jon, the situation is and will remain fluid. But as an investor, how closely are you watching all of this wheeling and dealing?
Jon Quast: I'm not watching it closely at all, and I'll give you two reasons why. First of all, when I buy a stock, I have an investment thesis, and so this thesis is basically my reasoning for why the stock I bought is going to outperform the market average, and in my thesis, I try to conservatively account for risk, such as geopolitical risk. Like what we're talking about right here. If something can be broken, if my thesis can be broken based on changes in economic policy, I'm generally not that interested. I'm looking for something that doesn't really matter what these big changes in economic policy will be. The underlying trends for my thesis are still intact. I'll give you an example. Mercado Libre in South America. I've lived in South America. I can attest to how much paper money is still used in those economies, but that is changing so fast. Those economies are digitizing extremely fast, and Mercado Libre is a financial technology company. It's also an e-commerce company. You start looking at the pervasive trend that the economy is going digital, that's not going to change, and so I really see Mercado Libre being a long-term winner, regardless of what changes happen in the economic policy. Another reason I'm not really watching this closely is because even if there is a trade deal in place, even when something comes down, it seems like, and I believe this is fair to say, things in Washington these days are far from settled, and so if we get news today, that might change tomorrow. I really don't see a ton of value of following it too closely. I really think about Investing Great Charlie Munger. He said, ""I figure that I want to swim as well as I can against the tides. I'm not trying to predict the tides"". And I think it's a good rule to live by.
Lou Whiteman: I think that's spot on. One of the advantages of being a long-term investor is, everything near-term is noise. I'm looking for companies that, whatever may come, can survive and thrive over the long term. I don't necessarily want to predict the weather. I just want to know that sometimes it's sunny, sometimes it rains, and I want companies that can do OK with both. I think that's exactly right, Jon.
Rachel Warren: I think that's right, guys. Up next, we have Microsoft and Meta Earnings and their aggressive AI spending plans. We'll be back with you in a minute. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Microsoft and Meta platforms were both out with earnings last night. Now, both companies posted double-digit growth that easily topped expectations, but the focus was on spending plans. Meta Platforms ' CFO, Susan Lee, said,"" We really believe that this is the time for us to make investments in AI,"" and that's really backing up the company's planned $85 billion in CapEx this year. Microsoft, for its part, said that they expect to spend 30 billion in the current quarter alone, which at an annualized rate would be even more than Meta or Alphabet is spending. Jon, the numbers here are almost mind-numbingly large. But the core businesses of these companies they are generating billions in cash, so they can afford the investment. Should investors be worried or excited about these spending plans?
Jon Quast: I believe that investors should be absolutely thrilled, ecstatic with these plans. You're right. These numbers are mind-numbing. In fact, they're so big, we really can't even wrap our heads around them, 85 billion. Look, there are 500 companies in the S&P 500. With 85 billion, Meta could purchase any one of about 75% of these companies. These are the biggest, most profitable companies in the US, and they can buy most of them with 85 billion. That's a lot of money, and we're just talking about Meta with that. You start adding in Microsoft, Alphabet, all the mega caps, they're going to collectively spend about 320 billion this year in CapEx compared to 230 billion last year. That's nearly a 40% jump from last year. I think if you're a shareholder of any of these companies, it's basically good news because they need to invest in their futures at scale, and so it's going to cost a lot of money. But these companies have also made many shareholder-friendly moves in recent years, such as share buybacks and dividends, and so I feel like there's a good balance here. I think beyond that, though, investors need to think, Where is that 320 billion going to go? That's a lot of cash. I think companies such as NVIDIA and AMD are going to see ongoing, strong demand for their chips. I think even industrial players, such as HVAC and Electrical company Comfort System USA, they've got a rising backlog right now as they're trying to meet all this demand for the facilities being built to support AI. I think there's a lot to be excited about when you see how much money is getting thrown around.
Rachel Warren: It's clear that Meta and Microsoft are increasing their investments in AI because they see it as a crucial driver for future growth and also to maintain their competitive advantage in various sectors. It's interesting because, of course, Meta's fallen a bit behind the competition here the last few years. But then you have its recent launch if it's Meta super-intelligence labs, their hiring spree that they've been on in a bid to catch up in the AI race. It's getting a lot of attention from investors. Lou, what are your thoughts on what we're seeing?
Lou Whiteman: To me, Microsoft has the most clear use case for AI outside of just refining its own business or internal work. Alphabet and Meta are mostly deploying AI for internal uses. Alphabet is hoping to use AI to reinvent search, but it's early days there. But Microsoft, thanks to 365, thanks to Office, all these massive businesses they have a clear lane to the corporate user to deploy AI. It may not be a sustainable advantage. There could be a way to catch up, but I think it's a real advantage right now over these just cloud players. I think we're going to see companies with those strong B2B connections, like Microsoft, like Salesforce, even Oracle. I think they're going to lead the way on deploying AI to the workforce, this next step that is really showing the payoff and all this investment.
Rachel Warren: Investors pushed Microsoft higher following earnings. The company joined in NVIDIA as the second member of the $4 trillion market cap club. Time for a bold prediction, guys. What will be the next company to break the $4 trillion market cap threshold, Jon? Tell us.
Jon Quast: Rachel, this might be a little bit of a surprise, but I think that Alphabet is the best position to make a run at a $4 trillion market cap. When you look at the valuations of the mega cap companies, for me, Alphabet is the one that makes the most sense. It does seem like it has a fair valuation right now. But when it comes to its financial position, competitive strengths, opportunities, it's as good as any of them, if not better than others. I think the only risk here is that it gets broken up. But honestly, any company making a run at four trillion has to be worried about being broken up at some point.
Lou Whiteman: I hate to go into Alphabet here because I think you're probably right, but I'll take the Dark Horse. Meta is currently sixth on the list. It isn't even quite two trillion yet, but look, that advertising business is a powerhouse, and I don't see another business like it elsewhere with less headwinds up ahead than I think Alphabet and some of the others. I'll take Meta, though I'll be honest, I don't think any of these guys get there in the near term, so it could be a long race.
Rachel Warren: It is certainly an exciting time to be a tech investor and to be investing in the world of AI. So many opportunities there.

Travis Hoium: Who will earn the gold medal for earnings so far this week? Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Travis Hoium joined by longtime Fools, Lou, the Legend, Whiteman and Matt, the Rit whisper, Frankel today, we're going to get two earnings from General Motors, Intuitive Surgical and Enphase Energy and rate them gold, silver, and bronze. But first, let's talk a little bit about tariffs. We found out late yesterday that the US and Japan have struck a deal that will lower the rate of tariffs from products coming from Japan from 25% to 15%. Japan is also going to invest $550 billion. In government affiliated institutions to ""build resilient supply chains"" in key sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Lou, I'm going to give you today's softball. Is this a massive change to global trade or a nothing burger?
Lou Whiteman: It isn't a nothing burger. Japan is our fifth largest trading partner, so this is an important deal to get done and also, historically, this has been a market that has been somewhat closed to outsiders. To the extent that whatever this agreement is, they can open up the market for US exporters. That could be significant. But yeah, let's be honest. This is one step in a very long process. Japan, if anything, looks like an easier negotiation than some when we started, so incrementally positive, but we still have a long way to go.
Travis Hoium: Matt, I want to take this back to manufacturing, in particular, some of the auto companies in the US, which we'll talk about GM in a moment. But how does this impact companies like Toyota and Honda, some of the biggest auto importers and also big employers in the US. How are these companies going to be impacted by these tariffs?
Matt Frankel: Yeah, so it's a big deal for the automakers. As we've seen from you mentioned GM, which we'll get to in a minute, the impact of the current 25% import auto tariffs can be in the billions, which they were for GM. Cutting it from 25% to 15% is significant. It's unclear if this is going to apply to the rest of the auto industry or if other automakers are going to have to do things like invest in the US and things to that extent. But GM's already investing $4 billion to bring some of its manufacturing domestic. Maybe it'll be a give and take with the administration, but it's really unclear beyond Japan. But for the Japanese automakers, this is a big deal.
Lou Whiteman: My question is, and as things stand right now, it's subject to change. But since US automakers don't import a lot from Japan, the 15% tariff really doesn't matter to them as much, we could be looking at right now Toyotas, for example, paying a 15% tariff to bring vehicles into the US to be sold in the US, but GM or Ford having to pay significantly higher tariffs on parts from China and elsewhere that go into US assembled vehicles, it doesn't feel like that's a fair trade off and again, we have a long way to go in the global negotiation process.
Travis Hoium: Yeah, this is going to be a long story that we'll definitely be covering here more. Let's move over to the US manufacturing space and GM's earnings, which were reported on Tuesday, revenue $47.1 billion, adjusted earnings per share, $2.53. Guidance for the year was flat from three months ago. That was when after those initial tariffs were announced. But the stock dropped 8%. Lou, was this a good report or not?
Lou Whiteman: On the face of it, just looking at the print on the paper, it was a solid report. Demand is holding up well. GM is doing a good job controlling what it can on the cost side. But investors, understandably, there's a lot more than just what's going on inside the business. We're focused on tariffs. Net income was down 35% on a 2% decline in revenue. That's a great way to illustrate just kind of how much higher costs are taking a toll. Look, the problem is, there's no reason to believe that changes in the second half of the year. We have a situation where the company is operating well, but there just isn't a lot of reason to get excited about near term prospects. There's just too many headwinds right now.
Travis Hoium: Matt, we talked about Mary Barra being one of our favorite CEOs. But you look at GM stock. The stock is down over the past four years despite great profitability, market share gains in EVs. They're actually taking market share from Tesla. They're the number two player there now, and buybacks have reduced shares outstanding by 20% on a compound annual basis over the past seven quarters and the stock only has a five priced earnings multiple based on their guidance. What is going on? What do we need to get investors actually excited about GM stock?
Matt Frankel: Well, I've been hearing for years, and people have used this to justify that low multiple that you just mentioned. I've been hearing for years that the auto industry is about to turn, become unprofitable. They're going to lose their pricing power. The market dynamics are going to change. It just hasn't happened. GM keeps making money. You mentioned those aggressive buybacks. Investors just generally don't seem to be sold on the fact that GM's EV strategy will be as profitable as the current sales mixes. To be fair, they are lower margin vehicles as it stands right now. But there's a lot to like about what GM is doing right now. You mentioned they're the clear number two in the US EV market. They had a 16% market share, which that's disrupting even Tesla. There's a lot to like about the quarter, 2.8 billion dollar in free cash flow, despite the tariffs impact. The market just really is not rewarding capital intensive businesses right now, especially those with uncertainty from tariffs, from EV strategy and all that. I just think the market is not convinced that this is going to go well.
Travis Hoium: They're buying back shares at a pace, and if this stock doesn't go anywhere, eventually, there just won't be any shares left, so we'll see what happens with GM.
Matt Frankel: I would be fine with that.
Travis Hoium: Next up, we're going to examine Intuitive Surgical's quarter with robotic precision. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Lou, Intuitive Surgical is one of the most iconic Motley Fool companies. It has crushed the market since its IPO, more than 200 bagger over that period of time. What did we learn in the second quarter?
Lou Whiteman: We learned what we already knew. We learned momentum remains strong. They grew revenue by 20%, earnings per share by 23%. The installed base grew by more than 1,000 systems to 10,488. That's important because Intuitive operates the Razor razor blade model. A bulk of the profits, a bulk of these sales come from reoccurring sales after the machines are installed. There are near term headwinds. Tariffs are concerned. They are clouded guidance, and it remains to be seen whether changes in hospital funding coming out of this new tax legislation, it's possible they will slow sales of new DaVinci devices. I'm not sure what becomes of hospital CapEx from this, but those feel like small speed bumps relative to a long term growth story that is very much intact.
Matt Frankel: Like you mentioned the razor and blades model there. It's my favorite thing about this company. One thing to note that I've noticed from the earnings report from a long term investor's perspective, is that the installed base of DaVinci machines increased by 14% is the year to year percentage increase. But the number of procedures performed using those machines increased at a faster 17% rate. That tells me that the industry is becoming increasingly more reliant on robotic assisted surgeries. That's a very positive thing looking long term. As Lou pointed out, other than a few minor speed bumps, it really was a solid quarter.
Travis Hoium: Next up, we're going to look at how the solar sector is holding up with Enphase Energy. We'll be back after the short break.
Ava: Hi. This is Ava from Vanta. In today's digital world, compliance regulations are changing constantly, and earning customer trust has never mattered more. Vanta helps companies get compliant, fast, and stay secure with the most advanced AI automation and continuous monitoring out there. Whether you're a start-up going for your first SOC 2 or ISO 27,001, we are growing enterprise managing vendor risk. Vanta makes it quick, easy, and scalable. I'm not just saying that because I work here. Get started today at vanta.com.
Travis Hoium: Matt, Enphase Energy has been the darling of the solar market for years, but the stock is falling on Wednesday after what I thought was an OK report, given all the wonkiness around solar right now, revenue was $363 million. Gross margin held pretty strong at 46.9%. They've moved more production into the US to avoid tariffs, but is this as good as it gets for Enphase, given the recent policy changes in the US?
Matt Frankel: It might be as good as it gets for now. I don't think it's the best that it gets. It's worth noting that solar technology itself is evolving very rapidly and will naturally become more cost effective over time, meaning that the government incentives or lack thereof that we're seeing this year, should matter less and less overtime. I agree it was a pretty solid report given the situation. The gross margin you mentioned is 170 basis points higher than it was a year ago. The company is doing a good job of mitigating tariff impacts, like you said. Just for example, they recently started shipping one of its products with ""higher domestic content"" than previous models. I think they're doing the right things.
Lou Whiteman: Yeah, similar story to what we just said about GM, I think. I think Enphase is doing the best of what they can with the situation they are in. Assuming solar is a big part of the clean energy answer long term, and I do think it is. I still think Enphase should benefit and should be a winner here, but it's hard to look at the world right now and see any reason to believe there's a catalyst right around the corner, and that's just where Enphase is.
Travis Hoium: The stock is down almost 90% from its late 2022 high, so I'm not sure if we have value there, but eventually this will become attractive. One of the things they talked about during the quarter was going a little bit more direct to consumer, including what they called IQ balcony solar. This is one to four solar panels. You just plug into an outlet to keep critical appliances running. They're starting to build an end around around the utility connection that is always kind of problematic with solar energy. Matt, are you interested in direct to consumer solar products?
Matt Frankel: Yes, especially the ones that are designed to not rely on government subsidies. It sounds like the balcony solar that you're talking about. I do think there's a lot of long term opportunity here, especially with the stock about 90%. I can't believe that 90% off its all time highs, which were in the 300s. Enphase could be worth a look, but I do agree that a turnaround isn't likely to happen overnight. It's going to be a long tailed turnaround story, and there's a lot of risk here.
Travis Hoium: As we look at these results and we try to wrap our heads around what's going on in the second quarter, I want to get gold, silver, and bronze for these three stocks and your takeaways so far, what can we take away toward the rest of earning season? Lou, I'm going to start with you. Who is your gold pick?
Lou Whiteman: Intuitive is clearly the safest pick here, but it also comes at a premium valuation. I'm going to go out on a limb, say, the stock that is my gold, the one I'm most excited about in a group is Enphase. The risks are real, and as we've said, I think patience is required, but I do think that there is a there there, and overtime it can work as for GM, I've been involved in the automakers a lot in my career. Even when times are good, this is a very difficult business. I respect what GM has done, but I have no desire to be a shareholder.
Matt Frankel: I'm not sure any of these three earnings reports are truly worthy of a gold. There's nothing, the stock didn't jump afterwards. There's nothing they didn't raise guidance, anything like that. I'd say GM was the most pleasant surprise to me. I get it I'm biased. It's one of my largest investments, unlike Travis, who ran away when they got rid of Cruz. That was my most pleasant surprise. They restarted buybacks at the end of the second quarter because of ""more tariff clarity"". They affirmed their guidance, which given what's going on in the auto industry is actually pretty impressive. But I mean, I'd give Intuitive Surgical, the silver. I mentioned, the world's becoming more reliant on robotic surgeries, and that's clear in their earnings. Enphase is by far the biggest turnaround of the three, but it is making the best of a bad situation. I'd give them the bronze medal if I had to name one.
Travis Hoium: Looking at these reports, I've got to say my gold here is GM. This is one of those stocks I don't own right now, but I just love the way that they're operating. I live in the Midwest, so maybe I have a different view than a lot of people, but I see GM vehicles all over the place, and they have just a dominant position in those massive trucks and SUVs and that's fundamentally where the money is made in the auto industry. I got to say, I'm intrigued by Enphase Energy. That would be my silver. I don't know if I'm looking for a bottom here, trying to find value where there isn't any, but this is the one company that consistently seems to be able to have high margins and doesn't end up getting disrupted. Sorry, Intuitive Surgical, they win the bronze for me. As we get through earning season, we're getting to some pretty big reports later this week. Matt, what are the reports that you're watching this week, and what are you looking to take away from them?
Matt Frankel: There are some big ones this week. They were recording this Alphabet reports, but I'm really watching Kinsale Capital Group. KNSL, they report Thursday afternoon and they've had two consecutive quarters of I don't want to say bad numbers, but definitely affected by catastrophic losses due to those California wildfires that stretched over a two quarter period. I'm curious to see if they can rebound from that in this quarter and see if their growth story is really still alive, because it is really hard to tell when things are offset by those catastrophic losses.
Lou Whiteman: How can you not say Tesla? Grab your popcorn and have Tesla.
Matt Frankel: Well, I'll be watching it.
Travis Hoium: Yeah, and I think Alphabet is going to be really interesting. Is search being disrupted? What's the story with their Cloud business? Is that going to get back to 30% growth?

Graanul is pleased to announce that holders of greater than 75% of its Existing Notes have acceded to the Transaction Support Agreement. While Graanul now has sufficient support from holders to implement the A&E Transaction via a Scheme, Graanul continues to progress towards achieving the Requisite 90% Consents to implement the A&E Transaction on a consensual basis, as described in the Consent Solicitation Statement. Noteholders are reminded to take the steps outlined below and in the Consent Solicitation Statement to participate in the Consent Solicitation and to do so by the Early Consent Deadline to receive the full Consideration.
Timing. The timing of the Consent Solicitation and Scheme Solicitation remains unchanged, with an Early Consent Deadline of 5:00 p.m. New York time on August 7, 2025, and will expire at 11:59 p.m. New York time on August 21, 2025, in each case, unless extended, re-opened, amended or earlier terminated by the Issuer in accordance with the Consent Solicitation Statement.
Eligible Holders may submit their instructions in respect of the Consent Solicitation and Scheme Solicitation at any time prior to the Expiration Time, but are reminded that Noteholders will receive the Early Consent Consideration only if they validly submit (and do not withdraw) their consent (or Abstention Instruction, as applicable) and become a party to the Transaction Support Agreement prior to the Early Consent Deadline (or otherwise as set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement). Supportive Noteholders wishing to receive the Early Consent Consideration are reminded to take action as soon as possible as custodians may impose varying and/or earlier deadlines for submission of instructions ahead of the Early Consent Deadline.
Consideration. Eligible Holders who satisfy the conditions set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement will receive consideration consisting of (a) the New Notes (in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Eligible Holder’s Supporting Notes, less its pro rata share of the Participation Consideration referred to below, plus, if applicable, the Early Consent Consideration paid to it in the form of New Notes), which New Notes have the improved terms, including as to economic terms, described in the Consent Solicitation Statement, (b) accrued and unpaid interest in cash in respect of the aggregate principal amount of such Eligible Holder’s Supporting Notes (prior to payment of the Participation Consideration), and (c) the following consideration:
provided that, to be eligible to receive the Early Consent Consideration, such Eligible Holders must validly submit (and do not withdraw) their consent (or Abstention Instruction, as applicable) with respect to all of the Existing Notes held or beneficially owned by them (except for any Existing Notes held by it in its capacity as a Qualified Market-maker and after taking into account any pending transfers) and become a party to the Transaction Support Agreement prior to the Early Consent Deadline; in each case, subject to and in accordance with the limitations and conditions set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement. Eligible Holders who take the relevant steps prior to the Expiration Time but after the Early Consent Deadline will not be eligible to receive the Early Consent Consideration, but will be entitled to receive the New Notes, accrued and unpaid interest and the Participation Consideration.
If the Issuer obtains the Requisite 90% Consents, holders who do not participate in the Consent Solicitation and Scheme Solicitation prior to the Expiration Time will not receive the New Notes, will not receive any of the above outlined consideration, and will have their Existing Notes amended in the form of Amended Notes to:
-
extend the maturity date to October 15, 2029 (but make no other changes to the economic terms of the Amended Notes);
-
disapply substantially all of the restrictive covenants in respect of the Amended Notes; and
-
disapply certain events of default in respect of the Amended Notes,
in each case, as described in more detail in the Consent Solicitation Statement.
The New Notes will have separate ISINs and trade separately from the Amended Notes that the non-participating holders will continue to hold.
Supplemental Indenture. Having received requisite support for implementation of the A&E Transaction via a Scheme should the Requisite 90% Consents not be achieved, the Issuer has executed a supplemental indenture to the Existing Indenture, which is now effective and operative, which would facilitate such implementation by permitting implementation of the Scheme Amendments to the Existing Indenture as disclosed in the Consent Solicitation Statement. Progressing towards and achieving the Requisite 90% Consents in order to implement the A&E Transaction on a consensual basis continues to be Graanul’s objective and Noteholders are reminded to take the steps outlined above to participate in the Consent Solicitation.
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this press release have the meaning given to them in the Consent Solicitation Statement.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.46%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) fell -0.71%.
Stock indexes gave up an early advance on Tuesday and turned lower on some disappointing news on US services activity, along with signs of sticky price pressures in the service sector. The US Jul ISM services index unexpectedly fell -0.7 to 50.1, weaker than expectations of an increase to 51.5. Also, the Jul ISM services prices paid sub-index unexpectedly rose +2.4 to a 2.75-year high of 69.9, versus expectations of a decline to 66.5.
Stocks initially opened higher Tuesday on strength in technology stocks, led by a +7% jump in Palantir Technologies after it reported stronger-than-expected profits and raised its full-year forecasts. Stocks have continued support from speculation that last Friday's dismal payroll and ISM manufacturing reports will prompt the Fed to cut interest rates. The chances of a Fed rate cut at the September FOMC meeting rose to 94% from 40% before the reports were released.
The US trade deficit for June was smaller than expected, a positive factor for Q2 GDP. The June US trade deficit shrank to -$60.2 billion from -$71.7 billion in May, better than expectations of -$61.0 billion and the smallest deficit in 1.75 years.
Dovish comments late Monday from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly were supportive for stocks when she said the time is nearing for Fed interest rate cuts, given mounting evidence that the job market is softening and there are no signs of persistent tariff-driven inflation.
In recent tariff news, President Trump said Monday that he would be ""substantially raising"" the tariff on US imports from India from the current 25% due to India's purchases of Russian oil. Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective after midnight on August 7. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
The markets this week will focus on earnings reports and any fresh tariff or trade news. On Thursday, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +3,000 to 221,000. Also on Thursday, Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be +2.0% with unit labor costs rising +1.5%.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 94% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 62% at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Q2 earnings reports released thus far suggest that S&P 500 earnings are on track to rise +9.1% for the second quarter, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 67% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, around 83% exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets on Tuesday settled higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up by +0.14%. China's Shanghai Composite closed up +0.96%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.64%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) Tuesday closed down -2.5 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose by +1.0 bp to 4.202%. Sep T-notes fell from a 3-month high Tuesday and posted modest losses, and the 10-year T-note yield moved up from a 3-month low of 4.183%.
Supply pressures are weighing on T-notes as the Treasury will auction $125 billion of T-notes and T-bonds in this week's August quarterly refunding. Also, signs of price pressures in the US service sector are bearish for T-notes after the July ISM services prices paid sub-index unexpectedly rose +2.4 to a 2.75-year high of 69.9. T-notes remained lower Tuesday on weak demand seen for the Treasury's $58 billion auction of 3-year T-notes that had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.53, below he 10-auction average of 2.58.
Losses in T-notes were limited after the Jul ISM services index unexpectedly declined. T-notes found support from dovish comments late Monday from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, who said the time is nearing for Fed interest rate cuts given labor market weakness and no signs of tariff inflation. T-notes also have positive carryover support from last Friday's weaker-than-expected payroll and ISM manufacturing reports, which boosted the chance of a Fed rate cut at next month's FOMC meeting to 92% from 40% before the reports.
European government bond yields on Tuesday were mixed. The 10-year German bund yield fell to a 1.5-week low of 2.601% and finished unchanged at 2.624%. The 10-year UK gilt yield rebounded from a 1-month low of 4.496% and finished up +0.8 bp to 4.516%.
The Eurozone July S&P composite PMI was revised downward by -0.1 to 50.9 from the previously reported 51.0.
The UK July S&P composite PMI was revised upward by +0.5 to 51.5 from the previously reported 51.0.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 16% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

Meanwhile, Trump also previewed coming chip tariffs, suggesting a carveout that could benefit Big Tech companies.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 0.4% to close at a fresh record, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended little changed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped 0.5%.
Stocks trimmed losses after Trump nominated Stephen Miran, the current chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, to serve on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors until Jan. 31, 2026, following Adriana Kugler's resignation.
Meanwhile, Trump's deadline for trade deals landed at 12:01 a.m. ET on Thursday. Imports from nearly 200 countries now face duties ranging from 10% to 50%, and the overall average effective tariff rate is projected to jump to 18.6%, according to the Yale Budget Lab, the highest since 1933.
Apple (AAPL) shares climbed Thursday as Trump and CEO Tim Cook announced the company would make a $100 billion investment in the US. As part of the deal, Apple will manufacture the cover glasses for iPhones and Apple Watches in Kentucky.
At the same time, Trump's comments that he'd exempt some companies from his plans to place 100% duties on semiconductors gave tech stocks an overall boost for a second consecutive day. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose around 0.7%.
Meanwhile, another wave of earnings flooded in Thursday morning. The reports featured a tariff warning from Toyota (TM), which said in its first quarter results that the impact of US tariffs will be some $9.5 billion. Among other notable corporate giants to report, Eli Lilly's (LLY) disappointing results of its much-awaited oral GLP-1 pill trial sent the stock down 14% despite posting better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter.
Also on Thursday, 1.974 million continuing claims for unemployment benefits were filed, reaching their highest level since November 2021. The state of the labor market is in high focus following a disappointing July jobs report and downbeat revisions to the May and June jobs reports.

Gold climbs on trade tensions, hopes of Fed rate cut
Gold (GC=F) futures climbed on Thursday as tariffs on imports from nearly 200 countries rolled out, and investor optimism over potential Fed rate cuts in September grew.
The precious metal rose 0.6% to trade above $3,454 per ounce. Inflows into gold ETFS and central bank purchases have fueled gold purchases over the past year.
Year to date, gold is up about 32%. The prospects of lower interest rates from the Federal Reserve amid a weakening job market have fueled purchases of the precious metal.
Meanwhile, President Trump's tariff deadline landed on Thursday, and tariffs on imports from a variety of countries now face duties ranging from 10% to 50%. The overall average effective tariff rate is projected to jump to 18.6% this year, according to the Yale Budget Lab, the highest since 1933.

Bitcoin, crypto stocks rally ahead of Trump order opening 401(k) plans to alternative assets
Major cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks were rallying early Thursday ahead of President Trump's expected signing of an executive order that would allow alternative assets like cryptocurrencies and private equity into the retirement accounts of millions of Americans, Yahoo Finance's Jake Conley reports.
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose nearly 2%, while ether (ETH-USD) and XRP (XRP-USD) were both up around 4%. Shares of Coinbase (COIN), the largest publicly traded crypto exchange, rose 3.4%. Robinhood (HOOD) and Strategy (MSTR) climbed over 4% and 2.6%, respectively.
Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2%, while Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 1.7% and Micron (MU) rose 3.4%.
Most advanced chips are produced by contract chip manufacturer TSMC (TSM) in Taiwan, but the company has been building out its capacity in Arizona, exempting it from Trump's tariffs. The company's US-listed shares soared nearly 7% Thursday morning, hitting a record high.
So far, Nvidia has committed to producing $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the US. Micron made a similar $200 billion commitment.

Here's a look at some top trending tickers on Thursday ahead of the opening bell:
Continuing claims for unemployment benefits hit highest since November 2021
Americans filing for unemployment insurance on an ongoing basis reached the highest level since November 2021 at the end of July.
In the week ending July 26, 1.974 million continuing claims were filed, up from 1.936 million the week prior and the highest level seen since November 2021, according to data from the Department of Labor released Thursday morning. Economists see an increase in continuing claims as a sign that those out of work are taking longer to find new jobs.
Meanwhile, weekly filings for unemployment benefits moved higher to 226,000 in the week ending Aug. 2, up from 221,000 the week prior.
Intel stock dips as Trump calls for CEO resignation
President Trump on Thursday morning called for the resignation of Intel's (INTC) CEO Lip‑Bu Tan, who has been at the job since March, saying the executive is ""highly conflicted"" and should leave his post immediately.
“The CEO of INTEL is highly conflicted and must resign immediately. There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!” wrote Trump on social media.
On Wednesday, Reuters reported that US Republican Sen. Tom Cotton sent a letter to the company's board raising questions about Tan's ties to Chinese firms and a recent criminal case involving his former company, Cadence Design (CDNS.O).
Intel stock was down as much as 3% in premarket trading.

Eli Lilly stock falls despite earnings beat as oral GLP-1 pill results disappoint
Eli Lilly (LLY) stock fell 7% in premarket trading. Although the company's second quarter earnings topped expectations, the results of a late-stage trial of its highly anticipated oral GLP-1 pill disappointed.
For the quarter, Eli Lilly reported $15.56 billion in revenue, beating Wall Street estimates of $14.69 billion. Earnings per share came in at $6.31, compared to Street expectations of $5.56.
Much of the $10.81 billion in US revenue was driven by strong sales of weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, which increased 46% in volume, though prices fell 8%.
Not too far removed from Figma's (FIG) huge IPO, Firefly will come to market at the Nasdaq later on today. The IPO was upsized, and it's likely it will come out of the block strong when it opens.
I am not in love with the company's financials, but it has a host of key deals in place and its technology has proven to work (see trips to moon). And it has a SpaceX (SPAX.PVT) like story to tell at a hot time for markets. Perfectly timed debut.

ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -TRADING DAY
Making sense of the forces driving global markets
By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist
Wall Street bucked the positive global equity trend and closed mostly lower on Tuesday, as U.S. service sector data rekindled stagflation fears and shined a light on the difficult position the Federal Reserve may find itself in next month.
More on that below. In my column today I look at the tumult of the last few days that has seen the worlds of U.S. politics, policy, and company earnings collide, exposing the big divergences that run through the country's equity and bond markets.
If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today.
1. Trump rules out Bessent for Fed chair 2. Easy to lose, hard to restore: US data trust on the line 3. EU still expects turbulence in trade relations with US 4. Markets struggle to price smoke and mirrors: Mike Dolan 5. Brazil's economy ready to ride out Trump's 50% tariff
Today's Key Market Moves
* FX: Dollar index is flat. The yen is the big mover inG10 FX, slipping around 0.3% vs dollar and euro. * STOCKS: S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow fall, Russell 2000rises. Benchmark Asian, Chinese, European, emerging indexes allrise. * SHARES/SECTORS: Seven S&P 500 sectors fall, led byutilities -1%; materials index +0.8%. Palantir shares +7.8%. * BONDS: U.S. yields creep higher, up 4 bps at the shortend, flattening the curve. 3-year auction is on the weak side. * COMMODITIES: Oil falls 1.7%, Brent crude futures hit afive-week low of $67.52/bbl. WTI nudges $65/bbl.
Stagflation-ISM
The stagflation red flags raised by U.S. service sector activity figures on Tuesday are a reminder that the world's largest economy and most important central bank face significant challenges in the months ahead.
Investors took their cue more from the bubbling price pressures in the ISM services report than the signs of softening activity. Treasury yields crept up and rate cut expectations were trimmed as a result.
Still, it's a curious one. Wall Street's slump on Friday went hand in glove with plunging yields and a dramatic surge in rate cut bets. Today, a hawkish tilt in the bond and rates futures markets was accompanied by a broad-based equity selloff.
There are other factors at play, not least the barrage of Q2 earnings, tariff headlines, and a renewed spike in policy uncertainty. But these moves are a reminder that there can be good and bad reasons driving yields up or down, and that the correlation with stocks can flip from one day to the next.
The ISM report showed service sector activity in June flatlined while the prices paid index rose to its highest in nearly three years. Tariffs, inflation pressures, growth fears are all in the mix.
Contrast this with China's services activity data released on Tuesday, which showed the fastest pace of expansion in July in 14 months.
U.S. corporate earnings have generally been strong. Of the 330 companies in the S&P 500 that had reported through last Friday, 80.6% reported consensus-beating profits, compared with the long-term average of 67.1%, according to LSEG data. But Caterpillar warned on Tuesday that tariffs pose significant challenges and could cost the firm up to $1.5 billion this year.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump told CNBC on Tuesday that he will not nominate Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for a position on the Fed's Board of Governors, thus ruling him out as a candidate for Fed chair. Trump said he will announce Governor Adriana Kugler's replacement ""very shortly.""
Trump also said the U.S. is ""very close"" to a trade deal with China and that he would meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping before the end of the year if an agreement is struck.
Looking ahead to Wednesday, there are two highlights in the Asian calendar for investors to home in on - the latest Chinese trade figures, and an interest rate decision from the Reserve Bank of India.
The RBI is expected to keep its benchmark repo rate on hold at 5.50%. But in light of the steep tariffs recently imposed on Indian exports by the U.S., traders are putting a near one-in-six chance of a rate cut. Likely RBI intervention on Tuesday kept the rupee from hitting new lows through 88.00 per dollar.
China's trade figures, meanwhile, will be closely watched after official U.S. data on Tuesday showed America's trade deficit with its Asian rival shrank in June to its lowest in more than 21 years. In light of the contrasting PMI figures on Tuesday, this will be worth keeping an eye on.
Navigating US markets' split personalities
During an extraordinary few days when the worlds of U.S. politics, policy, economics and company earnings collided, the divergences that run through the country's equity and bond markets have come into sharp relief.
For the bond market, the split separates short-dated Treasuries that price off the Fed's policy rate and longer maturities that are more sensitive to U.S. debt and deficit concerns.
For the benchmark S&P 500, that line is between the 'Magnificent Seven', along with a few other tech and artificial intelligence-focused megacaps, and everyone else.
These types of divides have always existed to some extent, but they have become more apparent this year given the historic concentration on Wall Street and rapid deterioration in the U.S. fiscal outlook.
The dramatic moves in U.S. assets over the last few days serve as a microcosm of these deeper divergences.
LONG AND SHORT OF IT
The split in the bond market burst open on Friday.
Triggered by surprisingly weak jobs figures and Trump's shock decision to fire a senior official in the agency responsible for collecting the data, the two-year Treasury yield plunged 25 basis points and the 2s/30s yield curve steepened by 20 basis points. These were the biggest moves in one year and two and a half years, respectively.
The slump in yields, especially at the short end of the curve, indicates that investors' supposed concerns about fiscal indiscipline quickly evaporate as soon as growth-sapping cracks in the labor market appear. So much for the bond vigilantes.
Tellingly, there was no pullback on Monday. Indeed, Treasury prices climbed even higher, pushing the two-year yield as low as 3.66%, its nadir since May.
Long-dated yields have declined too, but not as aggressively, resulting in Friday's dramatic steepening of the 2s/30s curve to levels that, with the exception of April's brief tariff tantrum, haven't been seen for more than three years.
Investors may wince at the size of the federal debt and the Treasury's funding needs but still want to load up on two-year bonds when they think rate cuts are coming. This parallel thinking isn't new, but the stark difference in the narratives driving the front and back ends of the curve is notable.
STAY NIMBLE
The U.S. equity market concentration story is familiar to everyone by now, but the last few days underscore how jaw-dropping - and seemingly entrenched - it is.
Blockbuster earnings reports from 'Mag 7' constituents Meta, Microsoft and Apple juiced another wave of outperformance in Big Tech stocks, reviving debate about concentration risk, bubbles and the long-term benefits of AI.
By some measures, a few Big Tech firms now account for as much as 40% of the total U.S. stock market cap. Tech is more expensive relative to the broader S&P 500 index than ever, even compared to the dotcom bubble, according to Bank of America.
Wall Street's average valuations and earnings growth are therefore increasingly being driven by Big Tech. Strip out the top 10 firms, and the rump S&P 490 has barely registered any earnings growth in the last three years, according to SocGen's Andrew Lapthorne.
Again, there are multiple narratives at work here. It may be true that overseas investors want to reduce their U.S. equity exposure, but don't want to miss out on the Big Tech boom. So even if foreign investors start shedding some U.S. assets – and that's debatable – they aren't apt to be jettisoning the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft.
This is a delicate juncture for investors. Wall Street is at record highs, but concentration risk has also rarely been higher. The outlook for long-dated bonds is worrying given current fiscal and inflation dynamics, yet the short end looks much more attractive, though even that is complicated by the economic and unique political pressures bearing down on the Fed.
The divergences in U.S. markets may narrow, gradually or suddenly, or they may continue unabated for some time. Without a crystal ball, it's tough to know exactly what the catalyst for mean reversion would be.
One thing is likely guaranteed though: in this environment, it will pay to be nimble.

Shares of Peloton gained 6% in early trading.
The connected fitness company, known for its stationary bikes and treadmills, posted net income of $21.6 million, compared with a loss of $30.5 million in the year-earlier period. That's thanks to better-than-expected sales but also, Peloton's efforts to cut its operating expenses, which Stern said in a letter to shareholders remain too high.
In fiscal 2026, which began in July, the company plans to reduce run-rate expenses by another $100 million, on top of the $200 million it cut in fiscal 2025. Half of those cuts will come from indirect costs, like renegotiating contracts with suppliers, but the other half will come from trimming 6% of its staff, the company said.
""Our operating expenses remain too high, which hinders our ability to invest in our future,"" Stern wrote in the letter to shareholders. ""We are launching a cost restructuring plan intended to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of FY26 by reducing the size of our global team, paring back indirect spend, and relocating some of our work. This is not a decision we came to lightly, as it impacts many talented team members, but we believe it is necessary for the long-term health of our business.""
The latest round of layoffs comes just over a year after the company announced plans to cut 15% of its staff.
For the most recent quarter, Peloton beat Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the company did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:
- Earnings per share: 5 cents vs. a loss of 6 cents expected
- Revenue: $607 million vs. $580 million expected
The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended June 30 was $21.6 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of $30.5 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier.
Sales dropped to $607 million, down about 6% from a year earlier.
Ever since its pandemic heyday, Peloton has been working to cut costs, stabilize its business and generate free cash flow to ensure the company can survive. Eight months into Stern's tenure as Peloton's latest top executive, those efforts are starting to bear fruit.
For the full year, the company generated $320 million in free cash flow, ahead of its own internal expectations, and its guidance implies a path to revenue growth in the back half of the year. Overall, operating expenses were down 25% in fiscal 2025, with meaningful cuts to sales and marketing as well as research and development, metrics investors and analysts have long said were too high for the size of Peloton's business.
For the fiscal fourth quarter, operating expenses were down 20% compared with the same quarter a year prior, led by a 28% decline in sales and marketing expenses, a 20% drop in research and development costs, and a 33% decline in general and administrative costs.
Peloton has also made strides in reducing its debt, which it restructured last year to stave off an imminent liquidity crunch. In fiscal 2025, its net debt declined 43%, or by $343 million, compared with the year-earlier period, bringing net debt to $459 million when cash and cash equivalents are subtracted from its total debt of about $1.5 billion.
Road to profitability
For Peloton's current quarter, it's expecting sales to be between $525 million and $545 million, weaker than the $560 million that analysts had forecast, according to LSEG. However, for the full year, it's expecting sales of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, in line with expectations of $2.41 billion, according to LSEG.
The current quarter is forecast to be worse than expected, largely because it falls during the summer months when people tend to pause their subscriptions and pull back on new workout gear. But the remainder of the year implies improving sales patterns in the quarters ahead.
During the most recent quarter, Peloton sold more bikes and treadmills than Wall Street expected, posting connected fitness revenue of $198.6 million, well ahead of the $170.3 million analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Subscription revenue came in a bit light at $408.3 million, behind forecasts of $411 million, according to StreetAccount.
Improving top-line metrics, which allows Peloton to better leverage its fixed costs, led to a 5.6 percentage point increase to its gross margin, which was 54.1% during the quarter, compared with 48.5% in the year ago period.
Notably, its hardware segment, which has long been a drain on Peloton's performance, is steadily getting more profitable. Peloton's gross margin for hardware was 17.3%, a 9 percentage point increase from the year-ago period, driven by a shift toward more profitable products and decreases in service and repair, warehousing and transportation costs.
The company's subscription gross margin grew by 3.7 percentage points to 71.9% but was helped by a one-time balance sheet adjustment related to music royalties costs. Excluding that benefit, subscription gross margin would have been 69.2%.
The gains that Peloton has made in improving its profits are expected to continue, but will be hampered by new 50% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on products made with aluminum, as well as other duties that touch parts of the company's supply chain. Peloton is expecting tariffs to impact free cash flow by $65 million in the year ahead and as a result, is expecting to generate $200 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2026, below what it achieved in fiscal 2025.
In Stern's letter to shareholders, there were no explicit plans to raise prices on subscriptions or hardware, but he said the company will rework its use of promotions and ""adjust prices"" to reflect its high costs.
""For example, we will introduce optional expert assembly fees to reflect the real costs of installing our equipment, while extending free self-install to include our Tread and Row, thereby preserving Member choice and control,"" Stern wrote.
Now that cash flow and some metrics are starting to stabilize, Stern is ready to talk about growth and outlined his vision to get there in his letter to shareholders. To offset the high costs of acquiring customers online, Peloton is returning to physical retail but this time, it'll open up micro-stores, rather than the sprawling showrooms it had in its early days. In fiscal 2025, it closed 24 retail showrooms, reducing its footprint of larger stores from 37 to 13 by the end of the fourth quarter.
Peloton plans to expand its micro-stores, from a count of one to 10, as well as grow its secondary marketplace for preowned hardware, Stern said. It also plans to boost the presence of its instructors at in-person events by three times this year, with the goal of increasing it by 10 times in fiscal 2027, he added.
Peloton also intends to expand further beyond the bike.
""We plan to support our members' wellness journey by expanding our offerings and strength where we are already a category leader, mental wellbeing, sleep, recovery, and over time, nutrition and hydration,"" Stern said on Thursday's earnings call. ""We will employ advanced technologies like AI to enhance our ability to serve as personalized coaches.""
Stern said the company will also work more closely with Precor, the fitness company it acquired under founder John Foley, by creating a ""unified commercial business unit."" He also said the company will start building a plan to expand internationally – a goal that Peloton has long had but has failed to execute profitably.
""Internationally, we plan to deliver local, in-language experiences using a mix of native instruction, AI dubbing, and more flexible approaches to music for thousands of classes,"" Stern wrote. ""Through partnerships, we aim to introduce the Peloton brand and experiences to millions of people around the world. Together, we believe these actions lay the groundwork for future, cost-effective launches of the full Peloton offering in new geographies.""",4288cec948481d5e2ef6626f59c7ffef,trafilatura,8156,0

Warren Buffett may be worth billions, but he had a stark reminder he sent every two years in a memo to his managers: reputation and planning for the future should take precedent over profit. It’s a lesson that’s worked wonders for Buffett as he’s led Berkshire Hathaway from a company with roots dating to the 1800s—to a trillion-dollar enterprise today.
Warren Buffett is widely considered one of the smartest minds in business—after all, he’s spent decades maintaining Berkshire Hathaway as a multinational investment powerhouse.
Even though he may seem like an easy-going, Coca-Cola-loving old man, he admits his leadership style can sometimes be “ruthless.” In fact, the billionaire sent a stark reminder to his managers every two years of his nonnegotiables, which include “to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation,” something he believes is the foundation of the entire enterprise.
“We can afford to lose money—even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation—even a shred of reputation,” the 94-year-old recalled in a social media post that’s currently recirculating, just months before he’s due to leave the company he’s led for 60 years.
Since taking over what was once a struggling textile firm in 1965, the well-known investor, worth $152 billion, has turned Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest businesses in the U.S. Under his leadership, Berkshire hit a market cap of $1 trillion this year. But from January 2026, Berkshire will no longer be under Buffett’s leadership; instead, the memo will serve as a reminder that its future reputation lies in the hands of the staff.
“We must continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have written about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly, but intelligent, reporter.”
Safeguarding reputation has been an ongoing theme in Buffett’s history—in a 2010 shareholder letter, he revealed that he’d sent that exact same reputation reminder note to staff for over 25 years and counting.
Famously, in 1991, while addressing members of Congress as the investment bank Salomon Brothers’ chairman, Buffett delivered this message to his employees: “Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.”
That sentiment was echoed by other business-leading billionaires like Jeff Bezos, who said, “Your brand is what other people say about you when you’re not in the room.”
This May, the legendary investor announced he would be stepping down as CEO by the end of the year, passing the reins to his successor, Greg Abel, after seeing how much he could do in a working day.
And as a succession planning request, Buffett asks that his managers provide a handwritten letter on any future recommendations to take their place, adding that the letter will be seen by no one unless he is no longer CEO.
“I need your help in respect to the question of succession. I’m not looking for any of you to retire, and I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie’s case, 110.)” Charlie Munger, who passed away in November 2023 at the age of 99, was Buffett’s close friend, trusted partner, and sounding board for over 60 years.
“But just in case you don’t, please send me a note or email giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should become incapacitated overnight,” Buffet wrote.
Going forward, Buffett told the Wall Street Journal he will still be going to the office.
“I’m not going to sit at home and watch soap operas. My interests are still the same.”
To: Berkshire Hathaway Managers (“The All-Stars”)
cc: Berkshire Directors
From: Warren E. Buffett
Date: December 19, 2014
This is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire’s top priority and to get your help on succession planning (yours, not mine!).
The top priority–trumping everything else, including profits–is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation. We can’t be perfect but we can try to be. As I’ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: “We can afford to lose money – even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation – even a shred of reputation.” We must continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have written about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligent reporter.
Sometimes your associates will say “Everybody else is doing it.” This rationale is almost always a bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating a moral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that they can’t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter or a judge and see how far it gets them.
If you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call. However, it’s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it’s too close to the line and should be abandoned. There’s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it’s questionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.
As a corollary, let me know promptly if there’s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news but I don’t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to bad news is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that almost caused the demise of a firm with 8,000 employees.
Somebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we knew of it. That’s inevitable: We now employ more than 330,000 people and the chances of that number getting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect in minimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of impropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most important factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determines how an organization behaves.
In other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you does a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don’t need me to help. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits, acquisitions, and any unusually large capital expenditures. But I like to read, so send along anything that you think I may find interesting.
I need your help in respect to the question of succession. I’m not looking for any of you to retire and I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie’s case, 110.) But just in case you don’t, please send me a letter or email giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should become incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I’m no longer CEO, in which case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses of your primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you have participated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it’s important to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to have your thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a few operations that are run by two or more of you – such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at Applied Underwriters, etc. – and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal,handwritten, etc. Just mark it “Personal for Warren.”
Thanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You make my job easy.

Apple CEO Tim Cook is doing what he can to appease the commander in chief, without making that ultimate concession.
Cook on Wednesday appeared at the White House with Trump to announce plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. Apple didn't announce the made-in-USA iPhone that Trump wants, but Cook got to tout Apple's position on U.S. production.
Some of Apple's most valuable parts, such as its glass and facial recognition sensor, are made by U.S. companies that Apple has worked with for years. Final assembly is only a small, though very critical, part of iPhone production.
""The final assembly that you focus on, that will be elsewhere for a while,"" Cook said Wednesday in the Oval Office.
Trump appeared happy enough, for now.
""He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it,"" Trump said. ""The whole thing is set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time in terms of cost and all, but I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that back.""
Experts said Cook's announcement seemed designed to get Apple out of Trump's crosshairs with respect to tariffs. Trump announced during the public meeting that the administration planned to place a tariff on chips that would double their price, but Apple — which relies on hundreds of different chips for its devices — would be exempt.
""CEOs are realizing that they do have to do something, and what they've discovered is that if they give the president something to brag about without destroying their company, that the problem might go away for a certain amount of time,"" said Peter Cohan, professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at Babson College who has written case studies on Apple.
The gambit worked. Apple stock rose 5% on Wednesday and another 3% on Thursday.
""What Tim Cook demonstrated in the first administration was a real savvy navigation of the treacherous waters,"" said Nancy Tengler, CEO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds a position in Apple. ""I thought this announcement was super-important symbolically, because the president is looking for headlines.""
What Apple announced
The centerpiece of Apple's announcement was the so-called American Manufacturing Program, which Apple said was designed to incentivize other companies to make parts for computers in the U.S.
By Apple committing to purchase parts and expand its relationship with U.S. suppliers, it could give those companies the skills and capacity to expand their business. And it lets Apple take some credit for supporting the 450,000 total jobs at its suppliers.
A closer look at the members of the program shows that Apple is leaning on some of its longest-tenured partners. All together, Apple said that its U.S. suppliers are on track to make 19 billion chips for its products this year. That level of business doesn't appear overnight.
For example, Apple said that all of its cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches would be made by Corning, in Kentucky, and that it would spend $2.5 billion on that effort. It's a powerful symbol — while the phone might be screwed together in China or India, the surface that users touch around the world will be made in the U.S.
But Apple has pointed to Corning as a critical American supplier in the past. The company's glass has been used on the iPhone since its first version in 2007. While Apple typically doesn't let its suppliers talk about their relationships, former COO Jeff Williams hailed Corning's glass in 2017, when it got an ""investment"" from the Apple Advanced Manufacturing Fund. Apple followed that up with a $250 million commitment in 2019, and $45 million in 2021.
Analysts are skeptical that the partnership could substantially improve Corning's revenue. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote on Thursday that Corning ""already produces 100% of the cover glass for Apple's phones and tablets,"" adding that Corning's glass business called Specialty Materials is worth about $2 billion per year.
Apple also highlighted its partnership with Coherent, a longtime supplier of lasers for Apple's facial recognition hardware, which is made in Texas. Morgan Stanley pegged the business at about $100 million per year, and said Apple has options including Lumentum and Sony.
The iPhone maker said it expanded a partnership with Texas Instruments to make chips in Texas and Utah. Texas Instruments has long supplied chips for the iPhone, such as circuits to control USB interfaces or power displays. Apple said it would partner with Samsung, another key supplier of parts like iPhone displays, to launch an ""innovative new technology for making chips,"" without offering additional details.
Apple declared that it will partner directly with companies in the semiconductor chain, even if they typically sell services or goods to Apple suppliers. Other partnerships are with Applied Materials, a tooling company, GlobalFoundries, a chip foundry, and GlobalWafers America, which is supplying Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Texas Instruments with made-in-USA wafers, the starting point for a batch of chips.
GlobalFoundries manufactures chips for Broadcom, which supplies wireless chips for iPhones. Both will work with Apple to develop and manufacture 5G components in the U.S.
Meanwhile, Apple will buy millions of advanced chips made by TSMC in Arizona, where it will be the factory's largest customer. Cook joined former President Joe Biden at the plant in 2022 and committed to buying chips from the factory.
Apple said it would invest in and become a customer at an Arizona Amkor facility, which packages and tests chips, the final stage before installation in a computer.
Apple also said it would expand existing data centers for artificial intelligence in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon. It's highlighted these data centers in the past in spending commitments.
While Apple's announcement sent partner stocks up, JPMorgan Chase analysts warned in a note on Thursday that ""the new and expanded engagements might not be completely incremental to global revenues and outlook.""
Trump had a different take.
""Oh, I love that you're doing this,"" the president said, after reading a list of Apple's commitments.
'Cost of doing business'
Apple has little to worry about when it comes to who will hold the company accountable for its promises. The company doesn't break out U.S. spending, and most of Apple's suppliers are contractually required to keep the information secret. Apple doesn't report how much its new campuses in Austin, Texas, or North Carolina end up costing.
Additionally, the $600 billion headline number likely includes lots of regular expenses.
Apple said in February that its $500 billion commitment included payments to U.S. suppliers, direct employment, data centers for Apple Intelligence and corporate facilities, as well as spending on Apple TV+ productions in 20 states.
Apple started publicly announcing U.S. spending during Trump's first administration in 2018, at a rate of about $70 billion per year. In February, the company committed to $125 billion per year. Wednesday's announcement brings that figure to $150 billion annually.
That's still a fraction of Apple's total spending.
In Apple's fiscal 2024, the company spent $210 billion globally on cost of goods sold, $57.5 billion on operating expenses and $9.45 billion in capital expenditures for nearly $275 billion in global spending during the period.
Teffler said she didn't think the newly announced spending would be material to Apple's profitability, especially since it already has relationships with the various companies such as Corning.
""They're going to spend money somewhere,"" Tegler said.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who previously predicted a made-in-USA iPhone would cost billions to produce and would leave consumers paying $3,500, said the Wednesday announcements indicate a much different approach. He said it's ""the cost of doing business.""",7ab757f341ee2a5b14935fba15e48eb0,trafilatura,8009,0

The entrance of private equity investments — funds that invest in non-publicly traded businesses — into workplace plans is a big win for the world's largest money managers, who stand to profit from expansion of access to an asset class that has historically been available only to wealthy investors.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in particular has been an advocate for opening the doors to private equity, arguing in his most recent annual shareholder letter that ""democratizing"" private markets could provide market-beating long-term returns for American workers.
But while these new investments can offer tantalizing profits, they also pose a major risk for long-term retirement savers, some investor advocates say.
""The objective for the average person is to have a safe, secure retirement plan,"" says Jerry Schlichter, founding partner of Schlichter Bogard, a firm known for lawsuits on behalf of employees over excessive fees in 401(k) plans. ""When you talk about new areas like cryptocurrency or private equity, these are fraught with danger for investors for a variety of reasons.""
To be clear, Schlichter and other financial pros don't deny these assets' potential to make investors money. They just may not be appropriate for everyday investors' retirement accounts, they say.
""It's a square peg in a round hole,"" Schlichter says.
The dangers of nontraditional 401(k) investments
Investing experts generally advise parking your core, long-term portfolio in a diversified mix of assets that have delivered proven, consistent returns over the long-term — decades, at least. Given the stock market's historical upward trajectory, a broad stock market index mutual fund would fit the bill of an appropriate 401(k) investment option, Schlichter says.
Under this framework, the argument against crypto's inclusion in workplace plans is clear. Although certain cryptocurrencies have delivered impressive returns, the asset class hasn't been around long enough to have proven itself as a safe option for investors.
""There's no long-term performance history for cryptocurrency, and the short- to intermediate-term has been all over the place,"" says Schlichter. ""This is not the kind of investment that people want and deserve when they need to have something that's protected for their years in retirement.""
The case against private equity is a little more complicated. As the name implies, private equity funds invest in a manner similar to mutual funds, but instead of holding shares in publicly-traded companies, they hold stakes in firms that aren't yet on the market.
It's not hard to imagine how investors in such funds can earn impressive returns. Just think how well you could have done if you owned a piece of Tesla or Nvidia before the firms went public.
For now, investment in such funds is typically reserved for accredited investors — generally those with annual incomes above $200,000 or a net worth north of $1 million.
The argument from Fink and others is that opening 401(k) plans to these investments would allow everyday investors to get in on the same return potential that the only the wealthy currently enjoy. Fink says in his letter that pension funds, many of which invest in private equity, tend to outperform 401(k)s, but experts debate whether private funds actually outperform market indexes on a long-term basis.
""There's nothing wrong with [nontraditional 401(k) investments], but you have to know what you own,"" says Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""What is it that you're buying? What are your expectations for this investment? And if it goes through a slump, what are you going to do then?""
For regular investors, who may not be familiar with how private equity works, there are a few key pitfalls to consider before buying.
They're expensive
An investment's fees eat into the returns you earn from it. And while private equity advocates argue that their returns are worth it, these funds have a very high hurdle to clear. Under one popular model, a private equity fund may charge a 2% annual fee, plus 20% of the fund's profits over a certain threshold.
Compare that with an index fund, which mirrors the return of the market while charging fractions of a percent in fees. ""They're almost free these days,"" says Schlichter.
They're illiquid
Say you want to pull money out of your 401(k) plan. If you own a stock or bond fund, that's generally an easy ask. Stocks or bonds that you ostensibly own are sold and you get your cash.
That's not so easy with private equity, which often has set holding periods and limits on how much investors can redeem.
""If there's a desire to pull out of private equity, there isn't a way to actually sell that company or sell shares — there's just no market for it,"" says Charles Rotblut, vice president of the American Association of Individual Investors.
That could mean that owners of private equity funds in 401(k)s could have trouble selling shares quickly, either to raise cash or to buy another investment. Or, Schlichter posits, such funds could choose to keep some cash on hand for redemptions, instead of investing it, which could dampen returns.
They're tough to understand
Private equity funds aren't as heavily regulated as exchange-traded funds and mutual funds and are therefore generally less transparent about their investment strategies.
That may leave everyday investors at sea as they try to understand complex strategies, which may include investing with leverage, trading derivatives or taking highly concentrated positions in private companies.
None of that is to say that, over a period of decades, a particular private equity fund won't outperform the market. But when it comes to your 401(k), the message is simple, says Schlichter: ""If you don't understand the investment, you shouldn't depend on it for your retirement assets.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-listed-crypto-taking-off-192903195.html,382de9bc6f75d82067c0312aa27ece90,This Coinbase - Listed Crypto Is Taking Off With a Little Help From Ethereum : Analysis,This Coinbase - Listed Crypto Is Taking Off With a Little Help From Ethereum : Analysis,2025-08-07 07:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"The cryptocurrency market is catching its breath after Monday's exuberance, with the market as a whole sliding 1.38% to $3.7 trillion on Tuesday. The crypto market saw broad gains over the past 24 hours, led by Ethereum layer-2 tokens which posted solid gains throughout the day. But today’s charts tell a different story as traders apparently lock in profits.
Still, there’s at least one token bucking the trend: Mantle, which trades as MNT on Coinbase and other exchanges, is up 8% today and nearly 25% over the last week. MNT is the native token of the Mantle network, previously known as BitDAO, a layer-2 Ethereum scaling network. But besides offering a platform for DeFi, Mantle recently began styling itself as a “Web3 Ethereum treasury,” boasting a $364 million ETH stash per listings on Strategic ETH Reserve.
Bullishness among investors chasing the crypto treasury trend may be playing into Mantle’s recent price gains.
Mantle stands out as today's contrarian play as easily the top gainer in the top 100 coins by market cap, despite broader market weakness.
Trading at $0.9389, MNT is up nearly more than 8% today and 24% in the weekly candlestick charts.
The technical setup for Mantle is decidedly bullish. The Average Directional Index, or ADX, at 33 confirms a strong trending environment. ADX measures trend strength regardless of direction on scale from 0 to 100, and crossing well above 25 separates choppy markets from trending ones.
For traders, this reading suggests the recent momentum isn't just noise but represents genuine directional conviction. When ADX readings sustain above 30, it often indicates a trend with staying power.
The Relative Strength Index, RSI, for Mantle is at 69, which means it’s approaching but hasn't yet reached overbought territory above 70. RSI functions as a thermometer to gauge how hot a market might be. Historical data shows many altcoins can sustain RSI readings between 65-75 for extended periods during bull runs, suggesting MNT could have more room to run before needing a breather.
The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows markets are in a bullish momentum phase with a price compression period after a major spike. Given MNT's position above key support levels and the bullish momentum readings, the bias requires analysis alongside other indicators to be accurate.
The price direction shows traders are attempting to switch momentum from bearish to bullish. The gap between the long term average prices and the short term average prices is narrowing, hinting at a possible golden cross in the near future. If this happens, traders may have yet another confirmation of a bullish momentum instead of a simple correction or a FOMO-driven brief price spike.
What's driving this outperformance? Besides pure price action, the project’s move toward establishing itself as a “Web3 Ethereum treasury” is likely helping.
Mantle said in an X post last week that it’s now the largest ETH treasury among Web3 entities—that is to say, blockchain-native projects unlike publicly traded companies like SharpLink or BitMine, which lead the list among Ethereum treasuries as a whole.
What it amounts to is a signal to MNT investors that MNT is backed, in a sense, by an ostensibly less volatile asset in ETH.
Also, MNT’s listing on Coinbase back in May coincided with a surge in interest in the coin. The “Coinbase Effect” as it relates to token listings is not nearly as pronounced as it has been in the past, but it’s still something. After all, Coinbase remains the most popular crypto exchange in the United States.
The recent launch of UR, a neobank that runs entirely on the Mantle network and the first of its kind to help users spend, save, and invest across fiat and crypto finances in one unified account, represents a notable milestone. With beta testing concluding on August 8, the market seems to be ready for a full rollout.
Key Levels:
Immediate support: $0.82 (breakout level from multi-month resistance)
Strong resistance: $1.30 (next major technical target)
Ethereum (ETH): A technical crossroads
Of course, Mantle would be nothing without Ethereum, which is itself taking investors for a ride.
Ethereum currently trades at $3,583.3, showing signs of consolidation after recent volatility. The technical picture reveals a market at an inflection point, with longer-term indicators trending bullish and shorter-term indicators turning bearish.
Ethereum’s ADX is at 39, which traders would interpret as decidedly bullish. It says the trend has room to keep up direction in the medium term. Anything above 40 on the ADX is serious momentum. At 39, Ethereum's trend strength is robust, and traders interpret this as confirmation that the current move has strong momentum behind it. But it's also approaching levels where some consolidation might be in order.
Of course, there will be ups and there will be downs, but if we’re zooming out, the overall direction of the movement is pretty clear.
The RSI for ETH sits at 55, placing ETH in neutral territory. It suggests traders are not as hyped as the trend strength suggests. RSI readings above 70 signal overbought conditions and below 30 indicate oversold levels. At 55, this suggests Ethereum has room to move in either direction without triggering automatic selling or buying from algorithmic trading setups.
This neutral reading combined with a strong ADX may indicate the market is digesting gains rather than showing exhaustion and heading to a new winter. We’re not there—yet.
The Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs, also tell a bullish story for swing traders. The average price of ETH over the last 200 days is well below the average price over the last 50 days. That’s a bullish signal for most traders.
Moving averages help traders identify trend direction: when shorter-term averages (like the 50-day) trade above longer-term ones (like the 200-day), it shows sustained buying pressure across multiple timeframes.
Particularly significant is the Squeeze Momentum Indicator showing an “on” status. This indicator identifies periods when volatility compresses (the squeeze) before explosive moves. When it fires ""on,"" it signals that a breakout from consolidation is underway. Combined with the strong ADX reading, this suggests traders should prepare for increased volatility.
The coin is also correcting after decisively breaking past the bullish channel that kept its gains going up but under a certain control. This seems to be the first time that resistance is testing its new configuration as a price support.
Key Levels:
Immediate support: $3,400 (psychological level)
Strong support: $3,200 (EMA50 resistance zone)
Immediate resistance: $3,800 (recent rejection area and major Fibonacci level)",60731393d31d8b0319a83d0635dc6f2f,trafilatura,6720,0

The President of Switzerland is leaving Washington without a tariff deal, just hours after arriving in the country with a 'more attractive' offer.
OpenAI announced that U.S. Federal Agencies will have access to their 'frontier models' through their Enterprise product for $1 this year.
Facebook parent Meta is adding reposts to Instagram, per an announcement made this afternoon.
And as for the movers, here are five stocks owning the headlines this afternoon:
Apple
The consumer tech giant Apple (AAPL) is nearly 6% higher intraday after announcing it would add $100 billion to its U.S. manufacturing bill. The news is set to be toted at a White House event this afternoon. Apple's next iPhone event is also reported to be due for early September.
Viasat
Satellite company Viasat (VSAT) hit a 52-week high after its revenues rose less than 1%. Its net loss nearly doubled year-over-year. However, investors were excited by the faster growth from the company's Defense and Advanced Technologies division.
Dave
Neobank Dave (DAVE) extended its month-long losses on Wednesday, falling 21% in spite of a strong earnings showing. The company's revenue rose 64% and the company raised its guidance for the year.
Upstart Holdings
Lending platform Upstart (UPST) is down 17% today despite a strong earnings showing, which was topped off by a rise in auto loans and small dollar value loans.
Vivid Seats
Vivid Seats (SEAT) saw its revenue fall 28% year-over-year, missing expectations. At the same time, its net loss grew to $263.3 million, a 21,000 increase YoY (yes, seriously), which came as the company took an impairment on an acquisition.
It's today's best-performing stock, though, as the company was bumped by speculators piling in after the company's recent 1-for-20 reverse split. The company also announced plans to save $25 million per year.

A.M. Movers: Astera, Shopify, Snap, Super Micro, Six Flags
30 minutes into trading, here are the top stories:
President Donald Trump just signed an executive order to impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports as a penalty for purchasing Russian oil. The company's tariff rate is now 50%.
Apple CEO Tim Cook visited the White House to celebrate a new plan to invest another $100 on domestic manufacturing.
California's Gifford Fire is now at 83,000 acres, making it one of the largest U.S. wildfires of 2025.
However, this morning's big movers have nothing to do with the White House. Instead, a.m. seem to be in their own lane.
Astera Labs
Chipmaker Astera Labs (ALAB), which makes connectivity chips, is up 30% to start the day after its aftermarket earnings on Tuesday showed fantastic results. At this point, that makes it far away the market's best performer to start the day. Sales grew 150% year over year, while earnings grew 238%. The company's guidance also excited investors.
Snap
Social media app Snap (SNAP) disappointed investors in second-quarter earnings report, with net losses continuing to overshadow the company's single-digit revenue growth.
Shopify
Ecommerce software company Shopify (SHOP) soared over 20%, thanks to still-strong marketplace growth. The company's sales grew 31% year over year, which was even faster than this time last year.
Super Micro
The once-beleaguered chipmaker Super Micro (SMCI) is also making headlines again today. After skirting out of being delisted from the Nasdaq earlier this year, the company fell after revenue growth and margins failed to impress. Other chipmakers have been similarly-situated as the AI data boom has been seen slowing.
Six Flags Entertainment
Can nostalgia sell? Apparently, not very well if you're Six Flags (SIX) . The company's stock sank 24% after its latest quarterly report showed disappointing earnings and declining visitors thanks to poor weather conditions. The firm announced that CEO Richard Zimmerman would also depart the company after a decades-long career.

Analysts are warning that the higher tariffs risk substantially diminishing the allure of Indian exports to the U.S., compared to regional peers.
""India's attractiveness as an emerging manufacturing hub will be hugely undermined,"" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a note when the duties were announced. He estimates that U.S. spending drives around 2% of India's GDP and the extra 25% tariff is ""large enough to have a material impact.""
India counts the U.S. as its single largest export partner. Its total goods' exports reached about $434 billion in the year ended March 2025, and nearly 20%, or $86.51 billion worth of goods were shipped to the U.S., according to the latest official data.
The resulting drop in exports due to tariffs would mean the economy grows by closer to 6% this year and next, rather than the 7% growth forecast prior to Trump's announcement, Shah said.
The 50% tariff on Indian products could lead to a 0.6 percentage point hit to the country's GDP, according to Goldman Sachs' estimates.
India's major exports to the U.S. are engineering and electronic goods, drugs and pharmaceuticals, gems and jewelry, according to the government data.
With notable variance across industries and lack of clarity over Trump's plans with sector-specific tariffs, here are segments that potentially stand to lose the most based on their exposure to the U.S. market:
Engineering goods
Engineering goods, including products like auto parts, power equipment and industrial machinery, have been India's biggest exports to the U.S. and globally, hitting nearly $117 billion in the year ended March.
Around 19.16 billion worth of these industrial goods, or about 16%, were sold to the U.S. over that period.
Exports of iron, steel, and other products exports accounted for 17.07% of the total engineering exports, while non-ferrous metals and products exports contributed 10.52%. Steel exports already face 50% sectoral tariffs, worsening the outlook for the sector as the same levy now looms large on other engineering goods.
India's total exports jumped 1.92% in June, in part driven by the rise in engineering goods, which rose 1.35% to $9.5 billion.
Gems, jewelry, textiles and apparels
The gems and jewelry, and textiles and apparels sectors, are also expected to be significantly jolted by the sudden hike in U.S. tariffs.
The gems and jewelry sector contributes 7% of India's GDP and employs about 5 million workers, according to a July report by a state-backed industry body.
About 33% of India's gems and jewelry exports went to the U.S. in fiscal year 2025.
Rajesh Mehta, executive chairman of Indian jewelry maker Rajesh Exports, said in an interview with CNBC earlier this month that higher tariffs will be an ""additional burden,"" while calling for government support for the sector.
Textiles is among the most labor-intensive sectors in India, directly employing about 45 million workers across the country. Similar to gems and jewelry, around 34% of textile exports went to the U.S. in the last fiscal year.
""Without a doubt, the new tariff rate is going to seriously test the resolve and resilience of India's textile and apparel exporters as we will not enjoy a significant duty differential advantage vis-à-vis many other countries, except Bangladesh, with whom we compete for a larger share of the US market,"" the Confederation of Indian textile industry said in a statement dated July 30, before the latest hike in duties was announced.
Electronics
India's electronics sector relied on the U.S. for 38% of its exports last fiscal year, making it ""the most exposed"" to potential risks of the tariff exemptions being rolled back, according to Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. Currently, several electronic goods are exempt from tariffs.
India overtook China to become the top exporter of smartphones sold in the U.S. in the second quarter, after Apple accelerated to move its assembly of more iPhones to the South Asian nation.
In a major, although temporary, reprieve for companies such as Apple, Trump in April announced to exempt smartphones, computers and other electronic goods from tariffs.
India's U.S.-bound exports of electronic goods have accelerated this year, and its exports in March alone more than doubled to $2.76 billion from a year earlier.
Pharmaceuticals
While the pharmaceutical sector is also currently exempt from tariffs, Trump has threatened duties on pharma exports to the U.S. In an interview to CNBC Trump said he would initially impose a ""small tariff"" on pharma, and then raise that rate to as high as 250% in a few years.
India's pharma sector has a high dependency on U.S. buyers, with its drugs and pharma exports to the U.S. reaching over $10.5 billion for the year ended March 2025, accounting for nearly 35% of the category's total shipments, according to the official data.
""[India's] Chemicals overall have somewhat less US exposure but this masks the high pharmaceutical sector's US dependency therein,"" said Hermann, leaving the pharma sector highly vulnerable to Trump's potential tariffs.
India also exported steel and aluminum to the United States, but trade in those goods is taxed through a separate executive order.
Overall competitiveness
""The U.S. could more easily source for supplies from alternative import locations, but it is much harder for India to diversify away from the U.S. across different sectors,"" said Michael Wan, senior economist at MUFG Bank.
India competes against the likes of Europe in pharmaceuticals; Vietnam and Mexico in electronics; Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam in textiles; and Israel in gems and jewelry, according to Wan. ""If these tariff differentials stick, India's export competitiveness will likely be eroded over time,"" he said.
Among the export-reliant nations that have clinched preliminary deals with Trump, Vietnam saw its tariffs lowered to 20% from 46%. In his latest tariff adjustment, Trump also eased tariffs on Thailand to 19% from the ""reciprocal"" tariff level of 36%, Bangladesh to 20% from 35% and Cambodia to 19% from 36%.

The event was held at the historic Episcopal High School in Alexandria, just outside Washington, D.C. The championship became the global center of youth chess and brought together school teams from 50 countries, offering a week of competition, dialogue, and shared ideas about the future of chess in education.
The chess tournament
It was held from August 3 to 6 and culminated in strong performances from all participants. The winning teams are:
1st Place - Velammal MHS School, India
2nd Place - National School of Physics and Mathematics, Kazakhstan
3rd Place - The Harker School, United State
The championship was organized by the International School Chess Federation (ISCF) under the auspices of FIDE, and sponsored by Freedom Holding Corp. and its CEO Timur Turlov, who is also the head of ISCF.
Smart Moves Summit
In parallel with the championship, the Smart Moves Summit (August 4-5) featured speakers from the worlds of education, sports, and technology, as well as grand chess masters.
On the first day, sessions explored how chess supports academic success and personal growth in school-age children. The second day focused on practical strategies for integrating chess into national curricula, with input from educators and government officials.
Timur Turlov, CEO of Freedom Holding Corp. and President of the International School Chess Federation, used the summit to advocate for systemic change:
""A chessboard is a very good test for all of us and it's also very good training. We launched this initiative of chess at school in Kazakhstan and actually already implemented this program in more than 500 schools all around the country and expect to roll out another 700 schools next year. We believe that maybe this could be one of the solutions that can help our kids to better adapt to this fast-moving world. Because the world will continue to change, and the speed of these changes will continue to accelerate.""
Timur Turlov, the driving force behind this event and the sponsor of numerous chess championships around the world, organized several world championships. For example, last year Freedom Holding Corp. brought high-level events like the Chess and Finance Conference Wall Street Gambit at last year's FIDE World Rapid & Blitz Championship in NYC. The championship in Alexandria became yet another step toward Turlov's goal to integrate chess into children's lives and connect young players from different cultures to collaborate.
Arkady Dvorkovich, president of FIDE, praised the initiative, noting:
""When I think about the events which took place over the past few days, I feel a profound sense of hope. Thanks to the initiative and generous support of Timur Turlov and Freedom Holding, we have started a new chapter for chess. This project is about more than just games - it's about making chess a fundamental part of education for every child and young person.""
Congressman Jamie Raskin (Maryland) gave a speech on the first day of the summit, thanked Arkady Dvorkovich and Timur Turlov, and emphasized the role of chess in non-violent conflict resolution.
""I think that chess can be a major part of the solution to the problems that beset humanity right now. And I think that chess can play a critical role in making sure that we make the right choices in favor of critical thinking, in favor of strategic planning, in favor of nonviolent and diplomatic resolution,"" said Mr. Raskin.
Speaker sessions
Notable speakers from around the globe gave talks on different topics of their specialization.
FIDE Deputy Chair Dana Reizniece, the President of the International School Chess Federation Timur Turlov, Dr. Bill Poucher, Steinar Sæthre, Omoboye Odu, and other professionals associated with chess gave speeches on the importance of integrating chess into the school curriculum.
Jerry Nash, Mauricio Arias Santana, Rita Atkins, and Fernando Moreno discussed how early exposure to chess fosters critical executive functioning, emotional regulation, mathematical skills, and social learning - particularly in inclusive and multilingual classroom environments.
Leontxo García, Jennifer Shahade, and Priyadharshan Kannappan addressed how chess can serve as a powerful tool for promoting equality across gender, socio-economic status, and geography. Leontxo García also moderated a session on building effective public-private partnerships, where Arpine Lpetyan, Jacob-Askham Christensen, and Steinar Sæthre discussed how well-designed learning methodologies aligned with national education goals can support impactful collaborations between chess organizations and government institutions. Jeremy Kane, Dr. Kenneth Regan, and Ella Papanek spoke on the topic of the role of educational technology in chess learning.
During the second day of the summit, there were several TED Talk-style conferences featuring Jenny Ingber, Rochelle Ballantyne, Kwadwo Acheampong, Robert Katende, and other distinguished speakers. The session highlighted how chess education is driving intellectual and social development among low-income youth, offering powerful tools for critical thinking, resilience, and opportunity.
A high-profile panel discussion followed, bringing together Viktor Bologan, Ilya Merenzon, Jon Kristian Haarr, Lidiya Perovskaya, and other contributors to the chess community focused on how strategic sponsorships and marketing initiatives can accelerate the growth of school chess programs while delivering tangible value to corporate and community partners.
In a compelling dialogue moderated by Elliott Neff, experts including Michal Kanarkiewicz, Daniel Weissbarth, Jacob Kristensen, and Priyadharshan Kannappan explored the intersection of pedagogy, strategic thinking, and entrepreneurship in scholastic chess.
2025 FIDE World Schools Team Championship & Smart Moves Summit is more than just a competition. The event served as a powerful example of how chess can open educational pathways, develop critical thinking, and foster cross-cultural understanding. Freedom Holding Corp. is very grateful for all the support from media outlets, journalists, and bloggers that helped us grow this event's reach to a broader audience. Together, we can make chess a universal game, accessible to as many children around the world as possible.",515e1f7fee7fb9f3fbc12aa22573060f,trafilatura,6474,0

Are the rewards worth the risk ? ,Private equity is coming to your 401 ( k ). Are the rewards worth the risk ? ,2025-08-07 07:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"In the past, the private equity world has been largely populated by ultra-rich investors, endowments and pension funds. That may be about to change.
Retirement savers with 401(k) accounts are gaining access to the private investment market, which mostly pivots on privately held companies, rather than public ones.
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, announced in June that it will offer a 401(k) target-date retirement fund that includes private investments, with a launch date in 2026. Another retirement giant, Empower, said in May that it will offer private investments in some workplace accounts later this year. Other retirement plan providers have made similar moves.
And the Trump Administration is expected to sign an executive order soon that would call for federal guidance on adding private investments to 401(k) plans, a move first reported in the Wall Street Journal.
Firms that invest in private assets are pushing to gain access to 401(k)s and other “defined-contribution” workplace retirement plans, a $12 trillion market.
Private equity firms raise money to buy, manage and sell companies for profit. Investors are typically very wealthy individuals or institutions. The private credit marketplace loans money to companies or individuals outside the banking and fixed-income industries.
Regular retirement savers haven’t had much access to private investments in the past. The minimum investment in a private equity fund might be in the millions, or at least the hundreds of thousands, according to Investopedia. Your money might be tied up for years.
Here's why wealthy investors like private equity
But there’s a reason wealthy investors and endowment managers like private equity funds.
In recent decades, “They actually have done better than the stock market by 1 to 2 percentage points,” said Robert Brokamp, a senior adviser at The Motley Fool.
Private equity yielded average annual returns of 10.5% from 2000 through 2020, Investopedia reports. Other estimates range higher. Private equity is considered a high-risk, high-return alternative to the stock market, which, of course, carries its own risks.
“Why do wealthy people like it? Because it has the highest upside,” said Keith Singer, a certified financial planner in Boca Raton, Florida.
Along with the upside comes a steep downside.
Private companies face fewer regulations and reporting requirements than public ones. It can be hard to divine how much money a private company earns.
“These are private companies, and with that comes less transparency,” Brokamp said. “That’s part of the reason people stay private: They don’t want to do all the regulatory filings that come with going public.”
The number of public companies has dropped “by about half” since the mid-1990s, Brokamp said. Private companies tend to stay private longer and do public stock offerings later.
Stocks are risky. Private equity can be riskier.
Stocks carry risk, but a retirement saver who puts money in an S&P 500 index fund is “investing in some pretty well-established companies,” Brokamp said.
Private equity, by contrast, often involves companies in distress. Bankruptcies run higher.
“Private equity is riskier than public equity,” said Caleb Silver, editor in chief of Investopedia. “It’s more speculative in nature because you are investing in companies that, in some cases, have no proven track record.”
Given the risk, Silver suggests an everyday retirement saver should not invest “more than 10% of your portfolio” in private investments: “It’s simply too risky.”
Some of the emerging 401(k) offerings seem tailored to manage that risk. BlackRock, for example, plans to offer private investments within a broader target-date retirement fund.
Target-date funds generally offer a mix of stocks, bonds and other investments, with the mix growing more conservative as you approach retirement. The new BlackRock fund would allocate only 5% to 20% of its holdings to private investments, with the quotient dropping as you age.
Private equity tends to be illiquid: Investors generally see their money tied up for months or years. In a 401(k), by contrast, you can typically buy or sell investments daily.
That should be less of a concern, though, when private equity sits in a target-date fund, which includes publicly traded investments that can be sold if an investor wants out.
In 2020, the Trump Administration issued an “Information Letter” instructing that 401(k)-type retirement plans could invest in private equity without violating federal regulations. The law requires 401(k) managers to act in the best interest of investors, protecting them from large losses and excessive fees.
Is private equity too risky for retirement savers?
Some observers fear, however, that the risks of private investment may be too steep for everyday retirement savers.
In June, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) penned a letter to the CEO of Empower about its plan to offer private investments in 401(k) accounts.
“Given the sector’s weak investor protections, its lack of transparency, expensive management fees, and unsubstantiated claims of high returns, we are seeking information on how your company will ensure the safety of the billions of dollars of retirement savings it safeguards as it implements this program,” Warren wrote.
Empower responded, in essence, that retirement savers deserve a crack at the lucrative private investment market, after decades of exclusion.
“Empower believes in the democratization of private investing,” wrote Edmund F. Murphy III, the Empower CEO.
Even so, leaders of the 401(k) industry will “feel more comfortable” about private investments if Congress approves legislation that explicitly allows it, said Thomas Gahan, managing director of Procyon Partners, a financial advisory firm in Shelton, Connecticut.
Gahan predicts more 401(k) providers will offer private investments as an option in the target-date funds, as BlackRock plans to do. “I think it’s a stepping stone,” he said.
The 401k industry may eventually allow any retirement saver to invest in funds made up entirely of private investments, Gahan said, but probably not without legislation that explicitly permits the investments – or an executive order from Trump.
“This will happen over time,” he said, “not overnight.”

Mixed opinions surround the data: some traders see the weak numbers and revisions as evidence of a cooling economy, potentially signaling a sideways to downward correction in stock indexes, especially after the S&P 500’s recent highs. At the same time, some feel the negative revisions were politically motivated. This could lead to the numbers being revised higher in the coming months. Others argue the unemployment rate’s modest rise to 4.2% and steady wage growth suggest no immediate recession, limiting downside risk.
In addition, the tariff uncertainties and the lack of an FOMC meeting until September 17 could catalyze increased volatility or a correction if market sentiment sours further.
August poses challenges for stock index traders due to reduced liquidity from summer vacations, with daily trading volume historically dropping compared to busier months like October. This thinner market can lead to overreactions when reports or events like the August 13 CPI release hit the tape or a new tariff is imposed, as fewer participants absorb order flow, amplifying price swings. While the Nasdaq has a 15-year seasonal buy pattern in August, this upward bias is unlikely to be a straight line. Traders should expect choppy price action with an upward tilt, requiring disciplined risk management to navigate exaggerated volatility.
Technical Outlook
Source: Barchart
The Nadaq QQQ exchange-traded fund (ETF) has rallied approximately 174 points, 44% of the April 2025 lows. Like other stock indexes, the rally has had shallow corrections, not offering some traders or investors any bargains to enter the market. The rally pushed prices to all-time highs. Technically, this has the 50 SMA uptrending under current prices, which is bullish. If August turns into a correction, a logical first support area will be the old all-time highs near the 50 SMA. Corrections are healthy for markets. Don’t be too quick to join the top and bottom pickers saying this is the end of the bull market.
Assets to Trade the Nasdaq Market
Standard Size Futures: Nasdaq-100 futures (NQ), traded on CME, contract size $20 x Nasdaq-100 Index.
Micro Size Futures: Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures (NM), traded on CME, contract size $2 x Nasdaq-100 Index.
ETFs: Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index; leveraged ETFs like ProShares UltraPro QQQ (TQQQ) or inverse ETFs like ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ).
Options: Options on Nasdaq-100 futures (NQ), Micro E-mini Nasdaq-100 futures (NM), or ETFs like QQQ.
Individual Stocks (Closely Correlated): Stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta (META), which are heavily weighted in the Nasdaq-100 (combined weight approximately~40%)
The major stock indexes—Nasdaq-100, S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Russell 2000—exhibit high correlation, with historical daily correlations between Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500 averaging 0.90-0.95 over the past decade. This tight relationship means the Nasdaq’s upcoming seasonal upward bias in August will likely influence these other indexes with varying magnitudes due to sector differences. Traders should expect coordinated moves across these markets, with potential choppiness from low August liquidity amplifying reactions to economic reports or events.
Other Stock Indexes:
S&P 500 futures: ES or ET
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures: YM or YR
Russell 2000 futures: QR or RX
Seasonal Pattern
Seasonal pattern research gives traders an edge by identifying historical price tendencies that often repeat due to recurring economic, behavioral, or market structure factors. For example, the Nasdaq’s 15-year average of a 130-point gain during the seasonal window in August reflects consistent historical seasonal buying. By studying these patterns, traders can anticipate potential moves, align strategies with historical probabilities, and manage risk around expected volatility or consolidation periods. This data-driven approach provides a statistical foundation to complement other analyses, helping traders make informed entry, exit, and position sizing decisions.

Did the recent drop in the stock indexes cause you to panic? What if you had seen this chart before the sell-off? While there are no guarantees in trading, MRCI research shows the Nasdaq market has experienced some weakness near the end of July into August before it finally found a bottom and began a rally into mid-September during the past 15 years (blue line). To refine this pattern, MRCI research (yellow box) has found that the Nasdaq market has closed higher on approximately September 15 than on August 11 for 13 of the past 15 years (87% occurrence).
As a crucial reminder, while seasonal patterns can provide valuable insights, they should not be the basis for trading decisions. Traders must consider various technical and fundamental indicators, risk management strategies, and market conditions to make informed and balanced trading decisions.
In Closing…
August’s trading landscape, shaped by the employment report’s miss and prior-month revisions, has sparked debate about a potential market correction, amplified by tariff uncertainties and no FOMC meeting until September 17. Low liquidity from summer vacations can exaggerate price swings during events like the August 13 CPI release or new tariffs, making navigation tricky. Yet, the Nasdaq’s historical seasonal pattern shows a consistent August rally, often dipping early before climbing into mid-September. Will you leverage this seasonal edge to trade smarter with Nasdaq futures, QQQ ETFs, or stocks like Apple, or let volatility catch you unprepared? Pair this insight with technicals like QQQ’s 50 SMA support and disciplined risk management to avoid the panicked crowd.

Associate degrees, which typically take 18 to 24 months to earn, can be a faster, more affordable alternative, she says.
Associate programs are ""designed to help you start working faster,"" Chan says, and they're beneficial for job seekers ""looking to save on both tuition fees and time.""
Especially when combined with resume boosters like internships, clinical experience or volunteer work — which are often built into these programs — an associate degree can open the door to roles with high-earning potential, she says.
Resume Genius identified the top-paying associate degree jobs using data and projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The report did not include jobs with median annual salaries below $49,500 or significantly low growth projections.
Here are the top-paying associate degree jobs of 2025, according to Resume Genius.
1. Air traffic controller
- Median salary: $144,580
- Estimated job growth (2023-2033): 3%
Air traffic controllers manage the flow of aircraft on the ground and in the air. The job is great for people who value structure, communication and high-stakes work, and also possess strong spatial awareness skills, Chan says. Another perk of the role is that it comes with a comprehensive federal benefits package, including retirement planning and health coverage.
Air traffic controllers are required to be United States citizens who speak English clearly enough to be understood through control systems. They also must be 30 or younger when they're hired, as the job comes with a mandatory retirement age of 56, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
Certification requires passing the FAA's pre-employment tests, including the Air Traffic Controller Specialists Skills Assessment Battery, in addition to medical and security screenings. After that, you'll undergo academy training covered by the FAA before you're out on the job, Chan says.
Despite the number of screenings and extra trainings, air traffic controller jobs are a ""really good opportunity"" for younger applicants, as the FAA is always seeking new candidates, Chan says.
2. Nuclear technician
- Median salary: $104,240
- Estimated job growth (2023-2033): -6%
Nuclear technicians work in control rooms, laboratories or power plants supporting energy generation, research and nuclear waste management. It's a highly technical job, best suited for someone with strong analytical skills and attention to detail, as well as a background in science and math.
Earning an associate degree in nuclear science, nuclear technology or a related field will best equip you for this role. Once you're hired, you'll also need to undergo extensive training to ensure you're prepared for the intricate operational and regulatory aspects of the job, Chan says.
While the estimated job growth for nuclear technicians is declining, salaries still remain high, and the role can provide avenues for other opportunities in nuclear energy management, Chan says.
3. Radiation therapist
- Median salary: $101,990
- Estimated job growth (2023-2033): 3%
Radiation therapists work on oncology teams to help treat people with cancer. They manage and operate medical machines and work closely with patients throughout their treatment, providing both technical and emotional support.
The role may be a great fit for someone who is passionate about health care and helping others, Chan says. Plus, she says, the job is in high demand.
In addition to earning an associate degree in radiation therapy or a related health-care field, you will also need to earn additional licensing and certification, including passing a national certification exam, Resume Genius reports. Flexible learning programs with online learning and in-person rotations are available, though, Chan says.
4. Nuclear medicine technologist
- Median salary: $97,020
- Estimated job growth (2023-2033): -1%
Nuclear medicine technologists use radioactive materials to diagnose and treat cancer and other medical conditions. It's a highly specialized role, combining aspects of health care, oncology, cardiology and neurology, Chan says — one best suited for people who are tech-savvy with a strong interest in pharmacology and health care.
To become a nuclear medicine technologist, you should earn your associate degree from an accredited nuclear medicine technology program, Chan says.
Some states also require additional licensing, she says, which involves passing an exam such as the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board exam or the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists exam. You may also have to meet other education and training requirements.
5. Dental hygienist
- Median salary: $94,260
- Estimated job growth: 9%
Dental hygienists are responsible for performing teeth cleanings, conducting oral health assessments and helping patients learn how to take care of their teeth.
Someone who is interested in dental care, hands-on tasks and working with others may enjoy this job, Chan says. It's a social role, as hygienists typically work closely with dentists and other office staff while serving as a primary point of contact for patients.
In addition to needing an associate degree in dental hygiene, which can take closer to three years due to the additional lab and clinical learning requirements, most states also require hygienists to pass the National Board Dental Hygiene Examination alongside a regional or state clinical board exam, according to the American Dental Hygienists Association.

The Federal Reserve last week kept its short-term interest rate in the same place it’s been since the central bank’s last rate cut in December. The Fed’s rate plays into the rate that many banks use as a guidepost to set annual percentage rates for the credit cards they issue.
But looking across the stack of credit cards that Americans use, a growing list of cards are slightly raising the interest rates they charge to riskier-looking customers. At the same time, they are lowering the APRs for their most creditworthy users.
That’s a signal that banks are getting more cautious in an uncertain time, card-industry experts say. And it’s happening with a range of cards geared toward different consumers.
Take Chase’s JPM Sapphire Reserve Card. The high-fee luxury card’s APR currently ranges from 20.24% to 28.74%. It’s been that way since May, when it changed from a range of 21.49% to 28.49%, according to Matt Schulz, chief consumer-finance analyst at LendingTree TREE.
Elsewhere, the Fidelity Rewards Visa Signature card with unlimited 2% cash back moved from a single 18.24% APR in May to a variable range of 17.24% to 27.24%, Schulz noted.
When cards switch from a single APR to a variable range, it indicates they’re hedging their bets to be more cautious toward riskier borrowers with lower credit scores, and more generous with more creditworthy ones, Schulz said.
A Fidelity spokesperson confirmed the card’s rate change and noted the card’s value for users.
Several other co-branded travel cards and shopper-rewards cards have adjusted their rates to go slightly higher at the top range while decreasing their lowest APRs, Schulz added.
These moves are small, but they speak volumes, he said. “Banks hate risk and always try to avoid it,” Schulz told MarketWatch. “In an uncertain economy, there are a lot of risks out there, and part of what banks are doing to protect themselves is slowly raising interest rates, especially on folks at the lower end of the credit spectrum.”
The average APR on new card offers has increased for four consecutive months, according to Schulz. The average offer was 24.35% in July, up from 24.20% in March.
Fed data shows the upward drift. For credit cards with a balance, the average APR increased to 22.25% in May. That’s up from 21.91% in the first quarter.
Americans’ average credit score was 702 in June, which is considered good, according to VantageScore, a credit-score company. (Scores range from 300 to 850.) The average score has held steady over the past year, but the share of borrowers with “prime” scores (from 661 to 780) has shrunk slightly in two years as more people have drifted toward the higher and lower ranges of the credit-score spectrum, VantageScore researchers said.
“Banks are used to responding to a changing economy. But the muddy waters around tariffs, economic policies and consumer sentiment may be leading to precautionary moves from banks,” said Bankrate credit-cards expert Katie Kelton, who has noticed a small increase in credit-card rates during recent months.
A tough time for an upward drift on credit-card APRs
“Cardholders who don’t carry a balance don’t need to be terribly concerned about APR changes,” Kelton said. “But if you do carry a balance, a higher APR could increase your debt even more quickly than before.”
The problem is that many people are carrying sizable balances. Americans had a collective $1.21 trillion credit-card balance in the second quarter, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data on Tuesday.
Card delinquency rates continued tapering off in the second quarter, which was good news, New York Fed researchers said. But rates are still elevated, hovering near levels last seen in 2011, the New York Fed’s numbers show.
Rising APRs at a time when the Fed has been holding rates steady may surprise some cardholders. But many might not know the rates they are paying on their balances: Anywhere from roughly one-quarter to one-half of card users don’t know their card’s APR, according to surveys.
MarketWatch readers appeared to show more awareness of the cost of their credit-card debt. Roughly half of people responding to MarketWatch polls on Instagram and X last week said they knew their credit-card APRs. Around 30% in both polls said they couldn’t say their APR without checking their statement first.
Delayed relief — even if there’s a Fed cut coming
A disappointing July jobs report and significant downward revisions to the jobs added in June and May could add to the U.S. economy’s cloudy picture ahead. In the wake of the weaker-than-expected jobs numbers, traders are increasingly predicting a quarter-percentage-point cut when the Fed makes another rate decision in September.
But it could be a while before cardholders feel any sort of debt relief. It can take one or two billing cycles for a rate cut to filter through to APRs, Schulz said.
And card issuers add a margin to the reference rate, which is the prime rate.
“Credit-card rates are calculated by adding the prime rate — which is the Fed’s rate plus 3 percent — plus a profit margin,” said Kelton. “And since the Fed has held steady on rates this year, including during this week’s meeting, we’re really looking at issuers’ profit margins for answers to APR increases or decreases.”
The extra margins that card issuers tack on to the underlying rates have been growing for years, according to Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia researchers. The average margin reached an all-time high of more than 17% in the first quarter of this year.
Even when accounting for a slightly lower reference rate, Philadelphia Fed researchers said the costs of a person not fully paying their credit-card balance “is considerably higher in the current environment compared with just one year ago.”

Most Read from Bloomberg
That streak just hit a wall. The stock plunged 17% last week after disappointing results, in its second-worst post-earnings drop. Analysts question whether Coinbase can keep using its pricing power to defend margins, without ceding ground to lower-cost rivals.
The firm has long defied warnings that competition would force it to slash fees — even raising them on a set of stablecoin trades in March. But competitors like Kraken and Robinhood are chasing market share. And Gemini and Bullish are preparing for potential public listings.
“We still see long-term risks to their growth due to above-average retail transaction fees and increasing competition from platforms like Robinhood,” said Alex Woodard, an analyst at Arca. “Coinbase needs to implement cheaper trading fees and continue to expand its product offering through M&A in order to avoid losing market share.”
Robinhood, known for zero-commission stock trading, has an average take rate roughly 50% lower than Coinbase’s, according to Mizuho, while Kraken has added stocks and exchange-traded funds to keep users engaged. Bitcoin, which drives much of the industry’s mood and trading activity, has also steadied.
Brian Armstrong co-founded Coinbase in 2012 and made it the first major crypto exchange to list publicly in 2021. That head start helped cement its role as the industry’s default platform for retail traders and institutions in the US.
Coinbase’s revenue grew 3% last quarter, its slowest in two years. Kraken’s sales rose 18%, while Robinhood’s crypto business nearly doubled to $160 million. Coinbase’s global market share edged lower from 5.65% to 4.56% before a small rebound in July, according to analyst estimates. For now, it still commands more than half of the US spot market, a reminder of its scale.
The broader backdrop remains bullish. Most analysts remain positive on the stock, as Bitcoin ETFs pull in billions and stablecoins hit record volumes. That rising tide means Coinbase could keep growing its revenue even if its market share — always volatile — slips. The question for investors is whether that growth is already priced in, and whether rivals like Robinhood or Kraken could chip away enough business to test its premium.
The firm attributed part of the trading slowdown to a deliberate pricing decision to charge for some stablecoin pairs, historically largely a zero-fee product.
“This was in our control,” said Alesia Haas, Coinbase’s chief financial officer on last week’s earnings call. “When you exclude the impact of lower stable-pair volume, our total trading volume was more similar to the overall spot markets,” she told analysts.
In other words, it was a bet on margins over market share — one that rivals may soon test.
“As more players enter crypto, it’s a sign the space is going mainstream,” a Coinbase representative said in an email. “That’s good for the ecosystem, but we’re here to win.”
That trade-off highlights Coinbase’s bind: cut prices and hurt margins, or hold firm and risk losing traders. Still, the company has often managed to keep fees steady or even increase them over the years, despite warnings from naysayers. Coinbase is planning to offer stock trading to expand its grip with clients.
“Exchanges have to become one-stop shops,” said John Todaro, an analyst at Needham & Co. “But every competitor is chasing that same strategy, which makes the fight even tougher.”
For investors, this is bigger than a single earnings miss: The stock has long been a favorite of large money managers — pensions, financial advisers, and cautious funds — because it offered a “safer” way to get crypto exposure through a regulated, publicly listed company. While he believes Coinbase can continue to do business without dropping fees, “either way, being so fully dependent on crypto trading is risky,” said Dan Dolev, an analyst at Mizuho.
That dependence has led to what Todaro calls “lumpy revenue growth, with some years of big gains and others of modest or even negative results.”
The company has plenty of firepower, with more than $9 billion in cash and revenue from its partnership with stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group. The firm runs a custody business — crypto safekeeping for investors such as Bitcoin ETFs — that ties it directly into Wall Street’s flows. And it’s trying to become an “everything exchange,” recently adding perpetual-style futures contracts in the US, buying the crypto options platform Deribit, and planning to list stocks and even prediction markets.
Rivals aren’t slowing down either. Aside from Kraken and Robinhood, OKX has re-entered the US. And Binance, despite its past legal troubles, had explored doing business with World Liberty Financial Inc., one of the Trump family’s crypto ventures, Bloomberg has reported.
“Binance and HTX have been the primary beneficiaries of spot market share growth this year globally,” said Saksham Diwan, research analyst at CoinDesk Data. ”In the US, Kraken has recorded the most significant gain in spot market share, although Coinbase still retains the vast majority of the spot market, with over 50% share in the US.”
Coinbase trades at about 44 times forward earnings — richer than traditional exchanges, but still lower than Robinhood at 65, and nowhere near Circle’s lofty multiple. H.C. Wainwright, which downgraded Coinbase in July, cautioned that competition could pressure its premium.
Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau expects a 46% revenue rebound in the third quarter, and sees the recent stock drop as a buying opportunity.
“I don’t think COIN’s valuation is out of reach,” Lau said. “It is trading at a big discount compared to HOOD and CRCL. I think if they can continue to grow both top and bottom line, it will help.”
But that optimism rests on Coinbase’s ability to hold its margins in a market where trading is becoming a commodity, and rivals look all set to cut costs anew.

On Thursday, many trading partners were hit with ""reciprocal"" tariffs on their exports to the U.S. Trump also announced late Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductor chips, with an exception for companies that are ""building in the United States.""
Most investors would benefit from tuning out the market volatility triggered by a trade war with dozens of countries, financial advisors say. History shows that the stock market is remarkably resilient, and offers handsome returns to those who take a long view.
""Investor uncertainty escalated amid the initial developments of tariffs,"" said Wes Crill, senior client solutions director and vice president at Dimensional Fund Advisors.
""[E]ven while the news headlines may be concerning, investors have good reasons to stay invested,"" Crill said. ""Prices are always set to provide positive expected returns.""
Still, there are also some tactical moves investors can take in this environment if they don't want to just sit tight and stay the course, market strategists say.
""Tariffs have made this investing environment very tricky,"" said Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management.
""[But] there are lots of opportunities if you're willing to look for them.""
S&P 500 up 12% since Trump's 'Liberation Day'
Trump has announced and rescinded a flurry of actions around tariff policy since his so-called ""Liberation Day"" on April 2.
The U.S. effective tariff rate is estimated to rise to about 17% — from 2.3% last year — after tariffs Trump proposed last week on a swath of countries, Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in an Aug. 1 research note.
Patience often trumps panic.Douglas Boneparthcertified financial planner
Those so-called ""reciprocal tariffs"" come on top of others, like duties placed on automobiles, steel, aluminum and copper, for example. A 17% effective rate would be the highest since the 1930s, Brown wrote.
But the stock market is still chugging along. Between the start of April and early August, the S&P 500 rose over 12%, according to Morningstar Direct. As reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Thursday, the market was little changed by midday.
That uptick ""reinforces a timeless investing principle,"" said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York.
""Patience often trumps panic,"" said Boneparth, a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council.
ETFs can help target investing amid tariffs
For investors who want to try to allocate their money in a strategic way amid the era of tariffs, exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, may be one place to look, said Andrew Hiesinger, founder and CEO of Quant Data, a market information platform.
""ETFs let investors adjust exposure to entire sectors, regions or supply chains in a single trade,"" Hiesinger said.
""When tariffs disrupt global markets, this flexibility can help smooth out risk compared to holding individual stocks that may be directly impacted by a single policy change,"" he added.
Many of the best-performing ETFs since early April have been focused on cryptocurrencies, an analysis by Morningstar Direct found.
""Cryptocurrency ETFs have gained momentum because digital assets are not directly impacted by tariffs on physical goods,"" Hiesinger said.
""Broader trade uncertainty can also drive investors toward crypto as a perceived hedge against geopolitical and currency risks.""
Meanwhile, nuclear energy ETFs have benefited from a growing demand for stable power sources and policy support, Hiesinger said.
""Tariffs on other energy inputs or technology components can indirectly make nuclear power more attractive,"" he added.
There is no single rule for how much of their portfolio investors should allocate to ETFs, Hiesinger said.
""The key is ensuring the position fits within their overall risk tolerance and broader portfolio strategy, rather than a fixed percentage or amount they can afford to lose,"" he said.
Tech and financial sectors stand to benefit
Among the challenges for investors is the whipsawing nature of the Trump administration's tariff policy, experts said.
But tactical traders looking to pinpoint investment opportunities over a time frame of weeks or months — compared to the multiyear or multidecade time frames of long-term investors — ""shine"" in such a fast-moving, volatile environment, Ritholtz Wealth Management's Cox said.
Technology, consumer discretionary, materials and industrials are among the investment sectors broadly poised for a negative tariff impact, Cox said. The consumer discretionary spending category encompasses retailers that sell good and services such as appliances, toys, electronics and apparel — many of which are manufactured overseas.
Meanwhile, the industrials sector includes transportation and logistics firms such as UPS, FedEx and other shippers that will need to adjust to a new reality of lower import volumes, Cox said.
On the other hand, the Trump administration has exempted many consumer tech products like smart phones and computers from tariffs. That somewhat insulates the tech sector from tariff impact, said Jacob Manoukian, U.S. head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.
Cox and Manoukian view sectors like utilities and financials as being less exposed to tariffs, as well. These include more services-oriented businesses, which are less focused on physical goods, and are more U.S.-based, Cox said.
""You're not importing bankers from Europe,"" Cox said.
Beyond tariffs
Ultimately, tariffs will have at least some financial impact on ""almost everything"" because of the interconnected nature of global supply chains, Manoukian said.
But investors should consider their impact alongside other Trump administration policies, Manoukian said.
For example, a recently passed tax and spending package tweaked rules around bonus depreciation and expenses for research and development; changes that are likely to prove financially beneficial for many companies, Manoukian said.",4e6a6e6b698d4a4cb1ebe2154968c316,trafilatura,6166,0

Moments before his deadline passed for countries to negotiate US trade deals, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that billions of dollars were now flowing into his country as a result of his import taxes.
Trump is using tariffs to encourage jobs and manufacturing industries to return to America, among other political goals.
Separately on Wednesday, he threatened to raise the tariff on imports from India to 50%, unless that country stopped buying Russian oil. He also threatened a 100% tariff on foreign-made computer chips, to push tech firms to invest more in the US.
Trump's trade policies have been broadly aimed at reshaping the global trading system, which he sees as treating the US unfairly. One of his key pledges as he returned to the White House in January was to cut the trade deficit - the shortfall between what America buys and what it sells.
His tariffs work by charging US importers a tax on goods they buy from other countries. Those importers may pass some or all of the extra cost on to customers.
Trump has also been accused of throwing the global economy into turmoil in recent months, though markets have recently been more stable.
The overall average US tariff rate is at its highest in almost a century, thanks to a range of other industry-specific taxes affecting products such as vehicles and steel.
The duties that came into effect on Thursday were first announced in April. Many were later paused amid market turbulence, and to give other countries time to strike new trade deals with the US.
A patchwork of rates were set for different countries - and were adjusted over time by Trump, who ultimately set a negotiating deadline of 7 August.
Export-dependent economies in South East Asia are among the hardest-hit.
Manufacturing-focused Laos and Myanmar face some of the highest levies at 40%. Some experts said Trump appears to have targeted countries with close trade ties with China.
But after more than four months of uncertainty, markets in Asia seemed to take the news in their stride on Thursday.
Major share indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and mainland China were a little higher, while markets in India and Australia were lower.
The latest set of tariffs will offer countries some stability after months of chaos, said economist Bert Hofman from the National University of Singapore.
""This is supposed to be it,"" he said. ""Now you can start to analyse the impact of the tariffs.""
Some major economies - including the UK, Japan and South Korea - reached agreements to ensure goods exported to the US would face a lower tariff rate than Trump threatened in April.
The European Union has also struck a framework deal with Washington, in which Brussels has accepted a 15% tariff on goods from the trading bloc.
Switzerland has said it will hold an extraordinary meeting on Thursday after its officials were unable to reach a deal with the US.
At 39%, the tariff rate on Swiss goods is one of the highest imposed by the US, and threatens to hit the country's economy hard.
Taiwan, a key Washington ally in Asia, was handed a 20% tariff. Its president Lai Ching-te said the rate was ""temporary"" and that talks with the US were ongoing.
Other tariffs unveiled by Trump after he returned to the White House in January have been aimed at the US's top three trading partners - China, Canada and Mexico - with a variety of political goals in mind.
Last week, he boosted the tariff rate on Canada from 25% to 35%, saying the country had ""failed to cooperate"" in curbing the flow of fentanyl and other drugs across the US border. Canada insists it is cracking down on drug gangs.
But most Canadian exports to the US will dodge the import tax due to an existing trade treaty, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).
Higher tariffs on Mexico were paused for another 90 days as negotiations continue to strike a trade deal.
Meanwhile, the US and China have held a series of talks in a bid to agree an extension to a 90-day tariffs pause due to expire on 12 August.
Some of Trump's recent tariff moves have been bound up with a separate effort to end Russia's war in Ukraine.
He has threatened to impose ""secondary tariffs"" aimed at Moscow's trading partners if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, although it is unclear whether positive noises following talks between Washington and Moscow and a potential meeting between Trump and Putin will affect this.
In the interim, Trump threatened on Wednesday to raise the tariff rate on Indian goods to 50% from 27 August, as he pushes the world's third largest importer of energy to stop buying oil from Russia.
Delhi called the move ""unfair, unjustified and unreasonable"" and vowed to protect its national interests.
The move marked a ""sharp change"" in Trump's approach to Moscow that could spark concerns among other countries in talks with the US, said market analyst Farhan Badami from financial services firm eToro.
""There is the possibility here that India is only the first target that Trump intends to punish for maintaining trade relations with Russia,"" Mr Badami said.
Also on Wednesday, Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors.
That threat came as tech firm Apple announced a new $100bn (£75bn) US investment after coming under pressure from the White House to move more production to the US.
Major chipmakers that have made significant investments in the US appear to be able to dodge the new tariff. Government officials in Taiwan and South Korea have said in separate statements that TSMC, SK Hynix, and Samsung would be exempt from the new levy.
The White House did not immediately respond to a BBC request for clarification.
The BBC has also contacted SK Hynix and Samsung. TSMC declined to comment.

Some investors may be wondering if the index and many top stocks are still worth buying now, or if valuations are getting overextended.
Here are some factors to consider when approaching broad market fluctuations and how the S&P 500 could fit into your portfolio.
1. Time horizon
One of the most effective ways to compound wealth is through buying and holding shares in quality companies over a long time period. And yet, human nature can make it challenging to buy stocks trading at their all-time high, even though history shows it's often a good idea.
Therefore, one of the most important factors to consider when approaching a red-hot market is your time horizon. A long-term position gives volatility time to play out, whereas a short-term holding is more susceptible to temporary price swings.
Data from MacroMicro shows that the forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 is 22.3, higher than the five-year moving average of 20.9 and the one-year average of 20.2. So the broader market, in general, is on the expensive side.
A pricey market is no big deal if you're investing for a retirement that's decades away because the focus is on years of compounding returns rather than what's happening on a quarterly or yearly basis. But if you're investing with a shorter time horizon, valuations will matter more. This is why it's always better to take the pressure off your portfolio by adopting longer-term holding periods.
2. The S&P 500's impact on your portfolio
Buying the S&P 500 provides exposure to 500 of the top U.S. companies. But in reality, it's not as diversified as you many think.
Investing $10,000 in the S&P 500, as represented by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO), is really $730 in Nvidia, $703 in Microsoft, $583 in Apple, $394 in Amazon, and so on.
The S&P 500 is much more top-heavy today than it was in the past. Not only is half of the index invested in just 25 companies, but the vast majority of the index is concentrated in just a handful of sectors. Technology, communications, and consumer discretionary have a combined 53.3% weighting. So before adding more of your hard-earned savings to the index, it's essential to be comfortable with its composition.
Arguably, the best reason not to buy the S&P 500 at an all-time high is if you're trying to diversify your portfolio but already own a lot of the index's top names. Another reason to avoid the index is if you're trying to invest in mid-cap or small-cap stocks that carry tiny, often negligible weightings in the index (or none at all).
Pairing holdings in individual stocks with positions in ETFs is a great way to adjust your portfolio weightings based on your conviction in certain names.
For example, let's say that you think Advanced Micro Devices is a great buy because it will take market share from Nvidia. The S&P 500 has just a 0.5% weighting in AMD, compared to 7.7% for Nvidia, so buying the S&P 500 effectively doubles down on the very company this hypothetical investor believes can be disrupted. In such a scenario, it makes more sense to invest directly in AMD as a way to counteract Nvidia's outsized representation in an S&P 500 fund.
3. Financial goals
Another good reason not to buy the S&P 500 is if it doesn't align with your investment objectives. The S&P 500 can be an excellent way to compound wealth over time, but it's no longer a good way to generate passive income. The index yields just 1.2% compared to 2.1% about a decade ago. The yield has gone down as valuations have increased, and growth stocks (many of which don't pay dividends or have low yields) have expanded their weightings in the index.
Investors looking to invest in the stock market with an emphasis on passive income may want to consider dividend-paying stocks or ETFs with higher yields.
Coca-Cola has a 3% yield, a track record of earnings growth, and 63 consecutive years of boosting its payout. Buying Coca-Cola and other top dividend stocks offers a way to collect a sizable amount of passive income while still participating in the market, rather than using a passive income strategy that focuses solely on yield with little upside potential.
Only buy the S&P 500 if it works for you
Over time, the best-performing companies are typically those that reinvest the bulk of their excess earnings into the underlying business to accelerate growth. Good ideas combined with deep pockets can create jaw-dropping results, as reflected in the S&P 500's epic long-term gains and shift toward tech-focused companies.
Even near its all-time high valuation, the S&P 500 is still a great buy for most long-term investors. However, it's a mistake to buy the S&P 500 without considering how its composition factors into your existing holdings and investment objectives.

The dollar recovered from a 1.5-week low today and turned higher as short covering emerged after the US unit labor cost report was slightly stronger than expected, which was negative for the inflation outlook and hawkish for Fed policy.
The dollar initially moved lower today on a larger-than-expected increase in weekly US jobless claims, a dovish factor for Fed policy. Also, dovish comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly weighed on the dollar when she said it may be appropriate for the Fed to cut interest rates in the “coming months.” In addition, strength in stocks today has reduced liquidity demand for the dollar.
Also, questions about the Fed’s credibility continue to weigh on the dollar after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler resigned last Friday, which could prompt President Trump to nominate a new governor who is more dovish and could undermine Fed Chair Powell’s influence.
US weekly initial unemployment claims rose +7,000 to 226,000, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 222,000. Weekly continuing claims rose +38,000 to a 3.75-year high of 1.974 million, higher than expectations of 1.950 million and a sign that unemployed persons are taking longer to secure new employment.
US Q2 nonfarm productivity rose +2.4%, higher than expectations of +2.0%. Q2 unit labor costs rose +1.6%, slightly stronger than expectations of +1.5%.
Late Wednesday, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said, “The labor market has softened, and I would see additional slowing as unwelcome. All this means that the Fed will likely need to adjust monetary policy in the coming months.”
In recent tariff news, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor imports. Still, companies would be eligible for exemptions if they demonstrate a commitment to building their products in the US. However, the US will levy a separate tax on imports of electronic products that employ semiconductors. Also, President Trump announced Wednesday that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” Last Thursday, President Trump raised tariffs on some Canadian goods to 35% from 25% and announced a 10% global minimum, along with tariffs of 15% or higher for countries with trade surpluses with the US, effective today. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 95% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting and 68% at the following meeting on October 28-29.
EUR/USD (^EURUSD) today is down by -0.29%. The euro fell from a 1.5-week high today and is moving lower on weaker-than-expected news on German industrial production. Also, the dollar’s strength today is weighing on the euro. In addition, the euro is struggling due to concerns that President Trump’s tariff policies will curb economic growth in the Eurozone.
The euro initially moved higher today on hopes for an end to the Russian-Ukrainian war, with President Trump expected to meet with Russian President Putin in the next few days to discuss an end to the conflict. Also, today’s stronger-than-expected German trade news is supportive of the euro.
German June industrial production fell -1.9% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.5% m/m and the largest decline in 11 months.
German trade news was better than expected as German June exports rose +0.8% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.4% m/m. Also, June imports rose +4.2% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.8% m/m and the largest increase in 5 months.
Swaps are pricing in a 12% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
USD/JPY (^USDJPY) today is up by +0.03%. The yen is slightly lower today against the dollar after Japan’s Cabinet Office cut its Japanese 2025 GDP estimate. Also, concerns that US tariff policies will harm the Japanese economy are weighing on the yen. Losses in the yen are limited after the Japan June leading index CI rose more than expected. Also, lower T-note yields today are supportive of the yen.
The Japan June leading index CI rose +1.3 to 106.1, stronger than expectations of 106.0
Japan’s Cabinet Office cut its Japanese 2025 GDP estimate to 0.7% from a January estimate of 1.2% and raised its CPI estimate to 2.4% from 2.0%.
December gold (GCZ25) today is up +12.20 (+0.36%), and September silver (SIU25) is up +0.453 (+1.20%). Precious metals today are moving higher, with gold posting a 2-week high and silver posting a 1.5-week high. Today’s US weekly jobless claims report showed weakness in the US labor market, which dovish for Fed policy and a bullish factor for precious metals. Also, dovish comments from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly were supportive of the demand for precious metals as a store of value when she said it may be appropriate for the Fed to cut interest rates in the “coming months.”
Gold buying by China’s central bank is also supportive of gold prices as the PBOC bought 60,000 troy ounces of gold for its reserves in July, the ninth consecutive month it has boosted its gold purchases. Finally, today’s action by the BOE to cut its official bank rate by -25 bp was supportive of precious metals.

Starting next year, the legislation caps the amount of federal loans students can borrow for graduate school at $100,000 over a lifetime — and sets a lifetime loan limit of $200,000 for professional programs, such as medical, dental or law school. Grad PLUS loans will also be eliminated entirely. Those changes go into effect for new borrowers on July 1, 2026.
Some experts say the new loan limits will provide a much-needed check on soaring tuition costs, which have jumped significantly in recent decades, outpacing inflation and other household expenses. Higher costs have made college and graduate school seem out of reach for some while saddling others with crippling student loan debt.

Families, too, support having additional guardrails. Roughly two-thirds, or 67%, of parents said there should be limits on how much federal student loan debt students can take on, according to Sallie Mae's annual How America Pays for College report.
However, for aspiring doctors, the limits may mean drastic changes. The average cost of medical school already exceeds $200,000. At private institutions, the average cost is more than $300,000, according to 2024 data from the Association of American Medical Colleges.
""This is now a generation that has a big-time punch in the face,"" said Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
'Crazy, crazy debt' for a medical degree
""People view medical students as future rich people and that's not the case at all,"" said Kylie Ruprecht, a third-year student at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine.
""You go into crazy, crazy debt to go into medicine,"" said Ruprecht, 24, ""and then repay those loans over decades.""
Ruprecht relies on a combination of unsubsidized student loans and Grad PLUS loans to cover her costs. Once she graduates, she will begin a four-year residency to become an anesthesiologist. It will be years before she is on solid financial footing, she said.
Ruprecht declined to say how much she will owe, in total, when she graduates. Although Ruprecht is grandfathered into the old borrowing limits, her current debt load, with Grad Plus loans, would surpass the new loan caps, she said.
In fact, about 27.5% of medical school students and 60% of those in dentistry programs graduated with more debt in 2020 than is allowed under the new loan limits, according to calculations by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.
""Medical school is the 'hair on fire' situation because the numbers are big, period, and the gaps between the federal loan limits and the program costs are sizeable,"" said Ken Ruggiero, co-founder and CEO of private education lender Ascent Funding.
Nearly every year, students and their families are borrowing more to make up the difference. Now, around 44 million Americans owe a combined $1.7 trillion for their education. Roughly 40% of that outstanding federal student loan debt is taken on for master's and PhD programs.
A growing shortage of doctors
The new legislation ""doesn't affect everyone equally,"" Mukkamala said — it's students from underserved communities who will be less likely to go into the medical field as the new loan limits fall short of the total cost of attendance, which is over $200,000. ""If someone like that gets through college and looks at that number, they are going to say, 'no way,'"" he said.
According to 2024 projections by the Association of American Medical Colleges, the U.S. was already on track to have a shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036.
""The new annual and aggregate loan limits could create challenges for some medical students to finance their education, resulting in an additional financial barrier to attending medical school and ultimately worsening the current and projected physician shortage,"" said Kristen Earle, program leader for student financial aid services at the Association of American Medical Colleges.
""We are concerned that this added barrier could deter qualified candidates, particularly low-income students, from pursuing a medical career altogether,"" Earle said.
'An opportunity for private lenders'
It's likely the new limits on federal student loans will spur borrowers to find other lenders to bridge the gap, Earle said. ""The changing landscape does present an opportunity for private lenders.""
Private student loans often come into play once students have reached the federal loan limits and still need additional education financing.
""The new loan limits for Parent PLUS loans and graduate/professional school loans will shift some borrowing from federal loans to private student loans,"" Kantrowitz also recently told CNBC. ""This will particularly impact low-income students, who are less likely to qualify for private student loans.""
Unlike federal loans, private loans are not guaranteed. Private student loan lenders rely on a borrower's credit score to determine eligibility and interest rate.
""We want to lend to people who can afford to pay us back, that's how the model works,"" said Ascent's Ruggiero.
Private loans also come with fewer safety nets and less flexible repayment options compared with federal loans.
""The idea behind [the loan limits] is great, but it's not putting the burden on the universities. It's putting the burden on students,"" said Ruprecht, the aspiring anesthesiologist. ""It's students who will have to scramble.""",de58844e44719815054f0542131c6cb7,trafilatura,5793,0

(CSE: SRAN) (FSE: P84) (Tradegate: P84) (""Sranan"" or the ""Company"") announces three channel samples with an apparent width of 5 metres that averaged 36.7 grams/tonne (g/t) gold were sampled in trench 25RACH-001, the first trench of an ongoing trenching program at the Tapanahony Project in Suriname.
This initial trench is located 150 metres south of Randy's Pit, which is the largest artisanal mine within the Tapanahony Project. The previously announced high-grade grab samples from underground workings within Randy's Pit (76.6 g/t and 23.7 g/t gold - see news release dated July 31, 2025) are located approximately 350 metres to the north.
The mineralization intersected in this generally north-south oriented trench trends to the northwest. These results represent the projection of gold mineralization beyond Randy's Pit to the south. This high-grade interval was missed in historical drilling. Gold mineralization is hosted within sugary textured transposed quartz veins that are associated with sericite-limonite alteration and oxidized pyrite relics. The trench sampled upper saprolite material at the contact zone between sheared sedimentary and granitic rocks, which is an excellent host for gold as seen at the Antino Project, majority owned by Founders Metals, as well as elsewhere in the Guiana Shield.
Table 1: Recent results of trench 25RACH-001.
Dr. Dennis LaPoint, Executive VP of Exploration and Corporate Development, commented: ""This initial trench further confirms the potential to extend the Randy trend. Multiple gold systems in Suriname are related to complex, multi-stage deformation zones that include tension veins that enhance grade. The ongoing trenching program is designed to further extend the strike length of the Randy trend. Trenching will be conducted simultaneously with drilling on the Randy trend.""
Samples were prepared and assayed by Filab in Paramaribo, Suriname. All samples >2 g/T were re-assayed with 50-gram re-assay and gravimetric assay. Standard QA/QC procedures were followed which showed a satisfactory level of reproducibility. Reject samples will be sent to an independent lab for confirmation of assay results following standard procedures. Channel sampling, trenching and drilling are used to determine average grade and thickness. The Company notes that the channel samples may not represent true thickness of mineralization.

Josh — We have a lot of consumer discretionary stocks on our Best Stocks in the Market list these days — from eBay and Flutter Entertainment to Carvana and Royal Caribbean . But we don't have a lot of retailers. Today, we're taking a look at one of the best technical set-ups on the list and a company that has fundamentally outperformed its competitors across every important metric. TJX owns and operates the T.J. Maxx brand as well as HomeGoods, Marshalls and the fast-growing outdoor and recreation retailer Sierra. CEO Ernie Herrman has been with the company since 1989 and has been running it as the chief exec since 2016. He's become known as the master of the ""treasure hunt"" retail model with which he surprises and delights shoppers with unexpected finds each time they visit the store. The results of all this treasure hunting speak for themselves, as you'll see in Sean's write-up and chart below. TJX is trending higher as Herrman reminds investors that trade disruptions and tariffs are not setbacks, they're opportunities to outcompete the field. Best Stock Spotlight: TJX Companies Inc (TJX) On the list since: 8/04/2025. Sean — There are signs that consumers are beginning to look for value in their shopping habits. This was a Wall Street Journal headline from last Sunday: ""American Consumers Are Getting Thrifty Again."" If consumers are looking for value, they can find it at TJX. The average discount range at TJX or Marshalls (owned by TJX) is 20% to 60% off comparable items at full-price department or specialty stores. TJX delivers value through its off-price retail model, which allows it to offer significant discounts compared to traditional retailers. The company purchases surplus inventory, overstock, canceled orders, and end-of-season merchandise directly from brand manufacturers and department stores. By avoiding the costs associated with in-house design, seasonal planning, and large-scale marketing, TJX is able to pass the savings on to consumers. And in an environment where people still want a new outfit for vacation, or for the new school year, consumers are happy to purchase these goods at a discount. This was Dollar General's CEO in June: ""We saw the highest percent of trade-in customers we've had in the last four years,"" related to middle and high-income shoppers looking for more value in the goods they purchase. TJX is trending beautifully. Below is a visual of TJX over the past 3 years, using weekly data. Buyers have been rewarded when accumulating the stock at or near its 50 week moving average. The 200 week moving average is in a distinct pattern as well, up and to the right: From 2019 through today, TJX has grown net income by an 8% compounded annual growth rate. That's inclusive of a pandemic, spending boom (and spending slowdown), supply chain issues, and now the beginnings (or endings) of a trade war. TJX is gearing up to report earnings later this month, but during their last earnings call they laid out some tariff mitigation strategies. This was the CEO in May: ""We are convinced that we will have an opportunity to gain market share if more consumers seek out value in the current environment. We are confident that our commitment to our shoppers, great value on every item every day will continue to resonate with consumers and drive more shoppers to our stores. Next, our team of over 1,300 buyers source goods from an ever-changing universe of over 21,000 vendors from more than 100 countries around the world. We have a global buying infrastructure and supply chain that has been in place for multiple decades."" Later in the call, they maintained full-year guidance for comparable sales, profit margins, and EPS for 2025. Simply put, the company is well-run and well-positioned for this current environment. Risk management Josh — This is as clean an uptrend as you're going to find. Short-term traders can use the simple 200-day moving average, but I would wait for a weekly closing price below before abandoning the name. That's looking at the $120-$122 area. A decisive break above the March highs around $136 takes us into a brand new area, you'll want to roll-up your stops, stay long and let the treasure hunt continue with the house's money.

Buy now, pay later loans gained popularity during the pandemic, especially among young people. While these loans can help you make large purchases without paying interest or undergoing a hard inquiry in your credit report, they can also easily be overused.
About 4 in 10 Americans under the age of 45 say they’ve used ""buy now, pay later″ services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals, or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Whether you’re a first-time or recurring user of buy now, pay later plans, here are some expert recommendations to use this tool responsibly.
Focus on needs vs. wants
Buy now, pay later plans divide purchases in monthly installments, typically in four payments. These loans are marketed as having low or no interest. Klarna, Afterpay, PayPal and Affirm are among the most popular buy now, pay later companies.
These loans should ideally be used for large purchases or necessities, said Lauren Bringle, Accredited Financial Counselor at Self Financial.
Bringle recommends asking yourself these questions before purchasing: Can I survive without this purchase right now? Do I need it for work, school, or a basic household need?
Buy now, pay later is best used when you have a plan for the purchase, not for impulse buys. For example, when you need to buy a computer for school or a new refrigerator for your house, recommended Tyler Horn, head of planning at Origin, a budgeting app.
Pause before purchasing
Before deciding to take out a buy now, pay later loan, it’s a good idea to pause and consider if it’s the best financial decision for you, recommended Erika Rasure, Chief Financial Wellness advisor for Beyond Finance.
Buy now, pay later plans can be positive budgeting tools when used strategically. However, it’s essential you know your spending behaviors before using them, said Rasure. If you’re an emotional spender, it might be hard for you to moderate your use of this tool and you could end up adding to your financial stress.
“Buy now, pay later can become a coping mechanism rather than a financial tool that can get you a good deal or improve your cash flow,” said Rasure.
If you have other payments due, such as credit card or student loan payments, consider how a buy now, pay later loan will add to your monthly payments, recommended Sarah Rathner, Senior Writer for NerdWallet.
Read the fine print
Like credit cards, each buy now, pay later loan has terms and conditions that can vary by purchase and providers. It’s crucial that you know what you’re agreeing to before you sign up, recommended Michael Savino, Chief Lending Officer at Municipal Credit Union.
“Always read the fine print. Understand fees, repayment schedules, and what happens if you miss a payment or go into default,” said Savino.
In general, if you miss a buy now, pay later payment, you can face fees, interest, or the possibility of being banned from using the services in the future.
Avoid stacking BNPL loans
You can easily run into difficulty keeping up with the cost and schedule of your repayments if you're trying to simultaneously pay off two, three or more loans, Savino said.
“Juggling multiple plans creates a blind spot and overall debt load, and multiple repayment dates are hard to manage,” Savino said. ""So more loans makes it more difficult to budget.”
The best approach: Stay mindful of your overall spending, and limit the number of buy now, pay later loans.
Keep track of your loan(s)
Whether or not you're paying for multiple buy now, pay later purchases at once, you want to be aware of where your money is going at any given time, recommended Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma.
“Buy now, pay later often requires automatic payments, so you want to make sure that your account is funded so that those payments are processing successfully,” recommended Jennifer Seitz, director of education at Greenlight, a financial literacy app for families.
There are many ways to track your loan payments — from setting a reminder on your calendar, to creating an intricate excel spreadsheet or tracking them on an app, said Jesse Mecham, founder of the budgeting app YNAB.
Finding the best method that works for you will help you stay on track and avoid late fees.
Make buy now, pay later work for you
For shoppers with low credit scores or no credit history, buy now, pay later loans can seem like the best, if not the only, loan option. If used moderately and responsibly, these short-term loans can be a positive lending exercise, said Savino.
“It allows you to to establish a baseline (and) get access to other affordable credit options that you can leverage that will ultimately provide financial wellness,” he added.
Still, NerdWallet's Rathner emphasized that shoppers using these tools always remember that buy now, pay later is a form of borrowing money.
“It just kind of feels like you’re given a little extra time to pay back,"" Rathner said. ""But the reality is, if you miss payments, it can hurt your credit, much like missing payments with any other loan.”

According to last year's ""Crypto Wealth Report"" from Henley & Partners, there are now 85,400 Bitcoin millionaires in the world, and the number continues to grow at a rapid pace.
There's a good reason for that. For much of the past decade, Bitcoin has been the top-performing asset in the world. But how much longer can Bitcoin continue to grind out these head-spinning returns? If you're hoping to become a crypto millionaire, it's essential to get the answer to this question right.
Institutional adoption
Right now, the key investment thesis for Bitcoin is institutional adoption. In other words, it's no longer just individual investors who are buying Bitcoin. It's now corporations, Bitcoin treasury companies, and even sovereign governments. Everyone these days, it seems, is trying to buy as much Bitcoin as they possibly can.
Take Strategy(NASDAQ: MSTR), for example. The company formerly known as MicroStrategy has been on an epic Bitcoin-buying binge since August 2020 and currently ranks as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world, with a stash worth an estimated $72 billion. Inspired by Strategy's example, dozens of other companies are now reinventing themselves as Bitcoin treasury companies.
At the same time, the U.S. government has become a huge proponent of Bitcoin. The big step this year was the proposed establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Right now, this fund would only be allowed to acquire Bitcoin in a budget-neutral way. In other words, it could't use taxpayer money to buy more Bitcoin. Yet, it's likely that the government will find a workaround. Some have suggested, for example, that tariff revenue might be used to fund Bitcoin purchases.
Is Bitcoin really going to hit $21 million per coin?
So, given all this institutional adoption, it's easy to see why analysts, investors, and Bitcoin evangelists are steadily cranking up their future price estimates. At one time, setting a price forecast of $1 million was considered a bold predication. Today, it's the base case scenario. According to Michael Saylor, founder and executive chairman of Strategy, his price target now is $21 million in 21 years.
So let's do the math. Currently, Bitcoin trades for about $114,000. For Bitcoin to hit $21 million, that implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28%. For most assets, that would be impossible. No asset grows at a CAGR of 28%! But this is Bitcoin we're talking about here. For Bitcoin, an annual return of 28% is considered a down year. This year, for example, Bitcoin is only up 22%, and it feels like a huge disappointment.
So, if you're trying to become a millionaire, you would need to invest $5,476 today in Bitcoin and then wait 21 years. Theoretically, if Bitcoin delivers on those forecasted 28% annual returns, you might just get there.
There's just one minor problem. All of this assumes that Bitcoin will continue to perform much like a high-flying tech stock. But what if Bitcoin starts to perform like digital gold, a term many use to describe its store-of-value qualities? That was the case earlier this year when investors sought out safe assets amid tariff uncertainty and landed on Bitcoin as a potential alternative.
And this is where things get interesting. If Bitcoin really is digital gold, as many investors now claim, then shouldn't it also perform like gold? During the past 10 years, the compound annual growth rate of gold has been about 10%. That's nowhere near the 28% annualized return for Bitcoin forecasted by Saylor.
So, let's run the numbers again, this time with a new CAGR of 10%. The results are not nearly as impressive. If we assume a CAGR of 10.8%, then Bitcoin will hit a price of $1 million after 21 years.
That's impressive, but it also means that investors are going to be facing a much bigger initial investment. Instead of only investing $5,476 upfront, an investor would need to invest $115,000. Suddenly, Bitcoin has gone from a cheap bet to a huge wager that few risk-averse investors will be comfortable taking.
And don't forget -- the price of Bitcoin does not just go straight up. If history is any guide, the price of Bitcoin tends to collapse every few years. For its entire existence, Bitcoin has very much been a boom-or-bust asset. During a span of 21 years, Bitcoin could have several severe downturns. We recently saw an example of this in 2022 when Bitcoin's price fell by 65%.
At the end of day, Bitcoin is still a potential millionaire maker due to its tremendous upside potential and the unprecedented level of institutional adoption. But just be aware -- the days of turning a few thousand bucks into $1 million may be over. These days, you might need to invest as much as $100,000 upfront to realize those crypto millionaire dreams.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-important-earnings-takeaways-opendoor-133337589.html,3dd43e045ae251ae53245a3b365dd383,4 Important Earnings Takeaways From Opendoor Technologies,4 Important Earnings Takeaways From Opendoor Technologies,2025-08-07 21:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Real estate technology company Opendoor Technologies(NASDAQ: OPEN) has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market recently. The clear leader in the iBuying industry, Opendoor recently attracted the attention of meme stock traders, which was fueled by hedge fund manager Eric Jackson posting a bullish investment thesis and projecting Opendoor could become a ""100-bagger"" in just a few years.
At the time, Opendoor traded for about $0.82 per share, so this implied an $82 price target.
To be fair, there has been some good news in recent weeks. Because the rally pushed Opendoor's share price well above $1, the company regained compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, and canceled a scheduled special meeting to approve a possible reverse split.
While the soaring stock price of the past month was certainly an impressive run, the company's second-quarter earnings may have just given investors a bit of a reality check. After the report, Opendoor dropped by about 20% -- still much higher than it was a month ago, but it is clear that the numbers are making at least some investors second-guess their positions. Here are some of the key takeaways from Opendoor's earnings that investors should keep in mind.
1. Second-quarter numbers were strong
On a positive note, Opendoor's second-quarter sales handily surpassed expectations. Analysts had expected $1.5 billion in revenue for the second quarter from the sale of nearly 4,300 homes, and Opendoor beat this by about $70 million.
On an adjusted basis, the company posted a loss of $0.01 per share, exactly what was expected and a completely manageable loss given the slow real estate market. And impressively, Opendoor generated its first adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) profit in more than three years.
2. The third quarter could be much worse than expected
Here's the main reason Opendoor's stock was under pressure after earnings. Opendoor's third-quarter sales guidance was much weaker than expected. While a slowdown was expected (the second quarter is seasonally strong), Opendoor is guiding for about $838 million in third-quarter revenue at the midpoint of its range, while analysts were looking for more than $1.2 billion.
Part of this slowdown is fueled by Opendoor's planned transition to a ""platform"" model, which essentially integrates agents and other parties to real estate transactions into the process. Early results are strong -- as opposed to the traditional direct-to-consumer model, more than twice as many customers are getting to the point of a final underwritten cash offer, and the platform should significantly boost capital-light commission revenue over time, leading to margin expansion.
It's also worth noting that Opendoor's homebuying volume was much slower than you might think, given its sales volume. The company only purchased 1,757 homes in the second quarter, 63% less than in the second quarter of 2024, and inventory is about $700 million lower than at the same point last year.
3. Management is planning for the worst
One quote that stood out in management's letter to shareholders said, ""Looking ahead, we believe housing market weakness will persist, and we are not assuming any near-term catalyst for improvement."" All of Opendoor's expectations are based on the assumption that mortgage rates will remain high and sales volume will remain slow.
Opendoor reported observing ""continually worsening housing conditions"" during the second quarter.
4. Opendoor needs market conditions to improve
As a final thought, it's important to consider the numbers in the context of the agonizingly slow real estate market in which Opendoor is operating. Not only are existing home sales volumes low, but interest rates remain stubbornly high, keeping Opendoor's holding costs elevated.
Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the quarter (and the few quarters before it) is that Opendoor is making the best out of a terrible market environment. If the Federal Reserve actually starts cutting interest rates later this year and mortgage rates start gravitating downward, it could be a major catalyst for Opendoor's top and bottom lines.
To be sure, an $82 share price might be a bit of a stretch, at least in the next few years, even if market conditions cooperate. But the fact that Opendoor is close to breakeven in a bad environment could be a sign to not count this disruptor out just yet.
Having said that, whatever happens, Opendoor is likely to be a very volatile stock, and there's still a lot that can go wrong. So invest accordingly, and don't risk money you can't afford to lose.

December-dated gold futures (GCZ25), the most actively traded contract, rose above the $3,500 mark on July 23 before paring back some gains. Spot gold also recently jumped, and is already up 29% year-to-date (YTD). While weak U.S. payrolls, rising Federal Reserve rate-cut bets, and a fresh round of tariffs are adding fuel, it’s the deeper structural forces that are doing the heavy lifting.
Central banks are loading up, with the majority planning to boost gold reserves within the next year. Layer in rising geopolitical tensions, surging debt, and gold’s tariff-exempt status, and bullion stands out not just as a commodity but as a strategic asset.
Money managers are following suit. Bullish bets on gold surged by the high teens to 170,868 contracts for the week ended July 22, hitting the highest level since April — well before the U.S. and European Union even started warming up trade talks. And with the dollar (DXY00) weakening, inflation still sticky, and rate cuts on the table, gold’s run has legs, flexing its safe-haven muscle hard.
If you’re looking to ride this rally wisely, you may want to keep your eye on Caledonia Mining (CMCL). This small-cap miner is turning heads with strong margins and a stake in Zimbabwe’s Blanket Mine, which delivered record-breaking second-quarter production numbers just weeks ago. With the full Q2 earnings report set to release next week and full-year production guidance raised, CMCL stock is gaining momentum right alongside gold.
Caledonia Mining stock is currently Barchart’s top-rated gold stock to buy.
About Caledonia Mining Stock
Founded in 1992, Jersey-based Caledonia Mining is building its legacy in the heart of Zimbabwe. With a 64% stake in the high-grade Blanket Mine and full ownership of Maligreen, Bilboes, and Motapa gold projects, the firm blends production strength with exploration potential. Caledonia Mining’s footprint spans from active mining to untapped reserves, positioning it as a rising force in Africa’s precious metals landscape with deep roots and a focused future.
The gold mining stock has surged 147% from its YTD low of $8.81, with shares seeing a 110% gain over the past 52 weeks. While CMCL did dip briefly late last month, the stock has been cushioned by the solid Q2 output from Blanket Mine and a bullish earnings outlook.
Plus, technically, CMCL stock’s 14-day RSI is at 46.69, neither overbought nor oversold, signaling possible consolidation.
One reason investors stick with Caledonia Mining is its steady payout. The company has been dishing out dividends for years, paying a $0.14 quarterly dividend. Its annualized dividend of $0.56 per share translates to a solid 2% yield, more than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF’s (SPY) 1.14% yield.
A Closer Look at Caledonia Mining’s Q1 Earnings Report
Gold may be the headline, but Caledonia Mining is quietly becoming the story. The company kicked off 2025 with an impressive Q1 earnings report on May 12. Revenue surged 46% year-over-year (YOY) to $56.2 million, fueled by a 9% boost in gold output and a 42% jump in average realized prices. Gross profit almost doubled annually to $26.9 million. Meanwhile, adjusted EPS rose to $0.585 from $0.097 in Q1 2024.
With 19,106 ounces of gold pulled from the ground, Q1 marked a high-water mark, thanks to operational refinements like plant-mine decoupling and sharper safety protocols.
That wasn’t all. Caledonia Mining also firmed up its balance sheet, ending the quarter with $18.6 million in net cash after closing its solar sale. Cost-cutting remains a top priority, with efforts underway to optimize the central shaft and streamline labor via new tracking systems.
In Q1, Blanket Mine produced 18,671 ounces of gold, up 9.5% annually. This was thanks to increased milled tonnage, which made up for a slight dip in grades. Meanwhile, the Bilboes oxide mine added another 435 ounces to the total.
Then came Q2, and another feather in the cap. The company announced that its Blanket Mine delivered 21,070 ounces of gold, the highest-ever for a second quarter. That nudged production for the first half of 2025 to 39,741 ounces, up 5.1% YOY. Riding that momentum, Caledonia Mining hiked its full-year guidance to between 75,500 ounces and 79,500 ounces.
CEO Mark Learmonth didn’t hold back regarding the results, noting, “Production in the first half of 2025 was excellent and has exceeded our expectations.”
And there’s more to come. Caledonia Mining is set to release its full Q2 and H1 results on Aug. 11, and the company is already telegraphing profitability. With gold prices on a tear and Blanket Mine firing on all cylinders, the momentum is hard to ignore.
What Do Analysts Expect for Caledonia Mining Stock?
Caledonia Mining is not exactly a household name on Wall Street, but it is making some serious noise. After the company reported record gold production at Blanket Mine for Q2, Maxim Group analyst Tate Sullivan raised his CMCL price target from $21 to $28, keeping a “Buy” rating. That kind of move says confidence is building.
Only one analyst covers CMCL stock, but it still holds a “Strong Buy"" rating. The $28 price target represents 29% potential upside from current levels for this under-the-radar gold mining stock.

Growth came in stronger than expected, and Venmo once again proved its value to the platform, posting more than 20% revenue growth and driving a 12% surge in payment volume. Even so, the market reaction was anything but enthusiastic. PYPL stock dropped 8.7% after the report, bringing a sharper question into focus for investors: is this weakness an opening to buy the dip, or a sign to reassess?
Part of the caution stemmed from what propped up some of the quarter’s key metrics. Transaction margin dollars (TM$) — a closely watched gauge of core profitability — rose 7%, marking the sixth straight quarter of growth. But that headline figure was inflated by a one-time boost tied to the renewal and expansion of a major payment partner agreement. Excluding that, TM$ momentum showed early signs of tapering.
Management acknowledged that, while transaction revenue should continue to trend upward, other value-added services are facing more resistance. Interest rate headwinds and difficult year-over-year (YOY) comps in credit are expected to slow that side of the business in the quarters ahead.
The selloff, then, was not a knee-jerk reaction. It reflected a more tactical adjustment to the underlying signals. Still, the broader narrative of PayPal’s strategic reset remains intact. For investors with a steady hand and a long-term horizon, this dip might not be a red flag, but a potential entry point worth considering.
About PayPal Stock
Headquartered in San Jose, California, PayPal is among the most trusted names in global digital payments. It serves both consumers and merchants through a seamless transaction ecosystem anchored by its flagship products, PayPal and Xoom.
Its peer-to-peer service, Venmo, has been pivotal in expanding the company’s payment volume and deepening user engagement across demographics. With a market capitalization of $65 billion, the company remains a dominant force in fintech.
Over the last 52 weeks, however, PYPL stock has underperformed, up 12% but trailing the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF), which has gained 26% in the same period. The latest earnings miss triggered a sharper reaction. For the past five trading days, PYPL is down 5%, reflecting disappointment despite the beat.
Valuation tells a more nuanced story. The stock trades at 12.8 times adjusted forward earnings and 2 times sales. These figures come in well below its own five-year averages, suggesting the market may be underestimating its earnings potential.
PayPal Surpasses Q2 Earnings
On July 29, PayPal delivered Q2 2025 results, handily surpassing consensus expectations. The company reported revenue of $8.29 billion, up 5.1% from a year earlier and ahead of analysts' forecast of $8.08 billion. Adjusted EPS hit $1.40, rising 17.6% YOY and beating the $1.30 per share estimate.
The headline figures marked a clear win, but the underlying trends painted a more layered picture. Transaction margin dollars totaled $3.84 billion, rising 7% and extending the streak to six consecutive quarters of growth. Yet, when factoring out a one-time benefit from a strategic payment partnership, momentum showed signs of cooling.
Meanwhile, adjusted free cash flow — one of the most closely watched figures in any fintech balance sheet — plunged 42.5% to $656 million. That was nearly two-thirds below analyst expectations and down from $1.4 billion in Q1.
Still, some key metrics held firm. Total payment volume (TPV) stood at $443.5 billion, exceeding projections of $433.6 billion. Active accounts rose 2% to 438 million, nudging past expectations of 437.8 million. These gains suggest PayPal’s core franchise remains intact, despite the margin pressure and rising costs.
Looking ahead, management is guiding for Q3 adjusted EPS between $1.18 and $1.22. Transaction margin dollars are expected to grow by 4%, reaching between $3.76 billion and $3.82 billion.
For the full year, adjusted EPS is now forecast between $5.15 and $5.30. The company also expects annual free cash flow between $6 billion and $7 billion, indicating confidence in its ability to rebound in the second half of the year.
Meanwhile, analysts expect Q3 2025 EPS to come in at $1.20. For the full fiscal year 2025, the bottom line is estimated to grow 12.9% from the prior year to $5.25. Moreover, for fiscal year 2026, EPS is predicted to increase 9.9% from the previous year to $5.77.
What Do Analysts Expect for PayPal Stock?
Analysts are largely keeping faith in PYPL’s recovery path. Canaccord Genuity has reaffirmed its “Buy” rating on the stock, setting a target price of $96 following the Q2 print. The firm pointed to strength in Venmo and better-than-expected earnings as reasons to stay constructive on the name.
Among 43 analysts covering PYPL stock, the consensus stands at “Moderate Buy."" Some 15 analysts maintain a “Strong Buy"" rating, two have a “Moderate Buy,” 23 advise to “Hold,” and three analysts recommend a “Strong Sell"" rating.
PYPL stock’s average price target of $81.14 represents potential upside of 20%. On the more bullish end, the Street-high target of $105 represents 55% potential upside from current levels.

Space and defense technology company Firefly Aerospace made its public debut on Thursday August 7, 2025, marking another trailblazing Texas company tapping Nasdaq as its partner for joining public markets.
“The Opening Bell Ceremony on an IPO day doesn’t just begin a trading day – it signals the launch of a new chapter. And for a company that has mastered the art of launching, landing, and operating in space, there’s no better metaphor for today,” said Rachel Racz, Nasdaq Senior Vice President and Head of Listings for Texas, Southern U.S., and Latin America.
“For Firefly, it’s always been about more than just reaching the stars. Their culture embraces a unique can-do spirit where they encourage each other to dream big. This group of believers and doers has been able to transform so many bold ideas into remarkable achievements by taking on calculated risks and flawlessly executing. ” said Racz.
Firefly joins over 200 other Texan innovators who are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market®, representing nearly $1.8 trillion in market capitalization. That includes Irving, Texas-based cancer diagnostic firm Caris Life Sciences, which celebrated its initial public offering at Nasdaq MarketSite® in June.
Along with the many listings that have come to Nasdaq from Texas, the exchange has also welcomed more than 25 Texan companies that have transferred their corporate listings from other exchanges, including Texas Instruments, Baker Hughes, American Airlines, and Noble Energy.
$47 billion consumer staples giant Kimberly-Clark became the latest Texas-based industry leader to make the switch to Nasdaq when it joined the exchange in May.
“The most special thing about Texas is the people. As a Texan, I’ve had a front-row seat to the stratospheric growth of the economy,” Racz told Nasdaq Newsroom. “This growth has been built on innovation, financial strength, and strong local communities.”
Nasdaq has proudly supported the broader Southeast regional economy for nearly two decades, partnering with over 2,000 clients, approximately 800 of which are based in Texas.
In May, Nasdaq stood alongside Texas Governor Greg Abbott as he signed Senate Bill 29 – a landmark legislation that empowers board directors and company leaders to make good-faith and thoughtful decisions without the constant threat of burdensome and costly litigation.
“Senate Bill 29 is a milestone for corporate governance in Texas. By embracing smart, innovation-focused regulation like SB 29, Texas is showing the world what it means to lead on economic growth and modern, clear governance principles,” said Ed Knight, Executive Vice Chairman of Nasdaq. “We commend Senator Bryan Hughes, Representative Morgan Meyer, and Governor Greg Abbott for advancing legislation that strengthens Texas’ position as a global center for capital formation.”
Earlier this year, Nasdaq further deepened its commitment to Texas by announcing plans for a new regional headquarters in Dallas and expanded investment in the Lone Star State.
“Texas is booming” Racz said. “And Nasdaq is so excited and proud to be part of it.”

Here what you need to know,Trump historic new tariffs are now in effect . Here what you need to know,2025-08-07 05:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"President Donald Trump just enacted a new wave of tariffs on dozens of America’s trading partners, marking a substantial escalation in ongoing trade tensions that could constitute the biggest change to the global economy in nearly a century.
The historic new trade policy follows months of false starts to Trump’s so-called “reciprocal” tariff rollout and countless bilateral trade negotiations, a handful of which resulted in agreements that fended off even higher tariffs.
Trump and his economic advisers have celebrated the considerably higher tariffs that have already gone into effect, correctly noting that they have raised more than $100 billion in tax revenue without leading to catastrophic inflation or a recession, as some economists had feared.
The president is moving forward with new, significantly more aggressive tariffs that economists fear could exacerbate budding economic problems, including rising inflation and slowing job growth, that are just now becoming more apparent.
Here’s what to know about the tariffs:
What are the new rates?
Before Thursday, virtually every country’s goods were subject to a minimum 10% tariff. Now rates vary substantially from country to country.
The highest rates imposed are on goods from Brazil (50%), Laos (40%), Myanmar (40%), Switzerland (39%), Iraq (35%) and Serbia (35%).
An additional 21 countries also face levies greater than 15%. That includes several countries the US relies heavily on for a variety of goods, such as Vietnam (20%), India (25%), Taiwan (20%) and Thailand (19%).
Goods from India could also be subject to an additional 25% tariff stacked on top of that because of an executive order Trump signed Wednesday that seeks to penalize India for purchasing oil from Russia. That second tariff is slated to take effect on August 27.
Thirty-nine countries’ goods, as well as members of the European Union, are subject to 15% tariffs, according to a list the White House published last week.
Besides Canada and Mexico, all other countries the US imports goods from will continue to face a minimum 10% tariff, albeit with a few exemptions.
Goods from Mexico and Canada are exempt from tariffs if they’re compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free-trade agreement. If not, goods from Mexico are subject to 25% tariffs, while goods from Canada are subject to 35% tariffs, up from 25% previously.
What’s the deal with the trade deals?
In most cases, they’re not exactly trade deals, per se, but rather rough sketches of ones that could take months, or even years, to finalize — assuming they don’t fall apart.
Over the past five months, Trump announced eight trade agreements. Of those, only two — with the United Kingdom and China — have been formalized. The agreement with China, which significantly lowered tariff rates both countries imposed on one another’s goods, expires on August 12. If both countries fail to act, rates could spike again.
Most agreements Trump announced involve trading partners committing to purchasing more American products, like oil, cars, Boeing airplanes, defense equipment and agricultural goods. They also involve hundreds of billions of dollars worth of investments in American businesses.
But it’s unclear if the United States and other trading partners involved in agreements are on the same page about many of the proposed terms. For instance, Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and a lead Japanese trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, both recently said many key details are still being worked out and are telling a vastly different story from Trump, who earlier this week said the country agreed to buy Ford F-150s.
Are any goods exempt from the new tariffs?
Yes, plenty.
One notable exemption is smartphones, which aren’t subject to any of the new rates. Additionally, goods for which Trump imposed separate sectoral tariffs or ordered investigations that could result in higher rates won’t be stacked on top of country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs.
For the time being, that means pharmaceuticals, for instance, could be imported from countries duty-free. However, Trump is warning they could soon face significantly higher rates.
The EU sought to preempt those tariffs by negotiating a 15% tax on pharma exports to the US as part of the agreement announced with Trump. Other countries involved in trade agreements similarly are getting more favorable rates on certain sectoral tariffs.
There’s also a partial exemption for certain goods manufactured abroad where at least 20% of their value comes from American materials and labor.
When are these tariffs effective?
Technically they’re already in effect, but there’s a caveat.
The executive order Trump signed last week essentially states that most goods that were loaded on ships and in transit to the US before 12:01 am on Thursday will face whatever the prior tariff rates were until October 5.
This isn’t the end
In addition to pharma tariffs, Trump has threatened to impose across-the-board tariffs on semiconductors and lumber. At an Oval Office event on Wednesday, for example, Trump said he would soon place a 100% tariff on chips and semiconductors, although he didn’t give a timeline.
And while the tariffs Trump just enacted could ultimately be rendered illegal, pending an ongoing court challenge, the president has plenty of levers he can pull to keep pushing his agenda for higher tariffs.

In fact, these shares are rising after the announcement, and here's why. Trump said Wednesday companies that are ""building in the United States"" will be exempt from the heavy levies. Still, specifics about the plan, such as how much U.S. manufacturing a company needs to do in order to qualify for the tariff exemption, were not immediately clear. While the exact details are still pending, Wall Street analysts believe the news marked an overhang removal for the sector. On top of that, a swath of tech companies have already committed significant dollars to build out manufacturing footprints at home, making them ineligible for the 100% tariff. Apple made the latest pledge to increase domestic production as it seeks to avoid punishing tariffs. The tech giant announced it will spend an additional $100 billion on U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years. Several top chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor , Nvidia and GlobalFoundries , also have already vowed to manufacture some of their products in the U.S. Here is what Wall Street analysts are saying about Trump's tariff threat. Bank of America ""From a high level, the 100% headline number seems intimidating, but in practice we expect a much lower impact, as major foundries such as TSMC/Samsung/INTC, and major IDMs such as TXN/MU have all committed to building significant US manufacturing footprint. Many other analog vendors such as ADI, NXPI, MCHP also have hybrid structure where they can potentially allocate US factories to US demand. Overall, we note specific details of the Section 232 tariff structure are not yet announced, but they can remove the current overhang on the sector if companies are able to work through this headline impact."" Raymond James ""A top-line tariff of 100% for semiconductors is attention grabbing, but the carve-out for companies that are building/planning to build will likely result in a 0% tariff on a wide swath of products. This is important as products covered by a sectoral tariff are excluded from reciprocal tariffs. Overall, we view this as a positive development, but the lack of details raises significant questions about the final impact. Beneficiaries of this could include Apple (especially given that the announcement was made at a White House event with CEO Tim Cook), TSMC, Nvidia, Texas Instruments, Micron, and GlobalFoundries."" Morgan Stanley ""To some degree this outcome would be something of a relief. Yes, 100% tariffs are unpalatable but if companies are given time to restore them, the real tax is just the higher cost of building chips in the United States. It's also important to note that this will not happen in isolation - we would expect strong retaliatory tariffs everywhere. So where the immediate reaction is to buy companies with a large US manufacturing base, the real optimization is to be prepared for multipolarity - that is, to build in the regions where the product is consumed. To that end, we disagree with some of the consensus thinking on the device side. The reactionary beneficiaries are Intel, Texas Instruments, Global Foundries, and Amkor."" Bernstein ""At first glance the application of said tariffs, if applied to ""raw"" semiconductor imports, would be a bit painful but likely manageable as the US does not import a ton of raw chips (~$45B worth in 2024, with almost half coming from Taiwan and Malaysia). However, the actual implementation is apparently going to be considerably more complicated (with some potential material reprieves), as he indicated that companies building, or committing to build, in the US will in fact face no tariffs."" Goldman Sachs ""We believe it is likely that some semiconductor companies may choose to increase their investment footprints in the US in order to avoid potential tariff impacts. While we await more details to fully assess the impact across our coverage, we believe a sub-segment of our coverage may be at reduced risk of these sectoral tariffs by virtue of their explicit mention in the press conference or contemporaneous press releases. For reference, these companies include: Texas Instruments, Applied Materials, TSMC, Nvidia, Broadcom, Intel, GlobalFoundries, Micron, IBM, Samsung Electronics, Amkor, GlobalWafers, Corning, and Coherent. We believe that the short-term impact on some of these companies is that, all else equal, these named companies may be perceived as ""tariff beneficiaries"" in the near term, pending more details on implementation."" JPMorgan ""Apple and Tim Cook delivered a masterclass in managing uncertainty after months and months of overhang relative to the potential challenges the company could face from tariffs. For Apple, this marks a significant increase in investment in the component supply chain in the US, although stopping short of investments in relation to final assembly, but also largely comprising a re-routing of investments to the US rather than incremental investments from a global perspective. Additionally, the exemption from tariffs suggested for Apple on account of the higher investments flips the narrative on the overhang on the shares in relation to tariff uncertainty to now position the company to have the least tariff associated risk relative to Hardware peers, which have to navigate the suggested 100% tariff on semiconductors.""",dd5a1c8db946c48853cc6d85e15fbb01,trafilatura,5416,0

Should You Buy the Weakness or Stay on the Sidelines ? ,SoFi Stock Has Lost Momentum . Should You Buy the Weakness or Stay on the Sidelines ? ,2025-08-07 16:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"While SoFi stock (SOFI) is still up 44.5% for the year, it is down 11.4% from its recent highs. The stock had rallied following its Q2 2025 earnings release last month and soared to a multi-year high of $25.11. SoFi has, however, since lost momentum. In this article, we’ll examine whether it makes sense to buy the dip or if investors should wait for a better price level. Let’s begin by looking at SoFi’s Q2 earnings.
SoFi Reported Strong Q2 Earnings
SoFi reported a stellar set of numbers in the second quarter. Its adjusted revenues rose 44% year-over-year to $858.2 million, which easily surpassed the $804.2 million that analysts were expecting. It was the highest percentage growth rate in two years, and that too off a higher base. The adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose 81% YoY to $249 million, significantly ahead of the $208.5 million that analysts had modeled.
The company’s members rose 34% YoY to 11.7 million as it added a record 850,000 members in the quarter. The company hit several records in the quarter, but here are a few notable ones.
Loan originations rose to a record $8.8 billion: Specifically, personal loan originations rose by 66% YoY while the corresponding increase in student loan and home loan originations was 35% and 92%, respectively. Importantly, the company’s lending business is growing with improving credit metrics, and the Q2 annual charge-off rate in personal loans fell to 2.83% as compared to 3.31% in Q1. Moreover, the on-balance-sheet 90-day delinquency rate for personal loans declined for the fifth consecutive quarter, coming in at 0.42% in Q2.
Fee-based revenue rose 72% YoY to $377.5 million: The company’s loan platform business generated $2.4 billion in loans on behalf of third parties in Q2. It is a high margin, low risk business for SoFi running at an annualized originations of over $9.5 billion with an annual revenue run rate in excess of half a billion dollars. SoFi’s total fee-based revenue has reached an annualized rate of $1.5 billion, which is quite encouraging.
After the Q2 earnings beat, SoFi raised its annual revenue and profit guidance. I would agree that it was an “exceptional second quarter” for SoFi, as CEO Anthony Noto said in his prepared remarks.
SoFi Stock Forecast
After SoFi’s Q2 earnings release, several brokerages, including Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Needham, and Mizuho, raised their target prices. However, while analysts have gradually raised their target prices, SoFi stock has invariably been trading above what the average sell-side analyst believes it is worth.
The stock has a consensus rating of “Hold” from the 23 analysts as polled by Barchart. Sell-side sentiment toward SoFi hasn’t changed much, and last week Redburn Atlantic initiated coverage on the stock with a “Neutral” rating and $20.50 target price. As I have stated before, the breaking point between sell-side analysts and SoFi is the company’s valuations, which are arguably higher than a traditional bank.
However, the multiples should be seen in the light of its unique business, which is a blend of a bank and a tech company. As Noto said in an interview with CNBC, SoFi is seeing the “growth of a technology company and the profitability of a financial company.”
What Could Drive SoFi’s Growth?
I believe SoFi should command a premium over financial companies, given the mix of its business. Having the banking charter helps SoFi gain access to low-cost member deposits and lowers its reliance on high-cost wholesale borrowing. It also has a tech and financial services business, which is fee-based. Importantly, since the Financial Services and Technology Platform segment is growing at a faster pace than the lending business, its share in SoFi’s revenue mix has been rising and reached 55% in Q2. A growing percentage of fee-based revenues bodes well for SoFi’s valuations.
The expected fall in interest rates could be a tailwind for SoFi’s home loan refinance business, as 3 million of its members have a home loan with another institution, and SoFi could target them for refinancing as interest rates fall further.
SoFi has also been signing up institutional clients, among others, for co-branded debit cards. Between Q1 2025 and Q1 2026, the company expects 10 such clients, which would mean incremental revenues next year. Crypto trading could be yet another growth driver for SoFi next year.
SoFi’s Valuations Are Not Exorbitant
SoFi expected optimism over meeting its 2026 EPS forecast of $0.55 to $0.80 in 2026. At the midpoint of that guidance, we get a 2026 price-earnings (P/E) multiple of 31.8x. The multiple would fall to 26.8x if SoFi were to hit the top end of its guidance.
Those who have been following SoFi for a while will agree that the company ends up beating its guidance quite often, and I don’t have a reason to believe that 2026 will be any different. While SoFi’s valuations don’t appear mouthwatering here, they are not exorbitant eitheṛ
Overall, given the kind of growth engine SoFi has been despite the higher base, I am comfortable holding the shares at these levels even as they might have hit a short-term peak. As for adding more, I would like to wait a bit.

Thanks to his company’s roaring IPO, his net worth has soared to $5 billion. And for the tech founder, the milestone is more than just a financial win—it’s a validation of his decision to drop out of an Ivy League university.
Figma burst onto the public markets last week, surging in share price by 333% and hitting a market cap of over $70 billion in just the first few days of trading.
For investors bullish on startups, last week was a rejuvenation after a sluggish stretch in the IPO market. But for Figma cofounder and CEO Dylan Field, last week not only helped propel his net worth to about $5 billion—it was also a validation that his decision to abandon an Ivy League education at Brown University was well worth it, a choice made possible by Peter Thiel.
In the early 2010s—with lines on his résumé detailing work at LinkedIn, Microsoft, and Flipboard—Field applied for the Thiel Fellowship, a program funded by the billionaire that gave $100,000 to young people who “want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom” (the prize has since doubled to $200,000). At the time, his parents admitted they were skeptical, with his mom telling CNBC that she feared Field would want a degree to fall back on later in life.
“I’m quite nervous, yeah,” Field’s father, Andy, said. “Most startups do fail. I think he has a good shot, but certainly not a sure thing by any means.”
After being awarded the fellowship, Field felt confident it was the right move—especially since he had once considered dropping out of high school owing to his struggles with structured education. In 2012, the same year Facebook went public (a company also created by a dropout enabled by Thiel), Field left school to build Figma. The rest is billion-dollar history.
Fortune reached out to Field for comment.
Billionaires who made it big after dropping out
Field is far from the first highly successful individual to have carved their own path in business without having walked across the stage to obtain a college diploma. In fact, many of the richest people on earth can call themselves college dropouts.
Mark Zuckerberg
Perhaps one of the most well-known college dropouts, Zuckerberg ditched his Harvard dorm in 2004 to move to California and dedicate his time to creating Facebook. Zuckerberg received an honorary doctorate from the school in 2017. His current net worth is about $272 billion.
Jack Dorsey
The cofounder of Twitter and Block, Jack Dorsey is a double dropout. After a brief stint at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Dorsey called it quits before trying again at New York University. One semester before he would have graduated in 1999, Dorsey ditched school to focus on founding Twitter. After selling the social media platform to Elon Musk in 2022, he came home with a $268 million windfall. His current net worth is about $4.7 billion.
Sam Altman
Sam Altman dropped out of Stanford University in 2005 to work on his first startup: Loopt, a location-sharing app. By 2015, he had helped cofound OpenAI, the leading AI organization behind ChatGPT. His net worth is now about $2 billion.
Larry Ellison
Larry Ellison, cofounder of Oracle, first attended the University of Illinois thinking he might one day become a doctor. After the death of his adoptive mother, he dropped out, then later attended the University of Chicago. While he never obtained a degree from either institution, his move to California opened doors into the tech industry. After jumping from job to job, he met Bob Miner and Ed Oates, and together they created the company that would later become Oracle. He is currently the second-richest person in the world, with a net worth of just over $300 billion.
Bill Gates
Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates enrolled at Harvard University in 1973 before leaving two years later to lead the computer company. While he admitted in the early years he wanted to return to school and finish his degree, he’s since become one of the most recognized names in the world. His net worth is about $123 billion.
Why Gen Zers are turning their backs on higher education
Being a college dropout is by no means the secret to becoming a billionaire—after all, many top business leaders have multiple degrees to their name, such as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook.
However, Gen Z is increasingly having doubts about whether the promise of a high-paying, secure job after spending four years on campus will be fulfilled; more than a third of graduates believe their degree was a “waste of money,” according to a recent survey by Indeed.
With millions of young people unable to find jobs in their desired industry, there may be some validity to their concerns. Zuckerberg suggested the disconnect may come from colleges being out of sync with today’s workforce needs.
“I’m not sure that college is preparing people for the jobs that they need to have today. I think that there’s a big issue on that, and all the student debt issues are … really big,” he said on This Past Weekend, a podcast with Theo Von.
“The fact that college is just so expensive for so many people, and then you graduate and you’re in debt.”",6952a6837f5c0f010789add10029f257,trafilatura,5392,0

Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.
In June 2010, Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett started what could be described as the world's most ambitious fundraising drive. After promising to give away the vast majority of their wealth, the trio asked their ultra-wealthy peers to pledge at least half of their assets to charity during their lifetimes or in their estates.
In two months, the Giving Pledge garnered signatures from 40 of America's richest families and individuals to sign up. That first batch of pledgers, including Michael Bloomberg and David Rockefeller, was announced 15 years ago this week.
In the years since, the Giving Pledge has lost steam when it comes to enrollment. By the end of 2010, 57 signatories representing an estimated 14% of America's billionaires had made the nonbinding commitment, according to a recent report by the Institute for Policy Studies. Currently, the pledge has commitments from 256 individuals, couples and families, including 110 American billionaires, per the progressive think tank. This group makes up 12% of the U.S. billionaire population as estimated by Forbes.
The annual number of sign-ups has also flagged since that first year. Even in 2020 when the pandemic spurred wealthy donors to give more, the Giving Pledge only earned 12 new signatories. This past May, the pledge welcomed 11 new members, a marked improvement over 2024's record low of four.
Meanwhile, over the past 10 years, the number of billionaires worldwide has increased by more than half to 2,891, according to UBS. Their wealth also doubled by more than half to an estimated $15.7 trillion, UBS said.
""It's disappointing in that you would hope more people would step up,"" said Chuck Collins, program director at the IPS and great-grandson of the meatpacker Oscar Mayer.
Collins, a co-author of the report, said the rapid increase in wealth may be partly to blame. This surge in wealth has also made it challenging for the pledgers to give away their money fast enough.
""Some of this is fairly sudden, the wealth growth,"" he said, ""so you got to give people ... a decade of slack, if you just land in the billionaire class to figure it out.""
Whether the Giving Pledge has been successful depends on whom you ask. The IPS report described the Giving Pledge as ""unfulfilled, unfulfillable, and not our ticket to a fairer, better future"" and identified only one living couple to have fulfilled the pledge, John and Laura Arnold.
A spokesperson for the Giving Pledge described the IPS report as ""misleading,"" and said the IPS used incomplete data and excluded ""significant forms of charitable giving,"" including gifts to foundations.
""For fifteen years, the Giving Pledge has helped create new norms of generosity and grown into a connected and active global learning community,"" a spokesperson wrote in a statement to Inside Wealth.
Collins said the Giving Pledge has some merit, describing it as a ""community of peers among a group who don't have a lot of peers.""
Amir Pasic, dean of the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said it has had a lasting impact on how the wealthy think about their giving.
""I still think that it was really important attempt to socialize the new wealth that was emerging early on in this century,"" he said. ""We can interestingly debate how successful it has or hasn't been, but it's become a feature of the high-net-worth philanthropic landscape.""
Though Giving Pledge enrollment has stagnated, other efforts to accelerate giving have emerged, said Pasic, citing the collective Blue Meridian Partners.
And while some billionaires, particularly younger ones, may be reluctant to associate themselves with the Gateses and Buffett, it doesn't mean they aren't contributing in their own way, Pasic said.
""Buffett is the senior representative of new wealth at the beginning of this century. New representatives have emerged since then,"" he said.
According to Collins, impact investing and other alternatives to traditional philanthropy have gained traction, especially among the new class of tech billionaires. He gave the example of Oracle's Larry Ellison amending his pledge to focus his resources on technology research instead of traditional nonprofit organizations.
""I think there's a little more blurring between for profit and nonprofit, charity versus impact investing,"" Collins said.
Venture capital billionaire Marc Andreessen has gone so far as to declare that innovating technology — and amassing personal riches in the process — is philanthropic in and of itself.
""Who gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives? QED,"" he wrote in 2023.
Pasic said it is possible that Bill Gates' recent commitment to give away virtually all of his wealth over the next 20 years may bring new urgency to the Giving Pledge.
""I think that remains to be seen,"" he said, ""whether it's going to end up being more of a kind of a private club that becomes less relevant or if it'll be the beginning of something broader, gaining new energy in this turbulent time and or spawning other kinds of groups ... or other collectives.""",ebf106d8783a18d25c66be8041f58c23,trafilatura,5377,0

Even Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which controls close to 40% of e-commerce in the U.S. and has the largest cloud computing business in the world, hasn't been able to overtake it, although it's likely to in the near future.
Walmart stock outperformed the market by a wide margin last year, gaining triple the S&P 500's 25% return, but its momentum is slowing in 2025. However, it's still a great buy for the value investor. If you're looking for a top value stock to buy today, here are three reasons why Walmart is an excellent candidate.
1. E-commerce is on the rise
Amazon may be the leader of e-commerce, but Walmart knows where its strengths lie. It's all-in on leveraging its edge, and Amazon's weakness, to grow its e-commerce presence.
Although Walmart only accounts for 6% to 7% of U.S. e-commerce sales, well below Amazon's share, Walmart is growing a lot faster these days. In the 2026 fiscal first quarter (ended April 30), U.S. e-commerce sales increased 22% year over year. Amazon's online stores sales and third-party sellers sales both increased 11% year over year in the second quarter, up from 5% and 6% respectively in Q1.
Walmart has about 4,600 retail stores in the U.S. -- more than double the number of rival Target, almost triple the number of premium grocer Kroger, and quadruple the number of Costco Wholesale. These stores are built-in distribution centers, and Walmart is using them as last-mile delivery hubs to get orders out faster and cheaper, since it has many of the products customers order on hand at all times. It already has a powerful distribution model for getting products into these stores, making it efficient to use them for e-commerce as well.
Another way Walmart is leveraging its store count is for pickup. There's a Walmart or Sam's Club store within 10 miles of 90% of the U.S. population, and people who don't want to wait for an order have an easy time picking it up at their local Walmart. In the first quarter, deliveries in under three hours increased 91% year over year.
This is a model Amazon can't replicate. Amazon has tried to develop some kind of physical presence for years, with mixed results. This is where Walmart dominates. While this may not ever make Walmart No. 1 in U.S. e-commerce, it should ensure the company's growth and ability to stay in a steady second place for the foreseeable future.
2. It's unbeatable in retail
E-commerce still represents a small percentage of Walmart's total sales, about 13% in Q1. Its total sales were $166 billion in the quarter, and they continue to increase, up 2.5% year over year. There is no other retailer that can come close to that, even when you include e-commerce. Amazon may overtake Walmart soon as the largest company, since it hit $167 billion in sales in the second quarter, but only about $100 million of that came from retail.
Walmart management continues to raise the bar for what it offers, renovating stores, making them more efficient, and changing the product assortment to meet different demand. The company is also finding new ways to boost engagement and revenue, such as its membership program and its advertising business. Membership grew 10% over last year in Q1, and membership fee income was up 15%.
Walmart also got investor approval for being resistant to tariffs, since much of its merchandise is made in the U.S., and leverage with suppliers means it can change packaging and production to come in even lower on cost. Finally, despite its size, the company also sees further opportunity to open new stores, and it opened 212 new stores in Q1.
3. It's a Dividend King
Value investors love a great dividend stock, and Walmart fits the bill. It doesn't have a high yield, only 0.9% at the current price, but it's growing, and it's reliable. Walmart is a Dividend King, which means the company has raised its dividend for at least 50 years. Walmart recently joined the club, and it raised the dividend for the 52nd straight year in March.
Walmart stock still packs a strong punch, and if you're looking for a stable and powerful value stock, Walmart could be an excellent addition to your portfolio.

Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States.
“I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,” Trump said Wednesday. He said the U.S. was “taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,” but did not provide a specific figure for revenues because “we don’t even know what the final number is” regarding the rates.
Despite the uncertainty, the White House is confident that the onset of his tariffs will provide clarity about the path for the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance America as a manufacturing power.
So far, however, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to the U.S. as companies and consumers brace for the impact of the new taxes.
Risk of economic erosion
Hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after the initial tariff rollout in April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.
“A less productive economy requires fewer workers,” Silvia said. “But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.”
Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded.
“It’s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down,"" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University.
Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce America's persistent trade deficit. But importers tried to avoid the taxes by bringing in more goods before the tariffs took effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.
The economic pain is not confined to the U.S.
Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariffs took hold. “The new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,” said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.
Dismay in India and Switzerland
The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and renegotiated.
Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India because of its purchases of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.
A leading group of Indian exporters said that will affect nearly 55% of the country’s outbound shipments to America and force exporters to lose long-standing clients.
“Absorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable. Margins are already thin,” S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organizations, said in a statement.
The Swiss executive branch, the Federal Council, was expected to meet Thursday after President Karin Keller-Sutter and other Swiss officials returned from a hastily arranged trip to Washington in a failed bid to avert a 39% U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods.
Import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs, and Trump announced 100% tariffs on computer chips. That could leave the U.S. economy in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impact.
Stock market remains solid
The president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is under a legal challenge. Even people who worked with Trump during his first term are skeptical, such as Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who was House speaker.
“There’s no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,” Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday.
Trump is aware of the risk that courts could overturn his tariffs. In a Truth Social tweet, he said, ""THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA’S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!""
The stock market has been solid during the tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measure signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.
On the global financial markets, indexes rose across much of Europe and Asia, while stocks were slipping on Wall Street.
But ING's Brzeski warned: “While financial markets seem to have grown numb to tariff announcements, let’s not forget that their adverse effects on economies will gradually unfold over time.”
Trump foresees an economic boom. American voters and the rest of the world wait, nervously.
“There’s one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he’s creating, and that’s Donald Trump,” said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. “The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.”",532169370c61f045bd2e3441a71fd470,trafilatura,5357,0

Read This Before You Collect Your First Social Security Check . ,2025-08-07 01:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"If you plan to retire in 2035, the countdown has begun. Now is a great time to make a checklist of all you need (and want) to accomplish over the next decade and use that list as your map to a financially healthy retirement. Before ever collecting your first Social Security check, make it a point to address the following:
Investments
You're on the final lap. You have 10 good years to contribute to the investments most likely to help you build a hefty nest egg. If you're behind, do what you can to max out your retirement accounts, particularly if your employer offers to match a percentage of your contributions.
Financial planning
Figure out where you stand; is there a financial gap you need to fill before retiring? Here's how to determine your current state of affairs:
Check your assets
It's not enough to know your portfolio balance. You should know how much risk you carry and if you're properly diversified. When you're decades away from retirement, you may be comfortable carrying more high-risk/high-reward assets. When you're young, your portfolio has plenty of time to recover after taking a hit.
However, many financial advisors suggest shifting toward investments with moderate growth that are likely to preserve your capital, although this is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Take the time to meet with a financial or retirement advisor who will be honest about what it will take to meet your retirement goals based on what you've built so far.
Create a post-retirement budget
What matters is being able to finance life after you retire, and that picture looks different for everyone. Create a budget based on the available information. It may not be exact (no one can see the future), but you can get an idea of what you're working toward.
Here's how it works:
List all known sources of post-retirement income: Social Security, pension, annuities, rental property, royalties, retirement fund withdrawals, and any other source of income you expect to receive.
List all expected expenses: Include housing, transportation, utilities, food, income and property taxes, homeowners association fees, pet care, and any other expense specific to your lifestyle. Don't forget to add things you'll want to spend money on, like hobbies, travel, and gifts.
Once you subtract expected expenses from expected income, you'll know how close you are to covering your monthly outlay.
Savings
If you haven't already, begin to tuck money away to invest during post-retirement bear markets. A bear market -- when stock prices decline by 20% or more from a recent high -- may seem scary, but it's actually a good time to take advantage of low prices by picking up high-quality stocks at a low price.
The idea is to have funds put away to draw from, instead of drawing down your retirement account while the market is depressed. Here's why: When stock values are low, you must sell more assets than you usually would to come up with the same amount of money. When you have a cash fund to draw from instead, you can leave the money in your retirement account and use it to buy those discounted high-quality stocks.
Debt reduction
Some insist on retiring with zero debt, and that's a worthy goal. But it's not necessary for everyone. For example, if you know you'll still have a monthly mortgage payment after retirement, take these final 10 years to plan for the expense.
Just make it a point to pay off any debt that carries a high interest rate. Once that's done, put the money to work by saving or investing it to pad your nest egg.
Healthcare planning
Learn all you can about how Medicare works and get an idea of your monthly out-of-pocket expenses. As you move toward retirement, get serious about regular exercise and a healthy diet. Both can help prevent age-related health issues and potentially lower your healthcare costs.
Estate planning
Take a fresh look at your estate plan to ensure your will, power of attorney, and healthcare proxy reflect your current wishes. Make sure your beneficiaries are up to date. You may also want to share your estate plans with family members to prevent future disputes, although that decision is entirely up to you.
""Swedish death cleaning""
Despite the dark name, Swedish death cleaning is a method of decluttering and organizing your home before you die, saving your loved ones the headache.
It's a nice thing to do, and Swedish death cleaning also allows you to decide whether your current home suits your future needs. For example, if you live in a four-story townhouse, you may prefer to age in place in a home on one floor, or you may come up with ideas for modifying your current home.
Having 10 years left to prepare for retirement means you still have some control over the outcome: Make a plan, stay focused, and imagine yourself living the retirement of your dreams.
The $23,760 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook
If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income.

Dive Brief:
Tesla, its CEO Elon Musk, CFO Vaibhav Taneja, and former CFO Zachary Kirkhorn concealed “significant risk” related to the electric vehicle maker’s autonomous driving technology, making materially false and misleading statements about the technology’s safety and potential, according to a federal securities class action complaint filed Monday in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.
The complaint, which names the three current and former company executives as defendants, was filed by Denise Morand on behalf of company stockholders which purchased shares between April 19, 2023 and June 22, 2025. It alleges the named defendants committed securities fraud by failing to disclose the risks associated with the EV maker’s autonomous vehicle technology, including robotaxis, and that, “accordingly, Tesla’s business and/or financial prospects were overstated,” the complaint reads. “As a result, the Company’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.”
By failing to disclose such risks, the three defendants participated in a scheme to “deceive the investing public” and “artificially inflate and maintain the market price of Tesla securities. Specifically, the complaint alleges “defendants Kirkhorn and Taneja enriched themselves by engaging in insider sales of the shares while those shares traded at artificially high prices.” During the period in question, Kirkhorn sold approximately 7,403 shares of Tesla stock with a value of at least $1.59 million, while Taneja sold about 8,192 shares of Tesla stock for at least $2.51 million, according to the complaint.
Dive Insight:
Both Kirkhorn and Taneja have reaped multi-million dollar pay packages during their respective tenures as finance chief for the Austin, Texas-based EV maker. Kirkhorn departed from the EV maker in 2023 with a $590 million pay package, after a 13-year tenure with Tesla that included four years in its top financial seat, CFO Dive reported at the time.
Taneja, meanwhile, who succeeded Kirkhorn as CFO in 2023, has made repeated sales of company stock over the past year, most recently offloading approximately $1.7 million in shares across transactions on July 7 and 8 after selling more than $3 million in shares in June, CFO Dive reported. This came after Taneja’s compensation for full-year 2024 reached $139 million, largely comprised of stock and equity awards.
The complaint comes as the EV maker’s efforts to move forward with autonomous driving technology have hit repeated setbacks. On Aug. 1, the EV maker was ordered to pay more than $240 million to the victims of a 2019 crash related to its autopilot technology by a Florida jury, according to a report by The Guardian. The company also remains embroiled in a regulatory tug-of-war with the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which has claimed the EV maker exaggerated the capabilities of its self-driving technology, according to a July 21 report by Bloomberg.
Musk has repeatedly championed the potential of Tesla’s robotaxi and similar technologies, a long-time passion project for the EV maker’s CEO. During the company’s most recent earnings call — where Tesla saw a 12% dip in revenue year-over-year, as well as 42% YoY dip in operating income — Musk was optimistic about Tesla’s robotaxi prospects, despite warning there might be some “rough quarters” ahead for the business, CFO Dive previously reported.The company’s robotaxi pilot, launched in Austin, Texas in June, is a “seminal point” for the business, he said, while also stressing the company is “being paranoid about safety.”
Monday’s shareholder complaint alleges Musk and his fellow defendants made repeated false or repeated statements regarding the safety of its autonomous driving services, and pointed to a June Bloomberg article, published shortly after the launch of the robotaxi pilot, which appears to show robotaxis disobeying traffic laws. The defendants also failed to disclose risks that such vehicles would “operate dangerously and/or in violation of traffic laws,” as well as the corresponding likelihood that Telsa would become “subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny.”
“It’s never actually investors. It’s always shitty class-action lawyers grifting for their percentage of the verdict,” Musk said in a Tuesday post on the social media site X, which he owns, in a reply regarding the suit. “They are scum of the Earth. The worst human being I’ve ever encountered.”
The suit comes as Tesla’s board also voted to grant Musk a pay package with a value of approximately $29 billion, following a seven-year ongoing regulatory tussle with Delaware legislators.
“To recognize what Elon has accomplished and the extraordinary value he delivered to Tesla and our shareholders, we believe we must take action to honor the bargain that was struck in 2018,” the company said in a Monday post on X. The board “recommended this award as a first step, ‘good faith’ payment to Elon,” according to the post.

The Federal Reserve is aiming for a 2% inflation rate, and the central bank has resisted lowering interest rates further until it sees evidence that inflation will reach its goal of 2%. That could become more difficult as a new round of tariffs is set to be implemented after President Donald Trump's Aug. 1 deadline passed with some nations, like Canada, receiving rate hikes.
As of June, the consumer price index was 2.7%, while core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy categories, held at 2.9%, according to research from The Motley Fool.
The inflation rate holds implications for the stock market as a whole and for nearly every sector within it. However, few are affected as much as the retail industry. Consumer prices directly affect demand, and higher prices can drive away consumer spending, especially in discretionary categories. Alternatively, some retailers and consumer packaged goods companies can use inflation to pass along higher prices, expanding their profit margins.
One popular retailer to watch with inflation still volatile is Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), one of the world's biggest retailers by revenue.
How inflation is affecting Costco
Costco's differentiated business model helps protect the retailer from inflation in some ways. First, because of its membership model, Costco's business isn't as sensitive to consumer prices as peers like Walmart and Target might be.
In fact, the company makes a large percentage of its profit from membership income. Its customers pay a base price of $65 a year for the privilege of buying its bulk goods at near cost. The profit it makes from retail sales is comparable to what it makes from membership income. In its most recent quarter, for example, it generated $1.24 billion in membership income, which made up nearly half of its $2.53 billion in operating income.
Since Costco enjoys a substantial membership-based revenue stream, inflation is less of a risk for the company as that membership income should be protected from inflation. Additionally, its customers have already paid to be able to shop there in part because of Costco's low prices.
Costco's pricing strategy, which is made up of selling bulk goods near cost and private-labeling brand-name products under its Kirkland label, arguably gives the company an advantage in an inflationary environment. Because of Costco's reputation for low prices, price-conscious consumers may be more likely to shop there when they're worried about high prices at other retailers.
In its annual report, Costco acknowledged: ""Inflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand.""
Is Costco a buy if inflation goes up?
Based on its membership model, reputation for low prices, and economies of scale, Costco seems better positioned than most retailers in an inflationary environment.
Looking back at 2022 could offer a good example of Costco's performance in an inflationary environment. In that year, Costco's performance essentially matched the S&P 500, with the stock falling 19.6% against the S&P 500's decline of 19.4%.
However, in fiscal 2022, which ended on Aug. 28, 2022, Costco posted impressive comparable sales growth, up 10.6% after adjustments for foreign currency and fuel prices. Earnings per share also rose 17% that year. Costco's results were similarly strong in the fourth quarter of 2022, even when inflation was peaking, with adjusted comparable sales up 10.4%.
This offers some evidence that Costco's business should be able to thrive in an inflationary environment. However, the stock could face pressure if the broad market pulls back, as it already trades at a high price-to-earnings ratio of 54, and expensive stocks tend to get hit harder in market sell-offs.
Given that valuation, Costco seems likely to follow the broad market lower on any macroeconomic worries. However, investors should rest assured that the business is resilient enough to handle another spike in inflation.

President Trump is imposing billions of dollars in new import taxes on US firms, yet the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index is up 26% from its April low and fresh off several record highs. Investors who shunned US assets just a few months ago are now aggressively buying.
However, numerous warning signs have emerged during the second quarter earnings season as companies outline the ways Trump's tariffs are hurting profits, disrupting operations, and forcing price hikes onto consumers. Tariffs are not hitting every company, since they mainly affect goods, and many of America's top firms are service providers. But some analysts think the negative tariff effects are widespread enough to take the wind out of stocks soon.
With second quarter earnings in for about two-thirds of S&P 500 companies, Yahoo Finance's Grace O'Donnell has identified more than four dozen large firms saying tariffs are impacting their businesses in some material way. Some are able to quantify the monetary effect on earnings. Others expect tariffs to hit their finances but aren't yet sure how. And some CEOs have been blunt about price hikes heading toward consumers.
Manufacturers are bearing a large portion of the tariff cost, since many rely on imported components that are now more expensive. Caterpillar (CAT), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), BMW (BMW.DE), Ford (F), Harley-Davidson (HOG), Hyundai (HYMTF), Tesla (TSLA), GE Aerospace (GE), 3M (MMM), and General Motors (GM) are among the companies saying tariffs reduced earnings in the second quarter. Ford, as one example, said tariffs would knock $2 billion off earnings this year. Caterpillar expects a tariff hit of at least $1.3 billion. Kimberly-Clark's tariff loss will be around $170 million.
It's not just manufacturers. Companies that import products they sell to consumers are suffering too. Apple (AAPL) expects tariffs to cut earnings by nearly $2 billion for the six months through Sept. 30. Hershey (HSY) said tariffs will cost it at least $170 million this year. VF Corp., whose brands include Vans, The North Face, and Timberland, sees a $250 million hit to earnings through 2026.
Some of America's biggest consumer goods producers, including Procter & Gamble (PG), Mattel (MAT), Columbia Sportswear (COLM), and L’Oreal (LOR.F), say they'll have no choice but to pass some of their higher costs onto consumers. Many executives discussing the Trump tariffs say it's too soon to assess the impact of import taxes that have only been in place a couple of months, which means a lot more bad news may be in the pipeline.
The disconnect in markets right now is that tariff impacts that are causing headline damage for a lot of individual companies don't yet seem to be depressing overall earnings. Roughly 80% of companies reporting their earnings so far have beaten analyst estimates, according to FactSet. That's better than the usual beat ratio. Earnings growth has also been solid, and Wall Street forecasts for the third quarter are even better, despite the tariffs. Solid actual earnings and robust forecasts for future gains are the driving forces motivating investors to buy.
The question is will it last, and there are several reasons for doubt. Oxford Economics thinks investors are too bullish now because they were too panicky in April and May, when Trump imposed dramatically high tariffs that he has since lowered. Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements on April 2 triggered a big stock sell-off, which in turn prompted Trump to back down and pause some of those tariffs. The average tariff rate jumped from 2.5% before Trump took office to about 28% after ""Liberation Day."" Recent changes to Trump's tariff regime brought the average import tax to as low as 14%, then up to about 18%, where it is today.
So, the average import tax is now lower than it was in April and May — but still considerably higher than it's been for the past 90 years. That will still sting. ""Margin resilience [is] unlikely to last,"" Oxford economists noted in an Aug. 5 analysis. ""We think margin pressures will build throughout the second half of the year as the effective tariff rate continues to move higher, businesses deplete front-run inventories, and domestic demand softens.""
Bloomberg recently reported that several Wall Street money managers, including Morgan Stanley, Evercore ISI, and Deutsche Bank, are warning clients that a stock pullback of 10% to 15% could be on the horizon. Trump's trade wars are the biggest concern, as the rising toll of import taxes further damages profits, raises prices, reins in spending, and depresses growth.
The sharp slowdown in job growth during the past three months may be a harbinger of worse to come. The average pace of job gains from May through July was just 35,000, an 80% decline from the 2024 pace. Trump got so angry over those numbers that he fired the government economist who oversees the employment report. But the real problem is Trump's own policies, and he can't fire every CEO who needs to explain how tariffs are harming profits.

The S&P 500 healthcare sector -- which includes pharmaceutical companies, biotechs, health insurers and medical equipment makers -- has slumped 5% in 2025, lagging the over 7% gain for the overall index.
Pressure to bring down U.S. prescription drug prices to overseas rates, tariffs targeted at pharmaceuticals and cuts to areas such as health research funding and Medicaid are among the Trump administration actions clouding the outlook for the shares this year, investors said.
Regulatory obstacles are compounding issues, including expiring drug patents and setbacks for bellwethers including UnitedHealth Group.
""You have got this constant overarching political and regulatory overhang that doesn't really seem to subside with any administration,"" said Jared Holz, healthcare sector strategist at Mizuho Securities. ""When you have so much nebulousness around the sector, it turns people off rather than invites them to the party.""
In another sign of the group losing favor, healthcare exchange-traded-funds have seen 12 consecutive months of net outflows as of July for a total outflow of $11.5 billion in that time, more than for any other sector, according to State Street Investment Management.
The performance picture is even dimmer over a longer period. While shares of massive technology companies pushed the benchmark S&P 500 up over 50% the past three years, the healthcare sector is little changed in that time.
That gap has put the 60-stock sector at nearly its biggest discount to the broader market in 30 years, which some investors hope is an inflection point for the battered group.
""The valuation is extremely cheap and the relative performance is at an extreme,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital, whose healthcare holdings include diversified giant Johnson & Johnson and medical device maker Stryker.
""So at this point, it seems like a pretty decent setup to get some outperformance.""
The price-to-earnings ratio for the healthcare sector, based on earnings estimates for the next year, has fallen to 16.2 times from nearly 20 a year ago, according to LSEG Datastream.
Meanwhile, the S&P 500's rally to records has driven the index's P/E ratio to over 22 times -- giving the broader market a significant premium over the healthcare sector.
'BAD NEWS IS PRICED IN'
Some high-profile healthcare names are at even cheaper valuations. For example, Merck is trading at a forward P/E of 8.7, against its long-term average of 14.5, while fellow drugmaker Bristol Myers Squibb trades at 7.4 against its average of 15.8, according to LSEG.
Year-to-date, shares of both Merck and Bristol Myers are down roughly 20%.
The group is drawing bets from some value investors such as Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, whose portfolio is overweight the sector including owning shares of CVS Health and European drugmakers GSK and Sanofi.
""Our perspective is a lot of this bad news is priced in and then some,"" Kaser said. ""To bet against the sector from here, you're essentially continuing to bet on the valuation gap, which is already large, continuing to widen.""
The group's decline means the total market value of the S&P 500 healthcare sector is about $4.8 trillion, not much higher than the $4.3 trillion value of Nvidia, the semiconductor company that has symbolized the artificial intelligence boom.
Indeed, some investors said a shift in capital away from Nvidia and other massive tech companies could spark healthcare shares. Such a move appeared to occur in the first quarter, investors said, when the healthcare sector rose 6% while declines in tech and megacap stocks dragged indexes lower.
Fears of an economic downturn also could help healthcare shares, at least on a relative basis. The group is often viewed as a defensive area in rockier economic times.
Economic fears flared following last Friday's weaker-than-expected employment report, while some strategists say the market could be due for a pullback after surging over 20% since its April lows.
""During the first quarter, healthcare did great even as tech rolled over, as the fears of an economic slowdown got to more economically sensitive stocks,"" said Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, adding he expects healthcare ""will perform better in a more difficult market.""
More clarity on regulatory issues, including tariffs, also could support healthcare, investors said.
But some value investors are hesitant to dive into the group. Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, said he is wary some healthcare shares could be ""value traps,"" preferring to overweight areas including industrials or financials.
""There's been just so much of an overhang in the sector,"" Mullaney said. ""There are better places to go with cleaner stories.""

Our call of the day from Nationwide Investment Management Group’s chief market strategist, Mark Hackett, discusses the fierce battle that’s been ongoing between institutional and retail investors. He says for now, Wall Street shouldn’t bet against that cohort.
Friday’s selloff marked a “typical response” for the institutional investors, Hackett told MarketWatch in an interview. “Bad jobs data on top of the tariff launch and then you had the Russia submarine issue. There’s a whole lot of things together that caused the pullback in the market and then you saw Monday which was almost a complete reversal,” he said.
“To me, that is retail investors having been trained into this concept of buying a dip and it’s confusing institutional investors completely at this point,” he said.
“And then you go back to the April/May timeframe where institutions were completely on the sidelines, very conservatively positioned and the retail investors was aggressively buying dips. Now it’s worked so many times, at this point, the retail investor has fueled this sense of inevitability about recoveries, and that’s what i think you saw [Monday] continuing a little bit today [Tuesday],” said Hackett.
According to data from Interactive Brokers, some retail investors didn’t even wait for Monday to buy. The retail brokerage said its cumulative net stock buy orders rose 78% on Friday from a week ago. Friday also marked the S&P 500’s SPX fourth-straight losing session, the longest such streak since May 23.
“If you look back in history before the pandemic, Friday would have led to a more consistent downturn. You have the seasonal period of August and September weak, you’re sitting at 22 times earnings [for the S&P 500], the market had rallied almost 30% off the [April] low. That’s exactly the time you would expect this period of consolidation, downward sloping for a couple of months until you can maybe have a full-order rally,” he said.
“Historical trends are no longer working, and what it does is make institutional investors very cautious about being short on an absolute relative basis, simply because of what’s happening with the retail investor,” said Hackett. That said, the nature of those investors has become predictable as they aggressively buy with each market pullback, he added.
Helping those investors out has been an enhanced toolkit with access to more options, lowered tech barriers and lots of free time during the pandemic that gave them a foothold in markets. “Retail investors have a sensitivity to momentum, a focus on thematics, and an insensitivity to high valuations,” LPL Financial head of equity research Thomas Shipp wrote in July.
The bottom line from Hackett is that “you don’t bet against the retail investor right now.” That’s not to say that their power is unlimited and that buy-the-dip strategy might run out of steam, but now “the retail investor confusing the institutional investor out of doing what they want,” he said.
He said the last time retail investors ran into trouble was the spring of 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine and markets endured a lengthy stretch of weakness, he noted. “But again, you got to October and then for no reason that felt real at the time, you saw this rebound and a very aggressive move from there,” he said.
Institutions coming into the final quarter of this year are struggling because major technology stocks are so heavily weighed already and they can’t have most of a diversified portfolio just sitting in seven major technology stocks. “Layer on top of that the fact that most of these people were very conservatively positioned back in April and now you’re chasing, you’re running from behind and it’s a terrifying place to be,” he said.
His expectation is that markets could consolidate through September, until tailwinds from U.S. government’s spending package and elsewhere start to kick in. That could then build up to a year-end rally, in his view.
Hackett says the retail cohort should take care right now, as markets bump up against high valuations, and economic uncertainty swirls. “Now wouldn’t be the time where I would be aggressively shifting my portfolio to risk on,” he said.

A week after reporting a second consecutive quarterly loss, Florida-based BayFirst Financial has shuttered the small-dollar Small Business Administration lending program that's at the heart of its problems.
BayFirst announced late Monday it has terminated its Bolt loan program. As part of the decision, the $1.3 billion-asset BayFirst laid off its 26-person Bolt team, plus 25 employees from other parts of the bank. The staffing cuts are expected to produce $6 million in annual savings, though terminating Bolt will also generate an undisclosed amount of near-term costs that are expected to be recognized as a restructuring charge during the third quarter.
""I would tell you that businesses today are facing tremendous headwinds,"" BayFirst CEO Thomas Zernick told American Banker Tuesday. ""Whether it's uncertainty caused by the tariffs, cost-of-goods spikes, difficulty in employment, they're struggling across the board. Lending into the [small-dollar] space didn't make sense, given the macroenvironment we're in today.""
Bolt offered borrowers around the country SBA-guaranteed working capital loans of up to $150,000 — a relatively modest amount — through the agency's 7(a) loan guarantee program. As of June 30, BayFirst said it had originated more than 6,700 Bolt loans for $870 million since 2022.
Zernick said Monday in a press release that Bolt's termination stemmed from ""a comprehensive strategic review to reduce risk from unguaranteed SBA 7(a) loans and position the company for long-term growth."" The SBA guarantees up to 85% of 7(a) loans, leaving lenders responsible for the remaining unguaranteed portion.
BayFirst said it hopes to sell its Bolt loan balances and the Bolt origination platform. To further cushion the financial shock, it announced it would halt payment of dividends. The company's directors have also agreed to forgo their fees.
Moreover, in announcing its second-quarter earnings last week and again on Monday, Saint Petersburg-based BayFirst said it would weigh ""strategic alternatives,"" though executives didn't specify how wide-ranging their evaluation would be.
""We want to make sure we give that thoughtful consideration and model out all kinds of different scenarios to make the best decision to get us back on track in earnings and going up and to the right,"" President and Chief Operating Officer Robin Oliver said on a July 30 conference call with analysts.
BayFirst reported a second-quarter loss totaling $1.2 million after losing $300,000 for the quarter that ended on March 31. The company recorded provisions totaling $11.7 million in the first six months of 2025, compared with $7.1 million during the same period in 2024. It reported charge-offs of $11.1 million between January and June, compared with $7 million during the same six months in 2024.
The majority of BayFirst's problem loans reside in its Bolt portfolio, Oliver said on the conference call. More specifically, Oliver singled out older-vintage Bolt loans originated prior to the run-up in interest rates during 2022 and 2023.
""The older ones, vintages that started at lower rates, definitely have had stress and are struggling to keep up with the payments,"" Oliver said on the conference call.
BayFirst isn't exiting SBA lending entirely. It will continue to make larger loans, which have performed better than the Bolt credits, according to Oliver. ""I think you have different types of borrowers, more sophistication in the financial statements, and things of that nature with some of those larger borrowers,"" Oliver said.
Powered by Bolt, BayFirst has ranked among the country's most active SBA lenders in recent years. Through the first 10 months of the agency's 2025 fiscal year, it originated more than 1,900 7(a) loans for about $1.9 billion. Like many prolific SBA lenders, BayFirst sells much of its production to investors, generating noninterest income.
This isn't the first time BayFirst has found itself in choppy waters with a nationwide loan program. It exited national mortgage lending in September 2022, about three months after launching the Bolt program. As a result of the move, BayFirst reported a $3.1 million charge against its third-quarter 2022 earnings.
Much like Bolt, BayFirst's mortgage business fell victim to changes in interest rates, according to Zernick. ""We started to see mortgage rates rise significantly,"" the CEO said Tuesday in the interview. ""It just impacted the purchase business, it impacted the debt refinance business. We had to make another tough-but-necessary decision to just pull out of residential.""
BayFirst, which opened its doors in September 2000, operates 12 branches in the Tampa and Sarasota regions. In the wake of Bolt's closure, the company plans to concentrate on ""continuing to build a great, premier community bank here in Tampa Bay,"" Zernick said in the interview. ""We now have a very robust banking center network around Tampa Bay, which we believe is one of the strongest banking markets in the country.""",930044a63c030739d9f72cdee3c2de1f,trafilatura,5081,0

Is It Too Late to Invest ? ,2025-08-07 13:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Investing in a stock that has accumulated significant returns in a short time period can be both exciting and nerve-wracking. On the one hand, you may be eager to jump on the bandwagon in the hopes of generating some fantastic gains. But on the other, you may be worried about a possible correction or sell-off taking place, especially as early investors take profits.
One of the hottest stocks on the market over the past year has been that of Rocket Lab (NASDAQ: RKLB). In just the past 12 months, it has risen by an incredible 830% (returns as of Aug. 4). That means if you had invested $5,000 into the business back then, you'd be up to around $46,000 today. It's an incredible performance, but it begs two questions: What is behind such a staggering return, and is it too late to invest in the stock?
I'll aim to answer both of those questions below.
Why is Rocket Lab stock so hot?
There aren't many big space stocks to invest in publicly, and so when a company like Rocket Lab starts to show some encouraging progress, investors take notice. Back in June, Rocket Lab launched its 68th Electron rocket, with the company boasting of a 100% mission success rate in its launches this year, a great sign of its success and reliability.
The company has been growing its sales at a high rate. It generates revenue from its launch services, spacecraft design services, and spacecraft components, along with other space-related products and services. Last year, its top line came in at $436 million, which was a 78% increase from the $245 million it reported in 2023.
Its growth rate has come down but Rocket Lab is still expecting growth of around 30% right now. With the company expanding into Europe and working closely with the U.S. government, investors remain optimistic about its growth opportunities in the long run.
Can the stock still surge higher?
While Rocket Lab has been red hot over the past year, there's still the possibility for even more excitement and upside, and that's due to its larger Neutron rocket. The Neutron, which is a partially reusable rocket, can carry higher payloads than the Electron (around 28,700 pounds versus just 660 pounds). The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory is planning a mission with the Neutron rocket as early as next year.
The big event investors are eagerly anticipating is the debut and test of the Neutron rocket. While a firm date hasn't been set, the company has previously said it should be ready for the second half of 2025. A successful launch could give investors confidence that the company may be on the cusp of much more growth ahead, as Neutron would help Rocket Lab tap into greater opportunities, serving a wider range of customers, and potentially improving its margins as well -- Rocket Lab's net loss totaled $190 million last year, which was more than the $183 million loss it incurred in the previous year.
Currently, the stock trades at close to 50 times its revenue and book value. Its a steep valuation and analysts also believe it may be due for a decline as the consensus analyst price target of less than $36 implies a downside of around 20% from where it trades today.
Should you invest in Rocket Lab stock today?
Rocket Lab has a promising future but the risk for investors is that they're already paying for it, based on the stock's egregious valuation. At such a high premium, expectations are enormous for the stock and there's plenty of downside risk should it falter or if its Neutron launch doesn't go according to plan.
At the same time, the opportunities in space exploration can be plentiful and garner a lot of demand from various government agencies. I don't think it's too late to invest in the business given its encouraging growth prospects, but you'll need to be willing to accept the risk that comes with the stock and the potential volatility that lies ahead with Rocket Lab, given its deep losses and high market cap.
If this is all too much risk, you may want to prefer going with safer growth stocks instead.

But before you simply rush out to join the crowd and buy the stock, you should step back. There are a few things you need to watch closely if you intend to add Cameco to your portfolio. Here are three of the big ones.
1. Cameco is a miner
The business that really drives Cameco's top and bottom lines is mining. The product it mines is uranium, which is the basic fuel used by nuclear power plants. Cameco also processes uranium (so it can be used as a fuel source) and owns part of Westinghouse Electric, which provides services to the nuclear power industry. However, the big story on the income statement is, and will likely always be, the price of uranium.
That's inherent in the fact that Cameco is a miner. But there's more to consider here as well. For example, it is difficult and expensive to build and operate mines. Thus, there is a material floor cost that Cameco needs to meet before it can make a profit. Again, that's not unique to Cameco; it is simply how mining businesses work. But you need to make sure you understand and closely monitor the core business if you are looking to buy Cameco.
2. Nuclear power is in high demand -- for now
Cameco's stock is ""hot"" right now because of its tie to the nuclear power industry. Nuclear power is experiencing something of a renaissance. There are some notable drivers of this. First, demand for electricity is growing because of things like artificial intelligence (AI), data centers, and electric vehicles. Second, nuclear power, once a nuclear power plant has been built, is a reliable and fairly cost-effective source of always on power (also known as base load power). And third, nuclear power doesn't emit greenhouse gases, so it is a ""clean"" energy option.
This is all great news for the nuclear power industry, with even previously shuttered reactors being restarted. Over the longer term, companies are working on building smaller, more modern reactors that are expected to be safer, quicker to build, less expensive, and easier to place close to where they are needed. Every nuclear reactor that gets turned on needs fuel. Thus, demand for what Cameco sells looks set to increase.
There's just one huge caveat. It doesn't happen often, but sometimes nuclear power plants have accidents. They are almost always high profile and have, historically, led to nuclear power falling out of favor for a period of time. If you are thinking of buying Cameco, you need to watch the nuclear power industry and the long-term and short-term developments that might make it more or less volatile.
3. Supply and demand swing around
The story right now is that Cameco makes a product that is seeing increased demand. But there's a second layer here because the expected supply of uranium isn't likely to be enough to match up with the demand. That suggests that higher uranium prices are in the cards, which would translate into better sales and revenues for Cameco.
To be fair, Cameco uses long-term contracts to mitigate the risk of commodity price volatility. So it won't participate fully in uranium price rallies, and it won't suffer as much if prices fall. But don't forget to keep watching supply and demand just the same. When commodity prices rise, investments are drawn into a sector. New supply eventually arrives, and then prices come back down. That's just as true of uranium as of any other commodity. So don't count on the current market projections playing out as positively as Cameco suggests right now.
Cameco is probably most appropriate for active investors
Cameco is a bit of a one-trick pony. When that trick is working, the stock tends to perform well. When the trick stops working, investors have a habit of dumping the stock. Given the nature of Cameco's business, the stock tends to swing from being in high demand to being shunned. This is the risk you take if you buy it today or any day. And if you are looking at it, make sure to watch the mining aspect of the operation, the nuclear power industry as a whole, and the supply/demand dynamics around uranium. Each of these things could help or hurt the company's return profile.
Should you invest $1,000 in Cameco right now?
Before you buy stock in Cameco, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cameco wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

On Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are ""building in the United States.""
As semiconductors represent an over $600 billion industry at the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.
However, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.
""It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,"" Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.
""The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.""
Big players win?
One of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.
The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.
Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.
If this is the case, the policy could have the effect of ""continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,"" Sullivan said.
Indeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMC announced it would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.
Shares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix — which have both committed investments in the U.S. — were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs.
An exemption on what?
Beyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.
Speaking on CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia,"" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.
For example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors — only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.
While Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.
""What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,"" Rasgon asked.
The confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started a national security investigation of semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector was exempted from Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs.
The vague language from the Trump administration — though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations — could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs.
Complex supply chains
Potential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.
Rasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.
""Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,"" he said.
Another large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Google, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.
According to a recent report from ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and ""big data.""
In a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.
The company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years.",5f4964196213add9246449fdfac5fda5,trafilatura,4975,0

Ross' newest endeavor is her new show that follows along as she travels the world on her own, embraces her individuality, and skirts the societal expectations for women in their 50s.
At 52, Ross sometimes feels the weight of other people's opinions — positive and negative — about her being unpartnered and child-free.
On her show, Solo Traveling with Tracee Ellis Ross, she takes viewers along as she goes from destination to destination by herself, and aims to shift that narrative that others tend to have about her life, by leaning into solitude.
""I mean Oprah said it, she said I'm the poster child for singledom. I don't wanna be that,"" Ross says in show's the first episode. ""I wanna be the poster child for being and inhabiting your own skin, for living in your own skin.""
The series is available on the Roku Channel and in the show's three episodes, Ross travels to Morocco, Mexico and Spain.
I wanna be the poster child for being and inhabiting your own skin.Tracee Ellis RossActress
Throughout her adventures, Ross tastes different olive oils, supports a female-run restaurant and takes a cocktail-making class. Sometimes she has not-so-great experiences like a change of plans because of the weather and feeling lonely after a solo dinner. But Ross embraces it all.
""So much of what solo traveling is about, for me, [is] not waiting for something in order to walk towards my life, in order to be in my life, in order to experience my life. I think that was why I took my first trip solo,"" Ross said.
""Not having a relationship, a long long relationship, not having children has allowed me to explore things of my own humanity. It has deposited me here at 52 in an extraordinary experience that is filled with joy, loneliness, grief, exuberance, delight, like literally all of it, and I feel available to it.""
Solo traveling can expose you to both good and bad things—and get you out of your comfort zone
There are pros and cons to any experience, says Millie Huckabee, licensed clinical professional counselor and founder and CEO of Sage Therapy. Solo traveling is no different.
When solo traveling, there's ""so much opportunity for things to come up. You're in an unfamiliar situation,"" says Huckabee who spent two weeks exploring Malawi on her own in her past.
""You're exposed to things that are outside of your everyday experience, which can be good and bad. That sort of mixed bag [of emotions] is part of that.""
Some positive effects that visiting places alone can have on a person are:
- Getting you out of your comfort zone
- Allowing you to meet new people
- Opening you up to novel experiences
- Increasing feelings of joy, awe and empowerment
- Allowing you to gain more insight and think about things more deeply
On the flip side, Huckabee says solo travel can also cause you to:
- Look inward and feel emotions you may have distracted yourself from
- Reminisce about past travel experiences or wonder how different your trip would be if you weren't alone
- Feel lonely, especially when you see other people traveling together
- Navigate challenging situations on your own
Challenging your worldview can be so good, and it can be really hard, too.Millie HuckabeeFounder and CEO of Sage Therapy
To prepare for the ups and downs that may come with visiting places alone, Huckabee suggests being optimistic about your trip while acknowledging it won't be perfect, and developing safety precautions like knowing where you can receive medical care and having translation apps ready to communicate with residents of the country.
It can also help to have good coping strategies you can reach for when you're feeling lonely, she says. These tools can range from reaching out to loved ones who boost your mood, or journaling and recording voice memos to process your emotions.
""Opening your mind and challenging your worldview can be so good, and it can be really hard, too. But I don't know, I highly recommend it,"" Huckabee says.
""You can really learn great things about yourself and really develop amazing relationships with new people that you never would have met otherwise.""

CEO Tim Cook, announcing at the White House on Wednesday afternoon a big, new investment in U.S. manufacturing, showcased the company's strength in navigating the political waters of the Trump administration to mitigate tariff headwinds. The handshake shifted the focus from Apple's perceived weakness in coming up with a clear artificial intelligence strategy. ""People were really viewing this until yesterday as an AI play, meaning they didn't have AI,"" Jim Cramer said Thursday as Apple shares jumped for a second straight session, adding roughly 3% to Wednesday's 5% gain. While the two-day move has certainly been a step in the right direction, Apple shares were still down just over 12% year to date. Apple's new commitment of $100 billion on top of the already-pledged $500 billion over the next four years is a ""very significant expansion,"" Jim said. ""This is how the supply chain starts"" in the U.S. Apple also said it would spend $2.5 billion to help expand Corning , the Kentucky-based company that manufactures glass for iPhones. As a result, all the glass for both its flagship device and the Apple Watch will be produced domestically at Corning's factory. ""This is the largest investment Apple has ever made in America and anywhere else,"" Trump said alongside Cook. ""As you know, Apple has been an investor in other countries a little bit, I won't say which ones, but a couple, and they're coming home."" AAPL YTD mountain Apple (AAPL) year-to-date performance Another positive of Apple's increased investments, according to Jim, is that smartphone rival Samsung may now face an increased tariff rate if the South Korean electronics giant doesn't invest more in the U.S. Jim said that would be ""very, very good news"" for Apple during Thursday's Morning Meeting. ""In the United States, there's a dogfight between Samsung and Apple,"" Jim continued. ""Remember, we were thinking, 'Oh my God, Samsung's going to be cheaper than Apple.' No. Apple will be cheaper than Samsung, and that will push even more Verizon, AT & T , and T-Mobile [customers] toward Apple."" While the market continued to push Apple stock higher Thursday, it doesn't mean that the company is out of the woods on artificial intelligence. Management has not only delayed the rollout of its AI suite, called Apple Intelligence, but the company has continued to lose top talent to other Big Tech names like Club holding Meta Platforms . Apple's generative AI strategy has been top of mind for investors in hopes that the new tech would usher in a much-needed upgrade cycle for the iPhone, its biggest money maker. So far, that has not been the case. AI is not Apple's only overhang. It also faces a series of legal headaches, including a government antitrust case against Alphabet that threatens billions of dollars in payments to Apple for Google search priority. Apple's long-standing legal feud with Fortnite maker Epic Games has put App Store commissions in focus. Both of these factors could weigh on Apple's crucial high-margin services business. Bottom line Overall, we're glad that Apple has taken the steps necessary to get back in the good graces of the Trump administration. Cook did it during President Donald Trump 's first term, and he did it again this time. The deal helps Apple on the tariff front, giving the company and its struggling stock a much-needed win. That said, getting AI right is still an important part of the Apple story. Jim said he is willing to wait and doesn't view the two-day rally as a reason to trim the position. ""I don't want to sell Apple,"" Jim added. Yet again, we're reiterating our ""own, don't trade"" thesis on Apple stock. After all, as Jim claimed earlier this summer, Apple continues to make ""the greatest product in the world."" The Club currently has a hold-equivalent 2 rating on Apple shares and a price target of $240, a roughly 12% premium to Wednesday's closing level of $213. The stock closed at a record $259 per share back in late December. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AAPL, META. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Sugar prices today tumbled to 5-week lows on signs of stronger sugar production in Brazil. Last Thursday, Unica reported Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the first half of July rose +15% y/y to 3.4 MMT. Also, the amount of sugarcane being crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills has increased to 54% from 50% the same time last year.
The outlook for higher sugar production in Brazil is bearish for sugar prices. Datagro said last Monday that dry weather in Brazil has encouraged the country's sugar mills to increase their cane crushing, diverting more of the cane crush toward more profitable sugar production rather than ethanol.
The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for prices after Bloomberg reported that India may permit local sugar mills to export sugar in the next season, which starts in October, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop. India's Meteorological Department reported today that cumulative monsoon rain in India is at 500.8 mm, or 4% above normal as of August 4. Also, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association said last Thursday that it will seek permission to export 2 MMT of sugar in 2025/26.
The outlook for higher sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer, is bearish for prices. On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 35 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage. That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.2 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).
Sugar prices have retreated over the past four months, with NY sugar falling to a 4.25-year low last month and London sugar sliding to a 4-year low, driven by expectations of a sugar surplus in the 2025/26 season. On June 30, commodities trader Czarnikow projected a 7.5 MMT global sugar surplus for the 2025/26 season, the largest surplus in 8 years. On May 22, the USDA, in its biannual report, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would increase by +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT, with global sugar ending stocks at 41.188 MMT, up 7.5% y/y.
Signs that the recent slide in sugar prices to 4-year lows has sparked a pickup in demand are positive for sugar prices. China's June sugar imports soared by 1,435% to 420,000 MT. Also, Coca-Cola agreed to use cane sugar in Coke beverages sold in the US instead of high-fructose corn syrup, which could boost US sugar consumption by +4.4% to 11.5 MMT from 11 MMT currently, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.
Sugar prices also have support from reduced sugar production in Brazil. Unica reported last Thursday that the cumulative 2025/26 Brazil Center-South sugar output through mid-July fell by -9.2% y/y to 15.655 MMT. Last month, Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, said 2024/25 Brazil sugar production fell by -3.4% y/y to 44.118 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat.
The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter of sugar.
The International Sugar Organization (ISO) raised its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to a 9-year high of -5.47 MMT on May 15, up from a February forecast of -4.88 MMT. This indicates a tightening market following the 2023/24 global sugar surplus of 1.31 MMT. ISO also cut its 2024/25 global sugar production forecast to 174.8 MMT from a February forecast of 175.5 MMT.
The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT. The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT FAS predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would rise +25% y/y to 35.3 MMT due to favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage. FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will climb +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.

Is This Leading Cryptocurrency Still a Buy ? ,2025-08-07 19:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"One year ago, XRP(CRYPTO: XRP) traded near $0.55. Today it hovers around $2.94, a roughly 500% jump that leaves early buyers feeling like geniuses and latecomers trying to fight against their fear of missing out (FOMO).
It's obvious that huge moves are thrilling, but they also create a classic investing challenge. Should investors cash out, or pile in with more capital to press the advantage with a proven winner? Let's sift through what actually changed for XRP and why the next leg higher might still lie ahead.
The last 12 months rewrote XRP's narrative
One of the main drivers for XRP's startling run has been the ever-improving technology on its ledger, the XRPL.
On June 30, the XRPL Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain launched, giving developers Ethereum tooling for their smart contracts without leaving the XRP ecosystem.
For the uninitiated, this means that programmers can use the same programming language they use to code Ethereum apps to code apps that run on the XRP Ledger. In other words, developers can now port decentralized finance (DeFi) and other apps directly to the ledger without much additional work, which is an option that XRP simply lacked before. The synthesis of this information is that XRP could now start to attract Ethereum developers who are fed up with that chain's high gas (user) fees, thereby supercharging the ecosystem with new talent and thus new apps.
Regulations are also shifting very much in XRP's favor, and its long-running legal issues are finally abating.
A Manhattan judge last year capped the liability of Ripple, the company that issues XRP, at a $125 million civil penalty, and, on June 27, both Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) signaled plans to drop their lingering cross-appeals, hinting the saga is near an armistice. Regulators had originally faulted Ripple over the question of whether XRP counts as a security. Now, given the Trump administration's retooling of the crypto market, it seems very likely that this issue is a thing of the past, with the outcome of future regulations almost guaranteed to heavily benefit XRP.
Why this rally might still be in its early innings
So, XRP is sailing in calm waters with both internally generated and external tailwinds to make the ride for holders into a pleasure cruise.
Smart contract compatibility is already broadening XRP's addressable market. DeFi lenders, prediction market operators, and synthetic asset platforms can now build without wrestling with the ledger's native scripting quirks. Even a modest migration of Ethereum-based liquidity would translate into incremental demand for XRP as the chain's reserve asset.
Meanwhile, as mentioned before, policy winds look unusually favorable at the moment, and the odds are good that conditions will continue to be balmy for the next couple of years.
With the SEC backing away from all-out litigation, institutional investors can engage with XRP and use it for their financial plumbing without worrying that subpoenas will land on their desks. Rule tweaks this summer also sparked confidence that spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could clear the agency's October 17 decision deadline, a move that would lead asset managers to accumulate coins for creation baskets and, if holders are a tad lucky, create a supply shock that sends prices soaring.
What's the right move?
Despite the above, it's also obviously true that XRP no longer looks cheap on a one-year chart. It's guaranteed that its volatile swings in price will remain ferocious.
Yet the blend of a brand-new developer runway, dissipating legal risk, looming ETF catalysts, and on-chain utility signals that the recent surge rests on more than thin air.
It's still worth buying today. Should XRPL's revamped tool set and institutional push work as advertised, today's lofty price quote could look tame a few years down the road. Diversify, think long term, and let the thesis, not the thrill, guide your allocation.

Solventum — The health-care stock popped 4% after posting a second-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue beat. Solventum also lifted its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance. Synaptics — The developer of semiconductor products jumped more than 2% on the heels of its better-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter. The company posted adjusted earnings of $1.01 per share on $282.8 million in revenue, while analysts surveyed by LSEG were looking for $1.00 per share on $280.2 million in revenue. Tripadvisor — Shares rose more than 5% after the online travel company reported mixed second-quarter results. While earnings of 46 cents per share, after adjustments, topped estimates, revenue of $529 million fell short. Viavi Solutions — The network test and equipment manufacturer surged 11% after reporting fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue results that topped analysts' expectations, per FactSet. The company also guided for current-quarter earnings and revenue above forecasts. Wynn Resorts — The casino operator slipped 1% after posting second-quarter earnings of $1.09 per share on $1.74 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected earnings of $1.21 per share and revenue of $1.75 billion.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 2 cents in earnings per share and $144.2 million in revenue. Pinterest — The social media stock slumped 10%. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter came in at 33 cents per share, falling short of analysts' call for 35 cents per share, per LSEG. Sweetgreen — Shares tumbled 23% after the salad chain posted second-quarter results that fell short of the Street's expectations. Sweetgreen also cut its full-year revenue guidance, calling for a range between $700 million and $715 million. That's down from the prior forecast of $740 million to $760 million. Yelp — Shares of the restaurant review service slid 3%. Yelp narrowed its full-year guidance, saying it now sees revenue ranging from $1.465 billion to $1.475 billion. The company last called for revenue to land between $1.465 billion and $1.485 billion. The new range is below the FactSet consensus estimate of $1.48 billion. Microchip Technology — The manufacturer of semiconductors saw shares tumble 6% after it delivered guidance that failed to impress Wall Street. Microchip is calling for fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings to land between 30 cents and 36 cents per share, while FactSet consensus estimates sought 31 cents per share. Revenue is expected to range between $1.11 billion and $1.15 billion, versus analysts' prediction of $1.13 billion. — CNBC's Christina Cheddar-Berk, Sean Conlon, Alex Harring, Yun Li and Darla Mercado contributed reporting.",82cbde8cefb306abf64af2c0cec1bab4,trafilatura,4659,0

The 39% import levy - among the highest of any applied under Trump's global trade reset - took effect at midnight Washington time (0400 GMT) after an 11th-hour effort by Swiss officials failed to produce a better deal.
The tariffs are set to throttle the small alpine nation's access to the U.S., a leading export market for Swatch, Rolex and Patek Philippe watches as well as high-end cheeses and chocolates.
The U.S. is also the single largest market for Swiss pharmaceuticals, worth $35 billion last year, produced by companies including Roche and Novartis, though those exports are not currently covered under the 39% rate.
""For the affected sectors, companies, and their employees, this is an extraordinarily difficult situation,"" President Karin Keller-Sutter told reporters following an urgent meeting of the seven-member Federal Council - Switzerland's governing cabinet.
Keller-Sutter left Washington on Wednesday without a deal following a hastily organised trip during which she did not meet with Trump or any of his leading trade representatives, according to two sources.
Her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected by U.S. officials, one of the sources added.
""We have seen in other cases that President Trump's positions can evolve,"" said Swiss lawmaker Damien Cottier, chairman of the Swiss-U.S. parliamentary association. ""We must continue to negotiate and argue our case, which is a good one.""
'Insanely high' tariffs on Swiss goods
Dozens of countries that have failed to strike deals with Washington are facing new tariff rates, which U.S. importers began paying on Thursday.
""BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.
Switzerland was stunned by Trump's decision last week to apply the steep rate, which is much higher than those negotiated by the European Union, Britain, Japan and South Korea.
Thursday's front page of the daily tabloid Blick was all black with the banner headline ""39%"".
""This number is insanely high,"" said Manfred Elsif, director of research at the University of Bern's World Trade Institute. ""Trump is simply obsessed with trade deficits in goods and does not understand that his short-sighted actions sour relations with allies.""
Switzerland removed tariffs on nearly all imports in 2024, extending virtually free access to its markets for U.S. products.
But Keller-Sutter said last week that Trump was focused on its trade surplus with the United States, which amounted to 38.5 billion Swiss francs ($48 billion) last year.
Industry associations and economists have said the tariffs will inflict major damage on the economy, put jobs at risk and curtail growth. They could also push the Swiss National Bank to cut interest rates next month.
Hans Gersbach, an economist at KOF Swiss Economic Institute at ETH, at Zurich University, estimated that if the levies remain in place for an extended period, it would result in a GDP loss of 0.3% to 0.6% over the next year.
""We will not enter a recession, but we are moving towards stagnation,"" he said.
Switzerland's private sector urged the government to continue talks with Washington.
""We are completely stunned because the horror scenario becomes reality now. And we fear this means the death of the export business of our industry to the U.S.,"" Jean-Philippe Kohl, vice director of industry association Swissmem, told Reuters.
Most companies kept a low profile on Thursday, preferring not to comment on the tariffs' expected impact.
""I think this is part of the game, to create chaos and make announcements every day,"" Zurich Insurance CEO Mario Greco, speaking as the company reported its first-half results, said of Trump's tariff announcements.
The Swiss blue-chip index was, meanwhile, up 0.8% at 1045 GMT, in line with broader markets, after hitting its lowest level since late April on Monday. The franc firmed, leaving the dollar down 0.1% on the day at 0.80605 francs.
""The lack of any drama so far on Swiss markets suggests a hope of some form of deal in the coming weeks,"" said IG broker Chris Beauchamp.",8a0086dc2c813d70817fdcc09e678907,trafilatura,4424,0

The current version of the bill promises ""at least” $600 for every adult and dependent child. For example, if you’re a family of four, you’d get $2,400. The amounts would phase out for married couples making over $150,000 a year.
The legislation, dubbed the American Worker Rebate Act, was introduced by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, in late July 2025, and must be approved by both the Senate and House of Representatives before going to the president.
There are significant obstacles to its passing right now: Sen. Hawley’s fellow Republicans in the Senate are less than enthusiastic about the bill, and several economists have voiced concerns that it won’t provide the relief consumers are looking for amid tariffs.
But while the chances of the bill passing are slim, thinking about where you would put this check — or any unplanned cash infusion — is a smart financial move.
Pay down your high-interest debt
Whether it’s a check sent from the government, a holiday bonus or any other windfall of cash, the first thing you should prioritize when you receive cash outside of your regular earnings is to pay down high-interest debt. (Credit card debt, anyone?)
The reality is that your high-interest debt is eating away at any windfall you may receive.

Freedom Debt Relief has resolved over $20 billion in outstanding debts since 2002. It offers free credit card debt relief consultations.
Accredited Debt Relief has helped clients pay off over $3 billion in debt over the span of 13+ years. They are a great option for people with more than $20,000 in debt.
Let's say you have $1,000 in credit card debt and you can only afford to make the minimum payment of $28.33 per month. With typical terms and a 22% interest rate, it will take you four years and 10 months to pay the debt off — and you’ll wind up paying $624 in interest alone.
If you were to use a $600 rebate toward that debt, you’ll only owe $400. Paying the minimum on a $400 balance — which would be about $15 per month — would shorten your repayment to three years and one month, and you'd end up only paying $154 in interest alone.
Overall, that would mean you’d save about $470 in credit card interest and you'd cut down your repayment time by nearly two years.
Stash your cash in an interest-bearing account
If you don’t have high-interest debt, you should find an account for your surprise funds where your money can grow.
High-yield savings accounts and money market accounts are two types of deposit accounts that allow you to earn interest on your savings without the cash being tied up. Both accounts are easy to withdraw from, so you can get your money in a pinch. Interest rates right now are around 4.00% APY.

Club name Apple shares are up again this morning, building on yesterday's 5.1% jump after announcing an additional $100 billion investment into the U.S. and the creation of the American Manufacturing Program. Bank of America suggested iPhones could gain market share if competitors face tariffs and Apple is exempt. 2. Nvidia and other chipmakers like AMD also traded higher this morning despite President Donald Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on semiconductors unless companies are building in the U.S. That caveat has investors betting these sector-specific tariffs will be more bark than bite. Club name Nvidia is investing in the U.S. 3. Is Eli Lilly becoming the gang that couldn't shoot straight? Shares are tumbling after its much-hyped GLP-1 pill helped patients on the highest dose lose an average of 12% of their body weight in late-stage trial. The Street was looking for 13% to 15%. Glad we sold some stock for the Club last week. 4. Lilly CEO David Ricks said on ""Squawk Box"" that the company is pleased with the trial results and plans to apply for FDA approval later this year. Lilly also reported better-than-expected earnings today and upped its full-year guidance on the strength of its injectable GLP-1s, Zepbound and Mounjaro. The stock cut its losses but was still down almost 8%. 5. Intel shares dropped 5% this morning after President Donald Trump called on CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign immediately, saying that he was ""highly CONFLICTED."" Sen. Tom Cotton has questioned Tan's ties to Chinese companies. Tan was named Intel CEO in March to turn around the struggling American chipmaker 6. Drive-thru coffee chain Dutch Bros reported a great quarter last night with no flies on it. Full speed ahead. No wonder the stock is up almost 20% this morning to around $69 a share. Barclays raised its price target to $92 from $84 and kept its overweight buy rating on the name. Morgan Stanley went to $84 from $80. 7. Looks like the short story for Duolingo — those betting the stock would go down — was a bad one. Shares are rocketing higher by 25% to around $430 after the language learning app delivered better-than-expected revenues and paid subscribers. Barclays, which has a hold-equivalent rating, took its PT to $390 from $375. I think that's way too negative. 8. Morgan Stanley downgraded Caterpillar to a sell-equivalent underweight from equal weight, with analysts saying they're worried about a ""steady deterioration"" in the machinery giant's fundamentals. I think many people are buying Caterpillar's stock to play the reshoring and an American manufacturing renaissance. 9. Shares of Airbnb dropped 7% after last night's earnings showed some slippage despite beating revenue and earnings estimates. Don't really get it. Its incremental investments aren't driving material upside. The post-pandemic travel bull market had been a powerful force. 10. E.l.f. Beauty's results were a little weaker than expected but still not bad. Tariffs are eating into profits. I'm talking to CEO Tarang Amin on ""Mad Money"" tonight. Meanwhile, over at DoorDash, CEO Tony Xu orchestrated perfection with a big earnings beat. Shares popped 7%.

Over the last four weeks, a pullback has changed the complexion of this chart, which now appears to be a classic example of a double top pattern. Now AXP is testing a key support level, and any further weakness could confirm a bear phase in August. The daily chart features a clear double top pattern, with the early July peak around $328 lining up well with the February top at $325. Now a double top pattern is only confirmed once you have a pullback after the second peak, and AXP has followed through to the downside in impressive fashion. The stock is now down about 11% off the July high, and the credit card giant is now testing key moving average support. American Express bounced off the 50-day moving average in mid-July, providing a brief respite from a strong downtrend phase. After a one-week bounce higher, sellers once again took control and pushed the stock down to its 200-day moving average. A hammer candle at the beginning of August indicated a likely short-term bounce, but we still see a breakdown as a likely scenario here. A quick analysis of volume trends shows how AXP has now entered a confirmed distribution pattern, with selling pressure outweighing buying power over the last month. Note the strong volume on down days, shown as a red histogram below the price bars, suggesting an influx of sellers in recent weeks. We can also use the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), shown in the bottom panel, to analyze trends in daily volume readings. Given the strong down days in recent weeks, it's not surprising to see the CMF has now dipped below zero to confirm a distribution phase. Until the Chaikin Money Flow pushes back above the crucial zero level, this chart suggests heavier downside volume and a strong chance of continued price deterioration. A closer look at the daily chart reveals that the 200-day moving average actually coincides fairly well with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level based on the April to July rally phase. This represents a ""confluence of support"" and suggests that any break below $287 would mean a likely continuation of the downtrend. In terms of downside targets, we can use this Fibonacci framework to identify further potential support levels. The 50% level around $275 could serve as secondary support, but we'd be looking for a potential downside target around $262. That would mean a 61.8% retracement of the spring rally phase, and represent about a 20% drop from the July peak. If AXP does manage to bounce higher off the 200-day moving average, we'd look for a break back above $305 to negate the bearish thesis. If this financial services firm can regain the 50-day moving average, and do so with an improved volume and momentum profile, we'd be interested in further upside moves in the coming weeks. But for now, the technical configuration suggests weakness over strength. - David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) All opinions expressed by the CNBC Pro contributors are solely their opinions and do not reflect the opinions of CNBC, NBC UNIVERSAL, their parent company or affiliates, and may have been previously disseminated by them on television, radio, internet or another medium.

Discovery film studios lift second - quarter results,Warner Bros . Discovery film studios lift second - quarter results,2025-08-07 13:30:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Warner Bros. Discovery's earnings got a boost from its film studios after a handful of box-office hits during the second quarter.
The period from April though June saw the releases of ""A Minecraft Movie,"" ""Sinners,"" ""Final Destination: Bloodlines"" and ""F1,"" which together generated $2 billion in the global box office to date, the company said Thursday.
WBD reported total revenue for the studios segment — which also includes distributing TV content — increased 55% during the quarter to $3.8 billion, with theatrical revenue up 38%, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange, because of the higher box-office revenue.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for the studios segment was $863 million during the period, up from $210 million during the same period a year prior.
In a letter to shareholders, WBD said it expects the momentum to continue, with the studios segment projected to generate at least $2.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year. The company said it was ""a substantial step toward"" its goal of eventually notching more than $3 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the segment.
While ""Superman"" was released shortly after the close of the second quarter, the film's success is likely to help lift the third quarter for Warner Bros. Discovery. ""Superman"" generated $220 million globally during its opening weekend, which the company said was the ""strongest ever debut for a solo Superman film.""
In late July, ""Superman"" and Apple's ""F1,"" which Warner Bros. distributed, had more than $500 million in ticket sales, CNBC reported.
Executives have been in the process of rebuilding Warner Bros. Motion Pictures for several quarters now.
In particular, CEO David Zaslav has called out the need to revive the studios since the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery in 2022. The segment had been plagued by the closure of theaters at the height of stay-at-home orders during the pandemic, followed by a Hollywood shutdown during the actors' and workers' labor strikes in 2023.
To help the unit, the company hired James Gunn and Peter Safran in 2022 as the co-heads of its DC Comics film and TV unit, in a move to steady the ship of the superhero film division. That same year, Warner Bros. appointed Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy as co-heads of Warner Bros. Motion Pictures, each of which had previously led MGM Studios.
""We've had an extraordinary run. You know we were in last place,"" said Zaslav on Thursday, noting the studios' hires shortly after the merger. ""And together we went from last to first. You know, Disney is a little bit ahead right now. … But we're really making the turn.""
Since the merger, Zaslav has said WBD would lean on its library of franchises, including ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter."" On Thursday, Zaslav said the company had the goal of two or three so-called tentpole releases a year, ""which provide real stability.""
Zaslav also said the company has already ""got a great script"" for the upcoming ""Lord of the Rings"" installment from director Peter Jackson. He also noted the next iteration of the ""Superman,"" or the ""Super family,"" franchise is in the works for DC Studios.
Still, the division has been faced with staff cuts, much like the rest of WBD since the 2022 merger. Last month Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group told employees it would cut 10% of its workforce, Deadline reported.
The company is also in the midst of splitting itself apart and essentially undoing the merger of just three years ago. Next year, the present-day company will be divided into two units — Warner Bros., comprised of the studios and streaming platform HBO Max; and Discovery Global, made up of the TV networks, Discovery+ and sports business.
Overall, WBD's total revenue increased 1% during the second quarter to $9.81 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 9% to $1.95 billion.",0fcab20ca5acbafa21358b7e6f4c2a50,trafilatura,3862,0

As of Jan. 1, 2026 some companies in Ontario, Canada, will be required to inform job applicants about the status of their candidacy within 45 days of a job interview, whether a decision has been made or not, effectively banning the practice of businesses ghosting candidates during the hiring process.
The rule applies to companies with at least 25 employees and also seeks to eliminate the posting of ghost jobs, where companies post job ads for roles they're not actively hiring for. Under the law, businesses will be required to disclose whether a vacancy is actively being filled, as well as if they're using artificial intelligence to screen and select candidates.
The law ""makes clear that if someone applies to your company and takes the time to interview, that you owe them a clear response and a decision,"" says Bonnie Dilber, a recruiting leader at software company Zapier.
""That feels like a minimum expectation,"" she tells CNBC Make It. ""People who apply to jobs deserve to understand what's happening behind the scenes.""
Companies that don't comply with the new law may be fined up to $100,000 CAD (about $72,500 USD), Bloomberg reports, though first offenses may result in warnings or lesser fines.
Half of job-seekers have been ghosted after an interview
Ghosting has become all too common in today's job market: Roughly half of job-seekers say they've been ghosted in the hiring process, meaning they've had initial conversations, and in some cases made it to final rounds of interviews, only to never hear back from the hiring team about a decision, according to Greenhouse data. Meanwhile, some 17% of all job posts on Greenhouse in the second quarter of 2025 were for roles the business never intended to actually fill.
In the U.S., state lawmakers in New Jersey, Kentucky and California have their own proposals to prevent HR ghosting in the hiring process.
The New Jersey proposal would require businesses to give interviewed candidates a clear decision of their timeline, remove job listings within two weeks of filling the role, and disclose when they post ads for roles that don't exist — otherwise they'd face a fine fine up to $5,000.
A bill to ban ghost jobs introduced in Kentucky failed to gain traction, but a similar one in California is currently under committee review, Bloomberg reports.
Dilber says it's possible that we could see more movement among states and cities that have previously passed transparency laws that center the job-seeker's experience, including in Colorado and Washington.
More regulation around using AI in hiring could come first, she adds: For example, in 2023, New York City became the first entity to prohibit employers from using AI decision-making tools to hire unless it's been audited for bias and provides required notices to applicants.

CEO sees benefits from Apple - Epic fallout,AppLovin stock pops 11 %. CEO sees benefits from Apple - Epic fallout,2025-08-07 20:15:00+00:00,gdelt_cnbc_com,cnbc.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"AppLovin shares resumed their historic rally on Thursday after the ad-tech company reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter.
The stock popped 12% and is now up 35% for the year after soaring more than eightfold in 2024. Wall Street has piled into the company due to its growth from artificial intelligence technology that's given advertisers more ways to target users in mobile games.
CEO Adam Foroughi suggested on the earnings call that another wave of growth is likely on the way due to the legal saga between Apple and Epic Games.
In April, a judge in Oakland found that Apple had violated the court's original order from a case that was originally decided in 2021, which forced the iPhone developer to make limited changes to its linking out policy under California law.
In June, Apple was dealt a blow in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, as a panel of judges denied the company's emergency application to halt changes to its App Store that resulted from the legal battle.
Foroughi, who founded AppLovin in 2012 and took it public nine years later, was asked on Wednesday if gaming companies have changed the way they spend money to acquire users due to the Epic case. Foroughi said the company hasn't seen an impact yet, and that it will ""take longer than people expect,"" with a big benefit coming within four to eight quarters.
The idea is that developers are no longer being forced to pay Apple's 15%-30% take because purchases can be paid outside the App Store, so they'll be willing to spend more on advertising to find new users. That plays into AppLovin's market.
""You'll start seeing it compound pretty quickly in terms of benefit to us as an ad platform,"" Foroughi said on the call with analysts. ""Once the very large leaders start doing it, you'll start seeing the smaller to mid-sized ones really pick it up quickly.""
For the time being, results appear good enough for investors when it comes to the present. Net income more than doubled to $819.5 million, or $2.39 a share, from $310 million, or 89 cents a share a year earlier. Earnings sailed past analysts' estimates of $2.03, according to LSEG.
Revenue increased 77% to $1.26 billion, with that growth figure excluding last year's revenue from the company's gaming business, which it sold in June. Analysts expected revenue of $1.27 billion.
While AppLovin's stock has been a Wall Street darling in recent years, multiple firms don't believe the story and have been public in their criticism.
In March, a third short-selling firm raised concerns about the company's digital ad technology and claimed that it is breaking app store rules. That report, from Muddy Waters Research, said that AppLovin's ad tactics ""systematically"" violate app stores' terms of service by ""impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs from Meta, Snap, TikTok, Reddit, Google, and others.""
A month earlier, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, which drove its earnings growth and stock surge. A
fter the initial short reports were published, Foroughi wrote a blog post, defending his company's technology and practices, and taking aim at those trying to profit from AppLovin's decline, calling them ""nefarious short-sellers"" who were ""making false and misleading claims aimed at undermining our success, and driving down our stock for their own financial gain.""
Analysts at Wedbush still recommend buying the shares and wrote in a report after the latest results that the fallout of the Apple-Epic case will likely become ""a tailwind for AppLovin next year.""

In the past year, U.S. companies made more progress in getting employees back to the office than at any time since 2020, when the pandemic fundamentally changed the traditional work paradigm. This is according to a forthcoming report from CBRE, due out next week. While some employers have gone fully remote and some offer hybrid work opportunities, the push is on to get more workers back to the office.
Nearly three quarters of the 184 companies surveyed by CBRE said they have met their attendance goals, up from 61% last year. The share of companies monitoring attendance jumped to 69% this year from 45% last year, and those enforcing attendance policies rose to 37% from 17%. Companies in the survey said they want employees in the office an average of 3.2 days a week. Actual attendance, however, is slightly below that.
""I think it was pretty loosey goosey for the last year or two, and I think the companies have got a lot better at that right now,"" said Manish Kashyap, CBRE's global president of leasing. ""They're coming up with policies that allow hybrid structures and allow flexibility, but whatever their new policy is, their implementation around that, and the governance around that, is definitely a lot better.""
More companies said they expect to expand their office footprints, rather than contract, according to the survey. Over the past several years there has been a huge slowdown in office development and a surge in conversions to residential.
The majority of survey respondents, 67% of companies, said they will either keep their office footprints at the same size or expand them within the next three years, up from 64% a year ago. For expansion, most pointed to business or headcount growth. About a third said they will reduce their space, down from 36% last year and 53% in 2023.
Concerns about the economy and tariffs do have some companies hesitating to make long-term decisions, but even with that concern, more are taking on long-term leases than were a year ago, CBRE found.
""You have organizations that finally have clarity and decision making, because they've been living in this world of hybrid for so long, and now they know what it truly looks like for them, so all those decisions that they may have put off, even if there's a little bit of economic uncertainty right now, they're still willing to move forward with some additional deals,"" said Julie Whelan, CBRE's global head of occupier research.
Despite the fact that overall office vacancies are at 18.9%, just under the 30-year high of 19%, nearly half of the companies surveyed said they were concerned about the availability of high-quality office space over the next three years. That concern is most significant when it comes to prime space, which accounts for only 8% of the total office inventory and has much lower vacancy rate than the rest of the market.
""For many, office footprints now are smaller but more effective and better tailored for collaborative work. Employers are much more focused now than they were pre-pandemic on quality of workplace experience, the efficiency of seat sharing and the vibrancy of the districts in which they're located,"" said Whelan.",79c33ef49c8cbcce0e8b8ace48fe11e6,trafilatura,3541,0

The order directed regulators to review all banks they supervise for any current or past practices that would effectively bar customers based on political or religious beliefs, and levy fines or other disciplinary measures as needed. It said regulators may refer certain cases to the Justice Department for potential civil action and also directed regulators themselves to purge any policies or practices that may discourage banks from providing services based on non-financial reasons. The executive order is the latest in a growing pressure campaign against the financial sector by U.S. conservatives, who argue they have been unfairly deprived of services on the basis of their political beliefs.
Trump claimed in a CNBC interview on Tuesday that he personally was discriminated against by banks, asserting without evidence that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. JPMorgan said on Tuesday it does not close accounts for political reasons. Bank of America said it does not comment on client matters, and would welcome clearer rules from bank regulators on how to conduct its activities.
The executive order said some financial institutions participated in ""government-directed surveillance programs"" against conservatives following the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, by Trump supporters. ""Such practices are incompatible with a free society and the principle that the provision of banking services should be based on material, measurable, and justifiable risks,"" the executive order said.
Large banks have consistently said they do not reject customers on political or other belief-based grounds. Instead, they have argued that overzealous bank regulators and supervisors have discouraged them from engaging with certain sectors and have called for clearer guidelines. In a joint statement, major banking groups thanked the Trump administration for efforts to rein in ""runaway regulations"" and said the new order may provide sought-after clarity for lenders.
""It's in banks' best interest to take deposits, lend to and support as many customers as possible. Unfortunately, regulatory overreach, supervisory discretion and a maze of obscure rules have stood in the way,"" said a joint statement from the Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Consumer Bankers Association and Financial Services Forum.
Trump-led regulators have already taken steps to loosen regulations, with all three federal bank regulators announcing this year they would no longer police banks on so-called ""reputational risk,"" wherein supervisors could sanction institutions for activities that are not strictly prohibited but could expose the bank to negative publicity or costly litigation. The executive order directed all regulators to stop using that standard within 180 days.
Banks increasingly complained the reputational risk standard was too subjective and vague, allowing bank supervisors to effectively bar firms from providing services to some people or sectors. The industry has also argued regulators need to update anti-money laundering rules, which frequently can force banks to shut down suspicious accounts without providing a reason.",7a10f0777b1d0e73276668ec09faa2dd,trafilatura,3516,0

The Japanese giant reported 421.8 billion yen ($2.87 billion) in the quarter ended June, versus 127.6 billion yen expected, according to LSEG consensus estimates. It is the second straight quarter of profit for SoftBank. The company reported a 174.28 billion yen loss in the same period last year.
In the fiscal first quarter, SoftBank said the value of its Vision Funds rose $4.8 billion. It is the biggest gain in value for the Vision Fund since the June quarter of 2021.
Profit for the Vision Funds segment, which takes into account other factors like expenses, hit 451.4 billion yen in the quarter, versus a loss in the same period last year.
SoftBank Group shares hit a record high on Thursday, ahead of earnings. The stock is up more than 36% this year, while the company has added nearly $37 billion to its market capitalization.
OpenAI bet
SoftBank has been on spending spree related to AI. The Japanese giant is leading a $40 billion funding round into ChatGPT developer OpenAI and it is currently waiting for its $6.5 proposed acquisition of AI chip firm Ampere Computing to close.
For OpenAI, SoftBank said that an initial $10 billion has been made by SoftBank and other investors. The remaining $30 billion funding will take place by December.
OpenAI is in talks with investors about a potential stock sale, with shares to be sold by current and former employees, CNBC reported on Wednesday. SoftBank will not buy any of those shares, a person familiar with the matter, told CNBC on Thursday.
IPO pipeline
The Vision Fund performance will be welcomed by investors hoping to see those big AI bets start to pay off.
SoftBank said that the rise of the value of the Vision Fund was helped by gains at public companies such as ride-hailing firm Grab, as well as Indian food delivery firm Swiggy. The performance was also aided by private investments in some of firms in India in which the fund has a position.
SoftBank expects companies in its portfolio — including PayPay, fintech giant Klarna and Indian eyewear retailer Lenskart — to go public this year, the person familiar with the matter said. Travel app Klook could file for an IPO in the U.S. in the coming weeks, the person said.
Meanwhile, SoftBank is a key company in the massive $500 billion Stargate project in the U.S. that aims to build data centers and AI infrastructure in the country. Investors are waiting for details on how SoftBank plans to fund this spending.
In May, SoftBank posted its first annual profit in four years for the fiscal year ended March, helped by gains in SoftBank's older investments in Alibaba, T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom.
In the June quarter, SoftBank reported a 256.55 billion yen investment loss for its other holdings, which weighed on the group's overall profit. The Japanese firm said it posted an investment loss on the sale of shares of T-Mobile and Alibaba, which was partially offset by a gain on shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia.
SoftBank said on Thursday that it sold 13 million shares of T-Mobile in August for $3 billion.
Meanwhile Arm, the chip designer that is majority-owned by SoftBank, contributed a 8.66 billion yen loss to the Japanese company. SoftBank attributed this to increase research and development expenses, which led to investments growing faster than revenues.",7bc0195b6e8a423c985b71a4128c0d2b,trafilatura,3444,0

India counts the U.S. as its single largest export partner. Its total goods exports reached about $434 billion in the year ended March 2025, and nearly 20%, or $86.51 billion worth of goods, were shipped to the U.S., according to the latest official data.
The potential 50% extra tariff on Indian products could put a drag of a total 0.6 percentage point on its gross domestic product, according to Goldman Sachs' estimates.

Questions linger about how these duties will be implemented: will they apply to the raw chip itself that is imported, or the end product, like a smartphone or laptop? And how much manufacturing needs to actually be done in the U.S.?
Trump said that, if companies are ""building in the United States or have committed to build, without question,"" then ""there will be no charge.""
A number of chip stocks moved higher on Thursday on investor hopes that pledges of U.S. investment and current footprint Stateside may help them avoid the worst of the semiconductor tariffs.
Based on Trump's comments, here's a breakdown of the major chip companies in the world and what their operations and investment commitments to the U.S.
TSMC
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's biggest chipmaker, has pledged a total of $165 billion in investments to the U.S.
This includes an ongoing $65 billion investment in advanced chip making operations in Phoenix, Arizona and a fresh $100 billion announced in March.
TSMC shares rose nearly 5% in Taiwan on Thursday, as investors bet the company will ride out the semiconductor tariffs.
Samsung
Samsung operates chipmaking facilities in Texas and has also committed billions of dollars in investment to the U.S.
Apple on Wednesday said that Samsung would produce image sensors of the iPhone maker out of the Korean tech giant's facility in Austin, Texas.
Samsung shares also ended the day higher in South Korean trading.
GlobalFoundries
U.S.-headquartered chipmaker GlobalFoundries saw shares surge nearly 10% in premarket trade on Thursday.
The company has a manufacturing footprint in the U.S., but it does not make cutting-edge chips like TSMC. Instead, it makes less advanced products that are widely used across various industries.
On Wednesday, GlobalFoundries announced an agreement with Apple for a ""deeper collaboration that will advance semiconductor technologies and strengthen U.S. manufacturing.""
The company said it will ""accelerate"" investments at its factory in Malta, New York.
Given its U.S. base, investors see GlobalFoundries as a winner of Trump's semiconductor tariffs.
SK Hynix
SK Hynix produces the high-bandwidth memory chips that Nvidia uses in its products. Last year, the South Korean company announced a nearly $4 billion chip packaging facility in the U.S.
Shares of SK Hynix closed more than 1% higher on Thursday.
Nvidia
In April, Nvidia said it plans to produce up to $500 billion of AI infrastructure in the U.S. via its manufacturing partnerships over the next four years.
Its Blackwell AI chips have started production at TSMC's Phoenix facility.
Nvidia shares were 1% higher in premarket trade.
Apple
While not strictly a semiconductor company, Apple does design its own chips. Trump on Wednesday announced that Apple will spend an additional $100 billion on U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years.
Apple said that its U.S.-based supply chain would produce more than 19 billion chips for its products this year, which includes manufacturing from TSMC in Arizona.

This classic technical signal suggests the meme coin is consolidating for a potentially large and imminent price swing.
Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-period (day or week) simple moving average of an asset's price. A narrowing band represents dwindling volatility, a sign that the market is coiling and building energy for the big move in either direction.
The narrowing of the bands follows consecutive weekly price drops. Notably, prices fell by 13.8% to $0.00001160 last week, the largest decline since the first week of March, according to data source CoinDesk.
Since then, prices have stabilized and recovered, trading above $0.00001200. The cryptocurrency has particularly demonstrated impressive resilience in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.
Key insights
SHIB showcased notable price volatility throughout the 23-hour trading window spanning from August 5, 12:00 to August 6, 11:00, recording a comprehensive range of $0.000003104, which constituted a 25.4% differential between the peak value of $0.000012217 and the trough of $0.000011913.
The digital asset underwent an initial steep correction from $0.000012362 to $0.000011985 in the opening hours, subsequently establishing consolidation patterns near the $0.000012000 threshold before executing a meaningful rebound that elevated prices to $0.000012186 by the period's conclusion, indicating persistent accumulation interest during price weakness.
Throughout the concluding 60-minute interval from August 6 10:23 to 11:22, SHIB displayed exceptional bullish characteristics with continuous upward price action advancing from $0.000012123 to $0.000012198, marking a 0.62% appreciation that strengthened the overarching recovery narrative.
The hourly trading session featured pronounced buying activity with transaction volume surges surpassing 19 billion tokens during pivotal breakout phases, notably around 11:07 when valuations momentarily challenged support at $0.000012125 before continuing the ascent to session peaks of $0.000012198, signaling substantial institutional positioning and validating the asset's capacity to sustain upward momentum beyond key psychological barriers.

Here are Toyota's results compared with the mean estimates from LSEG:
- Revenue: 12.25 trillion Japanese yen ($83.4 billion) vs. 12.19 trillion yen
- Operating profit: 1.17 trillion yen vs. 881.41 billion yen
While its June-quarter results topped estimates, operating profit dropped 11% year on year, with the company ascribing 450 billion yen in losses to U.S. tariffs. Net income attributable to the company fell 37% to 841.3 billion yen.
Toyota revised down its full-year operating income forecast by 600 billion yen to 3.2 trillion yen for its financial year ending in March 2026.
""Due to the impact of U.S. tariffs and other factors, actual results showed decreased operating income, and the forecast has been revised downward,"" the company said in an earnings release.
In its home country of Japan, the company said that operating income was weighed down by the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and increased expenses.
While profit fell, Toyota has seen strong global demand and the automaker last week reported record worldwide sales in the first half of the year.
""Despite a challenging external environment, we have continued to make comprehensive investments and as well as improvements such as increased unit sales, cost reductions, and expanded value chain profits, thereby minimizing negative impacts,"" the company said.
Japanese carmakers have been hit by U.S. President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles, which came into effect in April. Peers such as Honda have also reported a drop in profit, as they cut prices in order to maintain market share in the U.S.
""Japanese automakers faced significant profit pressure earlier this year due to elevated U.S. import tariffs and a stronger yen,"" automotive analyst at Counterpoint Research Abhik Mukherjee, told CNBC.
""Although vehicle export volumes to the U.S. held up, the higher costs from tariffs had to be partially absorbed, squeezing margins,"" he added.
In June, the value of Japan car exports to the U.S. fell 25.3% year over year, even though car export volumes to the U.S. rose by 4.6% in the same period, according to data from Japan's trade ministry.
Trump, however, announced a new trade deal with Tokyo last month with tariffs expected to fall to 15%, though the timeframe for the change remains unclear.
In light of the Japan-U.S. agreement, Toyota said it was expecting a full financial year impact of 1.4 trillion yen on profits.

In a letter sent Thursday to Google CEO Sundar Pichai and YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, the Democrats and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont asked the executives about conversations with Trump's lawyers over an ongoing lawsuit Trump filed more than four years ago, accusing the online video platform of unlawful censorship.
The lawsuit stemmed from the suspension of Trump's accounts on social media sites after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump filed suits against Facebook, Twitter and YouTube later that year.
The senators highlighted reports of a court filing from May indicating that lawyers representing YouTube and Trump were ""engaged in productive discussions."" In that filing, the two parties asked the judge to delay a June court hearing until Sept. 8.
""We are concerned about the possibility that Google could settle the lawsuit against YouTube in a quid-pro-quo arrangement to avoid full accountability for violating federal competition, consumer protection, and labor laws, circumstances that could result in the company running afoul of federal bribery laws,"" the letter said.
Twitter, now X, and Facebook, now Meta, settled lawsuits with Trump this year, for about $10 million and $25 million, respectively. A judge dismissed the Twitter case in 2022, but Trump appealed.
Under the 1996 Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are allowed to moderate content on their platforms and exempt themselves from liability for the material that users post.
The senators noted in their letter that Google is a defendant in multiple unfair labor and antitrust lawsuits brought by the U.S. government. It also pointed to the company's donation of $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, and noted that Pichai attended the president's inauguration and dined with him at Mar-a-Lago.
Google currently faces the potential of being broken into parts, after the company lost an antitrust case in 2024 brought by the Department of Justice related to Google's dominance among search engines.
The company argued that any kind of breakup could harm the U.S. in its tech competition with China. The judge is expected to rule on the penalties this month.
Also, the National Labor Relations Board has several open cases against Google that allege unfair labor practices, the senators said.
""The company has substantial interests in almost every aspect of the federal government, from tax policy to energy and environmental policy, and much more,"" they wrote. ""Google stands to benefit from how the federal government proceeds in these matters, and Google may settle this lawsuit in the hopes of securing outcomes favorable to the company.""
Despite calls for answers, Democratic senators have limited ability to force action, as Republicans control the White House and both houses of Congress.

Among our top detractors were Baker Hughes, Argenx and Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM). Atlassian is a leading provider of innovative, customizable team collaboration software tools. The company reported modestly disappointing quarterly results in May, following two prior quarters of solid results, due in part to delays in signing some large enterprise contracts. Other potential headwinds, such as tariff pressure on customers’ software budgets and the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on knowledge worker jobs, also weighed on investors. We have been monitoring these potential headwinds but don’t see any change in Atlassian’s long-term profit cycle, and we remain confident in the potential of several company-specific, multiyear growth drivers. And with the hiring of a new chief revenue officer in late 2024, Atlassian is working to enhance its senior management talent in sales, marketing and R&D. With the stock trading at an attractive valuation, we added modestly to our position.

Exports climbed 7.2% in July in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier, customs data showed Thursday, exceeding Reuters-polled economists' estimates of a 5.4% rise.
Imports rose 4.1% last month from a year earlier, marking the biggest jump since July 2024, according to LSEG data. The data also indicated a recovery in import levels following June's 1.1% rebound. Economists had forecast imports in July to fall 1.0%, according to a Reuters poll.
On a year-to-date basis, China's overall exports jumped 6.1% from a year earlier, while imports fell 2.7%, customs data showed. China's trade surplus this year, as of July, reached $683.5 billion, 32% higher than the same period in 2024.
China's exports have supported the economy ""strongly"" so far this year, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, cautioning that the momentum of businesses' shipment front-loading may soon fade.
However, Beijing's exports to the U.S. fell for the fourth consecutive month on a year-over-year basis. In July, it shrank 21.7% from a year earlier. Imports from the U.S. also dropped 18.9% year over year.
July's export declines were largely offset by shipments diverted to alternative markets such as Southeast Asia, which increased 16.6%, while imports fell 5.8% from a year earlier. China's exports to the European Union also rose 9.2% while imports fell 1.6%.
In July, China's exports of rare earths surged 21.4% from a year ago to 5,994.3 tones while auto exports grew 26% to 694,000 units. Exports of semiconductors rose 16% from a year ago to 31.8 billion units.
China's imports of soybeans rose 18.4% to 11.66 million tones, while crude oil imports grew 11.5% from a year earlier.
The U.S. and Chinese negotiators have yet to strike an agreement that would keep the triple-digit tariffs at bay as the truce expires on Aug.12.
China's U.S.-bound goods currently face a 20% tariff related to the country's alleged role in the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., a 10% baseline tariff, stacked on top of a 25% duty on certain goods imposed during Trump's first term.
Trump has threatened to impose new sectoral levies that will impact countries including China, such as a tariff on pharmaceuticals that could go up to 200%, and an about 100% ""secondary tariff"" for buying Russian oil.
So far, Beijing has agreed to end its export ban on rare-earth metals and magnets to the U.S. following a series of negotiations, while Washington has agreed to restart shipments of semiconductor design software and production materials.
Semiconductor giant Nvidia said last month that the U.S. government was reviewing its licenses to potentially allow it to resume sales of H20 chips to Chinese clients, reversing a ban the Trump administration imposed in April.
China's factory activity unexpectedly deteriorated to a three-month low in July, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index falling to 49.3 from June's reading of 49.7, missing expectations for 49.7.",6f9cc26d7cce45f498005dc617be602e,trafilatura,3154,0

""IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!"" Trump wrote on social media platform Truth Social.
In an earlier post Trump had said the tariffs were targeting ""COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS.""
Trump last week — ahead of his Aug. 1 tariffs deadline — rejigged the tariff rates and pushed back the deadline to Aug. 7.
Some of the steepest duties include Syria's 41%, and Laos and Myanmar's 40% rate, while Switzerland — after being unsuccessful in a last-minute scramble for a deal — is facing 39% tariffs.
Swiss negotiators this week travelled to Washington D.C. for talks after the country's higher rate came as a surprise to many, but so far, no deal appears to have been agreed. An update is expected from the Swiss government later on Thursday.
Separately, Brazil and India are both now facing duties of 50%. While Brazil's tariffs appear to have kicked in, India's rate is at 25% for now, and will rise to 50% later this month, according to an executive order signed Wednesday. Trump said his tariffs on India are related to its current purchases of Russian oil.
Other countries and regions, meanwhile, have been able to strike trade agreements with the U.S. This includes the European Union, Japan and South Korea — which all now face 15% tariffs — as well as the U.K., which negotiated a 10% rate.
Others, including China and Mexico, remain in limbo. China is engaged in something of a trade truce with the U.S. for now, while previously announced rates for Mexico are on pause.
'This game is not over'
Trump's latest tariff announcements — including higher duties on India and threats of 100% tariffs on chips — show ""this game is not over,"" according to Bill Papadakis, macro strategist at Lombard Odier.
""There has been some optimism building recently because the overall level of uncertainty has come down,"" he told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Thursday, pointing out that several deals have been made and Trump has walked back some of his threats.
""But we shouldn't be overly optimistic either,"" he warned, as the impact of tariffs on economic growth and inflation is not yet clear.
Beat Wittmann, chairman and partner at Zurich-based Porta Advisors, noted that sharp duties like the ones faced by India and Switzerland should not come as a surprise.
""You just watch how Trump is treating neighbors, Canada, and then you can imagine all the rest. So welcome to this new world,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""
Wittmann also weighed in on Switzerland, as it scrambles to lower its tariff rate.
""What should Switzerland do? Realize that we live in a world of policymakers and these other three superpowers — China, EU and the U.S., and all the rest — are in various degrees, takers,"" he said.
""So the only thing you can do is short-term accommodate, be flexible, be adaptive. But you know, structurally, you have to become stronger yourself and more independent.""",ccd0c19249224b41525f95772ce45fdb,trafilatura,3147,0

(NYSE:DIS) shares dropped after the company released its fiscal third-quarter 2025 results. While adjusted earnings per share (EPS) surpassed analyst expectations, the company’s total revenue fell slightly short of projections.
For the quarter, Disney reported adjusted EPS of $1.61, beating the consensus estimate of $1.47. However, revenue grew by just 2% year-over-year to $23.65 billion, slightly missing the $23.72 billion analyst forecast. The company’s performance was driven by its Experiences business.
The direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming businesses, including Disney+ and Hulu, reached a combined operating income of $346 million on revenue of $6.2 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year. The quarter concluded with 183 million total Disney+ Core and Hulu subscriptions, a sequential increase of 2.6 million. Disney+ Core paid subscribers increased by 1.8 million to 128 million.

Revenue for the Entertainment segment, which encompasses traditional TV networks, DTC streaming, and films, saw a modest 1% increase to $10.7 billion. In contrast, the Sports segment, primarily consisting of ESPN, saw revenue decline by 5% to $4.3 billion. Disney’s Experiences segment, which includes theme parks and consumer products, proved to be a strong performer, with revenue climbing 8% to $9.09 billion.
The company’s traditional Linear Networks business declined, with revenue falling 15% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. Consolidated operating income for the quarter grew 8% to $4.6 billion. This was led by the Experiences segment’s $2.5 billion, followed by the Sports segment’s $1.04 billion and the Entertainment segment’s $1.02 billion. Disney also demonstrated strong cash flow generation, with quarterly operating cash flow up 41% year-over-year to $3.7 billion and free cash flow rising over 52.7% to $1.9 billion.
Sports Content Deals
In a series of strategic moves to boost its sports offerings, Disney announced an equity-for-assets deal where its ESPN unit will take over the NFL Network, NFL RedZone, and NFL Fantasy. The agreement grants the NFL a 10% stake in ESPN, and ESPN will integrate these assets into its digital and DTC platforms, while also gaining rights to three additional NFL games annually. To maintain the NFL Network’s seven-game slate, four existing ESPN games will be moved to the channel.
Furthermore, ESPN and TKO Group’s World Wrestling Entertainment have entered a five-year, $1.6 billion agreement that gives ESPN exclusive U.S. streaming rights to many of WWE’s premium events, including WrestleMania and SummerSlam, beginning in 2026. The Wall Street Journal reported that ESPN will pay $325 million annually for the deal, which “significantly exceeds WWE’s current $900 million contract with Peacock.” These events will be featured on ESPN’s new $29.99 per month service, launching this fall, with select coverage also airing on ESPN’s cable channels.

Companies had lower expectations to clear coming into the quarter — analysts expected S&P 500 earnings to rise 5% in Q2, the slowest pace of earnings growth since Q4 2023 — amid President Trump's tariffs, stocks' lofty valuations, and uncertainty about the health of the US economy.

Salesforce (CRM) stock fell as much as 5% after hours after the company reported results in line or slightly better than estimates that failed to wow investors looking for big AI gains.
For the quarter, Wall Street was looking for Salesforce's artificial intelligence efforts to show broader adoption — and monetization. Year to date, the stock has underperformed with a 23% loss.
Salesforce did beat Wall Street estimates and show steady growth: Revenue climbed 9.7% year over year to $10.24 billion, slightly above analyst expectations for $10.13 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.91 were also above estimates for earnings of $2.78 per share.
For the 2026 fiscal year, Salesforce initiated revenue guidance of $10.24 billion to $10.29 billion and raised the low end of its full-year revenue guidance, which now stands in a range of $41.1 billion to $41.3 billion. Both of those outlooks represent single-digit growth, which lags in comparison to other large-cap tech and AI players.
“It’s not bad — no one is going to say these are bad numbers,” Jefferies senior analyst Brent Thill told Yahoo Finance in reaction to the results. “We’re just playing a relative game, where everyone else on a relative basis is way better.”

A substantial olive harvest, notably in Spain, has helped to restore confidence in the sector and led to a pronounced fall in prices for both extra virgin and virgin olive oils in supermarkets.
It comes after two consecutive seasons of poor yields resulted in a period of extraordinary turbulence throughout the olive oil value chain.
A perfect storm of climate change-fueled extreme weather, high interest rates and robust inflation culminated in a dizzying price rally of the liquid fat last year — one that stunned consumers and industry veterans alike.
Deoleo CEO Cristóbal Valdés said ""a major shift"" has since been underway, however.
""What was once one of the most challenging periods in our history — marked by a scarcity of raw materials, high price volatility, and declining consumption — is now giving way to a more normalized and promising market landscape,"" Valdés told CNBC by email.
Deoleo, the maker of household olive oil brands such as Bertolli and Carbonell, said it expects an environment of more contained raw material prices to persist throughout the second half of 2025.

""The significant rebound in the olive oil harvest — particularly in Spain — is already translating into more stable supply conditions, and this is having a direct impact on prices at origin,"" Valdés said.
""While some volatility may persist, we believe the trend towards normalization will hold,"" he added.
'Cautiously optimistic'
Most of the world's supply of olive oil comes from the Mediterranean, with southern European countries such as Spain, Italy and Greece among the world's leading producers of the commodity.
Spain, in particular, is the biggest olive oil producer in the European Union and a global reference for prices.
Spain's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said the country produced 1.41 million metric tons of olive oil in the 2024/2025 crop year. The yield, which was slightly less than forecast, marked a roughly 65% increase from 855,600 metric tons a year earlier.
Deoleo's CEO said the bumper Spanish harvest prompted a 50% drop in raw material prices, stimulated demand and allowed the company to lower olive oil prices at the shelf.
""Our outlook is therefore cautiously optimistic: we anticipate a more balanced market, where responsible pricing and a focus on value will be key to sustaining growth and ensuring long-term category health,"" Valdés said.
Deoleo's CEO also said the more favorable market conditions had allowed the company to double its investment in advertising and promotion to 10 million euros ($11.63 million).
Speaking to CNBC before the U.S. and EU agreed to a tariff rate of 15% for most EU goods from Aug. 1, Valdés said the company intended to ramp up its communication, marketing and consumer engagement efforts to ensure olive oil remains an everyday staple.",e51aad955392b3070e9354d2e83886c4,trafilatura,3030,0

Should You Buy the Dividend Stock Here?
Railroad giant Union Pacific (UNP) has bid to acquire Norfolk Southern (NSC) in a deal worth $85 billion. The proposed merger, if approved, would create the first U.S. transcontinental railroad, combining Union Pacific’s network with Norfolk Southern’s network. The railroad would encompass more than 50,000 miles, spanning 43 states and connecting to major ports on both the East Coast and West Coast.
On the other hand, this mega-merger is likely to face some scrutiny. Investors have also been skeptical about the move, with investor rights law firm Halper Sadeh LLC already investigating the company regarding this acquisition.

About Union Pacific Stock
Founded in 1862 and headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, Union Pacific is one of the largest freight rail network operators in the United States. Union Pacific operates more than 32,000 miles of track across 23 states. As a key player in the North American logistics market, the company transports a wide range of goods, including agricultural products and industrial equipment. Currently, Union Pacific has a market capitalization of $131 billion.
UNP stock has been beaten down for quite some time. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has declined by 5%. For comparison, the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) has gained 21% over the same period. So far this year, UNP stock is down by about 2%. Currently, UNP is trading only 9% higher than its 52-week low. Moreover, news of the merger has not been well received by investors, as UNP has declined slightly over the past five days.
On the other hand, this selloff has culminated in an attractive valuation. Union Pacific’s price-to-earnings ratio stands at 19 times, which is lower than the industry average.
On July 16, the company announced a 3% increase in its quarterly dividend rate to $1.38 per share, payable to shareholders on Sept. 30. Its forward annual dividend of $5.52 per share yields an attractive 2.4% on prevailing prices. The company has a record of paying dividends for 126 years, and this raise marks its 19th consecutive year of an annual dividend hike.
Union Pacific’s Q2 Results Topped Estimates
On July 24, Union Pacific reported sound growth in its second-quarter financial results. The company’s total operating revenues increased 2% from the prior-year period to $6.15 billion. At the center of this growth was higher volume and solid gains in core pricing. However, growth was hindered by factors such as reduced fuel surcharges and the business mix. The topline figure was also higher than the $6.11 billion that Wall Street analysts were expecting.",078d814d77cf29adf3544cfd0c6f7f25,trafilatura,2947,0

-
Palantir’s first billion-dollar quarter is dramatically increasing the wealth of the company’s cofounders and C-suite. Peter Thiel and Alex Karp have each seen their net worth jump by $17 billion collectively—and the company’s chief technology officer is the latest to join the billionaires club. This comes as Palantir admits its goal is to cut jobs—but grow revenue by 10x thanks to AI.
Palantir’s stock has hit turbo mode. In the last month alone, shares surged by some 25%, helping the AI and analytics company reach a market cap north of $411 billion. And over the last year, the stock has skyrocketed by more than 550%.
For Palantir’s investors and cofounders, this surge has translated to wealth racking up by the billions. Cofounder Peter Thiel’s net worth has jumped to over $25 billion—up $9 billion since January—and Palantir CEO Alex Karp’s has surged to more than $15 billion (up $8 billion YTD), according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Cofounders Stephen Cohen and Joe Lonsdale are also long-time members of the ultra-rich club.
Now, the financial wins are extending beyond the company’s founders. Chief technology officer Shyam Sankar became its latest exec to cross the billion-dollar mark on Monday, with his net worth climbing past $1.3 billion.
Later that day, the company reported a record-setting $1 billion in revenue for its most recent quarter, up 48% year-over-year. Profit also soared by 33% to $327 million, prompting the company to increase its full-year revenue outlook to at least $4.14 billion.
The company’s successes have been 20 years in the making, Sankar said on Monday’s earnings call.
Fortune reached out to Palantir for comment.
Other companies’ losses are Palantir’s gains
Palantir’s stock growth is likely welcomed news for investors who have been unsatisfied with the performance of other tech companies like Tesla, Apple, and Amazon, which are all in the red this year.
Competitors in the federal contracting space have also struggled, with firms like Accenture, Booz Allen and Deloitte losing key government contracts amid Department of Government Efficiency cuts. However, Palantir has largely gained, with earnings from the U.S. government growing by 53% year-over-year. Just last week, the company landed a $10 billion software and data contract with the Army.
And while Palantir’s partnerships with the federal government have raised eyebrows considering Thiel’s close relationship with the Trump administration, the company is only moving full speed ahead.
“There are almost no parasitic elements to this company,” Karp said in the earnings call on Monday. “We have a small sales force. We have very little BS internally. We have a flat hierarchy. We have the most qualified and interesting people, heterodox in their beliefs.”",95b48bf7e9cfc6bcbd1cbc55d08becd8,trafilatura,2930,0

Pathway has built an AI-powered clinical reference tool that doctors can use to ask questions about guidelines, drugs and trials. Pathway's answers are synthesized from medical literature, and Doximity said the Montreal-based startup has one of the largest structured datasets in medicine.
Doximity's platform, which for years was described as LinkedIn for doctors, helps clinicians stay current on medical news, manage paperwork, find referrals and carry out telehealth appointments with patients. Through its acquisition of Pathway, Doximity hopes doctors will also turn to the platform to answer their clinical questions.
""We hunted high and low, and I think we found the best company in the space at answering physicians' questions using AI, and it wasn't in Silicon Valley,"" Jeff Tangney, Doximity's co-founder and CEO, told CNBC in an interview.
The deal closed in late July for a cash consideration of $26 million and up to $37 million in additional equity grants, Doximity said.
Doximity's integration with Pathway is well underway, Tangney said, and the companies are testing a combined product with thousands of doctors.
Meanwhile, patients are turning with more regularity to AI tools and chatbots for answers to health-related questions, a trend that has potentially troublesome consequences due to the likelihood of inaccurate recommendations.
During a livestream on Thursday where OpenAI announced its new model GPT-5, CEO Sam Altman said health queries are one of the biggest categories of ChatGPT usage, according to a post on X, adding that the new model is ""much better"" in that area.
Doximity already has a free AI product, Doximity GPT, that doctors can use to generate insurance letters and summarize patient charts and reports. Pathway will bring additional ""robustness"" to the data that Doximity has on the back end, said Dr. Amit Phull, Doximity's chief clinical experience officer.
""What Pathway brings to this party or this marriage is that they have a very, very robust back-end data set that ties dosages to guidelines to literature to citations,"" Phull told CNBC in an interview.
Pathway's model scored 96% on the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination benchmark, Doximity said, which doctors have to take to prove that they understand and can apply medical knowledge.
Doximity, which went public in 2021, has seen its stock climb 10% this year after soaring 90% in 2024. The company has a market cap of about $11 billion.
Shares of Doximity rose about 6% in extended trading on Thursday after the company reported fiscal first-quarter results that topped estimates. Revenue jumped 15% from a year earlier to $145.9 million, while analysts expected sales of $139.5 million, according to LSEG.

Crime statistics unavoidably present an incomplete picture, simply because many crimes are not detected or reported. Such is the case with corporate fraud stats, as well.
In 2024, U.S. public companies lost an average of 1.06% of their revenue to known fraud, according to a new survey by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners and the Anti-Fraud Collaboration. That virtually replicated the previous year’s 1.07% average.
However, unknown fraud may be multiple times more expensive, according to the survey, whose 369 participants estimated that the real cost of fraud — detected and undetected — is actually 2.5% of revenue.
Half of the study participants were current employees of U.S. public companies in roles such as fraud examiner, internal auditor, compliance or ethics professional, risk management professional and financial statement preparer.
Additionally, 29% of those surveyed were in governance roles (i.e., board of directors or audit committee members), 14% were external consultants or advisers, and the rest were external auditors or employees of a government agency with regulatory or investigative authority.
“Even for frauds that do come to light, the full amount of the loss might not be determinable,” the report said. ACFE research also shows that about half of internal frauds last more than 12 months before being detected, “Meaning some frauds that were occurring in 2023 and 2024 were likely not yet included in the known fraud losses for those years.”
The survey asked participants to rate both the likelihood and significance of six categories of fraud. Cyberfraud was the worst offender in both senses by a substantial margin. Financial statement fraud was the least likely to occur, but had the second-worst consequences. Customer payment fraud was the second-most likely, but had the least significance.
All three of the most likely types of fraud were external in nature. In addition to cyberfraud, they included fraud by vendors and sellers and customer payment fraud.
The sixth type of fraud, asset misappropriation/embezzlement, was second-lowest in significance and the middle of the pack in likelihood.
As dire as survey participants were about the current specter of fraud, they’re also pessimistic about the future. Two-thirds (66%) of them said they expect an increase in the overall level of fraud over the next two years, compared to only 17% who forecasted decreased fraud.
Company employees and governance officials were asked what could be done differently to better deter fraud or detect it sooner at their company. The runaway top response could hardly be more straightforward: More than half (56%) simply recommended more or improved proactive and continuous monitoring for fraud.",47d9ca1b2a351565055ec744bcf10c50,trafilatura,2869,0

-
Barry Ritholtz is a savvy and experienced investor, who regularly shares his valuable insights.
-
Many of his lessons revolve around how we often do the wrong thing managing our money.
There's no shortage of financial books out there if that's what interests you. But since none of us has time to read them all, we need to be choosy. Permit me, then, to recommend How Not to Invest: The Ideas, Numbers, and Behaviors that Destroy Wealth -- and How to Avoid Them by Barry Ritholtz. It offers a fresh angle on investing and money management by telling us what not to do if we want to build wealth.
Here are a few lessons from the book. Dive in yourself, and you'll learn many more.
Meet Barry Ritholtz
First, meet the author, Barry Ritholtz, who is the co-founder, chairman, and chief investment officer of Ritholtz Wealth Management, and an early devotee of behavioral economics. You may know him from his very well regarded financial blog, ""The Big Picture,"" and his popular podcast, Masters in Business.
Ritholtz is known for his straight talk about financial matters, and his book has a lot of that to offer. (Better still, his writing is very accessible -- and even entertaining.)
Lesson 1: Beware of ""denominator blindness""
In times of extreme stock market volatility, you might run across a headline like ""Dow Plunges 1,000 Points!"" That can get your heart beating fast as you worry about whether your portfolio will be wiped out. You need to look at the bigger picture, though, specifically at the denominator in question. For example, if the Dow was at 1,000 before it fell by 1,000, that's a 100% drop and terrible indeed.
But the Dow Jones Industrial Index was recently near 44,600. So a drop from 44,600 to 43,600 isn't actually that horrifying. It's actually a drop of 2.24%.
Ritholtz applies the same concept to corporate layoffs. Consider Microsoft, which is expecting to lay off around 9,000 people in 2025. That's certainly a huge number of people, but don't let it have you wondering whether Microsoft is going out of business. You need to look at the denominator. Is the workforce reduction 9,000 people out of 20,000 or 100,000, or what?
Well, actually, as of about a year ago, Microsoft employed about 228,000 people worldwide (about 55% of which are in the U.S.). So a 9,000 reduction out of 228,000 is a cut of about 3.95%. It's not nothing, but it's not a bloodbath, either.
Lesson 2: Beware of prognosticators
Ritholtz takes to task those financial pundits who like to predict recessions. Recessions do happen, but no one can consistently predict when they will happen. That's why trying to time the market is not a smart move. Ritholtz notes: ""During the 20th century, there were 20 recessions, or one every five years on average. If you predict a recession over the next four years, you'll be on average right 80% of the time.""",26fd787593e5e1128d13a14ec97f40c6,trafilatura,2865,0

The retailer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a federal court in Delaware on Wednesday, highlighting the ""difficulty facing mall-based retailers geared to the teen and tween customer,"" according to Sarah Foss, head of legal at Debtwire.
In the filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware, the U.S. firm, primarily owned by Elliott Management and Monarch Alternative Capital, estimated both its assets and liabilities at between $1 billion and $10 billion, underscoring the financial strain that led to its latest filing.
Pressure From Shein, Temu Accelerate Retail Closures
The filing comes shortly after the company tapped Houlihan Lokey Inc. to find potential buyers for some or all of Claire's locations, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Claire's is also facing a $500 million loan that's due in December 2026, Bloomberg reported. It also decided to defer interest payments on its debt to help preserve capital.
In better times, the store targeted a younger demographic with a wide selection of affordable jewelry, hair accessories and beauty products. Today, the retailer, which sources from China, is facing higher import costs due to President Trump's tariffs. Consumers are also curbing their spending in response to the current economic climate.
Us Retail Closures Hit Highest Level Since Pandemic
One of the company's other core challenges, according to Foss, is that its target demographic ""is notoriously fickle and heavily influenced by the trends they are seeing online, leaving some of the mall mainstays like Claire’s or Forever 21 struggling to keep up with the changing trends and preferences of its customer base.""
Claire's first filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2018/ Elliott and Monarch took control of the retailer when it emerged later that year.
Foss said a bankruptcy filing can be a good option for a struggling retail chain as it allows a company to refocus, trim its debt and slim down its retail footprint, but ""retailers that have emerged from Chapter 11 only to file again a few years later often find themselves liquidating and shutting their doors entirely, with some kind of online presence remaining.""
However, the company still hasn't filed a document outlining its proposed path in bankruptcy.
The company operates under two brand names: Claire’s and ICING. There are more than 2,750 Claire’s stores in 17 countries throughout North America and Europe and 190 ICING stores in North America. There are more than 300 franchised Claire’s stores, located primarily in the Middle East and South Africa. Claire's products are also sold in thousands of concessions locations in North America and Europe, according to its website.",ed64f65ec45f4f319bf18bd886fa7bd9,trafilatura,2858,0

Crude Prices Slide on a Possible Russian Air Truce with Ukraine
On Monday, nat-gas prices sank to a 3.5-month low on higher US nat-gas production and the outlook for even higher output in the near term. Ramped-up US nat gas production is bearish for prices as recent US nat-gas output is up year-over-year. Also, expectations for even higher US nat-gas production are weighing on nat-gas prices after last Friday's weekly report from Baker Hughes showed that the number of active US nat-gas drilling rigs in the week ending August 1 rose by +2 rigs to a 2-year high of 124 rigs.
Lower-48 state dry gas production on Tuesday was 108.0 bcf/day (+3.4% y/y), according to BNEF. Lower-48 state gas demand on Tuesday was 75.6 bcf/day (-10.8% y/y), according to BNEF. Estimated LNG net flows to US LNG export terminals on Tuesday were 15.5 bcf/day (+3.9% w/w), according to BNEF.
An increase in US electricity output is positive for nat-gas demand from utility providers. The Edison Electric Institute reported last Wednesday that total US (lower-48) electricity output in the week ended July 26 rose +8.1% y/y to 98,772 GWh (gigawatt hours), and US electricity output in the 52-week period ending July 26 rose +2.7% y/y to 4,258,448 GWh.
Last Thursday's weekly EIA report was bearish for nat-gas prices since nat-gas inventories for the week ended July 25 rose +48 bcf, above the consensus of +41 bcf and the 5-year average of +24 bcf for the week. As of July 25, nat-gas inventories were down -3.9% y/y, but were +6.7% above their 5-year seasonal average, signaling adequate nat-gas supplies. As of July 30, gas storage in Europe was 68% full, compared to the 5-year seasonal average of 76% full for this time of year.
Baker Hughes reported last Friday that the number of active US nat-gas drilling rigs in the week ending August 1 rose by +2 to a 2-year high of 124 rigs. In the past ten months, the number of gas rigs has risen from the 4-year low of 94 rigs reported in September 2024.

SOFIA, Bulgaria, August 07, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Westinghouse Electric Company has signed its first Purchase Order, with MTG-Dolphin AD, supporting the two-unit AP1000® project at Bulgaria’s Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. The order demonstrates Westinghouse’s commitment to using local suppliers for the expansion of nuclear power generation at Kozloduy.
The scope includes the development of the Nuclear Quality Assurance (NQA-1) Program, including the implementation of a nuclear safety culture, the preparation of engineering documentation for mockup manufacturing and the potential production of an AP1000 CA Structural Module mockup. This work also presents opportunities for MTG-Dolphin AD to support Westinghouse’s projects in Europe and beyond.
""Our participation in the AP1000 project demonstrates the strength and potential of Bulgaria’s industrial base,"" said Svetlin Stoyanov, CEO of MTG-Dolphin AD. ""We are proud to support Westinghouse in advancing Bulgaria’s nuclear energy future and look forward to contributing to the success of the Kozloduy expansion, as well to future projects across Europe.""
""Westinghouse is committed to engaging Bulgaria’s highly experienced nuclear supply chain in supporting the expansion of Kozloduy as well as other AP1000 projects in Europe and around the world,"" said Dan Lipman, President of Westinghouse Energy Systems. ""Local suppliers such as MTG-Dolphin AD will not only help us deliver the project on time and on budget, but they will also help drive real economic impact locally and create thousands of jobs during construction and the many decades of operation to come.""
As part of its ""buy where we build"" philosophy of localization, Westinghouse has already signed memoranda of understanding with 29 Bulgarian suppliers to support the project. The Kozloduy project will also provide Bulgarian firms the opportunity to support other AP1000 projects in Europe and globally. Bulgarian companies can find more information about becoming a Westinghouse supplier on its Bulgarian website.
The AP1000 reactor is the only operating advanced Generation III+ reactor with fully passive safety systems, modular construction design and the smallest footprint per MWe on the market. There are six AP1000 reactors currently setting operational performance and availability records worldwide with twelve reactors under construction and six more under contract. There will be 18 units based on AP1000 technology in operation globally by the end of the decade. The AP1000 technology has also been selected for nuclear energy programs in Poland and Ukraine and is also under consideration at multiple other sites in Europe, the United Kingdom, and North America.",dc1408b693409f2d1b80f64c0eeff01b,trafilatura,2842,0

This move marks ExxonMobil's return to the Caribbean nation's waters after more than two decades and follows an earlier report that discussions were ongoing for the exploration rights to the deep-water blocks.
The blocks, located north-west of ExxonMobil's highly successful Stabroek block in Guyana, are situated in waters ranging from 2,000–3,000m deep.
The signing of an agreement with ExxonMobil for the area, now referred to as Ultra Deep 1 (UD1), could take place as early as next week, the report said.
An ExxonMobil spokesperson was quoted as saying: ""We will not comment on third party sources, but we routinely look at opportunities to optimise our advantaged portfolio.”
Trinidad and Tobago's Energy Minister, Roodal Moonilal, has not yet commented on the matter.
The agreement with Trinidad includes a signing bonus and a three-phase exploration programme, which involves seismic data acquisition and the drilling of exploration wells.
Should the exploration yield oil or gas, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago stands to benefit from royalty payments, profit sharing and a provision for cost recovery.
ExxonMobil first expressed interest in the Trinidadian blocks in November 2024.
The country, currently hosting a deep-water auction that is set to close on 17 September, has the right to negotiate individually for areas not included in competitive bidding, as per its laws.
With this development, Trinidad and Tobago aims to rejuvenate investment in its offshore sectors, which is crucial for sustaining its liquefied natural gas and petrochemical industries.
The nation is also hopeful of discovering oil in its deep waters, especially after a key offshore gas project with Venezuela was shelved due to the loss of US authorisation.
In neighbouring Guyana, ExxonMobil, alongside partners Chevron and CNOOC, is nearing the start of production at a fourth floating facility.
This expansion is set to increase output to more than 900,000 barrels per day, with a target of 1.7 million barrels per day by 2030.

Magnesia Specialties posted record revenue of $90 million. Gross profit jumped 32% to $36 million, with margin improving to 40%, driven by strong pricing, improved lime shipments, and operational efficiency.
Cash from operating activities for the first half of 2025 totaled $605 million, up from $173 million a year earlier. Capital expenditures reached $412 million.
The company returned $547 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. It ended the quarter with $225 million in cash and $1.2 billion in available credit.
Martin Marietta completed its acquisition of Premier Magnesia on July 25.

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.
“Demand across our primary end markets remains varied. Infrastructure activity remains robust, underpinned by sustained record levels of federal and state investment. In nonresidential, accelerating data center development and a warehouse recovery are contributing positively to near-term demand, partially offsetting relative softness in interest rate-sensitive light commercial construction. We expect residential construction demand to remain subdued until ongoing affordability headwinds improve,” commented Ward Nye, Chair and CEO of Martin Marietta.
“The first six months of 2025 represented the lowest total reportable incident rate in Martin Marietta’s history. Given our strong first-half performance, together with acquisition contributions and current shipment trends, we are increasing our full-year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $2.30 billion at the midpoint,” stated Nye.",22be59115822a24e2768a4e4a34d25e0,trafilatura,2822,0

FRT’s trailing and forward P/E were 26.04 and 29.67, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
A wide-angle view of an urban skyline, representing the company's investments in urban neighborhoods.
Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE: FRT) stands as one of the most resilient income-generating REITs in the U.S., distinguished by its 57 consecutive years of dividend growth—the longest streak in the sector and a hallmark of stability. Its portfolio comprises 104 high-quality retail and mixed-use properties strategically concentrated in affluent, densely populated coastal markets such as Washington D.C., Boston, and California. This focus on high-barrier, premium locations supports a 93.6% occupancy rate and a 95.9% leased rate, both near two-decade highs, ensuring consistent cash flow even through economic cycles.
FRT’s disciplined strategy emphasizes value-add redevelopment, transforming underperforming assets into mixed-use destinations like Santana Row and Pike & Rose, which enhance property values and tenant diversification. Recent acquisitions, including Del Monte Shopping Center, and a $785M redevelopment pipeline, further position the trust for long-term growth. Financially, the company maintains $1.5B in liquidity and a 3.8x fixed charge coverage ratio, while a $300M share repurchase program underscores confidence in its capital structure. Analysts forecast FFO per share growth of 6% in 2025, supported by strong leasing momentum and rent growth.
With a 4.6% dividend yield, well above the REIT average—and robust institutional backing (93.86% ownership), FRT remains a compelling choice for income-focused investors. While macroeconomic challenges such as interest rate sensitivity and e-commerce headwinds persist, its focus on essential and service-oriented tenants mitigates these risks. Trading around $95.64 with an average price target of $142, Federal Realty offers a rare combination of dividend resilience, premium asset quality, and measured growth potential for long-term investors.
Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG) by David in April 2025, which highlighted its disciplined capital structure, strong free cash flow, and premium tenant mix driving dividend growth. The company’s stock price has appreciated by approximately 10.73% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as SPG sustains solid fundamentals. Serhio MaxDividends shares a similar view but emphasizes FRT’s unmatched dividend growth streak and mixed-use redevelopment strategy.",33f88597549a9ff38cc4d411078d5e79,trafilatura,2804,0

Rivian (RIVN) reported mixed second quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday and did not report a gross profit, as policy changes like tariffs blunted its performance. The company also widened its full-year loss projection, as trade wars and the loss of EV tax credits complicated Rivian's path toward profitability.
Rivian said recent policy actions are expected to ""continue to have an impact on its results and cash flows of its business."" Because of some of the recent changes associated with regulatory credits and its second quarter performance, the company is increasing its adjusted 2025 full-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) before interest loss range to $2 billion to $2.25 billion, from $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously.
Recent policy changes include the Trump administration phasing out the EV tax credit, set to expire on Sept. 30, and sector tariffs of 25% on autos and auto parts. Rivian said on the conference call that the costs from the tariffs are in the ""thousands"" of dollars.
Rivian stock was down more than 5% in premarket trading on Wednesday.
For the quarter, Rivian reported revenue of $1.303 billion vs. $1.28 billion per Bloomberg consensus estimates, higher than the $1.158 billion reported a year ago. The company posted a loss per share of $0.97 vs. $0.77, with an adjusted EBITDA loss of $667 million vs. $493 million expected.
Rivian also did not post gross profit for the quarter, which it had done in the previous two quarters.
On the positive front, Rivian said development of its upcoming R2 midsize SUV is progressing.
""This quarter we made significant progress in R2 development and testing. We also substantially completed the expansion of our Normal, Illinois facility and have begun installing manufacturing equipment in preparation for our start of production,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement.
Rivian said it expects to commission the new R2 line in the third quarter of this year and to start validating the equipment and production processes. The R2 is slated for production in 2026.
The company said in early July that it produced 5,979 vehicles at its factory in Normal, Ill., and delivered 10,661 vehicles during the second quarter, slightly below analysts' consensus of 10,800. Production was limited during the quarter in preparation for model year 2026 vehicles, expected to launch later this month, the company said.

The two companies announced the deal on Thursday. Financial terms were not disclosed.
Craveworthy Brands, a fast-growing restaurant holding company, has become a prolific investor since its founding in 2022. Its portfolio includes legacy chains such as Genghis Grill and BD's Mongolian Grill, emerging concepts including Shaquille O'Neal's Big Chicken as well as several virtual brands that only offer delivery.
Gregorys was founded in 2006. The regional coffee chain is often counted as part of the third-wave coffee trend that focused on quality beans and artisanal craft, along with peers Blue Bottle Coffee and Intelligentsia Coffee. Today, Gregorys has more than 50 locations, but the deal with Craveworthy Brands is meant to help franchise Gregorys and expand beyond its tristate stronghold.
Founder Gregory Zamfotis will stay on as president of the brand.
""Gregory has built something special: a cult following, a craft product and a clear identity. Our role is to protect that, while layering in the operational firepower to grow thoughtfully,"" Craveworthy Brands founder and CEO Gregg Majewski said in a statement.
More than two decades ago, Majewski served as CEO of sandwich chain Jimmy John's, growing it from a couple dozen restaurants to 300 locations by the time he left in 2003. With Craveworthy Brands, he is looking to build a restaurant IP company, similar to the early days of private equity firm Roark Capital, he told CNBC in an interview in May. Roark owns Subway, Dunkin' parent Inspire Brands and Cinnabon owner GoTo Foods.
When looking for potential additions to Craveworthy Brands' portfolio, Majewski has said he's targeting brands with fewer than 75 locations and the ability to franchise easily. Today, the company's holdings include more than a dozen eateries, and its investments range from outright ownership to controlling stakes. With the Gregorys acquisition, the company's annual system sales will cross $400 million, a spokesperson said.
Craveworthy Brands' latest deal comes as beverages increasingly drive traffic in the restaurant industry. Although Starbucks sales are slumping, newer chains such as Dutch Bros and 7 Brew have seen growth soar in recent years. Fast-food chains such as McDonald's and Yum Brands-owned Taco Bell are testing broader drink menus, with options to customize and more ways to caffeinate, from refreshers to flavored cold brew.
Harborfield Management, Branded Hospitality and restaurant-focused venture capital firm Kitchen Fund also invested in Gregorys as part of the funding round.

In terms of market positioning, Celsius continues to strengthen its presence in the energy drink category, capturing 17.3% of the U.S. market share, an increase of 1.8 percentage points year-over-year. The company's international expansion strategy has shown promising results, with revenue growing 27% to $24.8 million across key markets including the UK, Ireland, France, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands.
The company's strong quarterly performance and consistent market share gains indicate solid fundamentals and effective execution of its growth strategy, while signs of accelerating demand for functional beverages could help to drive continued momentum in both domestic and international markets.
Can Celsius Stock Take Out $50 After Earnings?
CELH stock is now up more than 100% year-to-date, and is looking to find a foothold above the $50 level. The shares tagged a new 52-week high of $53 right out of the gate this morning, and are moving into technically overbought territory, based on the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 71.60.
Notably, the round $50 level that’s now in play after earnings was previously a key area of support for CELH through late 2023 and early 2024.

First Watch Restaurant Group Inc. reported a robust second quarter of sales and traffic growth, mainly driven by the company’s continued development and franchise acquisition efforts, as well as a marketing push that began earlier this year.
While First Watch’s in-restaurant traffic was still negative for the second quarter ended June 29, same-store sales grew by 3.5% and the company recorded its busiest day in company history on Mother’s Day 2025, with record-breaking same-store sales and traffic numbers on that day.
“I think Mother’s Day and Father's Day were really just high points of what we experienced the whole quarter, which was sequential growth in all dayparts,” First Watch CEO Chris Tomasso told Nation’s Restaurant News. “From our conservatism around pricing, to increasing our brand awareness through marketing efforts, I think all of these things have set us up to outperform in a challenging environment.”
First Watch began focusing more on marketing efforts and specifically on increasing brand awareness earlier this year. Tomasso said the company is working on conversions (or splitting wallet share) of people who are already daytime casual-dining customers.
“We're using everything from influencers to connected television to organic, digital and social media,” he said. “If you have this cocktail of things that are working, then don’t change it. … This is early innings for us. We're going to continue to learn and iterate as we go on and get better.”
Beyond marketing initiatives, First Watch’s second quarter was largely defined by continued growth. In the past quarter, the company entered its 31st state (Idaho) and opened 17 restaurants across eight states while achieving a 600-store milestone. Out of the 17 new restaurants, 15 are company-owned, which reflects the company’s broader strategy of leaning away from a franchise-heavy portfolio.
“If you look historically at when high-growth restaurant companies stumbled, it’s usually because they grew too fast,” Tomasso said. “As we grow, we work hard to make our culture stronger and not get diluted because of growth and new people coming into the organization. … These [franchise] acquisitions have come in pockets when we've opened a lot of restaurants, then there's a little lull, we acquire [some franchised stores] and then we go back to growth.”
Another avenue of growth for First Watch was third-party delivery, which Tomasso said during Tuesday’s earnings call, helped contribute to improved traffic numbers. He said third-party delivery “increased materially” in the second quarter as part of the company’s efforts to improve that channel, regain some lost traffic, and “generate incremental dollars.”",483f8a3a47b5863850c4451d7a7c5138,trafilatura,2783,0

Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG:
- Earnings per share: 33 cents adjusted vs. 35 cents expected
- Revenue: $998 million vs. $975 million expected
Sales in Pinterest's second quarter grew 17% year over year while net income was $38.76 million, up from $8.9 million a year ago during the same period.
Pinterest said third-quarter sales will come in between $1.033 billion and $1.053 billion, topping analysts' estimates of $1.025 billion.
The social media company said it had 578 million global monthly active users in the second quarter, ahead of the 574.5 million that StreetAccount was projecting. Pinterest said in May that it had 570 million monthly active users in the first quarter.
Pinterest recorded $251 million in second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA, which was higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $233 million.
""I'm proud of our Q2 results — delivering 17% revenue growth and another quarter of record users,"" Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in a statement. ""We're also excited that Gen Z has grown to over half of our user base.""
Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly told analysts in the company's Thursday earnings call that there's still some lingering concern from advertisers related to tariffs ""and broader market uncertainty"" that the company discussed in May.
For instance, Donnelly said unspecified ""Asia-based e-commerce retailers pulled back spend in the U.S. tied to the change in a de minimis exemption,"" referencing a now-closed trade loophole.
Snap shares plummeted more than 15% on Tuesday after the company reported second-quarter earnings in which global average revenue per user missed expectations. Snap's revenue grew only 9% year over year in the second quarter, far lower than peers such as Reddit and Meta, which saw their recent quarterly sales jump 78% and 22%, respectively.
Evan Spiegel, the company's CEO, said in an investor letter that Snap's ""topline growth"" was negatively affected by factors including a botched advertising platform update that has since been fixed.
Amazon reported second-quarter earnings last Thursday and noted that its online ad sales jumped 23% year over year to $15.69 billion. Reddit reported its latest earnings the same day, and said second-quarter sales skyrocketed 78% year over year to $500 million.
Alphabet beat on the top and bottom lines when it reported its second-quarter earnings on July 23, and Meta said on July 30 that its second-quarter revenue hit $47.52 billion.

The company’s revenues at $2.65 billion were up 9% from a year earlier, while its cost of transportation and other expenses rose 7%. That difference helped contribute to an 11% rise in operating income to $650.8 million, up from $575.7 million.
Its year-on-year comparison for the amount of freight moved was higher across the board. Expeditors (NYSE: EXPD) does not disclose actual tonnage, but it does report rates of growth or decline.
Both air freight and ocean freight kilos moved for the quarter were up 7% from the second quarter a year earlier. For air freight, the month-by-month increases were 9% in April, 4% in May and 7% in June. For ocean freight measured in 40-foot equivalent units, the gains were 12%, 7% and 4%, respectively.
Expeditors does not hold a conference call with analysts. But in his comments in the company’s earnings statement, CEO and President Daniel Wall sounded similar to the types of statements made by C.H. Robinson on their earnings call, citing changes in operations as the basis for the strong performance in the quarter.
““Throughout the Expeditors global network, we are seeing the positive impact of our strategic initiatives to maximize operational excellence,” Wall said in the statement.“Our focus on growth and execution puts us in a strong position to quickly adapt to this highly unpredictable environment. We are working with each of our regions and districts to increase efficiency and further optimize customer service to drive organic growth and boost profitability.”
Net earnings per share were up 8% to $1.34 per share. According to SeekingAlpha, that number beat Wall Street consensus by 10 cents per share. The total revenue figure of $2.65 billion was $200 million above consensus.
Stock market reaction is quiet
There was little reaction to the earnings in trading Tuesday. At approximately 3:20 p.m. EDT, the decline in Expeditors stock was about 0.75% to $116.02 on a day when the S&P 500 at that time was down about 0.4%.
Despite Expeditors being at the forefront of international trade and the impacts from tariffs, its stock price now isn’t that much different that it was a month ago (-1.9%), three months ago (+3.9%) and a year ago (-4.2%). The 52-week low was $100.47 back in April; the 52-week high was $131.59 in September.
Even in an earnings report where the numbers looked solidly higher, Wall’s statement said average buy and sell rates, in the air and on the water, “remained highly volatile.” Expeditors processed a “substantial increase” in customs clearances, and they “(required) greater skills as they have become more complex” coming alongside the increase in volumes.",d2cd1dbea90cf1f7f3dcda2fd7b9ca97,trafilatura,2778,0

Joining Trump to talk about the economy was Stephen Moore, a senior visiting fellow in economics at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and the co-author of the 2018 book “ Trumponomics.”
Flipping through a series of charts on an easel, Moore sought to elevate Donald Trump's performance as president and diminish the economic track record of former President Joe Biden. Trump stood next to Moore and interjected with approvals.
The moment in the Oval Office spoke to the president's hopes to reset the narrative of the U.S. economy. While the stock market has been solid, job growth has turned sluggish and inflationary pressures have risen in the wake of Trump imposing a vast set of new tariffs, which are taxes on imports.
Moore said he phoned Trump because he put together some data that shows he was correct to dismiss Erika McEntarfer as the head of the BLS. He noted that’s because reports from the BLS had overestimated the number of jobs created during the last two years of Biden’s term by 1.5 million.
“I think they did it purposely,” said Trump, who has yet to offer statistical evidence backing his theory. Revisions are a standard component of jobs reports and tend to be larger during periods of economic disruption.
The economy has seldom conformed to the whims of any president, often presenting pictures that are far more mixed and nuanced than what can easily be sold to voters. Through the first seven months of this year, employers have added 597,000 jobs, down roughly 44% from the gains during the same period in 2024.
The July jobs report showed that just 73,000 jobs were added last month, while the May and June totals were revised downward by 258,000.
While Biden did face downward revisions on his job numbers, the economy added 2 million jobs in 2024 and 2.6 million in 2023.
The fundamental challenge in Biden's economy was the jolt of inflation as the annual rate of the consumer price index hit a four-decade high in June 2022. That level of inflation left many households feeling as though groceries, gasoline, housing and other essentials were unaffordable, a sentiment that helped to return Trump to the White House in the 2024 election.
There are signs of inflation heating back up under Trump because of his tariffs. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs estimated that the upcoming inflation report for July will show that consumer prices rose 3% over the past 12 months, which would be up from a 2.3% reading in April.",80482b47226389bb5380bcf6fddf1fc0,trafilatura,2772,0

Details on how much domestic manufacturing is required to qualify for the exemption remain unclear.
Japanese semiconductor manufacturer Tokyo Electron fell over 5% before paring losses to trade 2.9% lower as of 11.20 a.m. Japan time (10.20 p.m. ET Wednesday), data from LSEG showed. Other Japanese chip stocks mirrored the fall. Renesas Electronics declined 4% at the open while Advantest slid 3.3%.
However, South Korean chip majors Samsung and SK Hynix appeared to be exempted from the 100% tariffs, the country's top trade envoy Yeo Han-koo was reported as saying on the radio. Memory chipmaker SK Hynix rebounded after falling by more than 3% in initial trade.
Shares of Samsung Electronics bucked the trend, climbing 2.47%. Apple announced Wednesday that it will use chips produced by Samsung Electronics at the latter's Texas facility for its devices, including iPhones.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — the world's biggest chip supplier — also started the trading session in the green, rising by over 4%.
TSMC has announced significant investments in the U.S recently, including an initial $65 billion to build three plants in Arizona, and an additional $100 billion U.S. investment in March.
""We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday, adding that companies like Apple that are building or committed to building in the U.S. won't be charged.
""So in other words, we'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge.""
Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, noted that ""the devil is in the details"" as there is no clear framework yet on how exactly the chip tariffs are going to work.
While Japanese semiconductor process equipment markets may wobble at the start given the headline shock of ""100% tariffs,"" the move could be positive for the industry given the number of Japanese chipmaking equipment that are indispensable for most chipmakers looking to ramp up U.S. production, said Andrew Jackson, head of Japanese equity strategy at ORTUS Advisors.
As of this moment, the big companies are the ""clear winners,"" said Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, citing companies like Apple, Nvidia and TSMC as the ones with the ""most dollars to pledge.""
""These are the big wins that President Trump wants to get,"" Newman said, adding that the smaller companies that do not have the same scale and leverage will have to negotiate.",4882269167830ec94408706b946d152e,trafilatura,2769,0

Sure, it's worth celebrating once you achieve this milestone, but what happens next?
A few high earners discussed this phenomenon, and the conversation started with a high earner who just achieved a seven-figure portfolio. The original poster asked fellow Redditors if they adjusted their investment style or risk upon reaching $1 million. Several high earners jumped into the comments and shared their thoughts.

Don't Do Anything Different
There isn't much of a difference between a $999,999 portfolio and a $1 million portfolio. An extra dollar shouldn't lead to revolutionary changes to your portfolio. Instead, you should keep embracing the approach that turned you into a millionaire.
You don't have to do aggressive options trading strategies or avoid any risky assets and put everything in a high-yield savings account. It's just as important to avoid inflating your lifestyle just because you have $1 million to your name.
However, some Redditors celebrated the moment they reached seven figures. A few husbands took their wives out to nice dinners the moment they became millionaires. It's fine to take some time to celebrate the achievement before going back to work.

Set A Higher Goal
A $1 million portfolio puts you in a better position than most people, but it's still not enough for retirement. This amount is also relatively low if you are young and want to start a large family. Children are the greatest joys of life, but they are also expensive. A $1 million portfolio won't be enough, and that's why high earners set more ambitious goals after reaching the first threshold.
One Redditor said that her husband set the mark at $2 million the moment the couple reached $1 million. A lot of people liked a high earner's suggestion to aim for a $2 million portfolio once you cross the $1 million benchmark.
Once you get to $2 million, you can set the next goal and aim for $3 million. Every million gets easier due to the power of compounding. Going from $1 million to $2 million requires a 100% jump, but you only have to grow your portfolio by 50% to go from $2 million to $3 million.",2e5332b52312a80daf31ea60c59382fc,trafilatura,2766,0

Cherney
(Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday reported disappointing data center revenue, a segment which includes lucrative artificial intelligence chips that investors are betting on for rapid growth.
Shares of the Santa Clara, California-based company slumped roughly 4% in extended trading.
AMD's shares have climbed more than 40% this year, far outpacing a nearly 12% jump in the benchmark chip index, as investors bet on the company's ability to capitalize on the widespread use of AI.
Chips that power complex AI systems for Microsoft, Meta Platforms, generative AI leader OpenAI and other customers are still feverishly sought after by tech companies.
Meta has raised the bottom end of its annual capital expenditure forecast by $2 billion to a range of $66 billion to $72 billion. Microsoft forecast a record $30 billion in capital spending for its current fiscal first quarter to meet soaring AI demand.
However, AMD has not benefited from the AI spending splurge to the same degree as rival Nvidia.
""Investors may be paying closer attention to their data center segment as they roll out new products to compete with NVDA and go after more reliable customers,"" said Carson Group chief market strategist Ryan Detrick.
In Nvidia's fiscal first quarter, its data center segment jumped 73% to $39.11 billion as companies scrambled to adopt the company's flagship Blackwell chips and systems. Nvidia's data center business includes its graphics processors (GPUs) and networking hardware.
By comparison, AMD's second-quarter data center revenue grew 14% to $3.2 billion, roughly in line with analysts' expectations of $3.22 billion, according to LSEG estimates. Beyond its Instinct AI chips, AMD also includes server processors (CPUs) in its data center segment.
AMD's relatively lackluster data center revenue in the second quarter was ""enough to raise an eyebrow,"" Dan Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, an AMD and Nvidia shareholder. ""AMD trades off of data center.""
In the conference call after AMD reported results, CEO Lisa Su said the company's AI chip revenue declined year-over-year because of the U.S. export restrictions on exports to China and the transition to next-generation MI350 series AI chips.
The company began volume production of the MI350 series ahead of schedule in June, Su said, and AMD expects a steep ramp-up in production of the chip in the second half of this year.
CHINA LICENSES UNDER REVIEW
The chip designer's third-quarter revenue of about $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with analysts' average expectation of $8.30 billion, data compiled by LSEG showed. AMD estimated third-quarter adjusted gross margins of roughly 54%, compared with estimates of 54.1%.",06e272fc6d0bc0e6ccca94cd183e087a,trafilatura,2758,0

""This is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States of America also are made in America,"" Trump said at the press conference. “Today’s announcement is one of the largest commitments in what has become among the greatest investment booms in our nation’s history.""
As part of the Apple announcement, the investments will be about bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the United States as part of an initiative called the American Manufacturing Program, but it is not a full commitment to build its popular iPhone device domestically.
“This includes new and expanded work with 10 companies across America. They produce components — semiconductor chips included — that are used in Apple products sold all over the world, and we’re grateful to the President for his support,” Cook said in a statement announcing the investment.
The new manufacturing partners include Corning, Coherent, Applied Materials, Texas Instruments and Broadcom among others.
Apple had previously said it intended to invest $500 billion domestically, a figure it will now increase to $600 billion. Trump in recent months has criticized the tech company and Cook for efforts to shift iPhone production to India to avoid the tariffs his Republican administration had planned for China.
While in Qatar earlier this year, Trump said there was “a little problem” with the Cupertino, California, company and recalled a conversation with Cook in which he said he told the CEO, “I don’t want you building in India.”
India has incurred Trump’s wrath, as the president signed an order Wednesday to put an additional 25% tariff on the world’s most populous country for its use of Russian oil. The new import taxes to be imposed in 21 days could put the combined tariffs on Indian goods at 50%.
Apple’s new pledge comes just a few weeks after it forged a $500 million deal with MP Materials, which runs the only rare earths producer in the country. That agreement will enable MP Materials to expand a factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce magnets that make iPhones vibrate.
Speaking on a recent investors call, Cook emphasized that “there’s a load of different things done in the United States.” As examples, he cited some of the iPhone components made in the U.S. such as the device’s glass display and module for identifying people’s faces and then indicated the company was gearing to expand its productions of other components in its home country.",6889da10759569f4caf4e7a0710d3c65,trafilatura,2752,0

Palantir Technologies (PLTR) shares jumped Tuesday after the data analytics software provider raised its full-year outlook amid booming demand for its AI platform.
The company posted quarterly revenue that surpassed $1 billion for the first time, topping Wall Street estimates, and now expects full-year revenue of between $4.14 billion and $4.15 billion, up from $3.89 to $3.9 billion previously. CEO Alex Karp said Palantir's commercial business nearly doubled from a year earlier, while its U.S. business grew 68%, which he attributed to ""the astonishing impact of AI leverage.""
Following the company’s blowout results, investment banks Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank raised their price targets on Palantir shares. The stock rose nearly 8% to $173 on Tuesday and has gained about 600% over the past year. The stock has been boosted by the company’s increasing business with the federal government and surging enterprise demand for its AI-powered tools.
Below, we break down the technicals on Palantir’s chart and identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching.
Rising Wedge Breakout
Palantir shares broke out above the top trendline of a rising wedge in Tuesday’s trading session. While this chart pattern often signals a potential trend reversal, a bullish breakout indicates strong price momentum
Moreover, the relative strength index confirms bullish price action, though it also flashes overbought conditions, increasing the likelihood of near-term profit taking.
Let’s apply technical analysis to Palantir’s chart to project an upside target if the shares continue their move into price discovery and also identify support levels worth monitoring during possible retracements in the stock.
Measured Move Upside Price Target
Investors can project an upside target in Palantir shares by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle.
When applying the analysis, we calculate the percentage change of the rising wedge near its widest point and add it to the pattern’s top trendline value. For example, we apply a 22% increase to $165, which projects a target of $201.30.",f0150b38176b84fed3404624cafd9642,trafilatura,2725,0

Muted demand in the US – which Molson Coors had expected to see improve in the second quarter – was a factor in the company’s changes to forecasts.
In the three months to the end of June, Molson Coors’ volumes dropped 6.6% amid lower brand volumes in the US and the end of a contract brewing deal.
The decline was better than Wall Street had forecast but, speaking to analysts after the results were published, Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley – who said in May he expected the US beer industry to pick up – conceded trading conditions had not improved.
“The industry did not get better as we were expecting it to,” he said. “We had expected it to navigate back to where it’s been for the last few years of around down 3% and it didn’t.
“Certainly, consumer confidence and the macro environment, whilst we continue to believe very strongly that it is cyclical, we’re not seeing any signs of that changing in the balance of the year, and it certainly didn’t in the second quarter.”
Molson Coors’ previous expectation that the US beer industry would return to the recent run-rate of a 3% decline had “faced with considerable scepticism last quarter – and for good reason”, Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman said in a note to clients today.
She added: “Molson Coors’ updated outlook strikes us as now rooted in a more reasonable view on the US beer industry’s near-term trajectory.”
Hattersley told analysts on yesterday’s post-results call that “the current industry decline is cyclical”, adding “Consumer confidence will turn I don’t know when but it will turn.”
Nevertheless, the Molson Coors CEO was pushed on whether the pressure on the US beer industry was cyclical given soft volumes in the sector for the past few years.
Hattersley said: “We continue to believe that over time, [consumer confidence] will change. I mean, it could be sooner rather than later, or it could be in the same time period next year.
The items that have been impacting the overall alcohol category – I’ve often heard GLP-1s talked about - we don’t have a lot of data that suggests that that’s having any meaningful impact on either the alcohol category or our category at this point.
“The other item that gets talked about is D9 [Delta 9]. The impact of D9 does vary by market. In some markets, it’s not sold. In others, it carries strong restrictions.
That’s certainly an area that we continue to monitor the impact of that. I think consumer confidence has had a disproportionate impact, as I said, across some consumers differently to others. And, again, we believe that that is cyclical.”",5757edb020c55c7b6d605c8b6026d799,trafilatura,2722,0

AMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here’s Why It’s a Buying Opportunity
The upbeat language comes as Ford’s top executives seek to reassure investors. Despite strong sales and an earnings beat, the company still faces headwinds from recalls, tariffs, and heavy R&D expenses.
For Ford stock fans, Aug. 11 is shaping up to be more than just a date. It is a potential turning point in the company’s EV future.
About Ford Stock
Ford is a global automobile manufacturer renowned for its extensive range of vehicles, including Ford trucks, sport utility vehicles, commercial vans, and luxury Lincoln models. The company maintains a strong presence in both domestic and international markets, with a deep legacy in innovation and mass manufacturing.
Valued at $44.6 billion by market cap, Ford’s stock has delivered an impressive 13% year-to-date gain, outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index ($SPX) 8.1% rise over the same period.
From a valuation standpoint, Ford appears attractively priced. It trades at a trailing price-earnings ratio of just under 8x, well below the sector median of 16x, signaling that shares may be undervalued relative to peers. Moreover, the company’s 5.4% dividend yield, double the sector average, adds an appealing income component for investors seeking value in the auto space.
Mark Your Calendar for August 11
A key focus for investors is Ford’s plan to revive its electric‑vehicle business, the very topic of the Aug. 11 event. Farley and the team have branded this upcoming announcement as a transformative “Model-T moment.” He explained that Ford will be in Kentucky to unveil “our plans to design and build a breakthrough electric vehicle and a platform in the U.S.” In other words, Ford is promising a new low-cost EV platform that can spawn multiple vehicles.
Ford is set to unveil plans for a new line of affordable EVs, developed by a secret team led by ex-Tesla (TSLA) talent. Aimed at the sub-$30,000 market, the initiative includes a rumored mid-size pickup and multiple vehicle styles to reverse EV losses and boost long-term profitability. This event could shape Ford’s stock in either direction.",2b2fc55c40d371628037dbcbdd9ff25a,trafilatura,2719,0

Cathie Wood just made a bold move again.
As AI continues to sweep the investing narrative, she’s doubled down on a stock that’s essentially at the center of it all.
Though it’s far from being a new name for her, the size and timing of her bet say something different.
💵💰Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter💰💵
The stock market’s near all-time highs, and even with all the overvaluation chatter, Wood’s conviction stands out.
When Cathie Wood shells out so much cash at an AI heavyweight, she’s not just stock picking, but making a clear statement. Real infrastructure, real profits, and zero hesitation.
Why AI is more than a trend for Cathie Wood
For Cathie Wood, AI isn’t just a passing fad, but also a key pillar of ARK’s investment strategy. AI is among the firm’s five “innovation platforms,” and Wood still feels we’re in the early innings of what she calls “the AI movement.”
In ARK’s Big Ideas 2025 report, she mapped out how smarter AI models and quicker chips could transform everything from diagnostics to robotaxis.
The thesis is that AI isn’t a vertical, but a foundational force that’s set to revamp virtually every industry, from automated factories to financial modeling.

However, instead of scattering bets, Wood looks to concentrate her capital in high-conviction bets she feels might double over a five-year window.
Be it AI, robotics, DNA sequencing, or blockchain, ARK aims to back the bellwethers leading the step changes. Hence, her strategy is bold and volatile by design.
Cathie loads up on Nvidia while selling stake in flying car stock Joby
Cathie Wood’s ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF just made a major move, speaking volumes about where she sees the near-term upside in AI.
On August 4, the fund scooped up an additional $1.6 million worth of Nvidia (NVDA) stock. The buying spree didn’t stop there, with ARKQ (ARK Invest’s autonomous tech fund) also adding a hefty $2.5 million of Nvidia stock the same day.

These bets underscore Wood’s conviction in Nvidia as perhaps the most compelling play in AI infrastructure.
Also in May, Wood dropped a head-turning $12.6 million into Nvidia across multiple ETFs, hailing it as the “backbone of modern AI infrastructure.”
However, it wasn’t the only AI chip stock she’s been loading up on.
In the past few weeks, ARK added over $11 million of AMD stock, betting big on its MI300X GPUs and their growing market share in training and inference markets.",345d458b61b1975ee506a543ef26d217,trafilatura,2711,0

A recent episode of “The Ramsey Show” featured a caller named Frank from Charleston, South Carolina, who shared a financial mistake that quickly spiraled out of control.
$62,000 Car Loan
Frank said he co-signed on a $62,000 loan for a brand-new Chrysler 300 after his brother-in-law came to him with $20,000 for a down payment and asked for help. “He’s just a big dumb animal, and I love him dearly,” Frank explained. “He came to me and said, ‘Hey, I got 20 grand... but I need help.'” Frank agreed to co-sign despite knowing better. “All I can hear in the background when I got done doing this is Dave saying... ‘One who signs debt for another is stupid.'”

Now Frank is on the hook for a car payment of $1,100 a month. And things got worse fast: “He’s going away for a very long time on a vacation. An unwanted vacation,” Frank said, confirming that his brother-in-law is headed to prison.
To make matters worse, the car is already about $12,000 underwater. Frank said he could sell it for around $50,000 in a private party sale, but the current loan buyout is $62,000. On top of that, the car is located in Arizona, while Frank lives in South Carolina.
He admitted he’s $5,200 behind on payments, and repossession is now a real risk. Co-host George Kamel warned him that it’s already too late: “You already did it, my friend... they’re going to sell it at auction for like 15 grand and you’re still going to owe the difference.”

Despite all this, Frank still doesn't have enough cash on hand to cover the gap after selling the car. He said he has around $10,000 to $12,000 in liquid savings and a few upcoming real estate closings that might help. He’s also scheduled a meeting with his credit union to try to get a personal loan.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.
The White House is preparing an executive order to impose penalties on banks allegedly discriminating against conservatives and cryptocurrency firms, according to a report on Monday.
Order Targets ‘Discriminatory’ Policies
The executive order could impose fines on financial institutions that sever ties with customers for political reasons, The Wall Street Journal reported. The draft order directs regulators to investigate whether any banks have violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust laws or consumer financial protection laws.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
The order might be signed as early as this week, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter, but there could be delays or alterations to the administration’s plans.
The White House didn’t immediately return Benzinga’s request for comment.
Tussle Between Crypto Industry And Regulators To End?
The tension between banks and the cryptocurrency industry escalated during the Biden administration, with cryptocurrency behemoth Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN) accusing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of instructing banks to halt or refrain from offering cryptocurrency-banking services. The company sued the regulator last year for failing to comply with Freedom of Information Act requests.
An FDIC spokesperson told Benzinga earlier that Coinbase executives misinterpreted their guidance to banks.

However, things appear to have taken a significant turn under President Donald Trump. The SEC repealed a cryptocurrency accounting directive earlier this year that prevented banking institutions from providing custodial services for digital assets.
Notably, both the Senate and the House voted unanimously to overturn the directive last year. However, the resolution was vetoed by the White House under former President Joe Biden.
The SEC launched a new initiative called ""Project Crypto"" last week, aimed at revamping securities regulations to accommodate blockchain-based financial systems.

Finding stocks that can double in a reasonable time frame is a smart investing strategy. I'm not talking about finding stocks that can double in under a year, as there is more luck than anything in that approach. Instead, I'm looking for stocks that can double in under five years.
The rule of thumb is that the market doubles about once every seven years, so if a stock can double in five, it's a market outperformer. I think there are a handful of stocks that meet this threshold, and each looks like an excellent buy now.
Alphabet
Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and the Android operating system. However, the most important part of its business by far is Google Search. This division brings in over half of Alphabet's total revenue and has allowed Alphabet to fund various investments.
But Google Search is under attack. Investors are worried that Google Search will become a victim of generative AI and lose significant market share. While there is some anecdotal evidence that users are defecting from Google to generative AI, the vast majority of the population still uses Google Search.
However, investors' fear of Google Search losing market share has caused the stock to fall to a cheap valuation. At less than 20 times forward earnings, Alphabet's stock is cheaper than the S&P 500, which trades for 24 times forward earnings.
Alphabet's business is still growing, with Google Search's revenue rising 12% year over year in Q2 and companywide diluted earnings per share increasing 22%. Combined with Alphabet's cheap stock price, this makes the stock an easy candidate to double in under five years.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is a massive beneficiary of the AI arms race. TSMC is a chip foundry, which means it fabricates chips for companies that are unable to do so themselves. Considering there's only a handful of chip foundries globally, this makes TSMC a top competitor in an industry where there are few other options.
This cements TSMC at the top of a very important industry, making it a smart investment. It also has massive growth potential, as management projects revenue will increase at a nearly 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years. A 20% CAGR over a five-year period results in a revenue gain of almost 150%, so this far exceeds the threshold needed to double in under five years.",e55993167b259a981b7e016f55e239f3,trafilatura,2698,0

Voyager Technologies missed badly on earnings last night.
-
Losses were more than twice what Wall Street had expected.
-
Voyager's defense business is doing its best to offset losses from the space program, but there are a lot of losses to offset.
It's been a little over a month since I first warned investors about the danger of investing in a new space stock, space station builder Voyager Technologies (NYSE: VOYG). After a smashingly successful IPO, Voyager's stock price flipped head over tail and began falling.
And why? Simply put, Voyager has years of costs ahead of it before it gets a space station in orbit, and whether it ever becomes profitable after that ""is anyone's guess,"" as I warned in June. One thing's certain, though:
Voyager definitely wasn't profitable in Q2. And now its stock is down another 17.3% (through 1:15 p.m. ET today).
Voyager Technologies Q2 earnings
Reporting Q2 results last night, Voyager fessed up to a $0.60-per-share loss -- twice what Wall Street feared -- despite generating sales of $45.7 million, ahead of the forecast.
Sales came (perhaps obviously) not from the space stations that Voyager hasn't built yet but rather from the company's defense business, which builds missiles for the military, and where sales grew 85%. Losses were in part due to ""non-recurring costs associated with the Company's IPO,"" which is at least somewhat reassuring.
Is Voyager stock a sell?
Less reassuring is company guidance. Management noted that full-year sales will range from $165 million to $170 million in 2025, which is ahead of analyst forecasts. However, on earnings, management noted only that ""adjusted EBITDA"" will show a loss, and it said not a word about its likely losses as calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), or about free cash flow, either.
Voyager did note that it is ""debt-free"" and has ""total liquidity of $669 million,"" suggesting the company should be able to burn cash for some time before it runs out. The bad news:
It will probably have to.

Weakness in Tuesday's global economic news was bearish for energy demand and crude prices. The US Jul ISM services index unexpectedly fell -0.7 to 50.1, weaker than expectations of an increase to 51.5. Also, the Eurozone Jul S&P composite PMI was revised downward by -0.1 to 50.9 from the previously reported 51.0.
Crude prices were also pressured Tuesday after Bloomberg reported that Russia is weighing options for a concession to President Trump, including an air truce with Ukraine to avoid secondary sanctions on its energy exports. US envoy Witkoff will visit Russia this week ahead of this Friday's deadline imposed by President Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine or risk additional sanctions on its energy exports.
Crude prices have support after President Trump said last Monday that he would impose new tariffs on countries buying Russian energy unless Russia reaches a ceasefire with Ukraine by this Friday. JPMorgan Chase warned that if enforced, oil markets would be unable to ignore the impact of triple-digit tariffs on Russian oil, given the significant scale of Russian exports and limited OPEC spare capacity, which could potentially lead to a supply shock.

OPEC+ has 1.66 million bpd of supplies that are currently due to remain offline until late 2026. The International Energy Agency said inventories have been accumulating at a rate of 1 million bpd and that the global crude oil market faces a surplus by Q4-2025 equivalent to 1.5% of global crude consumption.

By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) -Amgen on Tuesday posted quarterly financial results that beat Wall Street expectations as a 9% increase in product sales offset higher operating expenses due in part to development of experimental weight-loss drug MariTide.
The California-based biotech company's second-quarter revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $9.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $6.02.
Analysts had expected an adjusted profit of $5.29 on revenue of $8.94 billion, according to LSEG data.
The ""strong quarter for Amgen starts to reshape the narrative for the (company) as we look to the back half of the year,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a research note.
Shares of Amgen, which closed at $300.08, were down about half a percentage point at $298.50 in extended trading.
Sales of cholesterol-lowering medication Repatha rose 31% to $696 million. Sales of bone drug Prolia fell 4% to $1.1 billion and the company said it expects further erosion this year due to new competition from biosimilars.
Adjusted operating expenses rose 8% from a year earlier, while research and development costs rose 18%.
The company said it expects to have data in the fourth quarter from two key mid-stage MariTide studies. One is testing the drug in obese or overweight adults with or without type 2 diabetes, while the second is looking at MariTide as a treatment for type 2 diabetes.
MariTide is an antibody linked to a pair of peptides that activate receptors for the appetite- and blood sugar-reducing hormone GLP-1 while simultaneously blocking a second gut hormone called GIP.
Several companies are working to develop weight-loss drugs, encouraged by booming demand for current medicines and estimates that sales of obesity treatments could hit $150 billion in the coming years.
For the full year, Amgen slightly raised its financial outlook to adjusted earnings per share of $20.20 to $21.30 on revenue of $35 billion to $36 billion. It had previously forecast earnings of $20.00 to $21.20 per share on revenue of $34.3 billion to $35.7 billion.
Analysts, on average, have estimated 2025 earnings of $20.91 per share on revenue of $35.4 billion.
The company said its 2025 outlook includes the impact of implemented tariffs, but does not account for any future levies, including potential sector-specific tariffs, or pricing actions that could be implemented in the future.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Thursday he expects the country to collect $50 billion a month in tariff revenues or more - up from $30 billion last month - as higher levies on imports from dozens of countries kick in.
""And then you're going to get the semiconductors, you're going to get pharmaceuticals, you're going to get all sorts of additional tariff money coming in,"" Lutnick said in an interview with Fox Business Network.
U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs on imports from dozens of countries took effect on Thursday, raising the average U.S. import duty to its highest in a century, with countries facing tariffs of 10% to 50%.
Trump on Wednesday also announced plans to levy a tariff of about 100% on imported semiconductor chips unless manufacturers commit to produce in America, as well as a small tariff on pharmaceutical imports that would rise to 250% over time.
Details of those sectoral tariffs are expected in coming weeks after the Commerce Department completes investigations into the impact of those imports on U.S. national security.
Lutnick told Fox Business Network that companies could win exemptions from the expected semiconductor tariff if they filed plans to build plants in the United States, and those plans were overseen by an auditor.
""His objective is to get semiconductor manufacturing done here,"" he said, predicting that the initiative would result in some $1 trillion in investment to bolster domestic manufacturing.
Other exemptions have already been agreed, including with the European Union, which said its agreement to accept a 15% tariff on most EU exports includes chips, and with Japan, which has said the United States agreed not to give it a worse rate than other countries.
The push to boost domestic chip manufacturing is not new.
Congress created a $52.7 billion semiconductor manufacturing and research subsidy program in 2022 under former President Joe Biden, and all five leading-edge semiconductor firms agreed last year to locate chip factories in the U.S.
Last year the department said the U.S. produced about 12% of semiconductor chips globally, down from 40% in 1990.
Lutnick, asked about separate talks underway with China on extending a tariff truce that is due to end on August 12, said he felt an agreement was possible.

Yet, the market responded negatively, sending ABNB stock down more than 7% in early trading today. The pullback was driven by an expected slowdown in the company’s growth in the second half of 2025.
Airbnb Delivers Strong Q2 Performance
Airbnb, the popular platform for booking homestays, experiences, and services, reported $3.1 billion in revenue, a 13% increase from the same time last year. The company also boosted its profitability, earning $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA with a 34% margin, up from 32.5% a year ago. Net income rose to $642 million, or $1.03 per share, beating analyst expectations. Airbnb saw strong double-digit growth in net income during the second quarter, which helped boost its cash flow. ABNB reported $1 billion in free cash flow for Q2.

From the regional standpoint, Latin America led the charge with high-teens growth. It was followed by Asia Pacific in the mid-teens. At the same time, ABNB’s operations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) marked mid-single digit growth, while North America lagged with low-single-digit growth. Overall, Airbnb recorded 134 million nights and experiences booked during the quarter, up 7% compared to the same period last year.
What continues to work in Airbnb’s favor is its focus on enhancing its core business. Operational improvements across areas like checkout, guest messaging, and payment flexibility supported revenue growth. The company is also leaning into AI to improve customer service, expanding its AI-powered agent to cover all U.S. users, leading to a 15% reduction in the need for human support.
Airbnb’s international expansion strategy is gaining traction. Bookings in its newer markets have consistently grown at about double the pace of its core regions for six consecutive quarters. This reflects its efforts to tailor offerings to local markets, boost brand visibility, and attract more traffic.
The company is also laying the groundwork for longer-term growth through new services. In May, Airbnb expanded its platform beyond lodging with the launch of services and experiences. Although still early, Airbnb reported positive feedback and strong interest from hosts. Notably, this move can help better monetize the traffic it receives on its platform.",7500518940010e6736410b3e4231fa25,trafilatura,2683,0

In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on LB. LandBridge Company LLC's share was trading at $57.93 as of August 4th. LB’s trailing and forward P/E were 30.95 and 21.60, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
A drilling rig in the middle of an industrial mining site, surrounded by rugged terrain.
Landbridge (LB), created by private equity firm Five Point Energy as a complement to Waterbridge, controls surface rights to 277,000 acres in the Permian Basin. Initially overlooked, the company has begun attracting attention due to its potential to capitalize on critical infrastructure trends. While it lacks significant mineral rights, Landbridge monetizes its land through surface use fees for drilling sites, roads, pipeline, and electric transmission easements, along with sand, water, and some oil and gas royalties. Last quarter, surface royalties generated $26.2 million, up 181% year-over-year, driving trailing twelve-month revenue to $134 million. Despite its $4.23 billion market cap and a lofty 31x price-to-sales ratio, the company operates as a royalty model with 88–90% EBITDA margins and revenue growth of 131% over the last year.
The strategic long-term thesis centers on future demand from data centers driven by AI and energy needs. Limited grid capacity will push hyperscale developers to build in regions with abundant natural gas—making Landbridge’s acreage attractive for hosting data centers that require on-site power. In the near term, CEO-led efforts to secure new tenants and deploy cash flow toward additional land acquisitions underpin growth. While management has not given explicit targets, sustained expansion could compress valuation multiples significantly. At even 40% annual growth, Landbridge’s price-to-EBITDA could normalize near 10x by 2029.
With earnings due August 7 and hints of positive updates, the stock—trading at $55 after oscillating between $50 and $85—presents optionality for dividend growth investors, long-term compounders, or tactical traders anticipating a near-term catalyst.
Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on LandBridge Company LLC (LB) by FJ Research in May 2025, which highlighted its positioning at the intersection of energy security and AI infrastructure with strong insider alignment. The company’s stock price has depreciated approximately 16% since our coverage due to valuation compression despite growth. The thesis still stands as long-term tailwinds persist.

Four of the vehicles — a compact SUV/car/ pickup, and a mid-size pickup — are targeted at Central and South American markets and will support both internal combustion and hybrid powertrains.
At full production scale, the companies expect to roll out at least 800,000 vehicles annually.
The partnership will help GM compete against rising Chinese players in the Latin American market, where the Detroit automaker has had a strong presence for decades.
The two global automakers will also co-develop an electric commercial van for the North American market. Reuters in March reported that the two companies were nearing a deal to share two commercial electric vans.
Global automakers face stiff competition from Chinese EV makers and a trade war impacting imports of crucial parts, including rare earth materials, which has pushed production costs higher.
This is the first major partnership for vehicle development for Hyundai Motor.
The deal would give GM access to hybrid technology it lacks, while enabling Hyundai to enter into new segments such as vans in North America and mid-sized pickups, Kim Sung-rae, an analyst at Hanwha Investment & Securities, said.
The two companies did not say where the models will be produced. Hyundai, which has a factory in Alabama, said it will expand the production capacity of its new factory in Georgia. The company also has a factory in Brazil.
GM's budding partnership with Hyundai follows an unwinding of several projects the Detroit automaker had pursued with Honda over the past decade. Notably, GM and Honda in 2023 scrapped a $5 billion plan to jointly develop affordable electric vehicles.
Chinese automakers have released several high-tech, low-cost models, putting pressure on legacy automakers such as GM to slash expenses and streamline manufacturing processes. To compete with these rivals, many automakers have explored partnerships as a way to share development costs, especially for battery-powered models.
Cutting costs is even more pressing as tariffs have added billions of dollars in expenses for automakers around the globe. The Hyundai-GM announcement comes after the United States and South Korea last week reached a trade agreement to charge a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea, including autos.
This is among several deals between a South Korean company and a U.S. firm announced in recent weeks, following Samsung Electronics' 005930.KS chip deal with Tesla TSLA.O and Apple AAPL.O, and LG Energy Solution's 373220.KS battery deal with Tesla.",bbd3a1c927773cc151b169e1f7974f9f,trafilatura,2680,0

This move marks a significant step in the brand's expansion strategy across the Sunbelt region.
The new franchisees, Akash Chaudhari, Sanjay Chaudhari, and Brijesh Patel, bring a considerable experience to the table, having owned and managed multiple businesses in hospitality, foodservice, and retail sectors.
Their current operations include Super 8 motels, liquor stores, and Subway franchises across Tennessee, Missouri, and Wyoming.
The trio conducted market research over several months, including site visits to existing Frutta Bowls locations, interviews with third-party delivery personnel, and surveys among employees at local hospitals and businesses.
Their findings have informed the decision to open the first Frutta Bowls outlet in either Germantown or Cordova, with subsequent stores planned for Memphis and northern Mississippi communities such as Olive Branch and Southaven.
Additionally, the partners are exploring co-branding opportunities with Saladworks, another brand under the WOWorks umbrella.
WOWorks CEO Kelly Roddy said: ""This agreement is an exciting milestone for Frutta Bowls and our rapid expansion for this brand right now.
""Frutta Bowls is seeing incredible momentum, and this team's thorough research and community-driven mindset make them an ideal fit to lead our expansion in the Mid-South.""
The Frutta Bowls menu features a variety of superfoods, including acai, pitaya, kale, and an array of grains, fruits, vegetables, and nuts. These customisable options aim to bolster immunity and provide wholesome meals and snacks.
Akash Chaudhari said: ""When the hotel industry slowed during Covid, we realised the need to diversify.
""After months of research, Frutta Bowls stood out as the perfect match for the Memphis market. For consumers, it's healthy and quick. And from a business standpoint, we like that the brand has low overhead, and this concept is fresh and exciting to the market.""

CRGY’s trailing and forward P/E were 20.31 and 4.82, respectively according to Yahoo Finance.
View of an oil & gas exploratory platform, surrounded by a vast expanse of sea & sky.
Crescent Energy Company (CRGY), an acquisition-driven oil and gas exploration and production firm managed by KKR, trades at just 3.4x EBITDA and offers a compelling 28% free cash flow yield alongside a 5% dividend yield. Formed in 2021 through the merger of KKR-backed Independence Energy and Contango Oil & Gas, CRGY employs an “acquire-and-exploit” strategy focused on disciplined capital allocation and cash-on-cash returns. It targets a 2x multiple of invested capital with quick payback periods, while maintaining a reinvestment rate below 50%, ensuring operations are fully funded from cash flow. CRGY has consistently paid dividends for 13 years and currently distributes $0.12 per share quarterly.
The company has executed eight major acquisitions since 2021, most notably merging with SilverBow Resources in 2024 and acquiring Ridgemar LLC in early 2025, solidifying its position as the third-largest oil and gas producer in the Eagle Ford. Management by KKR provides scale, financial strength, and alignment, with CEO David Rockecharlie also leading KKR’s Energy Real Assets platform. John Goff, a renowned value investor and CRGY board chairman with a 4% stake, adds further credibility and strategic oversight.
Recent moves to simplify the capital structure by eliminating the UP-C framework and collapsing share classes enhance transparency and liquidity. CRGY boasts a 15-year drilling inventory and significant natural gas exposure, with 60% of 2025 production hedged at favorable prices. With strong cash generation, a history of disciplined growth, and catalysts including continued M&A execution, CRGY offers an attractive risk/reward profile supported by best-in-class sponsors and proven operators.

Axcelis posted better-than-feared results for the second quarter.
-
The semiconductor equipment provider is going through a cyclical downturn in power and general semiconductors.
-
Yet it appears a bottom is in, and investors are now looking to a recovery that has a wide range of possibilities.
Shares of small-cap semiconductor equipment supplier Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS) rallied big on Tuesday, up 9.6% as of 3:57 p.m. ET.
Axcelis reported earnings this morning, beating expectations and delivering solid guidance, with positive commentary on forward-looking bookings.
While the company is still posting large year-over-year declines, the stock had gotten incredibly cheap, and investors may be sniffing out a solid cyclical bottom.
Ion implant continues to be important
Axcelis makes ion implant machines, which infuse silicon wafers with other ions that change the properties of chips, such as enhancing thermal resistance and conductivity in silicon carbide (SiC) power chips. Power chips made up 55% of system revenue last quarter, with 43% going to ""general semiconductors,"" 3% going to memory applications, and 0% to advanced node sales.
That being said, the company said it had booked a follow-on order from an advanced logic company, showing that ion implant may soon be used in a wider variety of applications.
In the quarter, Axcelis saw revenue decline 24.2% to $194.5 million, with adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings per share down 35% to $1.13. Despite the big year-over-year declines, those numbers were actually much better than what analysts expected. Management also guided for sequential growth in revenue to $200 million for the third quarter, albeit with a slight margin decline due to mix.
Axcelis' main end markets are still working through a cyclical downturn, especially electric vehicles (EV), which are heavy users of silicon carbide. However, things appear to be bottoming out, and if the past several quarters indicate a bottom, Axcelis still looks cheap. After today's jump, shares trade around a high-teens earnings multiple on 2025 expectations. However, the stock is cheaper than it appears, since Axcelis has $581 million worth of cash on the balance sheet and no debt, good for over 20% of its $2.5 billion market cap.
The coming recovery has a wide range
While it's possible that a recovery in EVs and ion implant demand may remain muted, especially given tariffs and the rollback of U.S. EV subsidies, it may also be stronger than some think. Silicon carbide-based power chips are coming down in price and are finding their way into more and more applications, such as industrial processes and AI data centers.",f759000f903fe994381c363edd5cff9b,trafilatura,2667,0

It follows a decline the week before of 0.7 cts/g.
Relative calm in the benchmark price comes as a new round of volatility–this one pointing down–is rearing its head in the market for ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) on the CME commodity exchange.
In the four trading days leading up to the ULSD settlement Monday, the price of ULSD fell to $2.3176/g, down almost 15 cts/g from the July 29 settle of $2.4638/g. On July 21, ULSD settled at more than $2.50/g.
But market news has been largely bearish since then. Oil, including crude and diesel, both fell hard Friday in sympathy with the large asset selloff that accompanied the news of the weakest monthly employment report in several months. Prices bounced back only slightly Monday with the rise in equity markets, and resumed their decline Tuesday. At approximately 11:05 a.m. EDT, ULSD was down just over 6 cts/g, a drop of 2.6%.
Over the weekend, eight members of the OPEC+ group announced an increase in their output of 547,000 barrels/day. That increase would bring the group, which consists of OPEC and several non-OPEC oil exporters nominally led by Russia, close to fully reversing the more than 2-million b/d in output cuts the group has had in effect since spring 2023.
Diamondback CEO warns of imbalance
The bearish view of the market was laid out Monday in a letter from Kaes Van’t Hof, CEO of Diamondback Energy, one of the largest operators in Texas’ Permian Basin.
In the letter to investors, Van’t Hof said the market could have been worse for an upstream company like Diamondback. “The likelihood of a massive oil supply glut combined with an oil demand shock seems to have dissipated (on the demand side),” he wrote.
But there is no basis for a recovery, he added. “The projected increase in global oil supply in the second half of this year is hard to ignore,” Van’t Hof wrote. “Although projections are often incorrect in this sector, particularly when consensus is uniformly bullish or bearish (in this case bearish), we still believe we are approaching a yellow light to pull from last quarter’s ‘stop light’ analogy.”
Diesel coming back to earth against crude
One small piece of good news for diesel consumers is that the raging strength of diesel relative to crude has slowed.
A straight comparison of the front-month price of ULSD to the price of Brent crude, the world’s benchmark, peaked July 21 at more than 86 cts/g. But that spread dropped to almost 64 cts/g by Friday. The average for the year is about 61 cts/g.",e5f13798853f1b47b7681db5bfe36fd3,trafilatura,2665,0

Why Nvidia and other chip stocks are shrugging off Trump’s latest tariff threat
The reason I wouldn’t bet on Nvidia is that the largest-cap companies tend to underperform the market after climbing to the top of the market-cap rankings. A gutsy contrarian bet therefore is that a company lower in those rankings will be the first whose market cap exceeds $5 trillion. I list eight contenders below.
To show that the largest-cap companies are poor bets, I constructed a hypothetical portfolio that each year invested in the stock of the largest-cap company as of the end of the previous year. From 1980 until earlier this week, this portfolio lagged the S&P 500 SPX by four percentage points annualized.
Though many investors are surprised by this result, they shouldn’t be. It’s the result of the creative destruction that is the essence of a capitalist economy. The companies leading the economy in one era inevitably are replaced by the next era’s leaders. For example, IBM IBM, the largest U.S. company for much of the 1980s, was overtaken by General Electric GE in the 1990s, which in turn was overtaken by Exxon Mobil XOM in the aughts. Beginning about 10 years ago, Apple AAPL was at the top of the market-cap rankings, but has since stumbled.
Now it’s Nvidia turn. But I doubt anyone five years ago would have bet that the company would attain this status. At that time its market cap was below $300 billion. Its stunning 76% five-year annualized rate propelled its market cap to $4 trillion.
As a thought experiment, I applied that same five-year growth rate to each of the technology companies currently in the S&P 500. On that assumption, there are eight besides Nvidia that could hit the $5 trillion threshold within the next five years.
They are listed below, in alphabetical order. It would be no more surprising for any of them to eclipse the $5 trillion threshold than it was for Nvidia to have performed as well as it has over the past five years.
Many of you will object, arguing that Nvidia is different — the AI revolution is unique and will change everything. But in one form or another, we’ve heard this story before. The top of the internet bubble is an obvious example.",6f1e9363ba789737920b23a1585f456a,trafilatura,2665,0

Housing market reality check: Homeowners finally accept 3% mortgage rates aren’t coming back
On Wednesday, Visa unveils its new Cybersecurity Advisory Practice, providing customers and businesses with access to advanced tools designed to protect against the growing threat of cybercrime.
Over the past year, the digital payments giant says it has invested billions in cybersecurity infrastructure and enhanced its global payments network by deploying generative AI to detect and block fraud. With its latest initiative, Visa plans to share those capabilities directly with clients to address mounting concerns around information security in the AI era. The new practice will leverage Visa’s internal fraud-fighting insights and adapt them to meet the specific needs of each business.
Utilizing AI and drawing from a team of 2,000 consultants, data scientists, and product experts, Visa aims to help clients defend against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.
Visa’s Cybersecurity Advisory Practice emerged from what Carl Rutstein, the company’s global head of advisory services, describes as a clear need from clients for “deeper, more proactive support” amid a rapidly evolving threat landscape. As online commerce grows, so does cybercrime. “There has been a nearly 300% increase in internet fraud just over the last few years,” he tells Fast Company, prompting businesses to seek new ways to “proactively identify, evaluate, and obviously mitigate emerging cyber threats.”
According to cybersecurity and compliance firm VikingCloud, cybercrime could cost businesses as much as $10.5 trillion by year’s end, and up to $15.63 trillion by 2029.
The FBI reported that in 2024 the top three internet crimes were phishing/spoofing, extortion, and personal data breaches. Cybercriminals are increasingly turning to AI, using it to crack passwords, manipulate or poison data, and create deepfakes.
Rutstein says fraud has escalated as bad actors adopt AI to exploit the financial system. Visa, he notes, blocked $14 billion in presumed fraud within the U.S. in 2024—a 30% increase over 2023.
The Cybersecurity Advisory Practice is intended to build on Visa’s current “payment ecosystem,” offering services such as enumeration defense, employee training, and cybersecurity maturity assessments.",06a4574d6f05d0e806a4dc0cb3e4bc07,trafilatura,2658,0

President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that will pave the way for alternative assets like cryptocurrencies and private equity to be included in the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
Ahead of the news, major cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks rallied on Thursday.
On Friday, bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose around 1% to trade near $117,000, while ether (ETH-USD) and XRP (XRP-USD) were trading up more than 5% and more than 11%, respectively.
Shares of Coinbase (COIN), the biggest publicly traded crypto exchange, and Robinhood (HOOD), rose 0.6% in premarket trading on Friday. Strategy (MSTR) shares were flat before the bell.
President Trump's executive order, signed Thursday, directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate the use of alternative assets in 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts.
The order marks a major shift in retirement investments, opening up the traditionally staid industry to more speculative and sometimes illiquid investments. Typically, most 401(k) participants are offered a mix of stock or bond funds or index products in which to invest.
""President Trump wants to give American workers more investment options in order to attain stronger and more financially secure retirement outcomes,"" the White House wrote in a release. ""More than 90 million Americans participate in employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, and most of those are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets, unlike wealthy investors and retirement plans for government workers.
""Alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and digital assets, offer competitive returns and diversification benefits.""

Large asset managers, including BlackRock (BLK) and KKR (KKR), have expressed support for the move, which opens up the multitrillion-dollar retirement account industry to a broader mix of funds managed by these firms.
""Private assets like real estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns,"" BlackRock chairman Larry Fink wrote in his latest annual investor letter.

President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that will pave the way for alternative assets like cryptocurrencies and private equity to be included in the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
Ahead of the news, major cryptocurrencies and crypto-related stocks rallied on Thursday.
On Friday, bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose around 1% to trade near $117,000, while ether (ETH-USD) and XRP (XRP-USD) were trading up more than 5% and more than 11%, respectively.
Shares of Coinbase (COIN), the biggest publicly traded crypto exchange, and Robinhood (HOOD), rose 0.6% in premarket trading on Friday. Strategy (MSTR) shares were flat before the bell.
President Trump's executive order, signed Thursday, directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate the use of alternative assets in 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts.
The order marks a major shift in retirement investments, opening up the traditionally staid industry to more speculative and sometimes illiquid investments. Typically, most 401(k) participants are offered a mix of stock or bond funds or index products in which to invest.
""President Trump wants to give American workers more investment options in order to attain stronger and more financially secure retirement outcomes,"" the White House wrote in a release. ""More than 90 million Americans participate in employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, and most of those are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets, unlike wealthy investors and retirement plans for government workers.
""Alternative assets, such as private equity, real estate, and digital assets, offer competitive returns and diversification benefits.""

Large asset managers, including BlackRock (BLK) and KKR (KKR), have expressed support for the move, which opens up the multitrillion-dollar retirement account industry to a broader mix of funds managed by these firms.
""Private assets like real estate and infrastructure can lift returns and protect investors during market downturns,"" BlackRock chairman Larry Fink wrote in his latest annual investor letter.

New research shows the 10 jobs most at risk of being replaced by AI—and 10 jobs that are safe
As part of the agreement, Wells Fargo employees—everyone from tellers to investment bankers to C-suite executives—will be able to utilize AI agents via Google Agentspace, Google Cloud’s agentic AI platform.
The rollout will begin immediately with 2,000 Wells Fargo employees and will continue to be expanded over the coming months.
What does it mean for customers? Quicker, better service—theoretically.
The AI agents are expected to help Wells Fargo’s teams become faster at automating tasks, quicker at analyzing information, and overall more efficient at their jobs, the companies say.
For example, Wells Fargo’s banking business generates some 50,000 credit-related memos every year. A custom-built AI agent could conceivably tap into complex financial data, trends, and risk assessments to generate the first draft.
“Wells Fargo’s adoption of Google Agentspace marks a bold step forward in making banking simpler and smarter—for our customers and employees,” says Tracy Kerrins, consumer CIO and head of enterprise generative AI at Wells Fargo. “By leveraging advanced agentic AI capabilities, we can get answers and insights faster, work more efficiently, and free up time to focus on what matters most: helping people reach their financial goals.”
What guardrails are in place?
One thing that both Wells Fargo and Google Cloud’s team are putting front and center is what they describe as a more responsible approach to AI deployment.
In a statement, the two companies said their collaboration is “underpinned by rigorous ethical and regulatory frameworks so that these powerful tools are used in a way that promotes accuracy, fairness, transparency, accountability, and security.”
As companies across various industries team up with tech platforms to roll out generative AI products, some have drawn the ire of privacy and copyright advocates, among others.
Financial services are seen as particularly complicated use cases for AI given the strict regulatory and compliance requirements under which banks operate, to say nothing of the need to maintain consumer trust and protect sensitive private financial data.",67e62757c86a124dba6ff45d2d03df2e,trafilatura,2655,0

Rees added that strong cash flow generation allowed the company to return shareholder value through $133 million in share repurchases and $105 million in debt pay-down.
And while the company bested Wall Street’s expectations on both adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, Rees expressed caution over third-quarter forecasts.
“While we are pleased by this performance, the current operating environment is uncertain and challenging to predict,” the CEO said. “Against this, we have chosen to focus on managing expenses including the $50 million in cost savings we have already implemented, reducing our inventory receipts, and pulling back on promotional activity to protect brand health in the marketplace.”
He explained that while the actions will impact the top line of the business over the short term, they will position the business to drive margin dollars and support continued cash-flow generation over the longer term.
The net loss for the second quarter ended June 30 was $492.3 million, or $8.82 a diluted share, against net income of $228.9 million, or $3.77, in the same year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, the diluted EPS was $4.23. Revenues for the quarter rose 3.4 percent to $1.15 billion from $1.11 billion. Direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenues grew 4 percent, while wholesale revenues rose 2.8 percent.
Wall Street was expecting adjusted diluted EPS of $4.02 on revenue of $1.14 billion.
By brand, Crocs revenues rose 5 percent to $960 million. DTC revenues were up 3.4 percent to $495 million, while wholesale revenues increased 6.8 percent to $465 million. North American revenues fell 6.5 percent to $457 million, while international revenues rose 18.1 percent to $502 million.
At Hey Dude, revenues fell 3.9 percent to $190 million. DTC revenues rose 7.6 percent to $90 million, while wholesale revenues were down 12.4 percent to $100 million.
For the six months, the net loss was $332.2 million, or $5.94 a diluted share, against net income of $381.4 million, or $6.26, a year ago. Revenues rose 1.8 percent to $2.09 billion from $2.05 billion.",938fad43f8c9e9b20b738a4225a5f497,trafilatura,2655,0

Revenue came in at $1.24 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.19 billion and exceeding management’s guidance of $1.175 billion to $1.195 billion. Sales grew 5% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis.

Adjusted EBITDA was $238 million in the second quarter of 2025, a 13.5% decrease.
Pet Health revenue was $643 million, an increase of 11% on a reported basis, or 10% on an organic constant currency basis.
The increase in pet health revenue included a 4% increase in price. New products primarily drove year-over-year volume increases of 6%.
The Advantage Family of products and Seresto contributed revenue of $147 million and $113 million, respectively.
Farm Animal revenue was $583 million, a decrease of 2% on a reported basis due to the sale of the aqua business, and a 6% increase on an organic constant currency basis.
Farm animal organic constant currency revenue growth included a 2% increase from price. Volumes were up 4%, driven by increased volumes in U.S. cattle, led by Experior, and increased volumes in international poultry and swine.
The business has seen demand recovery for international swine products, while international poultry demand remains strong.
Sales of the company’s international farm animal products benefited from accelerated customer purchases, primarily in China, in advance of expected future tariff increases, estimated to have shifted approximately $10 to $20 million of expected future purchases to the second quarter.
Commenting on Elanco’s earnings, William Blair said, “Elanco’s second-quarter deck has some positive key product updates for Zenrelia (label update in the U.S.), Quattro (increased sell-through in the second quarter), AdTab (60% growth), and Experior/Bovaer (continued momentum).”
Analyst Brandon Vazquez of William Blair said the solid second-quarter update reinforced the belief that Elanco is on track for a multi-year period of improving growth and margins.

His death, on Thursday, was announced by the press office of the National Defense and Security Council. “Acting President Myint Swe passed away at 8:28 a.m. local time,” it said in a statement, adding a state funeral is planned, without mentioning the exact date.
Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing is expected to fully assume Myint Swe’s duties. He has already been serving as acting president during National Defense Council meetings in the capital Naypyidaw.
Myint Swe, a former lieutenant general, became the acting president after the military ousted the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi during a February 2021 coup. He was seen as a junta stalwart and mostly a ceremonial figure under Min Aung Hlaing.
Myint Swe previously served as army-appointed first vice president and was sanctioned by the US alongside Min Aung Hlaing for being one of the “perpetrators” of the coup. The US Treasury said in its sanctions notice that he was one of the people “who played a leading role in the overthrow of Burma’s democratically elected government.”
Since the coup, Myint Swe has rarely been seen in public. As the chair of the National Defense and Security Council, he was mainly responsible for granting and renewing the military chief’s powers during the prolonged state of emergency until he took medical leave on July 18, 2024.
After receiving treatment in Singapore and Naypyidaw around mid-2024 and continuing care at home, Myint Swe was sidelined. Min Aung Hlaing assumed his duties, extending emergency rule twice before lifting it last week.
A close ally of former junta chief Than Shwe, Myint Swe served in the military for about four decades before becoming the Yangon region’s chief minister in 2011. He was reportedly responsible for the previous junta’s violent crackdown on protesters during the 2007 Saffron Revolution. The US sanctioned him but removed the designation in 2016.
In 2017, Myint Swe led an inquiry into the military’s so-called clearance operations in Rakhine state, which forced hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh and drew global condemnation. The Myint Swe-led commission dismissed allegations of genocide, saying there was “insufficient evidence to take legal action.”",50cdeeaf8f811c433a2c1e085f160389,trafilatura,2652,0

Derby
(Reuters) -Americans' longer-term inflation outlook deteriorated in July even as households boosted their views on the current and future state of their respective financial situations, according to data released on Thursday by the New York Federal Reserve.
In its latest Survey of Consumer Expectations, the regional Fed bank said the expected level of inflation five years from now stood at 2.9% in July, rising from 2.6% in the prior month and the highest reading since March. Meanwhile, expected inflation a year from now rose to 3.1% from 3% in June, while three-year-ahead expected inflation held steady at 3%.
The rise in longer-run expectations, coming on the heels of a short cooling trend, may get the attention of policymakers who are trying to understand how President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff increases will affect the outlook.
The increases in import taxes are widely expected to push up inflation, with some data already showing that is happening. But there are big questions as to whether the increase will be a one-off impact or something more persistent.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking after the end of a two-day policy meeting last week, said ""near-term measures of inflation expectations have moved up, on balance, over the course of this year on news about tariffs."" He added that ""beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2% inflation goal.""
The central bank left its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range last week.
Some Fed policymakers believe the tariff price hit will be a one-time event, and they favor an interest rate cut to offset rising risks to the job market. But most central bank officials have been reluctant to cut rates because of a perceived risk that the long rollout and rapid shift in tariffs could lead to more lasting inflation.
Forecasters at Goldman Sachs said in research released on Thursday that ""over the next few months, we expect tariffs to continue to boost monthly inflation"" and will push price pressures well over the Fed's target by the end of this year, with the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index excluding food and energy items at a year-over-year gain of 3.3% by December, relative to 2.8% in June.
In its report on Thursday, the New York Fed found that home prices were expected to rise 3% on a year-ahead basis, while expected future inflation levels across a range of other measures were mixed.
It said labor market views also were mixed in July and the expectation that unemployment will be higher a year from now hit its lowest level since January.",b00421469bbd5e9d78b15b9bd9e73d7d,trafilatura,2643,0

They attributed the outflows to investor concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and a cooling U.S. economy, and remain optimistic that these crypto-focused products will regain momentum, particularly with the likely regulatory approval of new altcoin-based products.
“The spot crypto ETPs are benefiting from a one-two punch of macro demand for Bitcoin and regulatory changes that will likely accelerate blockchain adoption,” said Zach Pandl, head of research for crypto fund manager Grayscale. “Both trends should continue in the second half of 2025 and beyond.”
He added that the likely approval of staking ETFs could serve as a catalyst to further net inflows.
Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the decline “a breather,” and said that he remained “bullish long, long term.""
“I stick to this phrase–two steps forward, one step back,” he said.
Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows have topped $1.25 billion over the past three days, while their recently torrid Ethereum counterparts have hemorrhaged more than $600 million since last Friday. Ethereum last posted outflows on July 2.
It was the first time since a three-day period extending from the end of March into early April that investors simultaneously pulled more assets from both groups of funds than they invested in them on consecutive days.
BTC fell below $112,500 at one point, its lowest mark since July 10, although it recovered some ground on Tuesday. ETH sank to $3,380, its lowest level since the middle of the month.
Pandl noted that “there was evidence of froth in global markets in late July, including a surge in meme stock trading, high volumes in penny stocks, and tight credit spreads.”
“Signs of slower growth in the U.S. economy cooled investor enthusiasm and triggered the latest drawdown across assets,” he said.
The two largest crypto assets have been declining since last week, following a cooler-than-expected jobs report, the firing of the head of the government agency that compiles this data, and a fresh escalation of the Trump administration’s global trade war.
But Pandl said that the crypto exchange traded product outflows are consistent with pullbacks in financial markets as a whole and are ""comparatively small,” noting that recent outflows of Bitcoin ETPs were around 1% of assets, whereas the highest volume US equity ETF saw around 2% of assets in outflows.",0c665654fba3ee192de72a1d86c429f6,trafilatura,2638,0

The market saw a 5% decrease in registrations, totalling 140,154 units.
According to the trade body, this represents the lowest figure for the month since 2022 and is 10.8% below the levels seen in the same period before the pandemic, reflecting the current volatility of the market and broader economic factors.
The drop in demand was observed across both private and fleet buyers, with registrations declining by 3.2% and 6.5%, respectively.
In contrast, the business sector, which accounts for a smaller proportion of the market, saw a 10.4% increase in registrations.
Despite downturns in most vehicle categories, certain segments such as dual-purpose, mini, and luxury saloon models experienced an uptick.
Electric vehicle registrations provided a silver lining, with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) registering a 33% increase and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) witnessing a 9.1% rise.
However, the growth in BEVs was relatively modest compared to the substantial 34.6% hike seen in the first half of 2025.
The SMMT said the introduction of the Electric Car Grant (ECG) is expected to stimulate further interest in BEVs, although the delay in confirming eligible models has led to some buyers postponing their decisions.
The market share for BEVs has grown to 21.3%, an increase from 18.5% in the previous year, yet it falls short of the 28% target mandated by the ZEV Mandate.
Registrations of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) saw a decline of 10%, and the combined figures for petrol and diesel vehicles dropped by 14%, despite making up more than half of the market in July.
Year-to-date figures, however, remain in positive territory, with a 2.4% increase in overall market registrations due to the release of new models and price reductions offered by manufacturers.
The forecast for 2025 has been adjusted upwards to 1.9 million units, with a marginal increase anticipated for BEV volumes, which are expected to account for a 23.8% share of the market.
SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: “July’s dip shows yet again the new car market’s sensitivity to external factors, and the pressing need for consumer certainty. Confirming which models qualify for the new EV grant, alongside compelling manufacturer discounts on a huge choice of exciting new vehicles, should send a strong signal to buyers that now is the time to switch.
“That would mean increased demand for the rest of this year and into next, which is good news for the industry, car buyers and our environmental ambitions.",1f68c5d2704ceb9ca665b0f0279056f9,trafilatura,2637,0

Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) reported its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings on Tuesday.
The company’s second-quarter sales reached $6.74 billion, marking a 4.7% year-on-year increase and surpassing the analyst consensus estimate of $6.64 billion.
Marriott’s comparable systemwide constant-dollar revenue per available room (RevPAR) grew 1.5% year-over-year, while actual dollar RevPAR saw a 1.7% increase.

Performance in the U.S. and Canada was flat, with RevPAR edging down 0.1% in actual dollars, while international markets saw a 5.3% increase (6.1% in actual dollars).
The company added roughly 17,300 net rooms during the quarter, a 4.7% increase from the end of the second quarter of 2024.
Total expenses declined 5% to $5.51 billion, contributing to an adjusted EBITDA of $1.42 billion, up from $1.32 billion a year ago.
Despite a 3.4% rise in operating income to $1.24 billion, the company’s operating margin fell by 100 basis points to 18%.
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.65 outperformed the consensus estimate of $2.62.
At the end of the quarter, Marriott’s global system totaled nearly 9,600 properties, with approximately 1,736,000 rooms. As of June 30, Marriott held $700 million in cash and equivalents.
In the quarter, Marriott repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for $700 million. Through July 30, the company has returned over $2.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
CEO Anthony Capuano reported that Marriott delivered a strong second quarter, posting solid financial results and robust net rooms growth despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, with luxury strength offset by weaker select service demand due to reduced government and business transient travel.
Capuano noted that development activity remained strong, with nearly 32,000 rooms signed, over 70% in international markets, and a record pipeline of more than 590,000 rooms at quarter-end.

Roblox users spent around 10 billion more hours in the second quarter (Q2) of this year than last year.
-
Bookings earnings is a more important metric to Roblox because the company recognizes revenue gradually over time.
-
Roblox would need to maintain at least 40% to 50% bookings growth over the next several years to justify its valuation.
If you have a child in their teenage years or younger, there's a good chance that you have heard of Roblox (NYSE: RBLX). The metaverse gaming platform has been a hit among young folks since it was created in 2004 and reached its first 1 million registered users in 2006.
Roblox went public in March 2021, and the stock has been on a rollercoaster ride since then. Its IPO price was $45, but the stock surged to $134 by November 2021. Nearly seven months later, it had lost around 80% of its value, dropping to $27 in June 2022. However, in the past 12 months, the stock is up more than 250% and flirting with its all-time high (as of Aug. 4).
There's a lot to like about Roblox and its direction, but there's also one key red flag that investors should be aware of. Let's take a look at what those are before you make an investment decision.
Roblox's user growth and engagement are picking back up
Unsurprisingly, Roblox's platform was a major hit during the COVID-19 pandemic, with so many people at home and filling their time in various ways. During this time, Roblox's user base surged, but soon cooled as the world began to reopen. Roblox usage is now picking up more steam.
In the second quarter (Q2), Roblox had 111.8 million daily active users (DAUs), up 41% year over year (YOY). Its users engaged with the platform for a total of 27.4 billion hours, nearly 10 billion more hours than in Q1 2024.
For Roblox, more DAUs is obviously a good thing, but the hours these users engage on the platform are just as important because it leaves more opportunities for people to spend money via Robux (its virtual currency), participate in sponsored content (like luxury brand Gucci's Gucci Town), and engage with ads.
Bookings on Roblox's platform are picking up steam
While most people give a lot of attention to a company's revenue, Roblox's most meaningful top-line metric is its bookings because it reflects the actual cash coming in from user spending on the platform (mainly through Robux purchases).
Roblox's revenue, on the other hand, is typically recognized gradually over time. This gradual recognition means it may not be reflected in Roblox's financial statements in real-time and doesn't accurately reflect the immediate financial impact of Roblox's users' activity.",3ae1e9c50b857ed0a8e9c40da669efeb,trafilatura,2635,0

(Reuters) -Rivian and Lucid posted disappointing quarterly earnings on Tuesday and provided a grim outlook for the year as the electric vehicle makers take a hit from policy shifts and trade tensions that have disrupted the industry.
Shares of Rivian fell about 4% after the bell, while Lucid shares dropped 7%.
EV makers are navigating a bumpy road under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has decided to take away consumer tax credits, impose high tariffs on imports of auto parts and remove emission fines for makers of gas vehicles.
Add to that, China's curbs on the export of heavy rare earth metals - essential components for motors - have disrupted supply chains and affected production in the U.S.
Rivian flagged higher costs in the June quarter, hit by disruptions to rare earth supply, and increased its adjusted core loss forecast for the year as income from the sale of regulatory credits dries up.
Its cost of revenue for each vehicle produced rose about 8% to $118,375 per unit sold from a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations.
""That's really reflecting a much lower production volume, which was largely driven because of challenges we had within our supply base as a result of a lot of the changes in policy,"" CEO RJ Scaringe told Reuters.
""Therefore, our costs look higher, but it's not as if our bill of materials grew or as if we became operationally less efficient.""
Lower production in the June-quarter led to a $14,000 impact per vehicle sold to cost of good sold, CFO Claire McDonough said in a call with analysts.
The company will shut down production for three weeks in September, after a one-week pause in the second quarter, to integrate components and prepare for the launch of its smaller and cheaper R2 SUV next year that is seen as crucial to its success.
While Lucid said it managed to largely avoid the rare earth supply disruption by using some magnets from its inventory, its profit margin was hurt by tariff-related costs in the second quarter.
The luxury EV maker cut its annual production forecast.
The $7,500 federal EV tax credit expires at the end of September, eliminating a key competitive advantage that has driven demand, but analysts anticipate a surge in third-quarter sales as customers rush to make purchases before losing access to the incentive.
""We're definitely expecting that there is some softening in demand (in the fourth quarter),"" Lucid's interim CEO Marc Winterhoff told Reuters. The company has planned countermeasures to make it ""palatable"" for consumers, he said, without disclosing details.",4ca72c8f8f5907d05889bf5ae4db65ab,trafilatura,2630,0

By Jaspreet Singh
(Reuters) -Snap on Tuesday reported its slowest quarterly growth in more than a year, hurt by a temporary glitch in its ad platform and advertiser preference for bigger rivals such as Meta, sending its shares down over 16% in extended trading.
The Snapchat-parent said it had resolved the error that unintentionally allowed some ads to run at much lower prices.
Snap faces tough competition from the likes of TikTok and Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram, with advertisers preferring the larger platforms as they curtail marketing budgets amid economic uncertainty. Rivals Meta and Reddit reported upbeat second quarter results last week.
""The digital ad tailwinds that propelled Meta and Reddit to blowout quarters turned into a light breeze for Snap,"" said eMarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg.
Under different circumstances, investors might have overlooked its ad platform misstep, but ""there is little room for mistakes,"" she added.
Snap's quarterly revenue was also impacted by the timing of Ramadan, which influenced ad spending patterns. The end of the ""de minimis"" exemption - a U.S. duty-free import provision - also prompted some Chinese advertisers to reduce their marketing budgets.
In April, ad revenue growth declined to about 1% before ""largely recovering"" through May, and triggering the company to roll out Sponsored Snaps - a new video ads format that appears in user inboxes - more broadly in June, said CFO Derek Andersen.
The company said its expanded roll-out of Sponsored Snaps across the U.S. and several other global regions is driving more user actions and deeper engagement with ad content.
The Santa Monica, California-based company reported second-quarter revenue of $1.34 billion, up around 8.7% from last year and largely in line with estimates, but lower than the double-digit growth it recorded in the last five quarters. Its net loss widened to $263 million from $249 million a year ago.
Small and medium-sized businesses were the largest contributors to ad revenue growth and its subscription service Snapchat+ remained a key driver for diversifying revenue beyond ads.
Snapchat+ subscribers rose 42% to nearly 16 million for the quarter ended June 30. Daily active users rose 9% to 469 million, compared with estimates of 467.9 million.
The company forecast third-quarter revenue between $1.48 billion and $1.51 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.48 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

From economic data to corporate earnings, the anticipated impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs is finally showing up for all to see, but stock investors don't seem too concerned.
Data showed the U.S. service sector hit stalling speed in July as employment further weakened and input costs climbed by the most in nearly three years. Combined with a brutal jobs report on Friday, that rekindled stagflation fears and put the Federal Reserve in a tough spot.
U.S. earnings results, though they have been generally upbeat in the second quarter, are starting to show clearer tariff impact. Caterpillar warned that U.S. tariffs would cost it up to $1.5 billion this year and Taco Bell parent Yum Brands cautioned against higher costs and muted consumer demand.
Even AI chip stock Advanced Micro Devices reported disappointing data center revenue, sending its shares down 6.6% after the bell.
That is one reason that equity markets have turned cautious, with investors caught in the tug of war between still robust earnings and tariffs. Judging by the impressive bounce in shares following U.S. jobs figures, it seems buying the dip still wins for now.
The other big news of the day is ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is in early talks for a potential secondary stock sale, valuing the company at around $500 billion, Reuters reported.
In Asia, most shares were in the red but Japan and Australia outperformed with a gain of about 0.6%. Wall Street futures recovered from an earlier dip, with the Nasdaq futures up 0.1% and S&P 500 futures rising 0.2%.
European stock futures are bracing for a higher open, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures up 0.3%.
Currencies have moved little, with the dollar struggling to recover from the jobs-induced slump on Friday. All eyes are on Trump's pick to fill a coming vacancy on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.
Trump said the decision will be made by the end of the week, while ruling out Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as a contender to replace the current chief Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026.
The Treasury market braced for a $42 billion auction of 10-year notes after a three-year auction went poorly on Tuesday.
Key developments that could influence markets on Wednesday:
-- Euro zone retail sales for June
-- U.S. 10-year Treasury bond auction
-- Earnings results from Disney, Uber, McDonald's

An analysis by Insurify found that the cost of full-coverage car insurance could rise as much as seven percent to an average of $2,472 annually by the end of this year if tariffs lead to major losses for insurers.
Without the effect of tariffs, drivers are still set to see a rate increase of four percent in the second half of 2025, according to the insurance comparison site.
In a number of states, such as Rhode Island, Michigan, Maine, and Delaware, costs could rise more than 12 percent by the end of the year.
Insurify noted that in the first half of this year, car insurance rates held steady across the country and decreased in as many as 27 states, a trend now set to end because of inflation and tariffs.
“The U.S. has imposed several rounds of tariffs that raise the cost of auto parts, thus increasing the cost of repair claims for insurers,” Insurify said.
The company added that insurers “could raise premiums to align their rates with this additional financial risk.”
The firm also found that between June 2022 and June 2024, annual insurance costs rose by more than 40 percent, or $700. Rising labor costs, more expensive parts, vehicles with advanced technology, and extreme weather conditions have all contributed to the rise in prices.
According to the industry trade group Insurance Information Institute, the average cost of a claim has also risen. In 2023, the average claim for property damage was $6,551, compared with $4,689 in 2020. Over the same period, collision claims rose by a similar amount, roughly 40 percent.
However, it’s not certain that tariffs will push up the cost of car insurance, as regulators may deter increases, and some insurers have already included the impact of tariffs in their rates.
The uncertainty partly comes from the unpredictability of the tariffs. Trump recently revealed deals with South Korea, Japan, and the European Union to cut auto tariffs from 25 to 15 percent.
In its 2024 study, AAA found that it now costs roughly $12,297 each year to operate a new car.
According to Insurify, inflation and insurer losses could mean rising rates in all but four states by the end of the year.
Maryland has overtaken New York as the most expensive state in which to get car insurance. The state is now seeing average rates of $4,093, a rise of 20 percent compared to last summer. In New York, the average annual cost is $3,724, Delaware comes in third at $3,366, and Rhode Island is in fourth place with an average cost of $3,331.",fb8bb9270b297ddcc629b11848cd7374,trafilatura,2612,0

Rayan Tegtmeier, described as a ""seasoned financial expert"", will take over the CEO role from Bredack on 1 October, according to a stock exchange filing.
Bredack will remain “closely associated” with Veganz Group as the Berlin-headquartered company’s largest shareholder.
He will now focus on indoor farming as the managing director of OrbiFarm, the business Veganz Group sold for €30m ($34.6m) to an unidentified “third party” earlier this year, plus a profit share.
Veganz Group said in May it was looking to restructure the business into five business units under the brands Veganz, Mililk, Happy Cheeze, Peas on Earth and Orbifarm. That was before the vertical-farming business asset was sold.
Then in July, Veganz Group revealed it was spinning off the Mililk plant-based milk drinks business as part of an effort to raise new funds and in “preparation for entry of strategic investors”.
Tegtmeier's career history includes CFO of online supplements business nu3 Group and a board member of OTI Greentech, a tech solutions provider.
He has also ""executed multiple buy-and-build strategies across the DACH region"", including M&A, according to the filing.
Tegtmeier will help steer Veganz Group into its “next growth phase as a scalable technology company”.
The incoming CEO added: ""Under my leadership, the focus will be on profitable scaling, efficient capital allocation, and both organic as well as inorganic business expansion.
""My goal is to advance the chosen path, tap into new growth markets, and attract institutional investors - thereby helping to address what I believe is a significant undervaluation of the company's share price.""
Veganz Group's shares traded little changed at €17.70 in Frankfurt today (5 August). They have climbed more than 20% of the past 12 months.
Since founding Veganz Group in 2011, Bredack has “transformed” the business from a vegan supermarket chain to an ""innovative producer of plant-based foods with strong growth prospects"", the filing read.
Reporting its 2024 results in May, Veganz Group said sales dropped 34% to €10.8m.
It added that the DACH region, namely Germany, Austria and Switzerland, accounted for 95% of the sales total with Germany the company’s largest market at 81%.
Meanwhile, EBITDA losses for 2024 narrowed to €2.4m from €6.3m a year earlier, and similarly, the net loss shrank to €4.8m from €9.5m.
Last month, Veganz Group announced it had raised €7.1m through a new share issue, which “significantly strengthened its equity base”.",8db13fa2ec6f5cc182f4a9607e678805,trafilatura,2610,0

The statement, published by the Division of Corporation Finance, is specific to liquid staking, where participants deposit ""covered crypto assets"" into a third-party staking protocol provider, which in turn provides receipt tokens to the depositors.
Liquid staking allows users to lock up tokens in proof-of-stake blockchains while still maintaining access to their funds through derivative tokens. These tokens can then be used for various DeFi activities. Currently, liquid staking across all blockchains has nearly $67 billion in total-value-locked (TVL), with $31.7 billion in Lido, according to DefiLlama data.
Tokens tied to a number of liquid staking protocols, including Lido, Jito and Rocket Pool, went up marginally after the SEC statement was published, but are still down on the day's trading, CoinGecko showed.
To be sure, the SEC had previously published another staff statement addressing other forms of staking. Similar to the previous statement, Tuesday's note on liquid staking is not the same as binding guidance from the Commissioners or regulations that have gone through the SEC's formal rulemaking process.
However, the new statement does signal how the agency is thinking about the issue and suggests that any crypto industry participant who follows the guidance will not be sued by the regulator.
Tuesday's statement is specific to what liquid staking providers do, ""including their roles in connection with the earning and distribution of rewards, slashing, and the minting, issuing and redeeming of Staking Receipt Tokens,"" as well as other ancillary services. The main caveat is that the deposited crypto assets cannot be ""part of or subject to an investment contract.""
""In a Liquid Staking arrangement, the Liquid Staking Provider (whether a Node Operator or not) does not provide entrepreneurial or managerial efforts to Depositors for whom it provides this service,"" the statement said.
""These arrangements are similar to those discussed in the Protocol Staking Statement with respect to 'Custodial Arrangements.' The Liquid Staking Provider does not decide whether, when, or how much of a Depositor’s Covered Crypto Assets to stake and is simply acting as an agent in connection with staking the Covered Crypto Assets on behalf of the Depositor,"" the statement said.

Markel has underperformed the market over the past decade, although shares have more than doubled.
-
A $1,000 investment in the specialty insurance company would be worth about $2,160 today.
-
The company has a plan to help unlock the intrinsic value of its business and end the underperformance.
Over the past decade, Markel (NYSE: MKL) has delivered a 116% return for investors, or about 8.1% annualized. That isn't exactly terrible performance, but when you consider that the S&P 500 has produced a 255% total return over the same period, or 13.5% annually, it is less than impressive.
It's especially disappointing to investors, because Markel had established such a strong track record in its earlier days. In fact, even after the lackluster performance of the past decade, Markel has outperformed the S&P by more than 1,000 percentage points over the past 30 years.
Will Markel turn things around?
Markel is often referred to as a ""baby Berkshire"" for the similarities between its business model and that of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Like Berkshire, Markel uses its insurance float to invest in a portfolio of common stocks, as well as in entire businesses. But given its sluggish performance, is the investment thesis still intact?
Fortunately, the company's leadership is well aware of the problem and recently announced plans to unlock its intrinsic value, which management conservatively estimates at about $2,600 per share, about 35% above the current stock price.
Along with its year-end 2024 earnings report, Markel announced that it's conducting a thorough review of its business. Its goals are to optimize the insurance business, which quite frankly hasn't been as profitable as it should be, as well as to simplify the business structure and allocate capital as effectively as possible. If Markel can successfully execute on its plan, it could certainly create an inflection point in the stock that makes the next decade far more lucrative for shareholders.

Shares in Opendoor Technologies (Nasdaq: OPEN) are currently slumping more than 20% in premarket trading. Here’s what you need to know.

Opendoor reports its Q2 2025 results
Yesterday, Opendoor announced second-quarter results for its fiscal 2025. Here’s what Opendoor reported:
-
Revenue of $1.6 billion
-
Gross profit of $128 million
-
Net loss of $29 million
The company also revealed that it had an inventory balance of 4,538 homes with a total value of $1.5 billion. Additionally, it said that during the quarter, it purchased 1,757 homes, which was down 51% from the previous quarter and down 63% from the same quarter a year earlier.
For its current Q3, Opendoor issued revenue guidance of $800 million to $875 million.
But unfortunately for the company’s shareholders, after Opendoor announced its results, the stock plummeted over 20%.
When are OPEN shares down so much?
There are a few reasons why OPEN shares have fallen so much since the company announced its results yesterday.
The first is that the company reported a disappointing revenue guidance for the current Q3. It said it expects revenue of $800 million to $875 million. As noted by CNBC, that would represent a 36% decline from the same period a year ago.
This revenue decline is partly expected due to the current challenging home-buying environment. High interest rates, which in turn make mortgage rates high, deter home buyers, resulting in decreased home sales.
Another possible factor in Opendoor’s stock price slump today is that the company did not give much detailed information on its evolving business model, which it has dubbed “Product to Platform.”
This new model will see Opendoor “moving from a single product to a distributed platform with multiple offerings delivered through agents,” according to comments from CEO Carrie A. Wheeler on the company’s earnings call.
When a company radically changes its business model, it introduces uncertainty—and uncertainty makes investors nervous.
A third possible reason why OPEN stock is falling so much today is much simpler: It’s a meme stock, and meme stocks are highly volatile.
Yesterday’s earnings announcement was the first since OPEN stock went stratospheric last month, and the lackluster results may be prompting some investors who got in at the right time to take profits.",6f811672435b930b963c54b795a50d5c,trafilatura,2603,0

The acquisition will create a differentiated produced-water system in the Delaware Basin and expand WES' New Mexico footprint.
Aris’s full-cycle water infrastructure assets include approximately 790 miles (1271.3km) of produced-water pipeline; 1,800 million barrels per day (mbbl/d) of produced-water handling capacity; 1,400mbbl/d of water recycling capacity; and 625,000 dedicated acres from investment-grade counterparties.
The business complements WES’ existing produced-water business and is supported by long-term contracts with significant minimum-volume commitments.
The combined infrastructure will create a fully integrated produced-water value chain, enhancing WES’ ability to compete for new business development opportunities.
The transaction is expected to diversify WES’ customer base through Aris’s long-term contracts, acreage dedications and minimum-volume commitments with investment-grade counterparties.
WES president CEO Oscar Brown said: “The addition of the Aris assets better positions WES to provide enhanced flow assurance to our producing customers in west Texas, while expanding WES’s commercial relationships with some of the top E&P [exploration and production] operators in the New Mexico portion of the Delaware Basin, providing significant customer diversification and incremental opportunities for business development.”
According to the terms of the agreement, Aris shareholders will receive 0.625 common units of WES for each share of Aris they hold.
They will also have the option to choose to receive $25 per share in cash, although this may be subject to proration, with a maximum total cash consideration for the transaction set at $415m.
The transaction reflects a premium of 10% to Aris’s 30-day volume weighted average price and a premium of 23% to Aris’ closing price on the same date, based on WES’ closing price on 5 August 2025 and on the assumption of maximum cash consideration.
The total enterprise value of the transaction is approximately $2bn before transaction costs.
The merger, unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and Aris shareholder approval.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025.
Aris CEO and president Amanda Brock said: “Today’s transaction marks a significant milestone in Aris’ journey, and we are excited to join forces with WES.",eb2a8162bb546bd26863cbd67d98ef53,trafilatura,2600,0

ICAS has conducted the sessions with its members and the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) to discuss the proposals arising from a recent Call for Evidence.
In these discussions, members highlighted the necessity for a more streamlined corporate reporting framework, which has become overly complex and lengthy, often not meeting the needs of stakeholders.
The review aims to consolidate disclosure requirements and improve regulatory coherence while addressing inconsistencies in reporting standards and exemptions.
The proposed changes focus on producing annual reports that are more concise, relevant, and less dependent on standardised language.
The review will also evaluate whether modifications to the current reporting structure are needed to align with the UK Sustainability Reporting Standards (SRS), which are under review.
Although small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may not be directly impacted, they could face increased data requests from supply chain partners.
ICAS supports the transition towards digital reporting, which encompasses tagging, artificial intelligence, and online platforms, in line with the digital transformation initiatives at Companies House.
The intended reforms aim to reduce repetitive or low-value content, thereby lessening the burden on those preparing reports.
Additionally, the government is considering whether sustainability disclosures should be subject to assurance and, if so, the qualifications required for those providing such assurance.
This inquiry raises critical questions about the necessary skills and standards in the evolving field of sustainability assurance.
ICAS acknowledges the importance of a separate ongoing consultation aimed at developing an oversight framework for sustainability-related financial disclosures, which seeks input on a proposed voluntary registration system for sustainability assurance providers in the UK.
As advancements in sustainability data progress, the new reporting framework will need to accommodate the potential for restating sustainability figures when more accurate information is obtained. ICAS will continue to engage with stakeholders as the DBT prepares for its formal consultation on these proposals in 2025.

US Managers Want In,2025-08-07 19:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Active ETFs are booming in the US, and Europe is taking notice.
The European active ETF industry is expected to balloon to $1 trillion by 2030, up from just $50 billion today, according to Janus Henderson. JPMorgan’s asset management division recently partnered with the Dutch fintech Bux to offer its active strategies to subscribers via model portfolios. The move shows the importance of the European active ETF industry as banks like JPMorgan — which controls more than half the active ETF market, according to Morningstar — look to offer products to investors across the pond. In fact, much of the current hype around active ETFs in Europe can be attributed to their stateside growth, said Monika Calay, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar UK.
“A lot of managers are saying, well, if it’s something that’s successful in the US, should we also try to distribute in Europe?” she told ETF Upside.

Clones Across the Pond
Active ETFs are hardly new in Europe, but their recent surge in popularity is. Assets under management grew by 68% in 2024 compared with the previous year, per HANetf. Active strategies in the US have seen steep but steady growth since the SEC’s passing of the ETF Rule in 2019. In Europe, however, they were slower to take off, which Calay said is due in part to Europe’s “fragmented market.”
“When you think about Europe, you’ve got lots of different countries, different distribution channels,” she said. The UK market, for example, doesn’t have distribution fees, but there has still been slower adoption than expected because of its platform infrastructure. Still, more and more European providers are launching their own versions of American ETFs. These include:
-
Janus Henderson’s Tabula EUR AAA CLO UCITS ETF (JCLO) on European CLOs, which launched in March and seeks to replicate the performance of its AAA CLO ETF (JAAA).
-
JPMorgan’s EUR Government Bond Active ETF (JEUG), which launched in January and invests in bonds issued by Eurozone countries rather than US bonds, which are the focus of its Active Bond ETF (JBND).
So will other managers follow in JPMorgan’s footsteps and partner with European companies? Calay thinks so, even if the challenges remain steep. She pointed to Vanguard’s attempted launch of a direct investor platform in Germany, which closed after less than two years. “Every manager is going to have to decide how they want to access a particular market and look at the platforms that they want to partner with,” she said.",520c3e87cbd91d1e8b98edc1046776f7,trafilatura,2600,0

Lucid failed to meet analysts' revenue and loss per share estimates.
-
Investors are also concerned that the company lowered 2025 production volume expectations.
-
Despite the sore spots in the financial results, Lucid had positive news to report as well.
Luxury electric car (EV) maker Lucid (NASDAQ: LCID) reported second-quarter 2025 financial results yesterday after the market closed, and while the company reported some encouraging news, investors don't seem impressed.
As of 10:17 a.m. ET, shares of Lucid are down 7.5%, paring back the earlier slide of 10.7%.
Missing analysts' estimates isn't the only thing failing to charge up investors' spirits
Coming up short of analysts' revenue expectations of $262.6 million for Q2 2025, Lucid reported sales of $259.4 million. The bottom line of the income statement provided further disappointment. Whereas the consensus among analysts was the Lucid would report a $0.22 loss per share, the company posted a $0.28 loss per share.
Another source of consternation for investors is the fact that Lucid reduced its production volume. Instead of projecting 2025 production volume of about 20,000 vehicles, management now forecasts the company will produce 18,000 vehicles to 20,000 vehicles. Without providing much detail, management attributed the downwardly revised forecast to ""reflect the potential impact of continuously changing market environment and external factors.""
After a weaker-than expected earnings report, is now the time to hitch a ride with Lucid stock?
Clearly, investors are acutely focused on the company's inability to meet analysts' estimates and the lower 2025 production volume expectations. But there were some bright spots as well that bear recognition. Lucid reported a record for quarterly revenue in Q2 of $259.4 million, and it achieved its sixth consecutive quarter of record deliveries, with Q2 2025 deliveries growing 38% year over year.
While the bears outnumber the bulls today, Lucid still turned in a pretty good quarter. The reduced production volume forecast is bearable in light of its consistent growth in delivering vehicles overall. The market's overreaction today provides a great entry point for new investors seeking EV exposure to buy Lucid stock.

V2Food has acquired vegan business Daring Foods for an undisclosed sum and signed a tie-up with Ajinomoto to develop what the Japanese group's CEO described as ""next-generation, clean-protein products"".
Daring Foods will continue to operate under its own brand and be a platform for V2Food to launch products across in the US.
V2Food said it was working with Ajinomoto on ""initiatives"" in Africa and ""emerging"" markets in Asia.
Tim York, V2Food's CEO, said: “For several years, V2Food has been the number one plant-based meat company in Australia and, through the acquisition of Daring, we are excited to be able to introduce our world-class product range into the USA market.""
York took over the top position at V2Food in 2023 after former CEO Nick Hazell stepped down. V2Food was launched in 2019 with investment from Hungry Jack's founder Jack Cowin, Australia’s national science agency CSIRO and Main Sequence Ventures.
He added: “By combining our technological capabilities with Ajinomoto’s global scale and deep expertise in food science, alongside Daring’s proven market success, we’re creating a powerful platform for sustainable nutrition that doesn't compromise on taste or quality.”
Founded in 2018 in Scotland by Ross Mackay and Elliott Kessas, Daring Foods moved its headquarters to the US and launched there in 2020. Mackay, who had been CEO, left last year.
Daring Foods produces a range of plain, flavoured and breaded plant-based chicken pieces, wings and patties, as well as alt-chicken ready meals.
Jeffrey Gendelman, Daring Foods' CEO, said: “Together, we see an opportunity to shape the future of our space in a way none of us could have achieved alone.
“With V2Food’s technology platform and Ajinomoto Co.’s expertise supporting us, we’re in the best position yet to deliver on our consumer promise at both pace and scale.”

This development follows the company’s recent pre-Series B funding round, which secured $12m from Pivot Investment Partners and other existing investors.
The funding is intended to enhance the deployment of Docyt’s AI solutions within accounting firms and multi-entity organisations.
The HpAI engine combines large language models with specialised AI designed for complex tasks such as reconciliation, categorisation, anomaly detection, and month-end closing.
The capabilities of HpAI are integrated into the Docyt Accountant Copilot, which features AI agents that mimic the expertise of senior bookkeepers.
This allows firms to transfer responsibilities typically assigned to junior accountants.
Docyt’s AI system is capable of processing data, generating analytics, identifying anomalies, and automating month-end closing procedures. By using the Copilot, firms can potentially increase their operational efficiency without the need for additional personnel.
The HpAI technology is based on foundational models trained on comprehensive bookkeeping data, including ERP charts of accounts, vendor information, bank transactions, and financial records.
The models utilise 128 billion data points across more than 20 industry sectors, supported by a structured bookkeeping dataset developed over five years.
According to Docyt, these models do not require retraining on individual customer data, as they can adapt in real-time by maintaining contextual information to ensure accuracy.
This approach contrasts with commercial models that depend on broader datasets and general fine-tuning, aiming instead for precise categorisation and relevant financial insights.
Additionally, Docyt has indicated that its automation capabilities cover core bookkeeping functions and are applicable to various sectors, including hospitality, with plans for further expansion into additional industries.
Docyt co-founder and CEO Sid Saxena said: “At Docyt, we have spent over five years building high-quality synthetic datasets using in-house expertise of expert accountants doing high-quality data labeling that captures the complexity of real-world bookkeeping.
“This dataset is a critical component of our HpAI architecture, enabling it to deliver precise, context-aware automation. “We are now bringing this foundational AI architecture to accounting firms in the form of Docyt AI Copilot, enabling them to deliver client bookkeeping at scale, and with precision.”",81459d291281197a618ca110b993e288,trafilatura,2591,0

AMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here’s Why It’s a Buying Opportunity
Looking closer, the maker of chipmaking equipment stock has also fallen behind the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's (XLK) 34.6% return over the past 52 weeks.
Despite reporting a better-than-expected Q2 2025 adjusted EPS of $2.39, shares of Applied Materials fell 5.3% the next day due to revenue of $7.1 billion, missing the estimate. The shortfall was primarily driven by underperformance in its Semiconductor Systems segment, which brought in $5.3 billion, below the analysts' expectation amid reduced ICAPS investment and U.S. export restrictions to China. Notably, revenue from China, its largest overseas market, fell sharply to 25% of total sales.
For the fiscal year ending in October 2025, analysts expect AMAT's adjusted EPS to grow 9.5% year-over-year to $9.47. The company's earnings surprise history is promising. It beat the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.
Among the 34 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 22 “Strong Buys,” three “Moderate Buy” ratings, and nine “Holds.”
On Aug. 4, UBS increased its price target on Applied Materials to $185, maintaining a Neutral rating.
As of writing, the stock is trading below the mean price target of $206.33. The Street-high price target of $250 implies a potential upside of 35.9% from the current price levels.

The partnership brings together Fleetworthy’s Bestpass toll management system with Motive’s GPS and vehicle telematics, enabling a more comprehensive view of toll-related activity and associated costs.
A central component of the integration is a tool called Toll Genius, which merges GPS data with toll transactions to provide real-time visibility into toll expenses. By correlating vehicle location data with toll events, Toll Genius can identify inconsistencies such as unrecognized charges or mismatches in billing. This added layer of verification gives fleet managers a more accurate understanding of toll usage across their operations.
The integration also eliminates the need for manual data uploads, allowing information to flow automatically between the Motive and Fleetworthy platforms. Users can access toll insights and reports directly through the Bestpass portal, enabling quicker decision-making and improved responsiveness to potential discrepancies.
Fleetworthy reports that the tool also incorporates machine learning models, which can help detect patterns and streamline compliance efforts. Early adopters have noted reductions in toll errors and faster dispute resolution, suggesting the tool may contribute to improved back-office efficiency.
Shay Demmons, Chief Product Officer at Fleetworthy, said in a news release, “Our goal with Toll Genius is to bring unmatched accuracy, transparency, and insight to toll management. Whether it’s for cost optimization, compliance, or dispute resolution, this new integration gives Motive users the tools they need to run smarter and more efficient operations.”
This initiative aligns with broader trends in commercial transportation, where fleets are increasingly relying on integrated data systems to manage compliance, safety, and operational efficiency. The combined capabilities of Fleetworthy and Motive support this shift, offering fleets tools to enhance cost control while maintaining regulatory readiness.
Fleetworthy serves a wide network of fleets nationwide and offers one of the largest toll management programs available through its Bestpass integration. As data continues to play a growing role in fleet management strategies, solutions like Toll Genius may help operators keep pace with rising expectations around transparency, accuracy, and performance.

(Reuters) -Ralph Lauren cautioned on Thursday that tariff-related costs would pressure its margins this year and said it was bracing to see how inflation was weighing on price-sensitive consumers, sending its shares down 7%.
The comments overshadowed a rise in its annual revenue forecast, which was powered by solid demand for its Polo shirts and cable-knit sweaters in North America.
""The most meaningful offset is really the incremental cost inflation from the tariffs,"" CEO Patrice Louvet said on a conference call with analysts.
""The bigger unknown here today is the price sensitivity and how the consumer reacts to the broader pricing environment and how sensitive that consumer is. So that's what we're watching very closely as we head into the second half.""
Ralph Lauren, which sells its popular Polo Bear sweater for up to $398 on its website, has relied on its loyal, high-income customers to fuel sales and profit growth. Its stock has gained nearly 76% over the past 12 months.
Louvet said Ralph Lauren's core consumer has remained resilient around the world as the brand has shifted toward a full-price model.
""The consumer will pay up - just not indefinitely - so brands must pivot from price hikes to product storytelling before the runway lights dim,"" said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer of Running Point Capital.
Ralph Lauren's strategy to ramp up marketing spend and product innovation, as well as reduce promotions, has helped it gain market share in its core categories such as knitwear and handbags.
""Our high potential categories, including women's apparel, outerwear and handbags, continue to be accelerators for our business,"" Louvet said.
He said highlights include the Cable-Knit jersey and Polo Bear sweaters, linen shirts, dresses, the Cotton Canvas city jacket, and a handbag collection launched earlier this spring called ""Polo Play.""
The comments underline consumer preference for accessible luxury brands, similar to Tapestry, which has seen solid demand for its Coach handbags. Tapestry will report quarterly earnings next week.
Ralph Lauren's upbeat forecast is in contrast to bigger European rivals such as Gucci-owner Kering and Dior-parent LVMH, which have seen a sales slowdown.
The company expects fiscal 2026 revenue to rise by low- to mid-single digits from last year, compared with its prior target of a low-single digit increase.

DigitalOcean also raised its full-year sales outlook.
DigitalOcean (NYSE: DOCN) stock posted massive gains in Tuesday's trading. The cloud service specialists' share price rose 28.8% in a daily session that saw the S&P 500 index dip 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite index fall 0.7%.
DigitalOcean published its second-quarter results before the market opened this morning, and sales and earnings in the quarter beat Wall Street's expectations. In addition to artificial intelligence (AI) catalysts leading to better-than-expected performance in Q2, the company issued a significant raise for its full-year performance outlook.
DigitalOcean's Q2 results have changed the valuation picture
DigitalOcean's recent business momentum has proven to be significantly stronger than Wall Street expected. The company posted earnings per share of $0.59 on revenue of $218.7 million in the second quarter. Earnings were $0.12 per share better than the average analyst target, and sales were roughly $2.1 million ahead of the consensus analyst target. Revenue was up roughly 13.6% year over year, and management pointed to sales more than doubling for AI and machine learning services as a key driver for the performance beats in Q2.
What's next for DigitalOcean?
DigitalOcean expects strong sales momentum to continue in the near term. The company set guidance for Q3 sales to be between $226 million and $227 million -- good for growth of roughly 14% at the midpoint of the target range. Meanwhile, full-year sales are projected to come in between $888 million and $892 million, up from its previous guidance for sales of between $870 million and $890 million.
The midpoint of the new guidance range suggests annual revenue growth of roughly 14% year over year, representing a meaningful increase from the previous midpoint target for sales growth of 13%. Even better, the bump up in expected sales is being driven by the highly valued AI and machine learning categories.

The agreement with SG Safety, part of the CJ Group local conglomerate, will see the launch of the Myprotein brand into offline channels in South Korea for the first time, London-listed THG said in a filing.
CJ Group will also manufacture Myprotein branded products locally under license, including bars, snacks, powders, ready-to-drink products, and supplements.
THG said it will continue to produce its core protein powders, with SG Safety acting as distributor in the South Korean market.
The partnership marks the company's first licensing agreement in South Korea, enabling it to deepen its presence in a “capital-light manner”, the filing read.
Set for a consumer launch in the fourth quarter, the agreement builds on Myprotein’s online presence, where South Korea ranks among its “top five” global markets. The filing did not reveal the offline marketing channels.
Citing industry data, THG noted the South Korean sports nutrition market was valued at $1.88bn in 2023 and is projected to reach $3.05bn by 2030, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.2%.
Neil Mistry, CEO of THG Nutrition, said: “This collaboration will strengthen our presence in one of Myprotein’s most important markets, while also creating new opportunities to grow across established and emerging product categories, and to extend our reach across both offline and online channels.”
The agreement complements Myprotein’s existing partnerships in Asia, such as with Japan’s Itochu, the company said.
Jung-Hyun Sung, the CEO of SG Safety, said: ""We’re excited to be partnering with THG Plc to expand access to Myprotein across South Korea.
""The demand for trusted, high-quality nutrition products continues to grow, and this agreement allows us to meet that demand through local expertise in manufacturing and distribution, supported by the strength of the Myprotein brand.""
THG operates two primary consumer-facing businesses: THG Nutrition, which includes Myprotein, and THG Beauty. In 2024, the company spun-off its tech platform, THG Ingenuity, into a standalone business.
In April, THG’s board rejected an “unsolicited"" and ""largely unfunded"" takeover proposal for Myprotein from Selkirk to the tune of as much as £600m ($798.7m). The board considered the offer to be ""undervalued"".
In a first-quarter trading update in April, THG reported continuing revenue of £371.4m, down 6.1% in constant currency terms. THG Nutrition posted revenue growth of 0.1%.",83fa224e5b9fa6984cb02b9c061ed375,trafilatura,2582,0

The brand is a fan favourite among celebrities including Kendall Jenner, Kaia Gerber, Veneda Carter, and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
For the financial year ending 31 March 2024, Adanola reported a significant growth in turnover, reaching £57.11m ($76.10m), more than double the previous year's figure of £27.87m. Its pre-tax profit also increased to £18.98m, up from £8.31m in the prior fiscal.
Adanola CEO Niran Chana said: ""Adanola's ascent has been fuelled by staying disciplined as a women's product-first, active lifestyle brand. Across all areas of the company, we've curated the partners that support the vision of the brand.

I'm incredibly proud of what the Adanola team has achieved to-date, and we're poised and ready for our next chapter.""
Adanola operates through a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model while maintaining a ‘selective’ wholesale network with partners such as Selfridges Group, David Jones, Ounass, Equinox, and Soho House.
The brand strategically pairs an accessible price point with premium platform partnerships to enhance its brand positioning.
Following this investment, Adanola plans to prioritise digital channels and selectively expand its retail presence, including own stores.
STORY3 founder and managing partner Peter Comisar said: ""Adanola has garnered uniquely strong and authentic relationships with consumers, and we believe the business is in the early stages of powerful global growth. We are honoured to serve as a trusted partner to Hyrum and Niran given our long track record of supporting founders and entrepreneurial executive teams.""
""We see extraordinary opportunities to support the Adanola team as it leverages its loyal customer base and revered products to continue to expand in its home UK market and within key growth markets including the US,"" STORY3 Partner Samir Shah added.
In June last year, Adanola appointed Niran Chana as CEO to drive growth and lead overall strategy and execution.

The president has been inviting the chiefs of big Wall Street banks one by one recently to discuss what such a deal could look like, which could include a public offering, Bloomberg first reported last Thursday. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon also met with Trump for such discussions last week.
Some of these discussions have revolved around how the banks value these organizations, how they think they could sell them, and how this wider privatization effort could be structured, according to one person familiar with the matter.
The over-the-counter shares of Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA) both fell more than 3% Wednesday. They are up 101% and 147%, respectively, year to date.
Spokespeople for the banks declined to comment.
Fannie and Freddie play integral roles in the US housing market by purchasing mortgages and repackaging them as securities. Both fell under government conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis when mortgage defaults soared and the US Treasury Department injected over $180 billion into the mortgage lenders.
Selling the government's stakes in these two mortgage giants could mean one of the world’s largest public offerings, which would result in a major payday for the stock underwriting desks of these big banks. The president vowed in late May to take the mortgage giants public in a post on Truth Social.
However, pulling off such a move would be far from a simple feat.
The challenge with relinquishing the government’s conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie is that turning these massive institutions into private businesses could drastically impact access to affordable credit in the housing market, which has steadily relied on these institutions to fund 30-year mortgages for over a decade.

For these reasons, Democratic politicians, civil rights organizations, and some housing experts have been critical of the effort.

This could mean higher costs for credit unions to sell these loans,"" Kelsey Nelson, federal regulatory compliance counsel for the credit union advocacy group America's Credit Unions, wrote in June.",d47a1e1ff40b0cfc3bb1e059a0db74fb,trafilatura,2565,0

DHL reported that net profit grew 9.6 percent to 815 million euros ($943.8 million), while revenue declined 3.9 percent to 19.8 billion euros ($23 billion) in the period.
More from Sourcing Journal
Although it anticipates a subdued economic environment alongside expected cost cuts, DHL’s outlook for the 2025 fiscal year remains unchanged, with earnings before interest and taxes expected to reach at least 6 billion euros ($7 billion). Free cash flow is still guided to be roughly 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion).
For the second quarter, cross-border time-definite international shipments (TDI) at the company’s DHL Express segment declined 10 percent. Chief financial officer Melanie Kreis called it “a higher number than what we had in previous quarters.”
B2B volumes saw a 2 percent decline, while B2C volumes brought the wider number down at a 20 percent collapse.
From a market standpoint, U.S.-destined TDI shipments, which represent 17 percent of the global volumes, sank 31 percent in the quarter.
De minimis-related shipments from China and Hong Kong into the U.S. were the main culprit, with Kreis describing it as the “only market subsegment with a significant reduction in volumes.”
The closure of the duty-free trade exemption on packages worth less than $800 on May 2 did a number on air cargo in between the Chinese and U.S. markets. UPS already reported in late July that volumes from China to the U.S. tanked 34 percent on an annual basis in May and June once de minimis was scrapped. The provision ended just weeks after the U.S. temporarily slapped 145 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, further comprising air cargo supply chains on the trans-Pacific trade lane.
DHL has the benefit of not being U.S.-centric like UPS is. The firm said in April that it had reduced its exposure to de minimis volumes ahead of the May 2 date.
To counteract the overall DHL Express segment decline, the company reduced air capacity by 7 percent. The company’s annual rate increase implemented at the start of the year has also helped boost revenue per kilogram shipped by 4 percent.
“We have furthermore flexed capacity across the network to adapt to the volatile regional trade flows,” Kreis said, who noted that in the U.S., “we have responded with a significant reduction in airlift and in local pickup and delivery capacity.”",09e03a3d9517569d81db9e42f41cbb21,trafilatura,2561,0

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Paramount's new chairman and chief executive, David Ellison, outlined a plan to transform the century-old entertainment company into a technology-driven media enterprise in an open letter marking the completion of the merger with Skydance Media.
Ellison said the company would work to transform Paramount by investing in growth businesses that are anchored in its storytelling, working to scale its streaming business globally, and reorganizing the company to make it more efficient.
""We are in the midst of a generational change in our industry - and we understand Paramount has faced its own significant challenges, compounded by the reality of a merger process that stretched out over a considerable time period,"" Ellison wrote.
""But that time of uncertainty is now behind us. Moving forward, we will work with conviction and optimism to transform Paramount into a tech-forward company that blends the creative heart of Hollywood with the innovative spirit of Silicon Valley.""
Paramount Global and Skydance Media Thursday completed their $8.4 billion merger that was announced more than a year ago, capping a long drawn-out deal process marked by political scrutiny and shareholder concerns.
Ellison said he plans to reorganize Paramount into three business units - studios, direct-to-consumer and TV media - to speed decision-making. He plans to move the company onto a single technology platform to reduce costs, and said the company would find efficiencies associated with labor, real estate and procurement, with the goal of achieving a previously announced $2 billion in cost savings.
New Paramount will direct resources ""to what matters most,"" Ellison wrote, delivering more movies, television series, sports, news and games to global audiences.
Paramount will harness technology, not as a replacement for human creativity, but as a tool to amplify creativity.
""From virtual production stages that unleash filmmakers’ limitless imaginations, to AI‑assisted localization that brings shows to new language markets overnight, to a proprietary ad‑tech stack that maximizes yield across streaming and linear platforms, we will thoughtfully integrate these tools into every aspect of our work,"" Ellison wrote.
Ellison said the company would prioritize growing its streaming business, increasing investment in high-quality exclusive content, which he called the ""single biggest driver of subscriber growth.""

AMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here’s Why It’s a Buying Opportunity
Including today’s decline, Intel stock is down nearly 30% versus its year-to-date high set in February.
Why Is Trump’s Post Negative for Intel Stock?
Investors are choosing caution on INTC shares this morning as the president’s social media post highlights political and reputational risks tied to the company’s leadership.
An administrative demand for Tan to resign introduces meaningful uncertainty around corporate governance and strategic continuity.
Labeling him as “highly CONFLICTED” possibly due to ties with China-based businesses raises fears of national security scrutiny, especially amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions.
Earlier this week, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark wrote a letter to the chairman of the Intel board of directors questioning these alleged ties, including to Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), which just plead guilty to violating U.S. export controls.
All in all, Trump’s comment signals potential regulatory pressure and leadership instability ahead, risks that may further hurt Intel stock in the second half of 2025.
INTC Shares Continue to Face Challenges
Trump’s remarks add to a string of challenges facing Intel shares that made Seaport Global analysts maintained their “Sell” rating on the semiconductor company last week.
According to the investment firm, INTC stock isn’t worth owning despite an attractive valuation since it may continue to lose market share to competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), particularly in high-performance computing and AI-driven workloads.
Moreover, a recently announced NEX spinoff adds complexity to INTC’s corporate structure. It’s more of a defensive move than a growth catalyst, Seaport told clients in its latest research note.
Wall Street Sees Significant Upside in Intel
Despite several headwinds threatening Intel’s stock price recovery, Wall Street hasn’t really thrown in the towel on INTC shares yet.
While the consensus rating on the semiconductor stock remains at “Hold” only, the mean target of about $23 indicates potential upside of roughly 17% from here.",064ae17c0f5e4666e746857b6c3ef18f,trafilatura,2560,0

The financial wellness site ranks states by the time it takes to pay off those bills, with Alaska winning the dubious distinction of 16 months and 10 days to clear the books. The average Alaskan pays just $259 toward their credit card bill each month, with median debt spread across an average of 2.84 credit cards per person.
Mississippi resides at the other end of the spectrum, taking a mere nine months and 30 days to eliminate that debt. It's also one of the nation's poorest states, with average full-time salaries just $54,203 in 2023. This raises more questions than answers because low-income individuals and families have greater demand for debt to make ends meet, while having a tougher time paying it off.

WalletHub collected TransUnion data on median credit card debt and average monthly payments, combining the two to rank their 50 states and District of Columbia listicle. Using this methodology, a state with high debt and low payments takes the longest to pay off debt, while low debt and high payments takes the shortest. The results offer unique insight into stress levels of American families trying to make ends meet in 2025.
Median credit-card debt ranged from $2,148 to $3,683 in the report while finance charges stretched from $226 to $553. There was no obvious connection between geography, income and indebtedness, with coastal, Sun Belt and Midwestern states scattered all across the results.

The Nasdaq Composite jumped 0.98% for a record close of 21,450.02. The tech-heavy index hit a fresh all-time intraday high earlier in the day. The S&P 500 added 0.78% and ended at 6,389.45, a hair's breadth shy of a record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 206.97 points, or 0.47%, closing at 44,175.61.
The major averages posted a winning week, with the 30-stock Dow jumping about 1.4% and the broad market S&P 500 up 2.4% in the period. The Nasdaq posted a 3.9% climb on the week.
Apple lifted both the S&P 500's tech sector and the Nasdaq. The iPhone maker surged 13% this week after announcing plans to spend about $600 billion over four years in the U.S. in a bid to appease President Donald Trump. The stock notched its best week since July 2020.
Apple's latest surge kicked into high gear as Trump announced earlier this week that he would impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and chips, with an exemption for companies that are ""building in the United States."" Shares advanced another 4.2% Friday.
Trump's trade policies
Investors not only appeared to interpret the semiconductor tariff as being less harsh than anticipated, they also seemed to look past Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs, which took effect at midnight on Thursday. Some of the steepest duties include Syria's 41% and Laos' and Myanmar's 40% rate.
Trump warned U.S. courts Friday against striking down his tariff policy, writing in a Truth Social post that if the courts were to do that, ""It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION."" He also said that the duties have been having a ""huge positive impact"" on the market. Stocks nosedived in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariff announcement back in April, with the S&P 500 falling into correction territory after seeing its biggest single-day loss since 2020.
""The market's reaction to the April 2 announcement kind of shows how markets feel about tariffs,"" Ross Mayfield, Baird investment strategist, said. ""Investors are largely anticipating the administration not following through on hyper aggressive tariff plans, so it's kind of like chicken-and-egg, and I think we're still kind of in the later stages of figuring that out.""
""If markets anticipate that but don't react because they're waiting for the capitulation, the administration could possibly take it that the market is enforcing the policy rather than anticipating a change, so it is kind of a tricky dynamic,"" he continued.",41312558ad14fec3c620c515ad0509fc,trafilatura,2542,0

A recent announcement revealed that Joby and L3Harris will develop a next-generation military craft capable of piloted or autonomous flight. The partnership combines Joby’s vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) technology with L3’s military systems expertise, targeting applications like surveillance, reconnaissance, and contested logistics. The companies plan to test this fall, followed by operational demonstrations in 2026.

Beyond defense applications, Joby is pursuing aggressive commercial growth. The company delivered its first electric aircraft to the UAE in June, targeting a 2026 launch. Reports suggest Joby is also weighing an acquisition of helicopter service provider Blade Air Mobility (BLDE), which would provide immediate access to existing commercial aviation markets.
JOBY Stock Performance Depends on Commercial Operations
Joby Aviation’s first quarter 2025 results showcase the company’s accelerating progress toward commercial air taxi operations. Several critical achievements have positioned it as the industry leader in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft development.
The company made record-breaking progress on FAA certification, advancing 12 percentage points in Stage 4 of the certification process during the quarter. With Joby’s internal certification now 62% complete, each signed-off test plan brings the company closer to Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) flights with the FAA, a crucial step toward commercial operations.
CEO JoeBen Bevirt emphasized the significance of this progress, noting that “each plan we sign off with the FAA is a step towards unlocking TIA flights.” It remains on track to begin TIA flights within 12 months, as previously outlined.
Joby achieved a major industry milestone by completing routine pilot-onboard transition flights between vertical and horizontal flight modes. This achievement, described as “one of the most challenging technological feats in aerospace,” was built on hundreds of unmanned transition flights and thousands of ground and air tests.",5b3747f573b790e977c98d8ec5053d7b,trafilatura,2534,0

The stock prices of Super Micro Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq: SMCI) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMD) are down significantly over investor fears that artificial intelligence-related growth is lagging expectations. Here’s what you need to know.
Supermicro misses expectations
Shares in Super Micro Computer (aka Supermicro) are trading sharply lower in premarket as of the time of this writing. Currently, SMCI shares are down more than 16.2% to $47.95. The reason for this dramatic stock price drop has everything to do with the company’s just-announced Q4 2025 results.
The server maker announced Q4 net sales of $5.8 billion, which was up significantly from the $4.6 billion it posted in Q3. Net income for the quarter was $195 million, which was also up from Q3, when the company posted $109 million in net income. Finally, its Q4 earnings per share (EPS) were 41 cents, up from 31 cents in Q3.
So if Supermicro’s results were up over the last quarter, why is the stock falling?
It’s a combination of expectations and sales that fall short of past quarters. While Supermicro posted net income of $195 million—around $86 million more than the previous quarter—that was down from its $297 million in net income during the same quarter a year earlier.
As noted by CNBC, the year-over-year Q4 net income decline is partially attributable to Supermicro’s costs from President Trump’s tariffs. However, costs aren’t the only thing bugging Super Micro Computer investors. The company’s results also didn’t meet investor expectations.
LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter were an EPS of 44 cents, three cents short of what Supermicro delivered. Investors also expected revenue of $5.89 billion—more than the $5.76 billion that Supermicro reported.
As Reuters notes, many attribute the company’s lower-than-estimated revenue to Supermicro losing out on AI server sales to its bigger competitors, including Dell and HP.
Finally, Super Micro Computer also disappointed investors by forecasting full-year fiscal 2026 net sales to total at least $33 billion. Previously, the company had said it expected net sales of around $40 billion in 2026.",6cdd739a68e33b423894746670b7d982,trafilatura,2531,0

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he will nominate Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Stephen Miran to serve as a Federal Reserve governor.
Here are some investor comments about his impact on the Fed and markets:
ANDREW BRENNER, HEAD OF INTERNATIONAL FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, NATALLIANCE SECURITIES, NEW YORK:
""Our view is he is very controversial and will not pass the Senate. He will try to change the Fed. First he has no experience. No street. No business. Always politics.""
ROBERT TIPP, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, HEAD OF GLOBAL BONDS, PGIM FIXED INCOME, NEW YORK:
""So far bashing the Fed this term has been fruitless, or possibly even counter-productive — it certainly appeared to be counterproductive in the December 2018 Trump/Powell episode …
Presumably it (Miran's appointment) will have at least a marginal impact — but it will depend on the pliability of the rest of the committee members — which is certainly not a given.
Furthermore, as situations evolve, and nominees become acting chairs, there is at least one prominent example of a Fed Chair -- the first appointee following the 1951 Accord, Martin, who worked on the Accord from the administration's side – (who) proceeded in his long tenure to anger more than one president with his tight money policies ...
Again, while Trump is likely to choose someone more aligned with his thinking than Powell, the impact may not prove as material as some may fear.""
RYAN SWEET, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, OXFORD ECONOMICS, PHILADELPHIA:
""I don't think it means too much in the context of altering the course of monetary policy.
I think the biggest question mark is whether or not he gets confirmed in time to vote at the September meeting. If he does, then that increases the odds that we get three dissents if the Fed opts to not cut in September.
I do think the odds of a September cut are rising, not because of this nomination, but just because of the recent data on the labor market.""
TOM DI GALOMA, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF RATES AND TRADING, MISCHLER FINANCIAL, PARK CITY, UTAH:
""Stephen Miran will be good for the Fed because he will probably be inclined to lower rates. And I think he worked in the first Trump administration. So he has been in two Trump administrations. I think it's going to be a long-term deal for Miran and he will be Fed governor for a while. I don't think this is something that they want to do temporarily.""

-
The Department of Defense moved to ensure the U.S. will have a long-term supply of critical rare-earth materials.
-
Apple followed suit a few days later with another transformative deal with MP Materials.
-
The company is primed for significant facility expansion underpinned by heavy investment and support from the Department of Defense and Apple.
July was a momentous month for the rare-earth and magnets company MP Materials (NYSE: MP). The stock rose a whopping 84.9% in July, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Moreover, as I write, the stock is up an incredible 338% on a year-to-date basis.
Why MP Material stock surged in July
The move in July comes down to a series of events starting with the transformative partnership signed with the United States Department of Defense.
It's an unusual partnership, and it fundamentally changes the investment proposition for the company:
-
MP Materials will construct a domestic magnet manufacturing facility (its second), known as the ""10X Facility.""
-
The DOD purchased $400 million in the company's preferred convertible stock and has a warrant to acquire additional common stock. If exercised, the warrant could lead to the DOD owning 15% of the shares in the company at the time of the deal.
-
The DOD is loaning MP Materials $150 million to expand its capability at Mountain Pass, and JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have agreed to provide $1 billion in financing toward the construction of 10X.
-
The DOD will ensure that ""100% of the magnets produced at the 10X Facility will be purchased by defense and commercial customers with shared upside,"" and will enter a 10-year agreement, guaranteeing a price floor of $110 per kg for neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr) products.
As the bullet points imply, the deal helps secure MP Materials' future, ensures cash flow, brings financing, and propels the company into the forefront of providing the future supply of critical rare-earth materials to the U.S.
Enter Apple
A few days later, in mid-July, MP Materials announced a long-term rare-earth magnet supply agreement with Apple. The technology company's commitment to buying $500 million in rare-earth magnets produced in the company's Texas facility will result in a significant expansion in that facility.
The next day, MP Materials announced a $500 million stock offering, which was promptly raised to $650 million the following day due to strong demand, with the proceeds to be allocated to expanding its facilities, including 10X.",62b08a3b74bce2d43eda1dd49a580b6b,trafilatura,2528,0

LONDON (Reuters) -Big investors are turning more cautious on areas such as passive equities and private credit this year and are more interested in hedge funds as a sector than they have been for several years, according to a Goldman Sachs survey.
The survey showed 27% of large investors said they wanted to cut their exposure to long-only passive equities in the second half of the year, compared with 19% in the first half of the year, according to the report sent to clients and seen by Reuters on Thursday.
Private credit, which has been the most popular asset class among large allocators in the last few years, is losing favour: the survey showed that 31% of investors plan to commit money to this strategy in 2025, compared with 41% a year ago.
Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage conducted the survey in July. It surveyed 333 allocators including pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds that oversee more than $1 trillion of assets.
Passive equities, products tracking broader stock indices, have lost appeal as markets have been roiled by tariff shocks, the data from Goldman Sachs showed.
Meanwhile, uncertainty has grown for lending to private companies that need healthy financial conditions to grow, as recent data releases have cast doubt on the U.S. economic outlook.
U.S. duties on imported goods are starting to boost inflation, risking a period of tepid growth and high prices, known as stagflation.
Private credit valuations are not always transparent, two investors at companies overseeing a combined $2 trillion of assets, told Reuters on Wednesday.
One of the investors said they were considering redeeming from investments where they could not determine the values, or so-called ""marks"", of the portfolios.
Hedge funds had the highest allocator interest, according to the data from Goldman Sachs.
The survey showed that 37% of investors intend to allocate cash to this sector over the remainder of this year, unchanged from the first half. However, just 6% say they are going to decrease investments in it, compared with 10% previously.
It remained uncertain whether investors would stick to their allocation plans, Goldman said.
Even though many might want to invest more money in hedge funds, many were prevented from spending money that was locked into private markets commitments that weren't seeing income, or distributions, Goldman said.
Anecdotally, ""these pressures may be easing,"" the bank said.

(Reuters) -Blackstone, the world's largest alternative asset manager, has agreed to buy energy data and analytics provider Enverus, it said in a statement on Wednesday, as dealmaking in the private equity sector shows signs of recovery after a slowdown.
Reuters had exclusively reported last week that Blackstone had emerged as the frontrunner to buy Enverus. No financial details were given, but a source familiar with the matter said the deal could value the target at as much as $6.5 billion if Enverus meets certain financial metrics. At the closing of the deal, Blackstone will commit between $6.1 billion and $6.4 billion to acquire Enverus, the source said, adding that the transaction is expected to be financed with around $3 billion of debt.
Easing economic uncertainty and the prospect of potential rate cuts, coupled with pent-up demand for dealmaking, have made a fertile environment for a revival in mergers and acquisitions after a tariff-driven slowdown.
Blackstone President and Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Gray said last month the ""dealmaking pause was behind us.""
The Enverus deal marks Blackstone's latest investment in the energy sector. In January, a unit of the asset manager had agreed to acquire a 774-megawatt natural gas power plant in Virginia.
""Blackstone shares our conviction that the future of energy will be defined by AI, real-time intelligence, and bold execution,"" said Enverus CEO Manuj Nikhanj. ""Their global reach and deep expertise across energy, infrastructure, and data-rich industries will accelerate our momentum.""
""This is more than a transaction — it's a launchpad.""
Founded in 1999, Enverus provides analytics and benchmark data sourced from U.S. energy producers and more than 40,000 suppliers. The Austin, Texas-based company has more than 8,000 customers across 50 countries — from exploration and production companies to power and utilities.
Reuters reported in May that private equity firm Hellman & Friedman had launched a sale process for Enverus, which attracted interest from buyout firms and other companies.
H&F had bought Enverus from another private equity firm Genstar Capital in a $4.25 billion deal in 2021.
RBC Capital Markets and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett advised Blackstone on the deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2025. Citi, Morgan Stanley and Kirkland & Ellis advised Enverus and H&F.

That move added fuel to the fire for two already red-hot leveraged exchange-traded funds: the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR Daily ETF (PTIR) and the Direxion Daily PLTR Bull 2X Shares (PLTU). Both funds surged on the day and remain the top-performing U.S.-listed ETFs of the year. Each has more than tripled in value year to date, beyond Palantir’s 131% gain.
Palatir Growth Surprises Analysts
Palantir's revenue increased 48% year over year to $1.01 billion in Q2, marking the fastest growth rate in four years and surpassing analyst estimates of $939 million. Full-year guidance of $4.15 billion also topped expectations of $3.91 billion.
“This was a phenomenal quarter. We continue to see the astonishing impact of AI leverage,” said CEO Alex Karp in a statement.
Palantir, long known for its government and defense contracts, is rapidly expanding into the commercial sector. U.S. commercial revenue surged 93% in the quarter to $306 million, outpacing U.S. government revenue, which rose 53% to $426 million.
The company appears to be benefiting from its position at the intersection of two key growth themes: artificial intelligence and national defense. With the adoption of artificial intelligence accelerating and military spending on the rise globally, Palantir’s product suite has struck a chord with both enterprises and governments.
Valuation Risk
But the biggest criticism of the stock remains its valuation. Palantir trades at 86x forward revenue estimates, the highest multiple among its software peers. On the earnings side, the numbers are even more extreme: 241x forward adjusted earnings and 371x forward GAAP earnings.
Those sky-high multiples require near-flawless execution, something skeptics remain wary of.
Of the 31 analysts tracked by Bloomberg, only 10 rate the stock a buy, while 17 have a hold and 4 recommend selling. The average 12-month price target is $142, well below the current share price of $175.
Jefferies analysts, who have an underperform rating and a $60 price target, praised the quarter but cautioned that the stock’s valuation is “on a different planet.”
For now, though, investors—especially retail traders—seem unfazed. And leveraged ETF holders are reaping the rewards. PTIR and PLTU now manage nearly $700 million and $600 million in assets, respectively, fueled by both performance gains and continued inflows.",a2b84c5e3398e72271f748b359a1271b,trafilatura,2522,0

The assessment will be conducted in line with the group’s internal procedures over the coming weeks.
In a statement, the Italy-based firm said: “Generali confirms its intention to pursue the evaluation of the Offer and discussions on these matters.
“At this stage, Generali reserves the right to continue evaluating the Offer and the potential Industrial Partnership over the upcoming weeks in full compliance with the Group’s processes, procedures and schedule defined by its internal corporate governance bodies before forming a definitive view.”
In April this year, Mediobanca proposed to buy 100% of Banca Generali's shares for €6.3bn. It aims to fund the acquisition by selling its shares in Generali’s insurance arm, Assicurazioni Generali.
Mediobanca is scheduled take a shareholder vote on its Banca Generali takeover bid on 21 August, according to a company release.
The proposed merger is anticipated to create a major entity in the European market.
Meanwhile, Generali Group reported an adjusted net result of €2.2bn for the half-year period ending 30 June 2025. The figure marks a 10.4% rise from $2.02bn reported in the same period last year.
This improvement has been credited to the group's strong operational performance, particularly in the property and casualty (P&C) insurance segment.
The overall operating result of the group reached €4.04bn, which is an 8.7% rise from the previous period.
Banca Generali's operating result recorded a downturn of 11.6% to €275m for H1, largely due to a reduction in non-recurring performance fees.
Nonetheless, Banca Generali managed to secure total net inflows of €3bn in the first half of the year.
The Asset & Wealth Management division saw a marginal decrease in its operating result by 1.1% to €560m, supported by the input from Conning Holdings Limited (CHL).

The acquisition expands the suite of physical climate risk assessment tools available to clients of the sustainable investing business of ISS Stoxx, a subsidiary of global corporate governance and proxy advisory service Institutional Shareholder Services. Sust Global’s products deliver “globally consistent analytics on climate hazards and financial materiality across multiple scenarios,” the company’s founders said.
ISS Stoxx Head of Sustainability Business Till Jung said the acquired products “are a highly complementary fit” with the firm’s existing proprietary asset data.
“Institutional investors’ need for geospatial data and enhanced physical risk analytics is growing rapidly and we're pleased to address that demand through this transaction,” Jung said in the release. “Our ability to map them to corporates and investment portfolios will result in highly effective solutions for institutional clients.""

The regulator, which first laid out proposed reforms for payment firms in September, said companies would be required to keep customer money separate from their own funds, so that it could be returned if the firm fails.
The payments sector has come under greater scrutiny as more consumers have become exposed to the risk of poor safeguarding. Between 2017 and 2022, the use of current accounts with online money and payment institutions - rather than traditional banks - has surged five-fold, a FCA survey shows.
Under the tighter rules, larger payment firms will be subject to monthly reporting and annual audits, and they will be required to conduct daily checks to ensure the right amount of money is being safeguarded to protect customers.
The rules will apply to payment institutions, e-money institutions (EMIs) and credit unions that issue e-money, the regulator said.
EMIs flooded London over the last decade, benefiting from a lighter regulatory burden compared to banks.
Last month foreign exchange broker Argentex, an e-money institution (EMI) since 2018, fell into special administration after succumbing to market volatility following a decline in the company's liquidity position.
Failed payment firms had average shortfalls of 65% of their customers' funds over a five-year period to mid-2023, the FCA said.
""People rely on payment firms to help manage their financial lives. But too often, when those firms fail, their customers are left out of pocket,"" said Matthew Long, director of payments and digital assets at the FCA.
""We'll be watching closely to see if firms seize the opportunity and make effective improvements that their customers rightly deserve – this will help us to determine whether any further tightening of rules is necessary.""
UK Finance, a lobby group for the finance industry, said it was important that the new safeguarding rules were assessed for their impact and effectiveness before any further changes were made.
""We support a robust and effective safeguarding regime that protects customers without placing unrealistic demands on businesses, particularly smaller firms,"" a spokesperson said.
""Getting the balance right means having rules that are practical, proportionate, and internationally competitive.""

In a Truth Social post, Trump said Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan ""is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem.""
Intel said in a comment later Thursday that the company, directors and Tan are ""deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests.""
""We are continuing to invest billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including our new fab in Arizona that will run the most advanced manufacturing process technology in the country, and are the only company investing in leading logic process node development in the U.S.,"" the statement said.
Tan was named as Intel CEO in March as the company tried to rebound from declining sales under the stewardship of Pat Gelsinger.
This week, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., questioned Tan's ties to Chinese companies and referenced a past criminal case involving Cadence Design, where Tan was CEO until 2021.
Cotton wrote to Intel's chair to ""express concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations and its potential impact on U.S. national security.""
""Intel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,"" Cotton wrote. ""Mr. Tan's associations raise questions about Intel's ability to fulfill these obligations.""
Cotton asked whether the company required Tan to divest from positions in chipmakers linked to the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army and any other concerning entities in China.
Tan has invested in a number of Chinese companies, including some linked to the country's military, both directly or through venture funds, Reuters reported in April.
Intel beat revenue expectations when it reported financials for the second quarter in July, but announced several spending cuts.
In a memo, Tan announced cuts to the company's costly foundry division, which makes chips for other companies and had an operating loss of $3.17 billion.
The company canceled planned fab projects in Germany and Poland, and consolidated testing and assembly operations in Vietnam and Malaysia. Tan also said Intel would slow construction of a chip factory in Ohio.

Salesforce (CRM) is showing an IV Percentile of 81% in advance of their earnings announcement on August 27th.
Assuming we have a bearish outlook on CRM stock, we can run the Barchart’s Bear Call Spread Screener and find the following results:
Below are the full parameters for this scan:
Let’s analyze the first result which has the lowest lowest loss probability at 11.9%.
This Bear Call Spread on CRM stock involves selling the $290-strike September 19th call and buying the $320-strike call.
That spread could be sold for around $1.17 which means the trader would receive $117 into their account. The maximum risk is $2,883 for a total profit potential of 4.06% with a loss probability of 11.9%.
The breakeven price is $291.17, which is 17.65% above the current stock price. This can be calculated by taking the short call strike and adding the premium received.
As the spread is $30 wide, the maximum risk in the trade is 30 – 1.17 x 100 = $2,883.

The Federal Trade Commission has moved to block Edwards Lifesciences’ planned acquisition of JenaValve Technology, citing concerns that the deal threatens to reduce competition in the market for devices to treat aortic regurgitation.
The agency alleged that over two days in July 2024, Edwards signed agreements to acquire both JenaValve and JC Medical, the two leading companies competing to bring transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices to market to treat the potentially fatal heart condition. Edwards closed the acquisition of JC Medical in August 2024.
The FTC said Edwards’ proposed $945 million acquisition of JenaValve would combine the only two companies conducting U.S. clinical trials for a TAVR aortic regurgitation, or TAVR-AR, device.
“The deal threatens to reduce competition in the TAVR-AR market, likely resulting in reduced innovation, diminished product quality, and potentially increased prices for consumers,” the agency stated in a federal court complaint.
The commission voted 3-0 to issue an administrative complaint and seek a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to halt the transaction pending an administrative proceeding. The complaint and injunction request were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
JenaValve is poised to become the first company to bring a TAVR-AR device, called Trilogy, to the U.S. market, the FTC said. Food and Drug Administration approval of a TAVR-AR device by another company besides Edwards and JenaValve is not expected in the foreseeable future.
“The FTC is taking action to stop this anticompetitive deal and ensure that JenaValve and Edwards’ JC Medical subsidiary continue competing to innovate, expand treatment eligibility, and keep down costs,” Daniel Guarnera, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in the agency’s Wednesday statement.
Edwards’ stance
Edwards said Wednesday that it disagrees with the FTC’s decision and believes it will limit the treatment options for patients with aortic regurgitation. Edwards argued that the acquisition will actually “accelerate the availability, adoption and continued innovation of a life-saving treatment for patients suffering from AR.”
The company plans to continue to pursue regulatory approval for the deal and expects a final determination by the end of the first quarter of 2026.",28cd34c1d1dc75b5ad9f52b28d98f0cb,trafilatura,2500,0

GlobalFoundries beat expectations but issued soft guidance.
-
The consumer electronics market remains depressed, even as smaller segments are showing green shoots.
-
Shares are beginning to look attractive at all-time lows here.
Shares of specialty semiconductor manufacturer GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) sank on Tuesday, down 10.3% as of 3:20 p.m. ET.
The company reported earnings this morning that beat expectations by a decent margin; however, demand may have been ""pulled in"" to the second quarter, as third-quarter guidance came in well below analysts' expectations.
Mixed performance across different specialty chip end markets
GlobalFoundries is a U.S.-based fab for ""specialty"" semiconductor manufacturing nodes. These are chips that aren't on the ""leading-edge"" but are important to several end markets across consumer electronics, autos, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and a small segment in the periphery of data centers.
In the second quarter, GlobalFoundries posted revenue growth of 3.4% to $1.69 billion, with non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) of $0.42, up 11% on the year. Both figures beat analyst expectations.
Yet while the overall quarter was good, there were a lot of mixed results underneath the surface. GlobalFoundries saw strong growth in autos and data center, along with decent growth in IoT devices; however, the company's largest segment in consumer electronics continues to struggle, and was down 10%.
And it doesn't appear the consumer segment is improving in the near term, as GlobalFoundries issued highly disappointing guidance for Q3 revenue at $1.68 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.42. That guidance marks a small quarterly decline on both metrics, and was well below analyst consensus.
CEO Tim Breen noted, ""As we await a return to meaningful growth across the consumer-driven end markets, I am pleased with the steps GF is taking to broaden the long term value proposition to our customers.""
GlobalFoundries isn't the most exciting chip stock, but it's getting cheap
As a U.S.-based fabrication company for specialty nodes, GlobalFoundries is more of a ""geopolitical risk"" play than a real strong AI semiconductor play. So, its biggest value is sort of as a hedge against potential war or disruption in the East Asia supply chain.
That being said, the stock is also getting fairly cheap as it sits at all-time lows. Shares now trade around 20 times this year's earnings expectations and just 14.5 times 2026 EPS expectations.",33aa144cdf45a0b6e29d25b26c4a0194,trafilatura,2491,0

D-Wave's shares surged on artificial intelligence (AI) integration news, but fundamentals haven’t caught up.

Investors should be wary of quantum hype outpacing reality.
Shares of D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) spiked on Tuesday, finishing the day up 6.8%, but had jumped as much as 11.6% earlier in the day. The rise came as the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) lost 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.
D-Wave, a company developing quantum computing technology, announced the launch of a suite of new artificial intelligence (AI)-focused development tools.
D-Wave says it's bringing quantum and AI together
The company announced yesterday that it was releasing ""a collection of offerings to help developers explore and advance quantum artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) innovation."" Included in the release is an open source toolkit and a demo that enable ""developers to seamlessly integrate quantum computers into modern ML architectures.""
The company is clearly hoping to tap into the incredible growth of ML and AI, positioning its quantum technology as a powerful tool to maximize AI's potential.
Quantum investors are getting ahead of themselves
The company's current market capitalization of more than $5.7 billion stands in stark contrast to its 2024 revenue of less than $9 million.
Despite the hype around quantum computing, I think there is plenty of reason to believe this technology is a very long way from maturing and being capable of driving revenue of any significance. D-Wave delivers its computing services to customers using a mix of quantum and classical computing, but is conveniently light on the details of how much it relies on each.
If you're an investor with a particularly high risk tolerance and the ability to possibly wait a decade for your investment to pay off, you could consider investing now. I'll personally wait until valuations come back to Earth. If you do, however, I would strongly suggest spreading your investment around many quantum stocks; there's no way to tell at this point which company's approach will work in the long run.
Should you invest $1,000 in D-Wave Quantum right now?

AMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here’s Why It’s a Buying Opportunity
CrowdStrike stock has pulled back rather significantly in recent weeks but is still up nearly 50% versus its year-to-date low in March.
Why Alphabet’s Filing Isn’t Negative for CrowdStrike Stock
Alphabet’s decision to pull out of CRWD stock isn’t necessarily bearish for the cybersecurity stock.
According to Gene Frantz, general partner at Alphabet’s independent growth fund, CapitalG, via which the company held its stake in CrowdStrike, the fund retains conviction in cybersecurity firm’s leadership and its long-term potential.
Frantz’ remarks suggest the divestment likely reflects portfolio rebalancing or liquidity needs rather than a loss of conviction.
In fact, a blockbuster rally in CrowdStrike shares in the trailing 12 months confirms Alphabet’s exit marks the end of a successful investment cycle, not a judgement on future performance.
Jim Cramer Says CRWD Shares Could Rally to $1,000
Note that CrowdStrike stock has soared nearly 400% over the past five years. Still, famed investor Jim Cramer recommends sticking with it as it’s not done pleasing its shareholders just yet.
In a recent segment of Mad Money, the former hedge fund manager even signaled a possible surge in the cybersecurity stock to $1,000.
“You have the best. Take out your cost basis, and let the rest run,” he told a caller in late July.
Earlier this year, CrowdStrike acquired Flow Security, expanding capabilities in data observability and governance, which adds up to list of reasons to own CRWD shares in the second half of 2025.
CrowdStrike Remains a Buy-Rated Stock Among Wall Street Analysts
While not nearly as bullish as Cramer, Wall Street firms remain constructive on CrowdStrike stock as well.

Archer Aviation stock has rocketed higher over the past year.
-
Defense applications could represent a major source of its business.
-
Despite the stock's recent rise, now's still a great time to buy Archer stock.
Soaring about 140% over the past year, Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR) has provided some considerable lift to investors' portfolios. But plenty of investors who haven't taken flight with the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) stock may be standing on the tarmac wondering if it's too late for them to buy.
The answer is clear: Archer Aviation still has plenty of growth potential in the tank, making it a great consideration for growth investors.
Archer's huge new market opportunity is underappreciated
From its partnership with United Airlines to develop an air taxi network (in addition to United's option to purchase up to $1.5 billion of Archer eVTOL aircraft), to partnerships with Abu Dhabi Aviation and Ethiopian Airlines, to collaborating with Stellantis to strengthen its manufacturing capabilities, Archer is well-positioned to hit the ground running when it receives its final certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.
These factors have supported the stock's massive rise this past year, but Archer's partnership with defense start-up Anduril could be another major factor contributing to further growth. The two companies are developing hybrid eVTOL aircraft for defense applications, and it seems that Archer has high aspirations for where this collaboration could be headed.
In its 2024 10-K, Archer identifies two areas in which it plans to operate: commercial and defense -- though it's worth noting that Archer has worked with the United States Air Force since 2021.
Another interesting angle to Archer's defense work is its partnership with artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics specialist Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) to develop AI software for aviation systems. Since Palantir also partners with Anduril, it's not absurd to imagine the three companies collaborating to develop sophisticated eVTOL aircraft featuring AI.
Should investors prepare for takeoff with Archer stock?
Sadly, global tensions remain startlingly high, and defense spending will likely be a priority for nations in the coming years. While Archer stock has soared over the past year, the company's pursuit regarding defense applications suggests there's room for shares to ascend even higher in the period ahead.",55c2b6c9f5255b21cbdb14d66ace855a,trafilatura,2471,0

O'Reilly Automotive has been an amazing stock performer.
-
It's a somewhat recession-resistant business, too.
-
But think twice before buying great stocks at any price.
So, you're interested in O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY) stock. Who could blame you? It's been a terrific performer for many years, making lots of shareholders richer. You might be wondering whether it could make you richer, too.
Well, it might, but there are a few issues to consider.
For starters, let's review the stock's recent performance over time:
Data source: Morningstar.com as of July 29, 2025.
I posed the question of whether you could turn $10,000 into $61,917 in a decade with O'Reilly stock because that's what would happen with average annual gains of 20%. Looking at the table above, you might think that achieving 20% average gains will be easy. That's not necessarily true, though -- because the stock's price seems a bit overheated at recent levels -- without much margin of safety.
If the shares were undervalued, aiming for 20% gains would seem more reasonable. But if the shares are overvalued, then they've gotten ahead of themselves and may well pull back before advancing again.
Consider these measures: O'Reilly's recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.4 is well above its five-year average of 23.2. And its recent price-to-sales ratio of 5.0 is well above its five-year average of 3.7.
Given all that, I won't be buying shares anytime soon. But the stock is worth adding to your watchlist in the hope of a better, lower price. It has many points in its favor. For one thing, its business is recession-resistant, should a recession rear its ugly head. When people's cars have issues, they will simply need to buy parts and supplies. And the average age of cars in America has increased recently.
O'Reilly Automotive is growing well, too, posting revenue and earnings increases of 6% and 11%, respectively, in its solid second quarter. Growth investors might keep an eye on O'Reilly, but income investors should look elsewhere, as it doesn't yet pay a dividend.
Should you invest $1,000 in O'Reilly Automotive right now?

However, narrowing the focus, TMUS has lagged behind the iShares U.S. Telecommunications ETF’s (IYZ) 36.4% uptick over the past 52 weeks and 10.6% rise on a YTD basis.
On Jul. 23, TMUS delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, prompting its shares to surge 5.8% in the following trading session. The company reported record Q2 total postpaid and postpaid phone net and gross customer additions, along with industry-leading gains in postpaid net account additions and 5G broadband subscribers. This contributed to a robust 6.9% year-over-year growth in its overall revenue, which reached $21.1 billion, surpassing the consensus estimates by a slight margin. Moreover, its core adjusted EBITDA improved 6.4% from the year-ago quarter, reaching $8.5 billion, while its EPS advanced 14.1% annually to $2.84, topping analyst estimates by 5.6%.
Additionally, TMUS raised its fiscal 2025 outlook, and now expects postpaid net customer additions in the range of 6.1 million to 6.4 million, and projects core adjusted EBITDA to be between $33.3 billion and $33.7 billion.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect TMUS’ EPS to grow 9.6% year over year to $10.59. The company’s earnings surprise history is promising. It surpassed the consensus estimates in each of the last four quarters.
Among the 28 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a ""Moderate Buy” which is based on 16 “Strong Buy,” two ""Moderate Buy,” nine “Hold,” and one “Strong Sell” rating.

Still, diluted earnings per share of 13 cents came in 1 cent ahead of the 14 cents analysts had penciled in, according to Yahoo Finance. And adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 12 percent to $22.9 million.
Gross margins increased 4 basis points to 54.1 percent of sales, getting a boost from a higher mix of owned brands.
Overall sales increased 9 percent to $309 million. Sales at the Revolve division also rose 9 percent to $268.4 million, while Fwrd was up 10 percent to $40.6 million.
The company’s top-line growth outpaced its active customer count, which rose to 2.7 million for the last 12 months, an increase of 6 percent.
Cofounder and co-chief executive officer Mike Karanikolas told analysts on a conference call: “Our customer base continues to increase and, on average, we are generating more revenue per active customer, helped by a lower return rate year-over-year in our successful efforts to capture a greater share of the consumer’s wallet.”
He also touted Revolve’s international growth. While the business is still smaller abroad, at $67.3 million in sales in the quarter, that marked 17 percent growth.
Michael Mente, cofounder and co-CEO, said the company — known for its high-profile events — is getting heard in a crowded market.
“Our brand-elevating Revolve Festival held in April set the tone for the second quarter by delivering significantly greater marketing impact of reduced spending year-over-year,” Mente said. “Aspirational content from Revolve Festival in the Coachella Valley dominated social media feeds during the one-week period around our events.”

See today's video update from Mike above.) A swift downside reversal in the big indexes shows a twitchy, erratic market running out of eager buyers near the upper end of the past week's range. The opening rally attempt got its push from overnight overseas strength after strong China exports, positive European shipping trends and hope that the imposition of U.S. tariffs left room for negotiated exemptions. Twitchy bond-market action after some headlines on Fed governor Waller potentially having a better shot as President Trump's Fed Chair pick and after a soft 30-year Treasury auction had yields a bit higher across the board. Trump subsequently said he'd nominate Council of Economic Advisors chair Stephen Miran to what's left of the unexpired term. Isolated pockets of pronounced weakness in some earnings reporters and subsectors of tech. Eli Lilly 's disappointing weight-loss-drug results knocked the stock down 14%, and perhaps destabilized other crowded, large-cap growth names such as Visa (off 2.3%). Software stocks were bloodied, with a clanging guidance miss by cybersecurity player Fortinet triggering a flight from a group already seen as vulnerable in a more AI-centric world. Given all these hazards, the broader market hung together OK. The S & P has spent all week inside the range set by last Thursday's record high a bit above 6400 and Friday's post-payroll-report low just above 6200. Benign churn to alleviate overbought conditions or the start of a less trustworthy tape given loss of momentum, challenging seasonal factors and waning momentum? Damage to the S & P limited by Apple 's upside follow-through, the stock ahead by another 3% after it was seen as sidestepping further tariffs on its imports from India. The move only modestly closed its yawning 22-percentage-point underperformance relative to the Nasdaq-100 this year, but provided good ballast for the S & P 500. Weekly jobless claims a non-event, stuck in a benign range, though another uptick in continuing unemployment claims to a new cycle high, just under 2 million, accentuates the current low-metabolism labor market: weak hiring pace, few layoffs and muted labor supply (given retirements and immigration crackdowns). CPI next Tuesday is the next key macro input as the debate over the growth-inflation-policy interplay remains tense.",0953698f91d329599b0b9e781e38d8a0,trafilatura,2434,0

AMD Stock Slips After Q2 Earnings, But Here’s Why It’s a Buying Opportunity
Narrowing the focus, CCI has also lagged behind the Pacer Benchmark Data & Infrastructure Real Estate SCTR ETF’s (SRVR) 9% uptick over the past 52 weeks. On the other hand, it has outperformed the ETF’s 5.1% YTD rise.
On Jul. 23, CCI delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, and its shares surged 3.8% in the following trading session. Due to a decline in site rental revenues, the company’s top-line dropped 4.2% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. However, the revenue figure surpassed the consensus estimates by 1.9%. Additionally, its adjusted EBITDA fell 3% from the year-ago quarter to $705 million, while its AFFO per share of $1.02 decreased 1% from the same period last year. Yet, the AFFO figure also exceeded Wall Street’s expectations by 2%.
Its Q2 performance was supported by strong operational execution and increased leasing activity from customers, which also led the company to raise its fiscal 2025 guidance. CCI now expects site rental revenues to be $4 billion, and projects AFFO per share to be $4.20 at the midpoint.
For the current fiscal year, ending in December, analysts expect CCI’s FFO to decline 42.4% year over year to $4.02 per share. The company’s earnings surprise history is promising. It topped the consensus estimates in each of the last four quarters.
Among the 18 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a ""Moderate Buy” which is based on 10 “Strong Buy,” and eight “Hold” ratings.

""I do think it's something that doesn't makes sense,"" he said. ""If you can't deduct all your losses, you know, how does that make sense that you pay income tax on something that's not actually income.""
Previously, gamblers could deduct all their losses from their winnings so that they are only paying taxes on net winnings. But the new rule makes it so that gamblers can only deduct 90% of their losses from their winnings. For example, if someone wins $1,000 but also loses $1,000, they would only be able to deduct $900 and would have to pay taxes on $100 of winnings.
Robins said he believes the change was made as part of a ""technicality"" to follow the Byrd rule, which bans ""extraneous"" matters — usually anything unrelated to federal revenue or spending — in the budget reconciliation process. He said there has been some ""appetite"" to change the new provision, adding that DraftKings is working with members of Congress to do so.
DraftKings posted a strong quarter Wednesday after close, and shares jumped more than 3% in extended trading. The sports betting company said this quarter set revenue, net income and EBITDA records, with management attributing the success to ""continued healthy customer engagement, efficient acquisition of new customers, higher structural Sportsbook hold percentage, and sportsbook-friendly outcomes.""
Robins offered a sanguine outlook on widespread legalization of sports betting, saying he thinks progress has been made across the board. He suggested the practice will eventually be allowed in most states, including large markets like California and Texas.
Online sports betting is currently legal in 34 states, according to the latest information on the American Gaming Association website.
""I can't imagine a world where you can, you know, bet in 30, 40 plus states, and California is not one of them, and Texas is not one of them,"" Robins said.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission are quickly falling in step with the recommendations put forth by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets last week — the CFTC with a “crypto sprint,” and the SEC with an initiative dubbed Project Crypto, its plan for global crypto market primacy.
The regulators are “wasting no time in fulfilling President Trump’s vision to make America the crypto capital of the world,” said Acting Chairman Caroline Pham, who said the CFTC would work closely with SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and Commissioner Hester Peirce on Project Crypto.
“Providing regulatory clarity now and fostering innovation in digital asset markets will deliver on the Administration’s promise to usher in a Golden Age of Crypto,” Pham said in a prepared statement.
The first step in the CFTC’s sprint came Monday, when it said it would be launching an initiative to allow spot crypto trading on futures exchanges registered with the agency,
And the SEC, already at work on Project Crypto, issued a memo Tuesday clarifying that liquid staking — a method by which crypto investors stake their assets while maintaining liquidity — does not constitute as offering securities, and therefore do not fall within the SEC’s jurisdiction.
“Under my leadership, the SEC is committed to providing clear guidance on the application of the federal securities laws to emerging technologies and financial activities,” Atkins said in a prepared statement, calling the memo “a significant step forward in clarifying the staff’s view about crypto asset activities” that fall outside of the SEC’s purview.
Leadership at crypto firms previously in the crosshairs of regulatory scrutiny and enforcement, such as Ripple and Binance, lauded current regulators and the Trump administration for their about-face on crypto.
The SEC, CFTC and Congress collaborating on a national framework for digital assets “is exactly the sort of cooperation that we believe is required when transformative new technologies like blockchain and digital assets are introduced into the US markets — similar to previous leaps in financial technologies like the introduction of electronic trading,” Binance.US Interim CEO Norman Reed said in an emailed statement.",b0c729181cacf40e3f66e20f7cccf78b,trafilatura,2412,0

Narrowing the focus, MGM has also underperformed the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLY) 27.9% gains over the past year, but outpaced XLY’s 2.4% dip in 2025.
MGM stock prices dropped 3.8% in the trading session following the release of its Q2 results on Jul. 30 and have remained in the red since then. Driven by an increase in revenues from MGM China and Regional Operations segments, the company’s overall topline for the quarter inched up 1.8% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, exceeding Street expectations. However, Las Vegas Strip Resorts’ revenue has remained under pressure, falling 4.1% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. This has continued to unsettle investor confidence. Further, the recent downward revision of US jobs data has resurfaced the fears of recession, leading to a downturn in consumer discretionary stocks.
Meanwhile, MGM’s adjusted EPS has dropped 8.1% year-over-year to $0.79, but it managed to beat the consensus estimates by a notable margin.
For the full fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect MGM to deliver an adjusted EPS of $2.37, down 8.5% year-over-year. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates thrice over the past four quarters, while exceeding the projections on one other occasion.

Dive Brief:
-
BD is investing more than $35 million to expand production of prefilled flush syringes at a facility in Columbus, Nebraska, the company said Monday.
-
The investment will add around 50 jobs at the site and equip BD to make hundreds of millions of additional units a year to meet growing demand from U.S. hospitals and health systems.
-
BD framed the spending as part of an ongoing commitment to its Posiflush line, which has seen it invest more than $80 million to expand production of the syringes over the past three years.
Dive Insight:
Healthcare professionals use flush syringes to stop vascular access systems from becoming blocked and to help remove medication that is left at the catheter site. The resilience of the industry’s supply chain came under scrutiny when Cardinal Health’s 2021 recall of Monoject devices led to a shortage that persisted in 2023 and drove the FDA to share strategies for conserving the devices.
Against that backdrop, BD has increased its U.S. Posiflush production capacity. The company said it has grown capacity by 10% this year, bringing its total U.S. output of the prefilled flush syringes to above 750 million units.
Last year, BD added new needle and syringe production lines at plants in Connecticut and Nebraska as part of a more than $10 million investment. The latest investment comes three months after BD said it would invest $2.5 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next five years.
This week’s $35 million commitment is part of a series of vows by companies to invest in manufacturing in the U.S. amid the threat and imposition of tariffs. Yet BD has warned that tariffs are actually causing it to relocate some production from the Nebraska plant to overseas facilities.
BD CEO Tom Polen explained how tariffs are moving some production out of the U.S. at an event hosted by Goldman Sachs in June.
“Historically our flush syringes always came out of Columbus, Nebraska, and we would ship those to China. We have a facility now in China that’s going to source just for China for that,” Polen said. “I think there’s more downside to tariff impacts from a U.S. manufacturing perspective in the medtech industry than there are in many others.”

Duke observed growth in both electric and natural gas revenues, resulting in a notable 4.8% year-over-year increase in overall topline to $7.5 billion, exceeding the Street’s expectations by a significant margin.
However, this growth wasn’t completely translated into bottom-line gains due to a surge in operating and maintenance expenses and interest expense. While its adjusted EPS increased by 5.9% to $1.25, it fell short of the consensus estimates.

When it comes to facilitating payments, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin will be supported through the acquisition, Ripple said, as well as the cryptocurrency XRP. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $611 million since its December debut.
XRP rose 4.3% on Thursday to $3.07, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Still, the third largest digital asset by market cap has slumped 2.4% over the past two weeks.
Ripple has been ramping up activity in the payments space, with the passage of stablecoin legislation last month expected to supercharge the sector as big banks step in.

Ripple itself has moved toward the traditional banking system, with CEO Brad Garlinghouse saying that the company filed for a banking license with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in July. The company is already subject to oversight from New York regulators.
Earlier this year, Ripple acquired the crypto-friendly prime brokerage Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, while aiming to serve institutional clients on a larger scale. It was among the most highly valued deals in Ripple’s history.",9042058e021a2e9968b42c8d00cd6a8d,trafilatura,2348,0

But the largest higher education policy and lobbying organization in the U.S. said the wording of the memo was vague. The American Council on Education also said it may be illegal for schools to collect the data on race that the White House seeks.
The move is the latest effort in the Trump administration's effort to dismantle affirmative action policies at universities. It has launched dozens of investigations and threatened to cut off funding to schools that promote diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
According to the memorandum, a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling knocked down the use of affirmative action in college admissions, but universities have skirted that decision by relying on ""diversity statements"" students provide in applying that indicate their race. The White House now wants schools to show they are complying.
The U.S. Department of Education said in a statement that Education Secretary Linda McMahon had directed the National Center for Education Statistics to collect from universities data on the race and gender of their applicant pool, on the students admitted and of all enrolled undergraduates. Jonathan Fansmith, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, which represents 1,600 member schools, said collecting such data was illegal under the very Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action.
""You can't consider race in admissions, so schools don't collect data on race from applicants,"" Fansmith said. ""This seems to be an effort to get institutions to provide information that we don't have and that we can't collect.""
But a senior Trump administration official said the administration's understanding of the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action was that nothing in it ""prohibits the collection of demographic data as long as such data is not used in admissions decisions."" The official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The official went on to say that the administration expected universities to block access of their admissions officials from any data on the race of any applicant.",89a07b4f46b159b5763013c0a02176ff,trafilatura,2346,0

Shares of Firefly Aerospace — trading under the ticker symbol FLY — opened at $70 a share Thursday on its debut day on the Nasdaq.
Just last week, Firefly said it had planned to sell 16.2 million shares at a range of $35 to $39. A new regulatory filing on Monday came with a much higher range of $41 to $43. The company ended up raising $868 million from the IPO after selling 19.3 million shares at $45.
The hearty reception follows fellow space exploration play Karman's (KRMN) impressive start to the public markets this year. Its stock is up around 60% since its February debut.
""This company is not aspirational — it's operational,"" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told me on Yahoo Finance. An electrical engineer, Kim joined Firefly in October 2024 from Boeing's (BA) satellite segment, Millennium Space Systems.
Firefly is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. Its lunar lander Blue Ghost successfully touched down on the surface of the moon in March. The company's new Eclipse reusable rocket is expected to launch sometime in 2026, joining the already proven Alpha rocket in the portfolio.
Firefly remains an early-stage company, as its prospectus makes clear. The company boasts $1.1 billion in backlog, essentially business that may (or may not) become sales in the future.
It also lists partnerships with Elon Musk's SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, NASA, Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Space Force.
But the business is likely to lose money for the foreseeable future as it builds out technical capabilities and looks to generate profitable demand for its rockets.
For the six months ended June 30, Firefly estimated in its prospectus that it will lose between $95 million and $97 million on an adjusted operating basis. That would be on sales of $70.4 million to $71.4 million.
Firefly posted an adjusted operating loss of $190.6 million in 2024, up from a $123.9 million loss in 2023.

That’s because XRP whales have been booking profits since the cryptocurrency peaked at $3.65. They’ve sold $6 billion worth of XRP since mid-July, Santiment data shows.
Market data from CryptoQuant also backs it up with massive outflows from large wallets, a clear sign of coordinated offloading by whales.
“Unless we see sustained positive whale flows [greater than $15 million per day], the market may remain structurally weak,” CryptoQuant analysts said. “At present, there is no sign of consistent accumulation from large holders, a key component of a constructive trend reversal.”
If the pattern holds, a massive price correction could be imminent for XRP.
Even Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen offloaded $26 million worth of XRP last month. Ripple created XRP to facilitate cross-border transactions.
The last time whales booked profits en masse, XRP fell 40% after climbing as high as $3.36 in January.
On Thursday, XRP traded slightly above $3, a 4% uptick in the last 24 hours. Its price is still down 18% from its all-time high in July.
XRP’s structural weakness appears to be a common theme for altcoins.
Bitfinex analysts previously told DL News that the altcoin market doesn’t yet have the “sustained capital and structural demand” needed to trigger massive price gains and that until the situation changes, altcoin rallies will remain “short-lived and vulnerable to broader market pullbacks.”
Despite the ominous signs, traders are piling into optimistic bets on XRP perpetual contracts. Perpetuals are futures contracts without expiries.
Data from Coinglass shows almost twice as many traders are long on XRP shorts compared to those who bet on a price fall for the cryptocurrency. That’s a much larger ratio of bullish to bearish bets compared to the data from Bitcoin and Ethereum, where the split is much narrower.
On the options side, traders seem to have converged on $3.20 as an important price level for XRP, with more than $8.4 million in trading volume at that price mark for short-term contracts expiring at the end of August.

Palantir's Strong FCF Results and FCF Guidance
Palantir's $1.004 billion Q2 revenue, up +48% Y/Y and +13.6% Q/Q, was powered by strong AI-driven activities, including strong growth in its software contracts in the U.S.
In addition, Palantir raised its revenue guidance to a range of $4.142 billion to $4.150 billion. That is up from $3.8 billion to $3.902 billion projected in the Q1 release, an increase of +7.68% using the midpoints of the ranges.
Free Cash Flow. More importantly, Palantir's adjusted free cash flow (FCF) and FCF margins exploded. The company generated $568.8 million in Q2 adj. FCF, up +53.6% from $370.4 million in Q2.
Moreover, this Q2 FCF represented 56.7% of the $1.004 billion in revenue, up from a Q1 adj. FCF margin of 41.9%.
In addition, Palantir raised its full-year 2025 adj. FCF guidance to between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, up from $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion in its Q1 release. That midpoint represents a +11.8% forecast increase for the full-year.
That also implies its adj. FCF margin in the second half would be 46.3% of revenue.
For example, the $4.146 billion midpoint revenue forecast minus $1.886 billion H1 revenue implies H2 revenue would be $2.26 billion. And H2 FCF could be $1.9 billion in the full-year midpoint forecast for 2025, minus $935.146 million in H1 adj. FCF. That equals an implied H2 adj. FCF of $964.5 million.
In other words, the H2 adj. FCF would be 42.7% of H2 sales (i.e., $964.5 million/$2.26 billion). That is slightly lower than the full-year forecast margin (i.e., $1.9b adj. FCF/$4.146b = 0.458, or 45.8%).
Forecasting FCF for 2026
As a result, we can forecast significantly higher FCF in 2026. For example, analysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance are projecting $5.33 billion in sales.",b1fec005a469aa6c0e6ae4ab05f14251,trafilatura,2315,0

The dollar posted slight gains on Tuesday on some mild short covering after last Friday’s and Monday’s losses. Higher T-note yields on Tuesday were supportive of the dollar. Also, Tuesday’s news that showed the US Jun trade deficit shrank to a 1.75-year low was bullish for the dollar.
The dollar gave up most of its advance Tuesday after the Jul ISM services index unexpectedly declined. Also, dovish comments late Monday from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly were bearish for the dollar when she said the time is nearing for Fed interest rate cuts with the labor market softening and no signs of tariff-induced inflation. The dollar still has a negative carryover from last Friday’s weaker-than-expected US payroll and ISM manufacturing reports, which bolstered speculation that the Fed may cut interest rates as soon as next month.

Also, questions about the Fed’s credibility are weighing on the dollar after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler resigned last Friday, which could prompt President Trump to nominate a new governor who is more dovish and could undermine Fed Chair Powell’s influence.
The US Jun trade deficit shrank to -$60.2 billion from -$71.7 billion in May, better than expectations of -$61.0 billion and the smallest deficit in 1.75 years.
The US Jul ISM services index unexpectedly fell -0.7 to 50.1, weaker than expectations of an increase to 51.5. The Jul ISM services prices paid sub-index unexpectedly rose +2.4 to a 2.75-year high of 69.9, versus expectations of a decline to 66.5.

The offering, which is only open to qualified institutional buyers, comprises $1 billion of so-called Convertible Senior Notes due in 2029, and another $1 billion of notes due in 2032.
The firm says it will use the funds raised for general corporate purposes, such as investments in and acquisitions of other companies, and to buy back shares and previously issued debt.
It comes as Coinbase’s second quarter earnings report revealed a 25% drop in income from the previous quarter, 6% below analysts’ expectations.
Coinbase shares dropped 10% on the news, adding to a 24% drawdown since the stock hit an all-time high of above $444 on July 18.
Coinbase declined a request for comment.
Higher rates
Coinbase conducted a similar debt offering in September 2021, raising $2 billion by issuing senior notes due in 2028 and 2031.
The round was oversubscribed, with at least $7 billion in offers for the bonds, Bloomberg News reported at the time.
Coinbase agreed to pay just under a 3.4% interest rate on the 2028 notes and slightly over a 3.6% rate on those due in 2031.
The interest rates and terms for the latest debt raise will be determined upon pricing of the offering, the firm said.
But the rates will almost certainly be higher than the previous offering. That’s because it’s uncommon for private companies to raise debt at a lower interest rate than the US federal funds rate, which currently sits at 4.25% and 4.5% compared to the 0% to 0.25% rate during Coinbase’s previous debt offering.
Issuing shares
Coinbase said the debt will be convertible into cash or shares at the firm’s discretion. This means that Coinbase could issue more shares between the offering and when the notes expire to reduce its debt burden.
Investors are often wary of firms issuing more shares as it dilutes their ownership and can negatively impact share price.
Coinbase said it expects to attach capped call transactions to the debt that it sells, which the firm says should reduce the issuance of new shares from any future debt conversion.
Coinbase shares are down 2.5% on the day.

The stock closed at $60.35, valuing the company at roughly $8.5 billion. Shares initially opened at $70 under the ticker symbol FLY.
Space technology has gained momentum in recent years as companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX amass more funding and government contracts. Firefly is the third space company to go public this year after Voyager Technologies and Karman Holdings.
The rocket and lunar lander maker priced shares late Wednesday at $45, above its expected range of $41 to $43, raising $868 million. Earlier this week, Firefly had hiked its range up from the $35 to $39 it initially expected.
Firefly's customers have included a growing list of key defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and L3Harris, and the company recently received a $50 million investment from Northrop Grumman. Last month, Firefly also won a $177 million contract with NASA.
""It's all about execution,"" CEO Jason Kim told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday. ""We're focused on rating up our alpha rockets because there's so much demand for the response of dedicated one-ton launches from national security, commercial, as well as hypersonic missile testing.""
Earlier this year, Firefly's Blue Ghost lunar lander successfully touched down on the moon in a mission funded by NASA. Firefly is also widely known for its Alpha rocket and has said in its initial public offering filing that its backlog totaled about $1.1 billion at the end of March.
In its IPO filing, Firefly said revenue in the latest quarter jumped sixfold to $55.9 million from $8.3 million. However, the company reported a net loss of about $60.1 million, up from $52.8 million in the year-ago period.
Beyond just space, the tech IPO market has started to heat up this year after an extended dry spell due to high inflation and rising interest rates. Figma, Circle and CoreWeave have all debuted in 2025 and seen their stocks pop.

The move is expected to enhance the efficiency and reach of drone-based delivery systems for various operations including package delivery.
The proposed rules aim to streamline the use of drones by removing the need for individual waivers or exemptions previously required for BVLOS operations.
This change will broaden the application of drone technology across sectors, including manufacturing, farming and the movement of products.
US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated: “Our new rule will reform outdated regulations that were holding innovators back while also enhancing safety in our skies.
""It's going to change the way that people and products move throughout our airspace... so you may change the way you get your Amazon package, you may get a Starbucks cup of coffee from a drone.
“Industry needs this rule to make sure they can use this technology that's going to allow them to do business more efficiently and effectively.""
The proposed rules are expected to bolster Amazon’s efforts, which resumed testing of drone deliveries in two locations in Texas and Arizona in early 2025, as reported by Reuters.
The introduction of drone deliveries represents Amazon's ongoing effort to provide customers with a swift and seamless shopping experience.
The e-commerce giant has set a target to deliver 500 million packages annually by drone by the end of 2030.
The e-retailer recently enhanced its drone delivery service, allowing customers in select areas to have lightweight items delivered in less than an hour.

The Wedbush Securities global head of technology research on Thursday launched a unisex fashion line with Snow Milk, a Brooklyn-based brand specializing in thrifted, upcycled and new, numbered clothing. The shirts and other items will let followers of Ives — known for his eccentric clothing as well as his bullish view on tech stocks — to mimic his unique sartorial choices.
""I dress differently. I go to the beat of a different drum, but it's just like I do in terms of picking stocks,"" Ives told CNBC ahead of the launch. ""The clothing is symbolic of just the way that I attack investing.""
The line includes a long-sleeve button-down and short-sleeve polo covered in graffiti-inspired designs. One piece has a portrait of Ives on the sleeve, sporting sunglasses and a hat.
Items can be purchased online, as well as in pop-up stores in cities including New York and Los Angeles. Ives is based in New York while Wedbush is headquartered in L.A.
Ives' collaboration with Snow Milk marks the streetwear brand's first partnership with someone from the world of finance, according to a press release. Ives said it was important to find a brand that brings the same originality and authenticity to clothing as he does to financial research.
With Wall Street firms allowing more flexibility in workwear, Ives said this felt like the right time to officially break into fashion. Fans have long asked for him to make clothes or to provide advice on where to shop in hopes of building a similar wardrobe.
""It's not just cookie cutter, Brooks Brothers suits,"" Ives, a frequent guest on CNBC, said of today's Wall Street fashion.
Ives said this could be the first of many product drops that ultimately form a clothing line. Down the road, Ives said he'd like to expand into garments like sweatshirts and accessories such as hats.
The well-known tech analyst has long said his clothing choices help him make market calls that sometimes seem idiosyncratic. Now, Ives said he hopes the clothing pieces inspire others to similarly make bold decisions in both fashion and investing.
""In my decades on CNBC, viewers have seen my fashion evolve along with my view of tech stocks,"" Ives said. ""This is just another step in that journey.""",8fdaf6b465ddbd48a2a9a994f87f0ec8,trafilatura,2284,0

President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) accounts to invest in alternative assets, including private equity, real estate and digital assets, CNBC has confirmed.
The price of bitcoin climbed around 1% to reclaim the $116,000 level for the first time since July 31. Ether rose almost 4%, also retaking a one-week high.
Crypto-linked stocks were trading off their highs as the stock market rally fizzled in afternoon trading. Coinbase and Galaxy Digital were last higher by 1.5% each, and ether treasury stock Bitmine Immersion gained almost 4%.
Widespread inclusion of bitcoin in Americans' retirement accounts has long been viewed as a holy grail for crypto adoption. Conceivably, it would make the cryptocurrency a mainstay of U.S. financial infrastructure, expand access and encourage longer-term investing in the asset. The retirement market is currently worth $43 trillion, almost $9 trillion of which is held in 401(k) plans. The crypto market cap is nearly $4 trillion today.
""That's a monster pool of capital. What we're seeing … [is] the aperture of being able to buy crypto being widened and widened, [and] more avenues bringing people into the tent,"" Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday.
""When it becomes commonplace — when you can do it at the place you've already been doing business with, if its Fidelity or T. Rowe Price or whoever it is — you just pull more people into this ecosystem,"" he added.
Fidelity in 2022 became the first retirement plan provider to offer investors the option to put bitcoin in their 401(k)s, but the service hinges on employer adoption. Adoption since then has been low given that year's rate hike-driven bear market, lingering regulatory risk from the previous administration, as well as general caution and skepticism from investors.
The executive order, first reported by Bloomberg, is the latest in a series of efforts under the Trump administration to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the world."" In July, he signed stablecoin legislation known as the GENIUS Act into the first official U.S. crypto law.",caf7151ad2022b2c0e2fe5f08d14fef9,trafilatura,2258,0

The outflows follow July's record-breaking performance, when nine spot Ethereum ETFs claimed the top 10 spots in monthly ETF performance rankings with 48% returns, according to FactSet data. The profit-taking comes as Ether retreated from recent highs, recently trading at around $3,583.

ETHA Leads Exodus
BlackRock, Inc.'s (BLK) iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the exodus with $375 million in outflows on Aug. 4 alone, according to Farside data. The fund, which attracted $4.2 billion in inflows during July's rally, saw its five-day outflow total reach $112.8 million.
The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) posted $78 million in outflows over the five-day period, the data show. The fund had drawn $619.2 million in July flows during the crypto surge.
Meanwhile, the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) experienced $75.7 million in outflows, while the firm's larger Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) lost $43.2 million, according to Farside data.
Broader Crypto Retreat Pressures Funds
The outflows coincided with Ether's 5% decline over the past week, though the cryptocurrency remains up 40.5% for the month and 7.5% year to date, according to CoinMarketCap data.
The selling pressure extended across the sector. The Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) saw $40.3 million in outflows on Aug. 1, while the VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV) lost $5.2 million over the period, the data reveal.
Smaller players also felt the pressure. The Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET) experienced $5.4 million in outflows, while the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF (QETH) lost $8.4 million, according to Farside data. The 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (CETH) posted $7 million in outflows over the period.

The ETF industry saw 45 issuers debut last year and is on pace for 50 new ones in 2025, according to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, who shared the data in a post on X.
“It's where the fish are biting,” Balchunas said.
FactSet data analyzed by etf.com show 289 unique issuers as of August 2025, up from 252 in 2024, which puts the projected number of new issuers closer to 60 by year's end.
A Large Appetite for Niche Strategies
The explosion of new ETF issuers represents the fact that there is investor appetite for ETFs, and firms are eager to meet that demand, Zach Evens, analyst of passive strategies at Morningstar, told etf.com. He added that a lot of the ETF launches from new issuers have been in non-traditional or niche strategies.
“These types of strategies attempt to capture a specific market, or trade, and deliver select clients the specific exposures they desire,” Evens said, adding that many of the issuers use options to achieve those exposures.
Examples include covered-call and derivative-income ETFs, including single-stock funds: Derivative-income strategies saw more than $29 billion in net flows in the first six months of the year, and it was the top category for all active ETF flows, according to data from Morningstar. Other examples are leveraged or inverse ETFs—also sometimes with single-stock funds—crypto-related ETFs and defined outcome or buffer ETFs.
Many of these ETFs are relatively expensive compared to index ETFs, which lowers the bar for profitability, Evens added.
Relative Ease for New ETF Issuers
Another trend behind the surge of new ETF issuers is that it’s now relatively easy for firms to launch new ETFs with the rise in white label providers like Tidal Financial and ETF Architect, which handle much of the administration and operations associated with launching and running an ETF, Evens said.
That means that, while there’s more demand, there’s also more ability for firms to meet that demand.

The executive order directs the U.S. Secretary of Labor to review fiduciary guidance on private market investments in 401(k) and other defined contribution plans that are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. The federal law sets minimum standards for most retirement plans.
The executive order marks a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has pushed for greater adoption of private assets in defined contribution plans under Trump's second term in office. Though it also brings with it new risks for investors.
Bitcoin jumped Thursday in response to the news.
Private market assets have traditionally been excluded from 401(k)s, even as they've been embraced by pension funds and university endowments, because their high fees, lack of transparency and longer lockup periods make them riskier investments.
Yet, private market exposure in 401(k) plans was considered permissible in 2020, when the Department of Labor under the first Trump administration issued an information letter saying it could be appropriate for defined contribution plans under certain conditions. The guidance was later affirmed by the Biden-directed agency.
Its presence has already grown. Asset managers and plan sponsors have created products for retirement vehicles in which Americans collectively hold roughly $8.7 trillion in assets, according to data on 401(k)s at the end of the first quarter of 2025 from the Investment Company Institute.
In June, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said it's launching a 401(k) target-date fund in the first half of 2026 that will include a 5% to 20% allocation to private investments. In May, Empower, the country's second-largest retirement plan provider, said it's joining asset managers such as Apollo to start allowing private assets in some accounts later this year.
BlackRock and Apollo both traded higher earlier Thursday, but the stocks gave up those gains. BlackRock closed down 0.7%, while Apollo shed 3.3%. KKR fell 1.6%.

However, it caught the eye of one of the members of my investing club who wanted to know if you could apply an options collar – my favorite risk management strategy – to an inverse exchange-traded fund. And specifically to the UltraPro Short QQQ -3X ETF (SQQQ), which aims to move in the opposite direction of the Nasdaq-100, but with triple leverage applied. Wow.
After I got over the initial mind bending, it made a lot of sense. As with most hedging approaches, the money is made (or saved) by being out in front of the trouble.
More News from Barchart
And in this case, I don’t see it as a hedge as much as a way to try to exploit the potential for the market to finally crack again. Using an options collar on the SQQQ ETF is a way to reduce the risk associated with cracks in the Nasdaq-100 without missing out on high after new high in hot big tech stocks.
Let’s dig in and see what there is to offer here.
A Trade That Sounds Like Ordering Coffee
“I’ll have an ETF, inverse, triple levered, and collar it, please.” They’ll kick me out of the local coffee store if I try that one. But that’s exactly the order here. We’re looking at buying SQQQ, which will fly in a market decline and drop hard in a market rally.
Let’s remember what a collar does. If the stock market falls, SQQQ goes up, and life is good, at least for this trade. If the market rises a lot from here, say through year end, SQQQ will sink hard. Ah, but that’s what the put option side of the collar is for. You see, the principle is the same as a regular collar trade. The goal is to first protect against a bad outcome, and offset some of the cost of that insurance by selling a covered call option. In this case, the roles are reversed, in that SQQQ falling means an up market, not a down market, for stocks.
The charts don’t tell us much here, but this is less about timing the chart. The market is showing signs of weakness, and this is a way to try to profit mightily from it getting worse. I suspect most investors have plenty of long equity exposure, so this is a different avenue. But with limited loss should the market keep rising.",c55f52b682e978d34a7b347b3e75a04b,trafilatura,2230,0

TOKYO (Reuters) -Blackstone said on Wednesday it would launch a $3.5 billion offer to take TechnoPro Holdings private, the latest in a series of deals that have helped push M&A dealmaking to record levels in Japan this year.
The world's largest alternative asset manager is offering 507.4 billion yen, or 4,870 yen per share, for TechnoPro, a 17.4% premium to its closing average for the past three months.
Global private equity firms are competing to close deals to take Japanese companies private, following management reforms to tackle low valuations.
Blackstone was up against rival private equity powerhouse Bain Capital in the final round of bidding for engineering staffing firm TechnoPro, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Last week Swedish investment firm EQT announced a $2.7 billion tender offer for lift-maker Fujitec, while in February KKR took software developer Fuji Soft private after a protracted bidding war with Bain.
Blackstone is looking to expand aggressively in Japan, one of the people said. The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The TechnoPro acquisition marks Blackstone's seventh in Japan and its third private equity deal in 2025, it said in a press statement.
Real estate has also been a major focus for investors. In December 2024, Blackstone acquired a central Tokyo office and hotel complex for 400 billion yen in a deal it said was the biggest property investment by a foreign investor in Japan.
Bain and KKR, meanwhile, are part of three rival groups preparing to bid for brewer Sapporo Holdings' real estate business at a sale price also expected around 400 billion yen, according to two sources familiar with the matter, Reuters reported last week.
Shares in TechnoPro closed down 2% at 4,876 yen. The Nikkei business daily reported the plan late on Tuesday, saying Blackstone would offer a price below 4,900 yen.
The tender offer is expected to commence on August 7.

(Reuters) -Peloton Interactive forecast 2026 revenue above estimates and said it would cut 6% of its global workforce to boost cost savings under an ongoing turnaround effort, sending the exercise-bike maker's shares more than 11% higher.
The company also posted a surprise fourth-quarter profit on Thursday and said it will ""adjust prices"" to offset the impact of extra costs associated with tariffs.
It expects a $65 million hit from tariffs on 2026 free cash flow, the latest U.S. company to brace for uncertainties around how the Trump administration's changing trade policies will affect sourcing, costs and demand.
The layoffs, along with plans to slash indirect costs and relocate some offices, are expected to help save an additional $100 million by the end of its next fiscal year, Peloton said.
As of Thursday, the company has already actioned about half of these savings via workforce reductions and expects to realize the rest over the coming months, CFO Liz Coddington said on the earnings conference call.
CEO Peter Stern, who joined the company in January from Ford Motor, had kicked off the turnaround effort to address a slump in sales of Peloton's high-end stationary bikes and treadmills following a boom during the COVID lockdowns, when people were looking to work out at home.
In a sign the cost push was bearing fruit, operating expenses fell 20% in the fourth quarter, while general and administrative expenses were down 33% from last year.
Gross margin from its connected fitness products such as technology-enabled home exercise machines rose 900 basis points to 17.3% from a year ago. Gross profit in the segment rose 96% to $34.4 million.
Peloton posted quarterly profit of 5 cents per share, compared with Wall Street estimates for a loss of 6 cents per share.
The company forecast 2026 revenue between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, higher than analysts' estimate of $2.41 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
Total revenue for the quarter ended June was $606.9 million. Analysts, on average, were expecting revenue of $579.80 million in the fourth quarter.

(Reuters) -Tinder-parent Match Group's second-quarter revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, buoyed by strong performance at Hinge and a renewed strategic focus under new CEO Spencer Rascoff.
Shares of the company rose about 10% in extended trading.
The company credited its revenue beat to the ongoing overhaul, which places greater emphasis on enhancing user experience, including the integration of an ""AI-powered core discovery algorithm,"" to attract and retain users.
""We're starting to see some of the early benefits from Match Group's AI initiatives. And improvements in recommendations and other aspects of user interaction,"" said M Science analyst Chandler Willison.
Despite the topline growth, Match Group reported a 5% decline in paying users to 14.1 million, reflecting broader headwinds in the online dating sector.
Industry peers, including Bumble, have also faced sluggish demand as persistent inflation and a perceived lack of innovation have prompted some consumers to step back from app-based dating.
In response, Match and Bumble have been focusing on user experience over numbers by introducing artificial intelligence features such as AI-enabled discovery to make it easier for users to improve their dating outcomes.
The company is seeking to revamp its brand image, with a stated goal to ""transform Tinder into a low-pressure, serendipitous experience designed for Gen Z.""
Match, which also owns Hinge and OkCupid, has rolled out new features such as its AI-enabled interactive matching product to cater to the Gen Z audience.
The company further said it plans to reinvest approximately $50 million in the second half of 2025 into strategic initiatives, including product testing at Tinder and geographic expansion for Hinge, Azar and The League.
For the second quarter, the company posted revenue of $864 million, above analysts' expectations of $853.6 million, according to data compiled by LSEG. This excludes a one-time charge of $14 million.
The company sees third-quarter revenue between $910 million and $920 million, above estimates of $890.3 million.

What Happened: In an interview on the Thoughtful Money podcast, Howell stated that global markets are at the highest liquidity levels since COVID, driven by factors like U.S. Treasury General Account drawdowns, foreign central bank easing, and China's massive stimulus.
The Federal Reserve is injecting liquidity through mechanisms Howell calls “not QE/QE” — short-dated Treasury issuance, reverse repo drawdowns, and bank funding programs.
This will peak by early 2026 before facing major strain.
A looming $40 trillion debt refinancing wave across all sectors, driven by zero-interest COVID-era debt maturing between 2026 and 2028, could trigger a significant liquidity crunch and market volatility.
Also Read: Here’s When You’ll Know If A Bitcoin, Ethereum Rally In Q4 Is Coming
Why It Matters: Howell compares today's cycle to the 1980s post-Plaza Accord era, noting a similar pattern of monetary easing and asset performance.
He expects continued equity outperformance in the near term, led by tech, followed by gains in commodities and small caps.
As monetary inflation rises, he recommends hedging with assets like gold, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), quality equities, and real estate.
He warns the cycle may end abruptly, similar to the 1987 crash, if central bank policies diverge or bond market stress resurfaces. 10-year Treasury yields, and repo market stress are the warning signs that Howell suggests taking note of.

Other additions include its first-ever Dallas Fort Worth International flights to Athens, Greece, and year-round nonstop service between Miami and Milan.
American is also extending service for next year's World Cup, from Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Dallas and between Dallas and Zurich, where soccer's governing body, FIFA, is based,. Those flights will run from May 21 to Aug. 4 of next year, a bid for more business travel and sports tourism.
Brian Znotins, American's senior vice president of network and schedule planning, told CNBC that the airline saw high numbers of customers from Argentina travel to Doha, Qatar, during the 2022 World Cup and that he expects even more to travel to the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.
He also said the airline is expanding its Europe service in a bet that customers would rather connect in a U.S. hub like Dallas or Charlotte, North Carolina.
""We took a fresh look at where the demand hotspots are in Europe and we continue to see strength in Italy and Greece,"" Znotins said. ""We continue to see high numbers of travelers connecting in Europe to get to places like Rome and Athens,"" so the airline is adding more options from U.S. hubs.
With Prague and Budapest service from American's hub at Philadelphia International Airport, he said many customers already fly into one city and out of the other for Danube River cruises and other tours.
American's unit revenue for domestic flights in the last quarter fell 6.4% from 2024, while trans-Atlantic revenue rose 5%.

(Reuters) -Frontier Group, parent of discount carrier Frontier Airlines, forecast a bigger-than-expected loss for the third quarter on Tuesday, as soft domestic travel demand weighs on fares, causing its shares to slump 13% in afternoon trading.
Several major U.S. carriers, including Frontier, scrapped their financial forecasts in April, citing uncertainty linked to President Donald Trump's broad tariff measures and government spending cuts, which pressured consumers to scale back travel plans.
Since then, while airline executives and analysts have said there are early signs of stability in demand, budget-conscious travelers remain cautious amid tighter household finances.
The summer season, traditionally the industry's most profitable period, is underperforming this year, with weak demand for standard economy seats, forcing airlines to slash fares.
""We believe that the entire industry is not making money"" on domestic fares in the domestic market, CEO Barry Biffle said on a post-earnings call.
The carrier expects its third-quarter adjusted loss per share to be between 26 cents and 42 cents, compared with analysts' estimate of an 11-cent loss, according to data compiled by LSEG.
Executives are betting that capacity cuts through this year will help firm up airfare and improve pricing power.
Frontier expects its third-quarter capacity to fall 3% to 5% from a year earlier, while fourth-quarter capacity to be flat.
It reported a net loss of 31 cents per share for the quarter through June, compared with a 14-cent-per-share profit a year earlier. Analysts estimated a loss of 27 cents.
Total revenue fell 4.5% to $929 million, compared with Wall Street expectations of $946.12 million.
""The airline is at the mercy of the price-sensitive leisure revenue environment, and non-fuel costs look likely to come under pressure in the quarters ahead,"" TD Cowen's Tom Fitzgerald wrote in a note.

Smashburger — the Denver, Colo.-based, fast-casual burger concept — announced Tuesday the promotion of Jim Sullivan from president to CEO. Sullivan has served as president of the company since February and is replacing Denise Nelson, who stepped down as Smashburger CEO in June.
Sullivan joined Smashburger in June 2024 as chief development officer before he was promoted to president earlier this year. Before that, he held multiple development leadership roles across the restaurant industry, including chief development officer at Qdoba and at CKE Restaurants.
""Jim brings decisive leadership, a clear vision, and a deep understanding of Smashburger's position in the market,"" Richard CW Shin, CEO and global chief finance and chief risk officer of Smashburger parent company, Jollibee Group International, said in a statement. ""He has already laid the foundation for a more focused brand that is delivering better food, a stronger guest experience, and renewed momentum across the system. With Jim at the helm, I believe we are entering a new chapter of opportunity for Smashburger—one rooted in a strong guest connection, and a relentless drive to win.""
As CEO of Smashburger, Sullivan will be tasked with leading the company through a brand repositioning, accelerating franchise development (especially in non-traditional locations), and focusing on reinvestment in the in-restaurant experience.
""Smashburger modernized the technique of smashing burgers, and we're reclaiming that leadership with intention and momentum,"" Sullivan said in a statement. ""Our bold flavor, elevated guest experience, and operational discipline give us a distinct edge in a crowded space. With the strategic support of JFC, we are leveraging scale and operational flexibility to drive focused, capital-efficient growth. This is a brand built on craveable taste tailored to today's consumer, and we're building it to perform over the long-term for our guests, our teams, and our franchisees.""

(Reuters) -Media conglomerate News Corp beat expectations for fourth-quarter revenue on Tuesday, driven by a rise in digital subscriptions and strong performance at its Dow Jones unit.
The company benefited from strong circulation and subscription revenues at its Dow Jones division, which includes brands such as The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, MarketWatch and Investor's Business Daily.
Dow Jones reported a 6.7% increase in quarterly revenue, with total average subscriptions to its consumer products rising 7% to nearly 6.3 million from a year earlier.
Finance chief Lavanya Chandrashekar said that digital circulation revenues grew by 10%, as more customers shifted from promotional to higher-priced packages.
""Their fiscal Q4 earnings, particularly the performance at Dow Jones, underline how valuable premium sources of news and information still are,"" Emarketer analyst Max Willens said.
Revenue at the news media segment, which includes UK's The Times and The Sun along with the New York Post, fell 3.7% due to soft advertising conditions.
The company announced earlier this week it plans a West Coast expansion with the launch of The California Post in early 2026.
News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson said that the company is not ""seeing any particular negative trends"" from new search formats and is in the ""midst of advanced negotiations with several AI companies.""
The company's book publishing unit, which consists of HarperCollins, saw its revenue fall 3.5% due to slower consumer spending and a weaker slate of new titles.
News Corp's digital real estate services unit, which includes its majority-owned REA Group, posted strong results driven by price increases, with revenue rising 4% in the fourth quarter.
Total revenue in the quarter came in at $2.11 billion, compared with analysts' estimates of $2.10 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
Excluding items, the company earned 19 cents per share, compared with an estimate of 20 cents.

Japan's second-biggest car maker said quarterly operating profit was 244.2 billion yen ($1.66 billion) in the April-June period, more than a fifth below the average estimate of 311.7 billion yen in a survey of seven analysts by LSEG.
Honda said the steep 27.5% tariffs on auto imports by the U.S. - comprised a previous 2.5% rate and a 25% levy imposed by Trump in April - pulled down its operating profit for the quarter by about 125 billion yen.
But the automaker said the impact from the tariffs on its full-year operating profit was smaller than it had estimated in May. It now expects a 450 billion yen hit for the year, compared to 650 billion yen forecast previously.
The company raised its full-year operating profit forecast to 700 billion yen from 500 billion yen, and said it expected the yen to trade at an average rate of 140 per dollar, five yen weaker than it had previously estimated.
Honda's reliance on the U.S. has deepened significantly in recent years, with the market making up 41% of its global sales in the first half of the year, up from 37% for the whole of 2024 and 26% for 2022.
The company calculated its forecast for the full-year tariff impact assuming that a reduced 15% U.S. rate on Japanese auto exports as agreed under a bilateral trade deal last month would come into effect in September.
Honda builds most of its cars for the U.S. in Canada and Mexico, while also shipping a few thousand a month to the U.S. from Japan. It expected to benefit more from U.S. tax exemptions under the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement than estimated previously.
It said it recorded a one-time expense of about 113 billion yen related to electric vehicles.

Shares of the company dropped over 10% in extended trading.
Despite seeing a rise in deliveries for its luxury electric vehicles, Lucid is navigating an uncertain time for the industry as U.S. import tariffs threaten to upend supply chains and raise the costs of vehicles by thousands of dollars.
The company has been aggressively striking deals with North American companies in order to domestically source critical minerals used in EV manufacturing amid a push by the Trump administration to reshore production and strengthen American manufacturing.
Lucid's fortunes rely heavily on the success of its newly launched Gravity SUV and the upcoming mid-size car, which targets a $50,000 price point, as the company looks to expand its consumer base.
Competition in the U.S. EV market is also stiff, with industry giant Tesla pushing sales of its revamped Model Y, and Rivian marketing its refreshed versions of the R1T truck and R1S SUV.
Lucid now expects to make between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles this year, compared to its previous forecast of 20,000 vehicles.
In order to diversify revenue streams, Lucid signed a deal with Uber last month, whereby over six years, starting in 2026, the ride-hailing platform will acquire and deploy over 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle technology from startup Nuro.
As part of the deal, Uber will invest $300 million in Lucid as the firms look to establish a foothold in the robotaxi market.
Lucid reported revenue of $259.4 million in the second quarter, missing estimates of $279.9 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.
On an adjusted basis, the company lost 24 cents per share, compared with estimates of a loss of 21 cents per share.

Sony sees a tariff impact of 70 billion yen, compared to 100 billion yen forecast in May. It said the estimated impact is based on tariff rates as of Aug. 1 and that the situation remained fluid.
Japanese companies such as Honda Motor have trimmed their expected hit from tariffs amid a reduction in uncertainty with Japan striking a trade deal with the U.S. last month.
Sony also said it sees a stronger profit outlook at its games business, boosted by sales of network services and favorable exchange rates.
Sony was once well known as a maker of household electronics such as the ""Walkman"" portable cassette player but has become an entertainment behemoth spanning games, movies and music as well as a leading maker of image sensors for smartphones.
The group reported a 36.5% rise in operating profit to 340 billion yen for the April-June quarter, beating the 288 billion yen average of eight analyst estimates compiled by LSEG.
Shares in Sony, which announced results during the midday trading break, jumped 5%.
Sony sold 2.5 million PlayStation 5 game consoles in the first quarter, a 4% rise compared to the same period a year earlier.
Quarterly operating profit at the games business more than doubled to 148 billion yen due to higher sales of network services and games not made by Sony.
The console industry was set to receive a boost this year from the launch of ""Grand Theft VI"" but the latest addition to the popular series has been delayed to 2026.
Nintendo, which is seen as a potential beneficiary of GTA 6's delay, last week reported robust early demand for its new Switch 2 gaming device.

E.l.f. sources 75% of its products from China. Back in February, Amin told CNBC his company could ""maintain our extraordinary value and address the tariff issue,"" saying E.l.f. has adjusted to tariffs in the past and that it now has a larger international business.
Amin told Cramer that E.l.f. has been working on ""optimizing"" its supply chain, adding that a few years ago 100% of production was done in China. He said the company is diversifying suppliers less because of tariffs and more to meet ""the strong global demand we have for our brands.""
""International was the fastest-growing part of our business this past quarter, or, actually, the last few quarters,"" Amin said. ""So, really, to be able to meet that demand, we'll continue to diversify,"" Amin said.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer put under the spotlight. When a caller highlighted that the stock is receiving some hate despite the fundamentals looking good after the recent quarterly earnings announcement, Cramer commented:
“You know, you raise a great point. I mean, it has come down a great deal. When I saw it was down 23, I said, wow, they’re really taking the wood to this thing. And it’s a very, you know, it’s a very highly valued stock… Just give it that wide berth as you know, because you’re club members, you know, that’s how we think and that’s how I think you can build that position to the right size, right into the weakness.”

Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) provides streaming entertainment, including TV series, films, documentaries, and games across multiple genres and languages. The company’s content is accessible through multiple internet-connected devices. When a caller asked for advice on the stock during a June episode, Cramer responded:
“I mean, they are going to be the entertainment channel, so to speak, for the world. It’s worth $542 billion, that makes sense to me. I don’t want to double down because I think you might get an intraday swing at a point where you can buy some. But I’m not going to go against this company, which may be one of the best-run companies in the entire world, and I am not going to tell you to sell the stock.”

Here's how the company did based on average analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:
- Loss per share: 24 cents
- Revenue: $61 million vs. $55.2 million expected
The virtual care company's revenue increased 49% in its second quarter from $41.21 million a year earlier. The company reported a net loss of $5.31 million, or a loss of 24 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $10.69 million, or a loss of $1.40 per share, during the same period last year.
""It's a strategically consistent quarter for Omada, happening at an accelerated pace, which is nice,"" Omada CEO Sean Duffy said in an interview with CNBC. ""At the highest levels, there's just a huge spotlight on metabolic care right now.""
For its full year, Omada expects to report revenue between $235 million and $241 million, while analysts were expecting $222 million. The company said it expects to report an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, loss of $9 million to $5 million for the full year, while analysts polled by FactSet expected a wider loss of $20.2 million.
Omada, founded in 2011, offers virtual care programs to support patients with chronic conditions such as prediabetes, diabetes and hypertension. The company describes its approach as a ""between-visit care model"" that is complementary to the broader health-care ecosystem.
The stock opened at $23 in its debut on the Nasdaq in June. At market close on Thursday, shares closed at $19.46.
Omada said it finished its second quarter with 752,000 total members, up 52% year over year.
""The start gun of our next chapter just clicked, and we're running hard,"" Duffy said. ""It's been pretty fun.""

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching Closely. On August 4, BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $240.00 price target.
According to the firm, Apple may lose half of the $20 bn along with annual payment from Google if it is not required to pay Apple anything related to search.
“In our opinion, if Google is mandated to not pay Apple for anything related to search, then Apple could potentially lose half of the $20bn+ annual payment from Google. This amount is accounted for as part of Apple Services revenue (as Google TAC) and has a high drop-through to the bottom line (it’s a pure royalty type payment).

The firm believes the ruling would only apply to the US, and that Apple should be able to receive payment for search traffic sent to Google outside the US.
“We estimate that Apple may lose half of the $20bn since we believe the judge’s ruling would likely apply only in the U.S. (given the court’s jurisdiction) and we estimate about ½ of Google’s search Ad revenue comes from the U.S. Apple should still be able to get paid for search traffic sent to Google outside the U.S. In this scenario. We estimate that the potential loss $10bn+ would represent about 8% of Apple’s annual operating profit dollars.”

Global Markets revenue rose 28% quarter-over-quarter to $55.4 million despite a 22% decline in trading volumes, as Galaxy outperformed broader market trends, said brokerage KBW. The firm’s average loan book grew to $1.1 billion versus peer Coinbase’s (COIN) hitting $879 million.
Assets on Galaxy’s platform rose 27% to $8.9 billion, though adjusted gross profit in asset management fell 26% due to lower on-chain activity.
As expected, CoreWeave also exercised its final option to access an additional 133MW of compute at Helios, bringing the site’s total committed capacity to 800MW, the report said.
Galaxy separately agreed to acquire 160 acres of adjacent land, including a 1GW interconnection request, potentially expanding Helios’ capacity to 3.5GW.
The firm ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in total liquidity, including $1.1 billion in cash and stablecoins, and $1.3 billion in net digital assets. Corporate debt stood at $1.1 billion.
The company's digital asset holdings as of June 30 include 17,102 bitcoin valued at $1.8 billion versus 13,704 bitcoin valued at $1.3 billion six months earlier.
The third quarter is off to a strong start, said KBW, with record activity in July as Galaxy helped facilitate the sale of over 80,000 bitcoin and secured the final tranche of AI/HPC compute capacity at its Helios data center through a deal with CoreWeave (CRWV).
Shares are lower by 8% Tuesday alongside a selloff in crypto prices, with bitcoin shedding more than 1% to $113,000. The stock remains higher by 13% since listing on Nasdaq in May.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -United Airlines said a technology issue that led to a grounding of its flights for a few hours at U.S. airports and major delays across its network on Wednesday had been resolved.
""While we expect residual delays, our team is working to restore our normal operations,"" the airline said.
The technology issue prompted ground stops at several major United hub airports including Newark, Denver, Houston, and Chicago, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's website.
United said the problem related to its Unimatic system that houses information about each flight that is then fed to other systems, including those that calculate weight and balance and track flight times.
As of 10:25 p.m. ET (0225 GMT on Thursday), flight tracking data from FlightAware showed that 1,038, or 34%, of United flights had been delayed on Wednesday.
The FAA acknowledged the technology issue and said that it has offered full support to help address United's flight backlog.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a post on X that the issue was specific to United's operations, and was unrelated to the broader air traffic control system.
United said it was treating the technology issue as a controllable delay, meaning it would pay customer expenses such as hotels when applicable.
The carrier's problem came a few weeks after Alaska Airlines grounded all of its flights for about three hours due to an IT outage for the second time in just over a year.

The jury ruled that the plaintiffs proved that Meta violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act, according to a verdict form filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for Northern District of California.
The ruling stems from a class-action lawsuit dating back to 2021 against the health-tech company Flo Health and other businesses like Meta, Google-parent Alphabet and smaller data analytics firms.
Flo Health told users that ""their sensitive reproductive health information"" and survey questions would not be disclosed, but that personal data ended up being shared with companies like Meta and Google via their respective online ad-related tools known as software-development kits, according to a separate court filing.
Google and one of the analytics firms agreed to settle their claims prior to a jury trial that began in July, while Flo Health settled the day before the trial's conclusion on Aug 1. Meta chose to take the case to court and lost. The social media company is expected to appeal the verdict.
""This verdict sends a clear message about the protection of digital health data and the responsibilities of Big Tech,"" said lead trial lawyers Michael Canty and Carol Villegas of Labaton Keller Sucharow in a shared statement. ""Companies like Meta that covertly profit from users' most intimate information must be held accountable.""
A Meta spokesperson said the company disagreed with the ruling.
""The plaintiffs' claims against Meta are simply false,"" the Meta spokesperson said in a statement. ""User privacy is important to Meta, which is why we do not want health or other sensitive information and why our terms prohibit developers from sending any.""",a299d51c4f79ddf1741c29566acc2749,trafilatura,1819,0

-
Vertex Pharmaceuticals reported a Phase 2 trial of its experimental pain treatment missed key endpoints.
-
Because of the results, the drugmaker will no longer develop the medicine, called VX-993.
-
The news sent shares tumbling despite Vertex reporting strong quarterly earnings.
Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) sank 15% Tuesday, a day after the drugmaker announced a study showed its experimental pain medicine was not successful, and it would no longer move forward with its development.
The company said a Phase 2 trial of VX-993 ""did not result in a statistically significant improvement on the primary endpoint of the time-weighted Sum of the Pain Intensity Difference from 0 to 48 hours (SPID48) compared to placebo.""
Chief Medical Officer Dr. Carmen Bozic explained that the findings, along with other data on VX-993, indicated that the treatment was not expected to be superior to Vertex's other NaV1.8 inhibitors, so ""we will not be advancing it as monotherapy in acute pain."" The company was testing VX-993 as a follow-up to its NaV1.8 inhibitor drug, Journavx, which received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in January.
The news offset Vertex's better-than-expected second-quarter results. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.52, with revenue rising 12% year-over-year to $2.96 billion. Both exceeded estimates of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha.
Most of its sales ($2.55 billion) came from its Cystic Fibrosis treatment known in the U.S. as Trikafta.
With today's big selloff, Vertex Pharmaceutical shares hovered around break-even year-to-date.

The firm said investors shouldn’t be over-reacting to headlines surrounding Tesla’s recent Autopilot-related jury verdict in Florida. It believes the case is less significant than it seems.
“In our years covering TSLA, we’ve learned to ignore headlines related to Autopilot liability. But the robotaxi roll-out has breathed new life into this topic, and we feel compelled to comment on recent media intrigue. On Friday, when a jury in Florida found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash, headlines began proliferating, referring to a “stunning rebuke”, a “massive blow”, and a $243M obligation. In our view, these headlines paint an unrealistically negative picture. In short, we don’t think shareholders should be losing sleep over this.”

""While we expect residual delays, our team is working to restore our normal operations,"" the airline said.
The technology issue prompted ground stops at several major United hub airports including Newark, Denver, Houston, and Chicago, according to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's website.
United said the problem related to its Unimatic system that houses information about each flight that is then fed to other systems, including those that calculate weight and balance and track flight times.
As of 10:25 p.m. ET, flight tracking data from FlightAware showed that 1,038, or 34%, of United flights had been delayed on Wednesday.
The FAA acknowledged the technology issue and said that it has offered full support to help address United's flight backlog.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a post on X that the issue was specific to United's operations, and was unrelated to the broader air traffic control system.
United said it was treating the technology issue as a controllable delay, meaning it would pay customer expenses such as hotels when applicable.
The carrier's problem came a few weeks after Alaska Airlines grounded all of its flights for about three hours due to an IT outage for the second time in just over a year.
In April 2024, Alaska grounded its entire fleet due to an issue with the system that calculates the weight and balance of its planes.",2453f3ea9e1bb08a2883350b81a05fe9,trafilatura,1570,0

The company’s deployed hashrate remained steady at 35.5 EH/s, while average operating hashrate inched up 1% to 30.2 EH/s as a result of uptime improvements across its Rockdale, Corsicana, and Kentucky sites.

""We have partnerships with Brookfield and also with Nvidia – these are our big partners for this gigabit factory,"" CEO Tim Hoettges said in a call with reporters following the company's second quarter results.
Although discussions with North Rhine-Westphalia about building the data processing center in the state are ongoing, a final decision has yet to be made.
""This is where we currently see our factory. But, of course, that could still change during the selection process,"" Hoettges said, adding that the company would proceed as quickly as possible once a decision is reached.
The company is looking at existing production sites where electricity and water regulatory approvals are already in place, Hoettges said.
""Discussions are happening here, for example with RWE,"" he said.
In May, the Bonn-based company said it had teamed up with SAP, web hosting firm Ionos, and unlisted retailer Schwarz, but in June it was reported the companies would submit separate EU bids instead.
Hoettges dismissed media reports that it had been in talks to join such a consortium.
""It's a good thing that there is competition in Germany,"" he said.
