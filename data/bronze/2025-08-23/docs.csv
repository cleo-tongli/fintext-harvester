At just 30 years old, the California-born-and-raised entrepreneur has achieved what many will spend their lifetimes chasing. In April, Guo's net worth soared to $1.3 billion after her first business, Scale AI, wrapped up a deal with tech giant Meta that valued the company at $25 billion. She was named the youngest self-made woman billionaire, a title previously held by pop star Taylor Swift.
""Honestly, I still feel the same as that little girl, like my life pre-money and post-money, it hasn't really changed that much,"" Guo told CNBC Make It in an interview.
Guo co-founded Scale AI, an AI data labeling company, alongside Alexander Wang in 2016. Guo, who headed up the operations and product design teams at the Silicon Valley startup, left the company in 2018.
""We had disagreements around products and sales,"" Guo explained. ""Where Alex was very sales-driven on bringing in more customers, I was very focused on like 'hey, we need to prioritize the products or helping make sure that scalers [employees] get paid on time, their hours are being counted correctly, but that wasn't where the resources were being poured in.""
However, Guo held on to her stake, which is worth just under 5%. When Meta agreed to acquire 49% of Scale AI, the deal pushed Guo's stake to a skyrocketing $1.25 billion.
""I think most people could have work-life balance if they cut out what most people waste their time on when they get back home.""Lucy GuoFounder and CEO of Passes
A serial entrepreneur and a graduate of the Thiel Fellowship program, Guo wasn't out of the game for long and founded Backend Capital, a venture capital firm investing in early-stage tech startups in 2019. Her most recent company, Passes, a content creator monetization platform founded in 2022, has raised over $65 million in funding.
Since becoming a billionaire, Guo hasn't taken her foot off the work pedal. ""I am still working very long work days,"" she said.
'I have more hours in a day'
Guo belongs to a category of founders who optimize their days to be as productive as possible, and her newfound billionaire status isn't an excuse to slow down.
An average day for Guo includes waking up at 5:30 a.m. and going to Barry's Bootcamp for two workout sessions back-to-back. Lunches are a luxury for the startup founder, and she often eats during meetings as her schedule doesn't always allow for a break, she said.
""I think most people could have work-life balance if they cut out what most people waste their time on when they get back home, which is, a lot of people doom scroll on TikTok, a lot of people just sit and watch TV mindlessly,"" she said.
In the interest of work-life balance, Guo gives herself one day off on the weekends, where from noon to 6 p.m., she's totally focused on spending time with her friends, and then it's back to work straight after.
""I think I have more hours in a day because I'm gonna be honest, I'm totally blessed. I don't need that much sleep…even though I'm working these long hours, I feel like I have work-life balance.
""I could theoretically work until midnight, and then I could go out to the club until 2 a.m., and then I could go to sleep, and then wake up at like 6 a.m. and do Barry's.""
The young founder embodies the Silicon Valley mantra of working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, similar to China's infamous 996 work culture, which includes working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week.
""9 a.m. to 9 p.m., to me that's still work-life balance,"" Guo commented. ""At 9 p.m., you can go to dinner with your friends. You can invite them to a potluck. You don't need to sleep from nine to nine. That's a ridiculous amount of sleep.""
""If anyone thinks that's not work-life balance, I don't know what to say because you literally have 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. to hang out with your friends, and then you sleep from 2 a.m. to nine. That's seven hours of sleep, which is more than enough.""
But not everyone agrees with the pursuit of a 996 work schedule. Some founders previously pushed back against the trend, telling CNBC that the views are outdated and unnecessary to achieve success.
An always-on culture decreases retention and creates a revolving door of talent, Sarah Wernér, co-founder of Husmus, told CNBC.""
Suranga Chandratillake, general partner at Balderton Capital, added that 996 is about ""a fetishization of overwork rather than smart work…it's a myth.""
New founders need to work 90-hour weeks
Startup founders' working hours are a much-contested issue. Recently, some venture capitalists were even pushing European founders to step up the work pace to keep up with their counterparts in the U.S. and China.
""In general, when you're first starting your company, it's near impossible to do it without doing that [996], like you're going to need to work like 90-hour work weeks to get things off the ground,"" Guo said.
As a company grows, hires more talent, and finds stability, Guo says it is possible to work less later on.
She noted that becoming a billionaire isn't about intense working hours. If you consistently invest hundreds of thousands into the S&P 500, it could grow to billions by the end of your lifetime, according to Guo.
""I don't think you need to work those hours to become a billionaire, per se. It's how you opt to do it. If you opt to start a tech company, you're gonna be working those hours in the beginning. If you're like, main method is doing it via investing, you're not gonna be working those hours,"" she said.
Guo's latest startup, Passes, became embroiled in controversy in February after a class action lawsuit was filed against her and the company, alleging that she distributed child sexual abuse material on the platform to paying subscribers.
""I think it's a total shakedown. I never met this person, never talked to this person,"" Guo said about the lawsuit.
A spokesperson from Passes told CNBC Make It via email: ""As explained in the motion to dismiss filed on April 28, Ms. Guo and Passes categorically reject the baseless allegations made against them in the lawsuit, which was only filed against them after they rejected a $15 million payment demand.""
Clark Smith Villazor, the New York-based litigation firm that brought the lawsuit against Passes, has yet to respond to CNBC's request for comment.",d1e52e6d93a43bc641935e462339d315,trafilatura

The southern European country is still leading growth in the euro zone with annual gross domestic product forecasted to rise 2.5% this year, while the economies of France, Germany and Italy are respectively forecast to expand 0.6%, 0% and 0.7%.
Spain's GDP surpassed expectations in the second quarter, growing 0.7%, above a Reuters forecast of 0.6%. The growth was also higher than the previous three months, which levelled at 0.6%, data from the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) showed.
""For the second year in a row, we will be the advanced economy number one in terms of GDP growth,"" Spain's Finance Minister Carlos Cuerpo told CNBC in April.
""Spain is a great outlier now in terms of growth. It's also a great place to invest,"" he added.
The success of Spain's economy relies on high consumption and investment, as well as tourism, Next Generation European funds, and immigration.
""It's not just tourism, it's also non-tourism services. We're exporting more in terms of services to firms like IT, accountability services, financial services, than we're exporting in terms of tourism — 100 billion euros [$116.8 billion] with respect to 94.95 billion [euros in tourism]. So that's an element of modernization of the Spanish economy,"" said Cuerpo.
Despite this economic growth, several challenges await Spain, such as keeping pay in line with the rising cost of living, climate change, an ever more divided political scene and the fact the country has the highest unemployment rate in the EU.
""What is going to happen with tariffs and international trade, especially in an economy like Spain, where exports of goods have increased considerably over the last 15 years?"" said Cardoso.
""The second challenge is that the savings rates remains relatively high. A third source is this low investment rates. And finally, how to decrease the government deficit and public debt.""
Immigration and tourism boom
Still, tourism in Spain represents around 12% of the country's GDP, as it benefits from the pandemic rebound, and cheaper prices compared to other Western European nations.
The sector's success has sparked backlash from local communities over the influx of people visiting historic and popular sites, particularly during the peak summer months. Last year in June, protesters in Barcelona were seen spraying travellers with water guns and shouting ""tourists go home.""
The sector can also count on its growing workforce of nearly 3 million people as of 2024, a progression of 9.7% compared to 2023.
Job creation is also supported by high immigration. While other European countries are closing their borders, Spain is planning to welcome nearly a million migrants over the next three years, through work visa schemes and the granting of residence permits to undocumented workers.
""90% of the increase in the labour force since 2021 comes from immigration,"" BBVA Research's Chief Economist Miguel Cardoso told CNBC.
""This is allowing the service sector to expand. This is keeping firms relatively competitive in terms of containing the increase in labour costs, and it's allowing, for example, the prices in services to remain relatively contained in a high inflationary environment.""
Las year, most people migrating to Spain came from Colombia, Venezuela and Morocco.
""Latin American economies, some of them are not doing relatively well, so there is this push factor. There is also the fact that immigration to the United States has become more difficult, and therefore people are turning around and seeing alternatives,"" added Cardoso.
Spain's economy has also been bolstered by the European Union's Next Generation EU funds which has made 163 billion euros available to Spain, through grants and loans. The country is the second biggest beneficiary of this pandemic recovery assistance, following Italy.
Spain's Cuerpo told CNBC that 70% of the grants — 55 billion euros — have already been dispersed.
""This was a program that was designed in part to try to help with the recovery after the pandemic,"" said Cardoso.
""So the government prioritized investment projects that they already had a plan for, and therefore they are having a relatively low multiplying effect within the economy.""
Nonetheless, the Spanish government aims to use these funds in sectors such as non-tourism services exports, including renewables.
Low energy costs
Since investing in green energy in the 2000s, Spain has benefited from low energy costs and has seen less impact from the European energy crisis that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
""The increase in the renewable share in the electricity mix over the past five, six years has implied a drop of 40% in wholesale electricity prices,"" Cuerpo said.
Low production costs are an attractive criterion for companies, particularly foreign investors, who also supply the sector.
Photovoltaics tracker company Arctech, founded in China in 2009, opened its European headquarters in Madrid in 2024. Photovoltaic cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. It's a burgeoning renewable energy source that can lead to lower electricity costs.
""Spain is probably the location in Europe where the most PV has been done,"" Arctech's EU and NA Markets General Manager Pedro Magalhaes told CNBC.
""The solar ecosystem is really here [in Spain], from the junior engineer, all the way to the funds that are investing in these large assets.""
The company now boasts 17 branches outside China, and is planning to expand in Eastern Europe, as well as plans to diversify into storage solutions.
""Things are happening here. We use the port of Valencia to import and distribute to many locations in Europe,"" Magalhaes added.
Like Arctech, many foreign companies are planning to take advantage of the country's low energy costs.
Auto giant Stellantis teamed up with battery manufacturer CATL in late 2024, announcing plans to build a $4.3 billion lithium iron phosphate battery plant in Zaragoza, northeastern Spain.
Foreign direct investment in Spain is strong too, with the country ranking as the fourth most attractive country in the EU for investors. China alone declared it will be investing up to 11 billion euros in Spain in 2025, as it gears up for a record 33 new projects in the country.
""When you look at where does that investment come from, the largest investor in Spain is U.S.,"" said Cuerpo.
""But we're also attracting investment from other parts of the world, including China, on specific sectors related to renewables, to sustainable mobility as well, and this is of course, always part of our economic security agenda.""

On average, surveyed Americans, asked ""What age should you be"" for retirement, said 58, according to a recent report by Empower, which polled 1,001 adults on June 2.
That's much younger than the current typical retirement age. On average, as of 2024, men retire at age 64 while women retire at age 62, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

What to do with required retirement withdrawals when you don't need the money
Even at those average ages, workers may not have planned to retire. Many Americans, 58%, end up retiring earlier than they expected, according to a 2024 report by Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies in collaboration with Transamerica Institute.
Of those who retired early, 46% pointed to health-related reasons, 43% cited employment issues and 20% family reasons. Just 21% said they retired early because they are financially stable.
What you risk with an early retirement
For those targeting retirement at age 58, they may be ""looking at 30 to 40 years of not working,"" as people are living longer, said Carolyn McClanahan, a certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville, Florida.
If you decide to retire earlier, make sure you have enough saved to tide you over for that length of time, especially in case of economic downturns such as recessions, said McClanahan, a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.
""You may end up coming up short [or] not having enough money if you quit work too early,"" McClanahan said.
What's more, you need to consider health care, as Medicare typically kicks in at age 65 — if you stop working at age 58, you'll need to come up with health care coverage for those gap years.
Starting your retirement savings early and aggressively is key to making this goal happen. It's also crucial to know how much money you need to live on during retirement and how much you'd need to save to get there.
The ""magic number"" that surveyed Americans said they need to retire comfortably is an average $1.26 million, according to an April report by Northwestern Mutual.
While that figure is lower than the prior year's average of $1.46 million, many of those surveyed said they feel unprepared for retirement. More than half, or 51%, said they think it's somewhat or very likely they will outlive their retirement savings, according to the report.
Some retirees end up going back to work
Citing data from the Federal Reserve, a separate report by wealth management firm T. Rowe Price said 2.4 million Americans retired during the Covid pandemic. About 1.5 million of those retirees had gone back to work by March 2022.
More than half, or 52%, of workers said they plan to work at least part-time in retirement, according to a March report by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. About 80% of respondents who plan to work in retirement or past age 65 said it was due to financial reasons.
Some adults simply ""have a lot of trouble retiring,"" said Gloria Garcia Cisneros, a certified financial planner at LourdMurray, an investment and wealth management firm.
Garcia Cisneros said she has clients that have the option to retire but still work a few hours a week at jobs that don't require a lot of them, are not hard on their body and are ""not for the money.""
""We don't just turn off and then live half of our life just doing nothing,"" said Garcia Cisneros.
Overall, working for slightly longer can be beneficial; by delaying the year you start collecting Social Security benefits, you reduce the risk of outliving your savings.
For example, say there's a 62-year-old who earns $100,000 per year, already has $900,000 saved for retirement and expects to spend roughly $65,000 per year in retirement, according to the T. Rowe Price report.
If that person retires at age 62, there's a 64% chance they will not outlive their funds in retirement, researchers wrote. But if they retire at age 65 instead, there's a 92% chance they won't outlive their savings.",d72afb839437e8bf6cb7f3e04b2f7573,trafilatura

The S & P 500 has risen almost 10% so far in 2025, while the Nasdaq Composite is higher by more than 11% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is ahead more than 7%. Stocks have climbed even as policy changes, from President Donald Trump's higher tariffs to his extension of tax cuts from his first term to immigration limits, have spurred concern over the health of the economy and the state of consumer spending. Hiring has slowed meaningfully in recent months, while inflation has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target . ""The economy and markets have been telling diverging stories: macroeconomic data point to an incrementally weakening environment, while the S & P 500 has posted positive year to date performance after April's significant low,"" strategists and economists led by Ariana Salvatore wrote in a report earlier this week. The Morgan Stanley strategists attributed the diverging paths for the economy and the market to the varying impacts that the specific policy changes have had on different sectors of the market, and those segments' differently weighted share of the total S & P 500 market capitalization. Their conclusion is that while the policy shifts have added macroeconomic concern, stock investors are assessing the impacts on a company-by-company and sector-by-sector basis rather than keying on broad brush concerns. Limited market cap weight ""For example: tariffs are a clear headwind to margins for certain industries, but the overall market cap weight of these groups is limited,"" Salvatore wrote. ""In short, the negative impacts (e.g., tariffs, immigration) are concentrated in sectors that do not represent a significant portion of S & P market cap, while the tailwinds (e.g., taxes, deregulation) are more dispersed among a broader cohort that drives index-level performance."" The broad picture implies an ""incrementally weaker"" macroeconomic environment in the future, but without a recession, Salvatore said. In that climate, equities as a whole should continue to outperform, with the brunt of the negative impacts from policy shifts concentrated in consumer discretionary stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Sectors that ought to remain resilient include industrials, driven by artificial intelligence tailwinds, as well as semiconductors. ""Although the on-again-off-again tariff policies on the surface appear volatile, the economy is in the middle of an expansion and company fundamentals are solid with one notable exception, health care,"" where there's an existential threat to profit margins, said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management. Stocks have slowed as of late, with Microsoft, Netflix, Walmart and Apple all retreating this past week, and the S & P 500 sliding for five straight days through Thursday. On Friday, investors were encouraged by remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's annual economic symposium signaling that the central bank could lower interest rates as soon as next month. ""The recent activity is starting to play out true to seasonal and technical form – August and September have been the two worst performing and most volatile months over the last 20 years,"" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. ""It may prove to be that way again. The recent price action is a normal digestive phase in a secular bull market and is setting the stage for a great year-end rally.""",bb6dff39dbe59d4fc8ab4a943d53fc20,trafilatura

Look up the term ""recession specials"" through Google's search engine, and the list of results will include entries from the Great Recession nearly 20 years ago.
Consider this Grub Street article from 2008 slugged ""Recession Specials: Your Definitive Guide."" Or this 2009 story from The New York Times, which details the mealtime recession specials restaurants across New York offered as an act of survival.
Fast-forward to 2025 and a crop of establishments are once more hinting at a looming economic downturn.
When 'recession' returns as a selling point
Recession fears were heating up this spring as President Donald Trump rolled out a slate of tariffs in early April. The term ""recession indicator"" entered the vernacular of social media users as a tongue-in-cheek way of gauging a potential economic slowdown.
Businesses are now getting in on the joke as well. For instance, Brooklyn, New York coffee shop Clever Blend advertises a $6 gelato and espresso ""recession special.""
Wicked Willy's, a bar in Manhattan, got on board by offering a ""Recession Pop Party"" earlier this month, with one caption on an Instagram post declaring: ""The recession is BACK! Get ready to dance and party all night long!""
Market Hotel, a Brooklyn concert venue, advertised a similar event. ""From The Fame to Animal, Circus to Rated R, we're serving economic anxiety with a side of electro-pop, bloghaus, and auto-tuned glam,"" an Instagram caption for the event read. ""Dress like rent's due and you're dancing through it.""
But the trend doesn't just stop in New York. Super Duper, a burger chain with 18 locations across the San Francisco Bay Area, tapped in earlier this year with its own ""Recession Burger,"" a seasonal special introduced in the summer.
""THE ONE THING THAT DIDN'T GET THE INFLATION MEMO: Meet the Recession Combo, our new Seasonal Special,"" a post from Super Duper's Instagram reads. The meal includes a ""Recession Burger,"" fries and a beverage for $10.
The idea for the burger's name didn't necessarily come from a desire to cash in on the buzzword, said Ed Onas, Super Duper's vice president of operations. Instead, he said, the moniker was derived from the Depression-era origins of the Oklahoma-style smash burger, which aimed to stretch ground beef by adding lots of sliced onions.
But once Super Duper established the burger's name, the chain decided to offer a discounted ""Recession Combo"" for $10. This would save customers $5 from the normal price of the add-ons, Onas said.
""That's kind of where the name of the burger plays in … And we figured, we're calling it the 'Recession Combo,' why don't we just offer a deal that makes it a really good value for our guests?"" Onas told CNBC in an interview. ""Inflation has kind of been going on, and we figured it's a nice offer for a short amount of time for our guests.""
This extra-value combo meal was an exception for Super Duper, which normally doesn't offer such deals. The burger went viral in a local San Francisco subreddit, with a post gaining 1,400 upvotes and 170 comments.
""Obviously, we were happy about it. We didn't realize that it was going to get as much attention as it did,"" Onas said. ""We were happy, and our guests were happy, and at the end of the day, that's what it's all about.""
As a testament to the burger's overwhelming success, Onas told CNBC that Super Duper will be adding it onto its menu as a permanent fixture going forward.
Shedding light on waning consumer sentiment
These small businesses getting in on the trend could be a broader reaction to waning consumer confidence. Consider that the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index came in at 58.6 in August, down from a reading of 61.7 in July and reflecting a 13.7% change on a year-over-year basis.
This souring in sentiment has been driven primarily by concerns over trade policy, said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan.
""What's very clear from the consumer sentiment data is that consumers are broadly bracing for a slowdown in the economy and a deterioration — not just with inflation, expecting inflation to get worse — but they're also expecting businesses conditions to deteriorate,"" she said. ""They're expecting labor markets to weaken and unemployment rates to go up. And what you're seeing with these businesses could be a reaction to that.""
A lack of consumer confidence — and trust in income reliability — will ultimately lead to a pullback in spending, Hsu added.
""Young people are feeling just as bad about the economy as older folks, and in some months they feel even worse than older folks,"" she said. ""Across the age distribution, people agree that the trajectory of the economy has soured.""",9cc34b443690af75abcfde697a0d8a65,trafilatura

For the first year, Time Out included the 10 best cities for Gen Z to live in, according to them.
The survey of over 18,500 people from around the world and across all age groups was filtered to pull the responses of people born from 1997 to 2012 to rank the best cities for Gen Z to live in. The categories surveyed were food, nightlife, culture, affordability, happiness, livability and overall city vibe.
""The fact that our readers rated these cities so highly around the world is really exciting,"" Rossilynne Culgan, Things to Do Editor at Time Out New York, tells CNBC Make It. ""Knowing that there are these places that readers really love and feel a lot of passion about is exciting. It creates a roadmap to places to add to maybe your own bucket list to go and see.""
Of the cities in the top 10, the United States only had one ranked: New York City.
According to the Time Out survey, the Big Apple took the No. 4 spot and was rated highly for walkability, nightlife, food scene, and eating out options and culture, which includes art, live music, performances, and shows. On the other hand, only 46% of Gen Z respondents said it was an affordable place to live.
""I think New York needs to keep doing what it's doing. It's a very exciting place to live, according to Gen Z, and I have to completely agree with them. Being able to be in a place where you have that excitement, where you have culture and any time of day you can go out and find something fun to do is really special and I think really unique for New York,"" Culgan says.
The 10 best cities for Gen Z, according to Gen Z
- Bangkok, Thailand
- Melbourne, Australia
- Cape Town, South Africa
- New York City, United States
- Copenhagen, Denmark
- Barcelona, Spain
- Edinburgh, United Kingdom
- Mexico City, Mexico
- London, United Kingdom
- Shanghai, China
Bangkok, Thailand, is the No. 1 city for Gen Z, thanks in part to its high scores in happiness. 84% of Gen Z say they are happy living there, and 71% said it's a budget-friendly city to live in.
The estimated monthly costs for a single person is 20,141 Thai Bhat or roughly $617 not including rent, according to Numbeo.
The cost of living in Thailand is, on average, 45.9% lower than in the U.S. Rent in Thailand is also, on average, 68.8% lower than in the U.S.
Gen Z says the No. 2 best city to live in is Melbourne, Australia. Dubbed Australia's culture capital by Time Out, 77% of Gen Z described the city as diverse and inclusive and 96% gave it high ratings for the city's art and culture scene.
Melbourne also ranked highly for quality of life, with 91% of Gen Zers saying the city is ""good"" or ""amazing.""
The cost of living in the Australian city for a single person is 1,703 Australian Dollars or roughly $1,094, according to Numbeo.
Melbourne is 32.9% less expensive than New York, excluding rent. On average, rent is 61.3% lower than in New York.

The move comes after Abrego Garcia, who in March was wrongfully deported to an infamous prison in El Salvador, was released from a jail near Nashville, Tennessee on Friday. He had been held there since he was returned to the United States in June to face federal human smuggling charges, which he denies.
In the new filing, Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that the Trump administration offered on Thursday to deport him to Costa Rica, after serving any sentence imposed by the court, if he agreed to remain in jail until Monday and plead guilty to both counts in the criminal indictment.
Abrego Garcia declined to prolong his stay. His attorneys write that ""within minutes of his release"" on Friday, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement representative informed them that ""the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda,"" ordering him to report to ICE's office in Baltimore on Monday morning.
His attorneys allege that the Trump administration is effectively forcing Abrego Garcia to choose between pleading guilty and being deported to Costa Rica, or being deported to Uganda.
""On Friday evening, the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning—precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office—to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,"" his attorneys say.
""There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,"" Abrego Garcia's lawyers write.
His attorneys say in the filing that the administration's threat of deportation to Uganda supports their motion to dismiss the smuggling charges on account of vindictive and selective prosecution.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the new filing.
Abrego Garcia was detained by ICE on March 12 and deported to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador three days later in what the Trump administration has since called an ""administrative error.""
A U.S. judge in 2019 barred Abrego Garcia from being deported to El Salvador because of concerns that he would be persecuted there.
Abrego Garcia's case has become a flashpoint of the Trump administration's strict immigration playbook. The administration has alleged that Abrego Garcia has ties to the notorious MS-13 gang, an accusation that he denies.
A trial on the federal human smuggling charges is scheduled for January.",cf1d4e9da34c1ce4347a3f67a8322598,trafilatura

The remarks are likely to reinforce market expectations that the central bank will resume a rate hike cycle, which was put on pause due to concern over the fallout from U.S. tariffs on the export-reliant economy, later this year.
Despite Japan's dwindling working-age population, wage growth remained stagnant for decades due to ""entrenched deflationary expectations"" that discouraged companies from raising prices and pay, Ueda said at a panel held on Saturday during the Federal Reserve's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
Now, wages are rising and labor shortages have become ""one of our most pressing economic issues,"" as global inflation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic served as an external shock that broke Japan out of a deflationary equilibrium, he said.
""Notably, wage growth is spreading from large enterprises to small and medium enterprises,"" Ueda said.
""Barring a major negative demand shock, the labor market is expected to remain tight and continue to exert upward pressure on wages,"" he said.
Ueda spoke as part of a panel including Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde addressing labor market challenges developing in their economies.
Japan has seen three straight years of high wage increases in annual spring wage negotiations between companies and unions.
Labor mobility has also risen from historically low levels as the younger generation in particular searches for better-paying jobs, forcing companies to increase pay as they compete for workers, Ueda said.
""In sum, demographic shifts that began in the 1980s are now producing acute labor shortages and persistent upward pressure on wages,"" Ueda said.
""They are also driving significant adjustments on the supply side of the economy - through higher participation, increased mobility, and capital-labor substitution,"" he said.
Such forces will complicate the relationship between labor market conditions, wages and prices, he added.
""We will continue to monitor these developments closely and incorporate our assessment of evolving supply-side conditions into the conduct of monetary policy,"" Ueda said.
After exiting a massive, decade-long stimulus last year, the BOJ raised interest rates to 0.5% in January on the view Japan was on the cusp of durably achieving its 2% inflation target.
The BOJ kept rates steady in July but revised up its inflation forecasts and offered a less gloomy outlook on the economy, keeping alive market expectations for a rate hike this year.
While consumer inflation has exceeded the BOJ's target for well over three years, Ueda has vowed to go slow in hiking rates as underlying inflation - or price rises driven by domestic demand - remains short of 2%.
But stubbornly high food inflation and prospects of sustained wage growth have led some BOJ board members to warn of second-round price effects that could warrant another rate hike, a summary of the bank's July meeting showed.
Nearly two-thirds of economists polled by Reuters in August expect the BOJ to raise its key interest rate by at least 25 basis points again later this year, up from just over half a month ago.",5f3f5d68340d45bfc623aa042c13445f,trafilatura

Mixed Q2 earnings results elicit mixed opinions among the analysts.

Colorado-based company, Civitas Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CIVI) is an independent exploration and production company. The company focuses on oil and liquids-rich natural gas operations in the DJ Basin of Colorado and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. It takes pride in being Colorado’s first carbon-neutral oil and gas producer.
Civitas Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CIVI) saw mixed results in its Q2 2025 earnings. The company’s total revenues of $1.1 billion fell short of estimates and dropped 19.5% year-over-year, primarily because of lower oil price realizations and a decline in sales volume. Despite these operational headwinds, the company demonstrated proactive financial management by exceeding its full-year 2025 asset sale target. It also signed agreements to sell non-core DJ Basin assets for $435 million. The proceeds from the sale are set for debt reduction.
Analysts’ opinions are also mixed, with CNN recording 9 out of 18 analysts assigning a Buy rating to the stock while the rest are sticking to a Hold rating. Upside potential stands at 38.64%.
The significantly high dividend yield of 6.33% enhances Civitas Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CIVI)’s appeal to high-yield seeking investors. Insider Monkey database noted 41 hedge funds holding stakes in the company, reflecting strong institutional confidence.

Its Unusual Options Activity Revealed Several Trading Strategies . ,SoFi Stock Dropped 12 % in 2 Days . Its Unusual Options Activity Revealed Several Trading Strategies . ,2025-08-23 01:00:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"SoFi Technologies (SOFI) had good news for investors yesterday. The fast-growing fintech announced that it was getting into the international money transfer business by the end of 2025.
SoFi members will be able to send funds abroad through the SoFi app. Partnering with Lightspark, an enterprise infrastructure provider that utilizes the Bitcoin Lightning Network, to send and receive money. SoFi believes it is one of the first U.S. banks to offer a blockchain-powered remittances service.
Despite the good news, its shares trade well below where they opened Tuesday morning. The international money transfer business will be another revenue stream for the company. More importantly, it’s another product for members to use, creating stickier, more engaged members. It’s a win/win.
In Wednesday’s trading, SoFi had eight unusually active options with Vol/OI ratios ranging from a high of 57.71 to a low of 1.36, evenly split between puts and calls.
Here are three options strategies to use, whether you’re bullish or bearish about SOFI stock.
The Long Straddle
This strategy involves buying a call and a put at the same strike price and expiration date. The long straddle is a bet that volatility will pick up in the future, but you’re not sure in which direction.
The only long straddle available from the eight unusually active options is the Nov. 21 $20 call and put.
The net debit for the two options is $5.98, or 26.55% of its closing share price of $22.52. To make money here, SOFI stock must move up 15.4% or down 37.7% in the next 93 days.
The last time SOFI stock traded at $14.02 was in early June. It’s unlikely to fall this much over the next three months unless it reports poor earnings before expiration. Last year, SoFi reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 29, so it’s possible, but unlikely, for the share price to fall by nearly 38%.
However, SoFi reported excellent Q2 2025 results at the end of July, suggesting that its business continues to get stronger, making a move to the upside much more likely, hence the 39.3% profit probability.
The Long Strangle
This strategy involves buying a call and a put at a lower strike price. Both have the same expiration date. The long strangle, like the long straddle, is a bet that volatility will pick up in the future, but you’re not sure in which direction.
Three of the four put options from yesterday’s unusual options activity expire on Sept. 19 in 30 days—the strike prices: $17.50, $19.50, and $20.50. There is only one call option expiring on Sept. 19, the $24.50 strike.
There are several pros and cons to doing a long strangle with a wider spread between the call and put strike prices. Further apart, they’ll cost you less, and since the maximum loss is the cost of both the call and put, you have less capital at risk.
However, on the downside, you’ll need a bigger move over the next 30 days to profit from this bet, which lowers the odds of making money, but if the big move happens, you’ll generate a higher return.
Inversely, doing a long strangle with a closer spread will cost you more, but the move needed to break even or make money is smaller. It’s a tradeoff.
Referring back to the table earlier with the eight unusually active options, the $17.50 put expiring on Sept. 19 had an ask price of $0.19, the $19.50 put had an ask price of $0.43, and the $20.50 call had an ask price of $0.68.
Given the $0.81 ask price for the $24.50 call, the net debits are $100, $124, and $149. The net debits as a percentage of yesterday’s closing price of $22.52 are 4.44%, 5.51%, and 6.62%, respectively.
The Barchart Technical Opinion is a Strong Buy, indicating a very good chance that SOFI stock will continue to move higher in the near term. Based on this bullish indicator, I would consider the put strike that needs the lowest percentage move to break even.
That would be the $17.50 put, which needs a $2.98 move (13.2%) to breakeven [$24.50 call strike price + $1.00 net debit - $22.52 closing price]. Note, this means that the breakeven price on the downside is $16.50, or 26.7%. That’s far less likely to come to fruition.
The Bull Put Spread
This strategy is a bet that the share price will increase in value. It involves selling a put option and buying a put at a lower strike price. Both have the same expiration date. The bet has a limited profit and loss.
Based on yesterday’s three unusually active put options, you have three possibilities: sell $20.50 put / buy $19.50 put, sell $20.50 put / buy $17.50 put, and sell $19.50 put / buy $17.50 put.
The net credit (maximum profit) of selling the $20.50 put and buying the $19.50 put is $21. [$20.50 put bid price of $0.64 - $19.50 put ask price of $0.43]
The net credit (maximum profit) of selling the $20.50 put and buying the $17.50 put is $45. [$20.50 put bid price of $0.64 - $17.50 put ask price of $0.19]
The net credit (maximum profit) of selling the $19.50 put and buying the $17.50 put is $23. [$19.50 put bid price of $0.42 - $17.50 put ask price of $0.19]
The maximum loss for the three bull put spreads are $79 [$20.50 put strike - $19.50 - net debit], $255 [$20.50 put strike - $17.50 put strike - $45 net debit], and $177 [$19.50 put strike - $17.50 put strike - $23 net debit], respectively.
Which would you play?
I would go with selling the $20.50 put and buying the $19.50 put, which has the highest maximum profit percentage [maximum profit divided by maximum loss] of 26.6% and the lowest risk/reward ratio [maximum loss to maximum profit] of 3.76 to 1.
Lastly, its breakeven is $20.29 [$20.50 put strike - $0.21 ask price], 9.9% lower than yesterday’s closing price.

By session’s end, the token had regained $0.24, reinforcing the $0.23–$0.24 band as a zone of support and accumulation.
The rebound comes as broader macro conditions favor digital assets. The Federal Reserve has kept rates below 2%, with markets increasingly pricing in cuts that could provide short-term momentum for crypto.
Institutional developments are also strengthening sentiment. Global payments network SWIFT launched live blockchain trials featuring Hedera, while asset manager Grayscale filed a Delaware trust for HBAR — a move viewed by some as laying groundwork for a future ETF.
Together, these factors highlight rising institutional interest in enterprise blockchain infrastructure. As central banks and financial institutions accelerate testing of tokenized settlement systems, Hedera’s positioning within global payments is gaining attention. HBAR’s latest recovery may signal more than intraday volatility — it reflects growing confidence in Hedera’s role in digital finance.

Getting laid off later in life can undermine retirement security, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Boston College’s 2012 to 2022 Retirement Study.
Of Americans aged 50 to 65 — many of whom would be Gen X, born between 1965 and 1980 — 14% were laid off once in the previous 10 years, according to the study. And nearly a quarter of those (24%) weren’t able to find a new job.
And older workers who do manage to find a new job? They may have to accept a low-ball offer to stay employed — especially during a period of economic instability and jobs cuts related to AI and automation.
Kevin Cahill, an economist at FTI Consulting, told WSJ that, based on a forthcoming study he co-wrote, older workers who find new jobs take, on average, an 11% wage cut.

What’s going on with Gen X?
There’s a perfect storm of factors that’s making it harder for Gen X to move ahead in what should be the most successful and highest-paying years of their career.
Boomers aren’t the only ones facing ageism. An AARP study found that 64% of workers over age 50 had witnessed or experienced age discrimination in the workplace.
For example, 33% of respondents said there’s an assumption in their workplace that older workers aren’t as tech savvy as their younger counterparts, whether that’s accurate or not.
Another challenge — and one highlighted by the 11% wage cut — is that some employers may simply be unwilling to meet their salary expectations. It’s a common lament by Gen Xers that they’re “overqualified” for a position, yet there aren’t as many senior-level positions available that they would be qualified for.
At the same time, they’re passed over for leadership roles because they’re considered too old.
As a recent article in Fortune points out, instead of passing the baton onto the next generation, “baby boomers are skipping over Gen X in favor of promoting younger talent into their spots.”
Sometimes they’re even paid less than their younger (and less qualified) counterparts. In a Resume Now survey of workers aged 40 or older, 49% said they earn less money than younger colleagues who do the same job.",dfcc8492889a8655f1f377f9c848e8f2,trafilatura

The approval marks a significant step in Gemini’s EU strategy, enabling the firm to roll out its trading products and services to customers in more than 30 European jurisdictions, the company noted.
Europe's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which came into effect this year, is the EU’s first region-wide crypto rulebook, designed to harmonize digital asset oversight across member states and provide legal clarity for firms operating in the sector.
Gemini has been steadily building its regulatory base in the region. In May, the company secured a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) license to offer derivatives. That was followed by the launch of tokenized stocks in Europe a month later.
The crypto exchange said the MiCA license underscores its long-standing focus on compliance as it looks to introduce additional offerings, including derivatives, to both retail and institutional clients in Europe.
Gemini is also among several crypto companies that are looking to go public. Last week, the firm said it had hired Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Cantor as lead bookrunners for its planned IPO.

Michael Burry is Betting Big on This 1 S&P 500 Stock That’s Down 40% in 2025
Walmart stock has been in favor with investors over the past four months. Despite the post-earnings decline, therefore, it remains up nearly 23% versus its year-to-date low on April 7.
Walmart Stock to Climb on Market Share Gains
Michael Zakkour, founder of retail consulting firm 5 New Digital, believes Walmart has evolved into the preferred retailer for value consumers, which could indeed help the NYSE-listed firm grow its market share in the months ahead.
“Walmart is winning on the back of value consumers and value consumers are across the board now, from top of the economic chain down to the bottom,” he told CNBC in a post-earnings interview on Thursday.
Additionally, the multinational’s tech investments remain a meaningful tailwind for WMT stock. In fact, Q2 marked another quarter of double-digit gains for Walmart.
A 0.96% dividend yield makes up for another great reason to own Walmart shares at current levels.
WMT Shares Are Well-Positioned to Weather Tariffs
Zakkour favors a bullish stance on Walmart stock also because all retailers are not in the same boat when it comes to navigating tariffs-related headwinds.
“Some are on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, and others are in a dingy,” he noted on “Squawk Box.”
According to him, the sheer size and global footprint of Walmart positions it rather strongly to absorb the macroeconomic uncertainty.
Finally, the high-margin advertising business makes up for another great reason to invest in WMT shares at current levels. In Q2, the ads business continued to grow rapidly and came in up 46% on a year-over-year basis.
Walmart Remains a ‘Buy’-Rated Stock
Despite weakness in Q2 earnings, Wall Street analysts agree with Zakkour on Walmart shares.
The consensus rating on WMT stock currently sits at “Strong Buy” with the mean target of nearly $113 indicating potential upside of roughly 15% from here.",b8ca38115bb50dd7bff429c736bfbe0e,trafilatura

-
The SEC has moved decision deadlines for several spot XRP ETF filings from mid-August to October.
-
These are deadline extensions, not approvals or denials.
-
Much of the ETF-related upside is already priced into XRP, so an approval-day pop is unlikely to be dramatic.
It was a big deal when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally approved the first spot Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024. Crypto investors also saw a sea change when the SEC gave the nod to Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) ETFs six months later.
These days, several fund manager firms are seeking approval for spot-priced XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) funds -- and the SEC is dragging its feet again. This week, regulators took one look at the waiting XRP ETF filings that were due for a decision and moved their deadlines to October instead.
A quick history of spot-ETF decisions in the crypto space
This calendar dance is nothing new. The SEC saw ETF decision deadlines looming for the Bitcoin and Ethereum funds many times over more than a decade of fund manager filings. Spot Bitcoin ETFs were launched in Canada three years before the American go-ahead. Fund manager Grayscale started its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEMKT: GBTC) as a mutual fund in 2013 and almost immediately started pushing the SEC to allow that fund's conversion into a proper ETF.
And yes, XRP-related filings have been piling up. For example, Grayscale launched an XRP Trust mutual fund in September 2024 and wants to convert this instrument into an ETF.
The SEC dug into a familiar bag of tricks to push back all the XRP ETF decisions again. Other applicants include Cathie Wood's Ark Invest, CoinShares, and Bitwise. Furthermore, the sweeping October delays apply to a few Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) ETF projects, a proposed spot-price Litecoin (CRYPTO: LTC) fund, and a Grayscale Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) ETF idea -- and more.
I'd rather have bricks than straw in the regulatory crypto framework
The Trump administration calls itself crypto-friendly, and the current regulators have indeed taken several blockchain-friendly steps in 2025. They won't just rubber-stamp every incoming request for cryptocurrency-based financial instruments, though. Careful review of each filing is still necessary, and I think the crypto sector will benefit from this policy in the long run.
I'd much rather see a late but robust crypto-trading framework than a brittle rush job. It's like building a house out of bricks instead of straw or sticks. Even a mild crisis or challenge could blow those unstable houses down, and then cryptocurrency investors are back to square one -- no enforceable trading rules to speak of.",7c725dabef3c204d25f784ddb3d56498,trafilatura

Shares of the food chain plunged Thursday as customer backlash and investor unease drove the chain’s worst losing streak in months.
Shares of Cracker Barrel (CBRL) tumbled more than 12% on Thursday, the steepest drop since April, before ending the session down over 7%. The drop erased over $90 million in market value.
The stock, down 16.47%, is on pace for its worst five-day stretch since Feb. 14, when it dropped 17.7%. Cracker Barrel’s stock fell to the $54 level.
Cracker Barrel Unveils New Simplified Logo: 'Our Story Hasn’t Changed'
Since May, Cracker Barrel, beloved for its Southern comfort food, front-porch rocking chairs and gift shop filled with knickknacks and old-fashioned sweets, has embarked on a $700 million transformation across its 660-plus restaurants.
The sweeping makeover includes ""decluttered"" dining rooms, a revamped menu and other changes aimed at updating a brand long rooted in nostalgia.
Cracker Barrel Executive Insists Restaurant Remodels Are 'What The Guests Asked For'
On Tuesday, the brand unveiled its new logo, which drops an illustration of a man resting his arm on top of a wooden barrel, a folksy image that has embodied the brand's southern hospitality for the last 56 years.
Cracker Barrel described the new logo as squarely anchored on the brand's ""signature gold and brown tones"" while incorporating ""the iconic barrel shape and word mark that started it all,"" the company said in a statement.
The statement added that ""farm fresh scrambled eggs and buttermilk biscuits"" served as inspiration behind the ""hues of a refreshed color palette.""
Critics say the rebrand is a risky move for a company already struggling with thin margins.
""Like Bud Light or New Coke, this is yet another example of how abandoning your brand and loyal customers is not the way to grow a business,"" Richard Stern, director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital.
Stern added that Cracker Barrel has consistently posted weak profit margins around 1.5%, ""roughly a third of what you’d expect from a successful restaurant.""
Stern argued that by chasing a new market, the restaurant chain has strayed from its roots.
""Their brand was partially the old-fashioned feel of an American general store, harkening to the pioneer west and the growth of rural highways,"" Stern added.",7f504621bc58530c38a74135448f500f,trafilatura

Chase is offering great welcome offers on its Sapphire Reserve cards, including the Chase Sapphire Reserve® and the brand new Sapphire Reserve for Business℠:
-
Chase Sapphire Reserve: Receive 125,000 points after spending $6,000 in the first three months.
-
Sapphire Reserve for Business: Earn 200,000 points after spending $30,000 on purchases in the first six months of account opening.
These huge sign-up bonuses follow Chase's announcement of massive updates to its flagship premium travel credit card, the Sapphire Reserve. The Sapphire Reserve updates include a slew of new features and benefits, as well as an annual fee increase to $795.
Important: Read more about the new Chase Sapphire card eligibility requirements to see if you qualify for a Chase Sapphire welcome bonus.
How much are these Sapphire Reserve credit card bonuses worth?
We calculate the value of Chase Ultimate Rewards points to be about 2.05 cents per point. That means 100,000 Chase points would be worth about $2,050 and 200,000 points would be worth about $4,100.
Keep in mind that you can redeem Chase points for a number of different things, but these values are based on redeeming your points for travel. Specifically, you can often get the best value from Chase points by transferring them to certain travel partners, such as World of Hyatt or Air Canada Aeroplan, for high-value redemptions.
What can I do with 100,000 or more Chase points?
Stretch your points at Hyatt Category 1 hotels
You can transfer Chase points to your World of Hyatt account and redeem them toward Hyatt stays. A standard night at a Category 1 Hyatt hotel costs between 3,500 to 6,500 points.
In the example above, you can stay 20 nights at the Hyatt Place Los Cabos — which is minutes from the beach and offers free breakfast — for less than 100,000 points. That’s an excellent way to spend a few weeks if you have the time to spare and like Los Cabos. It’s also a great way to work toward earning or maintaining World of Hyatt elite status.

Book premium flights
You can often get great redemption value by transferring Chase points to certain airline partners and booking premium (first or business class) flights. You should have a specific redemption already in mind, on hold if possible, before transferring your points to a partner, since you can’t transfer them back.
In the example above, you can book a business class flight with Emirates from New York (JFK) to Milan (MXP) for 87,000 miles plus $101.50 in taxes and fees. The cash price for this flight is $5,778, which gives you a redemption value of about a whopping 6.5 cents per point.

Score big redemption values on Hyatt luxury stays
You can also get excellent redemption value by redeeming your points toward luxurious hotel stays. For example, this one-night stay at the Park Hyatt Vienna costs $1,005.69 or 30,000 points. Redeeming your points on this stay would give you a value of about 3.4 cents per point, which is well above average.

Does a Sapphire Reserve card make sense for me?
For premium benefits
The updated Chase Sapphire Reserve is chock-full of benefits, including loads of new credits that can help offset the increased annual fee. If the credits align with your travel habits and preferences, you should be able to get more than enough value to make the card worth it. If the credits seem too complicated to use, consider other travel credit cards with more straightforward benefits.
For business owners
The Sapphire Reserve for Business makes sense if you can leverage its rewards and benefits for full value as a small business owner. Part of having a premium travel card is traveling enough to use perks like airport lounge access and Lyft credits.
With the business card, you also have access to business-related credits from ZipRecruiter and Google Workspace. If you’re not sure whether you can get value from these credits, you might want to consider a different business credit card.
For simplicity and affordability
The Sapphire Reserve cards only make sense if you’re willing to pay a hefty annual fee. If you’re not, consider no-annual-fee credit cards or other travel cards with lower annual fees. These cards have plenty of valuable benefits, but they aren’t always the easiest to use, especially with complicated credits.

And to the dismay of some fans, the chain's new logo now ditches the barrel itself.
Or rather, the drawing many have associated with Cracker Barrel over the years. The man leaning on that barrel is also gone, as are the words “Old Country Store.” Instead, the new emblem features a simpler design with just “Cracker Barrel” written on a gold background, which also has a semi-updated shape.
“Anchored in Cracker Barrel’s signature gold and brown tones, the updated visuals will appear across menus and marketing collateral,"" the Tennessee-based company wrote in a Tuesday announcement. Cracker Barrel added that its logo is ""now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and word mark that started it all.”
According to Cracker Barrel, this latest look marks the brand's “fifth evolution” of its logo to date. It was unveiled as part of a campaign from the company called “All the More,” which also advertises some new fall menu items.
Cracker Barrel has been working on a wider rebrand for some time. Beyond a new logo, that's included remodeling its country-style restaurants and retail stores. The company began ramping up this overhaul last year by swapping out older, more antique-filled designs with lighter paint and modern furniture.
Founded in 1969, Cracker Barrel operates nearly 660 locations across the U.S. today. Those attached to the chain's previous look have been quick to express ire about both the new logo and restaurant remodels online.
“Our values haven’t changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven’t changed,” Cracker Barrel said in a statement sent to The Associated Press on Thursday. The company added that the man on its former logo, known as Uncle Herschel, “remains front and center in our restaurants and on our menu,"" as he represents “The Herschel Way,” which is “the foundation of how our 70,000 plus employees provide the country hospitality for which we are known.”

","As Zero - Emission Credit Revenue Dries Up , What Does That Mean for Tesla Stock ? ",2025-08-23 01:45:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"Tesla (TSLA) has long enjoyed a unique advantage in the auto industry: its ability to rake in billions from selling regulatory credits to rival automakers struggling to meet federal fuel economy and emissions standards. For years, this lucrative stream of “easy money” has boosted Tesla’s profitability. But that era is coming to an end, and the implications for Tesla’s stock are becoming harder to ignore.
The U.S. government’s rollback of clean energy incentives is closing the door on the regulatory credit market that once acted as a financial lifeline for EV makers. For Tesla, the largest beneficiary of the system, this shift represents a turning point. Without the cushion of credit revenue, the company must increasingly rely on its core business performance to deliver profits. That’s a tall order at a time when U.S. EV demand is expected to cool sharply, competition is intensifying, and the company’s own fundamentals are showing signs of strain.
As Wall Street weighs the risks of a post-credit era, investors are left asking a critical question: without the golden goose of regulatory credits, what does the future hold for Tesla stock? Let’s take a closer look.
About Tesla Stock
Tesla is a prominent innovator dedicated to accelerating the global transition to sustainable energy. The Elon Musk-led powerhouse designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells high-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems, and energy storage products. It also offers maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance, financial, and various other services related to its products. In addition, the company is increasingly focusing on products and services centered around AI, robotics, and automation. Its market cap currently stands at $1.04 trillion.
Shares of the EV maker have slumped 20.6%on a year-to-date basis.
Tesla’s Easy Money from Regulatory Credits Set to Dry Up
Tesla and other EV makers in the U.S. are losing a major source of income as the U.S. officially phases out the emissions credit market. In one of my previous articles on TSLA, I discussed the impact of President Donald Trump’s recently signed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” on the EV maker. The most significant change is the elimination of the federal tax credit for EV purchases effective Sept. 30. Another important change is the termination of penalty enforcement for automakers with lower average fuel economy, essentially, those producing more gas-guzzling vehicles and fewer EVs.
You may be wondering what these credits actually are and why they matter so much to EV makers.
To reduce carbon emissions, governments worldwide have introduced incentives to encourage automakers to produce electric vehicles. With that, automakers essentially earn credits by producing zero-emission vehicles. All automakers are required to meet the CAFE and emissions requirements set by the federal government. The CAFE requirements have risen steadily year after year since 2010, reaching 49.2 miles per gallon in 2024. Carmakers that didn’t meet this requirement could purchase credits from those that generate a surplus. Since EV makers produce only zero-emission vehicles, they generate surplus credits that can be sold. In other words, Tesla and other EV makers were effectively subsidized by automakers that bought their regulatory credits to keep producing gas-guzzlers such as pickups and SUVs while avoiding U.S. government fines. Buying credits was cheaper than paying fines.
Regulatory credit revenue has served as a strong profit driver for EV makers, particularly Tesla. This is because revenue from regulatory credit sales goes straight to the bottom line, thus boosting EV makers’ profits. It began on a small scale, but as Tesla produced more vehicles, it accumulated a significant number of credits that could be sold to other automakers. Over time, hundreds of thousands in revenue grew into millions, and millions eventually grew into billions. According to FedScout, Tesla has generated $12.24 billion in revenue from the sale of “automotive regulatory credits” since 2015. However, the passage of the OBBBA ended Tesla’s golden goose.
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Tesla’s peers Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) have faced difficulties obtaining the necessary paperwork from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to finalize zero-emission credit deals. Notably, a week after Trump signed his megabill, NHTSA informed automakers that it would postpone issuing the annual compliance notifications for the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. An NHTSA spokesperson told the WSJ that the agency will resume issuing compliance letters once it completes its review of the CAFE standards. However, there is considerable doubt that this will occur under the Trump administration. With that, this effectively ends the market for credits under the CAFE standard, since automakers no longer need to buy credits after the Trump administration officially removed penalties for noncompliance.
Meanwhile, the Zero Emission Transportation Association (ZETA), an EV industry trade group, filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals seeking to compel the NHTSA to resume issuing the letters. Christopher Nevers, Rivian’s director of public policy, stated in the petition that the company cannot finalize its credit deals because NHTSA stopped issuing compliance letters, leading to a $100 million revenue loss. Rivian no longer anticipates receiving any CAFE credit revenue this year. In a separate statement, a Lucid executive noted that the credits “represent a significant share” of the company’s revenues. As the largest EV maker in the U.S., Tesla is set to face greater revenue losses than its smaller rivals.
Over the past four quarters, Tesla generated nearly $2.5 billion in regulatory credit revenue, which made up a notable share of its net income during the period. Those figures represent global regulatory credit revenues, and while Tesla doesn’t specify how much originates from the U.S., analysts estimate that up to half comes from its U.S. sales. Moreover, William Blair analysts estimated in July that roughly 75% of Tesla’s credit revenue is derived from CAFE standards. In its latest quarterly earnings report, Tesla said revenue from regulatory compliance credits dropped to $439 million, down 26% from the prior quarter and 51% year-over-year. The EV maker also said that the repeal of U.S. federal regulatory credit programs led to a $1.11 billion drop in expected revenue and cautioned that future revenue could be heavily impacted by the changes. “While we’ve never planned our business around such sales, it will nonetheless impact our total revenues going forward,” Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the company’s Q2 earnings call.
It is now clear that the end of the regulatory credits system will have a significant impact on Tesla’s profits. Although Tesla hasn’t needed these credit sales to remain profitable for years, its dependence on them has clearly increased in recent quarters, particularly as sales have declined in recent months. William Blair analysts warn that the loss of regulatory credit revenue will “result in a direct hit to profitability” and expect demand to drop by about 75% in 2026 before disappearing entirely in 2027. “The elimination of the CAFE fines requires a reset in expectations,” the William Blair analysts said in a note. Separately, analyst Troy Teslike projects that the U.S. rollback will cut about $255 million from Tesla’s revenue each quarter, over $1 billion annually moving forward. Some analysts are even more doubtful about Tesla’s outlook without regulatory credit sales. Gordon Johnson, an analyst at GLJ Research, said, “These regulatory credit sales are the reason that Tesla exists today. Without regulatory credit sales, Tesla loses money in its core business.”
Putting it all together, with the credits gone, Tesla will now have to rely entirely on its actual sales performance for its income. Even more troubling, with the $7,500 EV tax credit set to end in September, EV sales in the U.S. are expected to collapse. On the Q2 earnings call, Musk warned that Tesla could face “a few rough quarters” due to the end of EV subsidies, and now it’s clear those quarters will indeed be very rough.
What Do Analysts Expect for TSLA Stock?
Wall Street analysts remain divided on Tesla, as the stock holds a consensus rating of “Hold.” Of the 42 analysts covering the stock, 12 give it a “Strong Buy,” two a “Moderate Buy,” 18 suggest holding, and 10 rate it a “Strong Sell.” Bulls are largely encouraged by Musk’s promises on artificial intelligence, robotics, and self-driving technology, while bears highlight the company’s weakening fundamentals and toxic brand image. Notably, the stock currently trades at a premium to its average price target of $299.28.

Shares are now eyeing their fifth-straight daily drop, extending a pullback from a rally to their highest level since January, though the $14 level looks ready to contain losses. Better yet, RGTI could be a prime buy-the-dip candidate, as a historically bullish signal flashing may help the shares back into positive territory for 2025.
Per data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, Rigetti Computing stock's pullback placed it within one standard deviation of its 50-day moving average. The shares were above this trendline in at least eight of the past 10 trading days, and spent 80% of the past two months above it.
Within these parameters, four other signals occurred over the past three years, after which the security was higher one month later 75% of the time, averaging a 14.6% gain. From its current perch, a similar move would place RGTI back above $16.
An unwinding of pessimism could boost RGTI as well.

About UnitedHealth Stock
So far, UNH stock has really struggled this year, down 39% year-to-date (YTD) while also lagging behind the S&P 500’s gain of about 9%. In the 52-week period, it has lost close to 47% of its value, with the stock being 51% below its 52-week-high.

Following a difficult period, shares rebounded over 12% in the last week after Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) (BRK.B) increased its stake, signaling some renewed investor confidence despite broader turbulence.
Building on this momentum, UnitedHealth is experiencing a 1.5% gain today and about an 8% increase in a month.
UnitedHealth Misses Q2 Targets
UnitedHealth’s second quarter 2025 results fell short of expectations. Earnings came to $4.08 per adjusted share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.84 and declining 40% year-over-year (YOY). Revenue rose to $111.6 billion, a 12.9% YOY increase that slightly beat consensus expectations by 0.1%. Despite the top-line beat, profit was pressured by elevated medical costs, with a medical care ratio of 89.4%, higher than both the consensus and prior year, leading to a net margin drop to 3.1%.
Operating earnings were $5.2 billion, down 34.6% YOY, and total operating expenses surged 17% to $106.5 billion. The cost jump was driven by increased medical costs, hitting $78.6 billion, and higher product expenses. UnitedHealth’s health benefits arm, UnitedHealthcare, posted revenue of $86.1 billion, while Optum contributed $67.2 billion.
It ended the quarter with a cash reserve of $32 billion, up from $29.11 billion at the end of 2024.
Looking ahead, UnitedHealth management now forecasts adjusted net EPS of at least $16 for 2025, a sharp reduction from its previous $26 to $26.50 projection.

China is preparing to consider yuan-linked stablecoins as part of its efforts to expand the currency's use worldwide, in what would represent a significant departure from its previous stance on digital assets.
What Happened: The State Council, China's cabinet, is expected to review a policy roadmap later this month that could authorize the issuance and use of yuan-backed stablecoins, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
The plan is likely to set targets for global yuan adoption and assign responsibilities to regulators such as the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the report quoting sources said.
Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
Senior leaders are also scheduled to meet before the end of August to discuss yuan internationalization and the role of stablecoins, which have grown increasingly important in global financial flows.
If adopted, the strategy would mark a reversal from Beijing's 2021 ban on cryptocurrency trading and mining, which had been introduced over financial stability concerns.
Officials are now considering stablecoins as a potential instrument to advance yuan internationalization, particularly as U.S. dollar-backed tokens dominate the global market and gain traction in cross-border trade.
China has long sought a greater international role for the yuan, but strict capital controls and persistent trade surpluses have constrained progress.
Those restrictions remain a challenge for the rollout of yuan-backed stablecoins, analysts note.

Why It Matters: The yuan accounted for just 2.88% of international payments in June, down to a two-year low, according to data from SWIFT. In comparison, the U.S. dollar held a 47% share.
Dollar-linked stablecoins currently make up more than 99% of the $247 billion global stablecoin market, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
Beijing's move comes as other Asian countries also explore local stablecoins. South Korea has pledged to allow won-backed tokens, while Japan is developing its own frameworks.
Hong Kong, meanwhile, enacted a regulatory regime for fiat-backed stablecoins on August 1, positioning itself as one of the first global jurisdictions to do so.
Shanghai and Hong Kong are expected to spearhead domestic implementation of China's stablecoin plan, sources said.",7b8dab79ef839d8fa6756282971151ee,trafilatura

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -New Zealand's Fonterra Co-operative Group said it will sell its global consumer and associated businesses to French dairy major Lactalis for NZ$3.845 billion ($2.24 billion), which sent its shares surging to a more than 7-year high on Friday.
Shares of the dairy company rose 17.1% in early trading to NZ$5.88, their highest level since February 2018.
The sale includes Fonterra's global consumer business, encompassing the operations of brands such as Mainland and Anchor butter, Kapiti ice cream and cheese and the Anlene powdered milk supplement. The deal includes long term commitments to purchase milk from Fonterra, Fonterra Chief Executive Miles Hurrell said.
The transaction also covers the dairy company's Foodservice and Ingredients businesses in Oceania and Sri Lanka, along with its Middle East and Africa Foodservice operations.
Hurrell said in an interview they had run both a trade sale and IPO process in parallel in the past 15 months and it was only in the last couple of weeks that Fonterra had really focused on the trade sale.
""Our assessment was a trade sale would give better value,"" he said. ""A trade sale will bring synergies to the business and I think we've seen that play out with the numbers we've announced today,"" he said.
Sources told Reuters in May several companies, including Japan's Meiji, Canada's Saputo and Lactalis, were mulling bids for the units. U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus was also among the interested parties.
Fonterra said the sale price could rise by NZ$375 million if the Bega licences held by its Australian business are included.
""Combining the Fonterra consumer business operations and market leading brands with our existing footprint in Australia and Asia will allow Lactalis to further grow its position in key markets,"" Lactalis Chairman Emmanuel Besnier said.
Privately-held Lactalis, the world's largest dairy company, counts names such as France's brie cheese maker President and Italy's mozzarella producer Vallelata among its brands and sells everything from yoghurt to flavoured milk and desserts.
Fonterra is targeting a tax-free capital return of NZ$2 per share following the sale's completion, it said. It is also hoped to grow its ingredients brands and selling high-end ingredients to other companies.
""That's where you'll see us continue to innovate and put more of our farmers capital to grow those businesses that get a stronger return long term,"" Hurrell said.",f9e2f54c0292dde39e90c0acf4ec82e2,trafilatura

He predicts these changes once the investor steps down.
-
Veteran analyst Meyer Shields said he was ""shocked"" by Warren Buffett's decision to retire.
-
Shields expects Berkshire Hathaway to pay a dividend and face more scrutiny under Greg Abel.
-
He disagreed with other Buffett gurus who predicted Abel might intervene more in subsidiaries.
A veteran analyst says he was stunned by Warren Buffett's decision to step down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO this year — and told Business Insider what he expects to change under his successor, Greg Abel.
""I was shocked,"" Meyer Shields, a managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods who's been covering Berkshire for more than 15 years, said in an interview.
Shields didn't see Buffett's resignation coming because the famed investor had ""frequently talked"" about wanting to stay in the top job as long as possible. ""This has been his life more than anything else,"" Shields added.
Buffett, who turns 95 next week, had just showcased during the hourslong Q&A at Berkshire's annual meeting in May that he still had the ""mental acuity"" and familiarity with Berkshire's sprawling operations to remain in charge, Shields said.
The fact that Buffett made the announcement signals it was ""voluntary"" and ""his decision,"" Shields continued. The legendary stock picker may have opted to step down because he wanted to leave on his terms and with his legacy intact, he added.
Buffett has ""always been very good at not overplaying his hand,"" Shields said.
What might change under Abel — and what might not
Berkshire has ""so much cash now"" — a record $344 billion as of June 30 — that it's high time it returns some to shareholders via a dividend, Shields said. The conglomerate is ""hoarding"" the huge sum, he continued, and it's ""not doing anybody any good for that to just be sitting there.""
Buffett's company has only paid one dividend during his 60-year tenure. He once joked he must have been in the bathroom when the board approved it.
Buffett has said he prefers to let shareholders decide how much income they want to draw out of the company, and doesn't want to pay them something that is taxed.
Shields said a dividend is ""quite likely"" under Abel. He also suggested there could be a spike in employee turnover among staff who might not feel the same commitment toward the new boss.
He predicted a ""little bit more skepticism"" from Wall Street and the financial media when the company is no longer led by someone so revered he's dubbed ""The Oracle of Omaha.""",a037fa5154b6ec7f9c14c03a7fe3c2ca,trafilatura

In a filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, SpartanNash said C&S withdrew its Hart-Scott-Rodino Act Notification and Report Form on Monday and resubmitted it on Tuesday. The refiling launched another 30-day waiting period before the merger can be finalized.
Withdrawing and refiling pre-merger notifications is “standard procedure” and gives the Federal Trade Commission “additional time for antitrust review of certain transactions,” SpartanNash said in the SEC filing.
The company said it still expects the acquisition to be completed later this year, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. SpartanNash has scheduled a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the merger for Sept. 9. SpartanNash’s board of directors has unanimously approved the merger and recommended that shareholders vote in favor of it.
C&S and SpartanNash initially appeared to have few antitrust concerns
When they announced their agreement to merge in June, C&S and SpartanNash said their operations were complementary, signaling that they had little of the overlap that often requires companies to divest some holdings to satisfy antitrust concerns.
The two companies both have widespread wholesale distribution operations, although they appear to operate largely in distinct markets. SpartanNash has distribution facilities in 14 states, primarily concentrated in the Midwest, and C&S has facilities in 15 states, mostly in the Northeast, Southeast, and West Coast areas.
SpartanNash also operates retail grocery stores in 10 states: Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. C&S, meanwhile, has limited retail operations, although it does license the Piggly Wiggly supermarket banner to operators in several states where SpartanNash owns stores, including Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky.
If the merger cannot be completed for antitrust reasons, C&S would owe SpartanNash an antitrust termination fee of $55 million, according to SEC filings. Conversely, if SpartanNash elects to terminate the merger agreement for any reason, it would owe C&S a termination fee of $35.4 million.
As previously reported, C&S had first approached SpartanNash about acquiring a single warehouse in North Carolina, but subsequently made an offer to acquire the whole company for about $1.77 billion.
The merger agreement followed the failed merger of Kroger and Albertsons, in which C&S was scheduled to play a major role by acquiring 579 stores and certain related support infrastructure across several markets to satisfy antitrust concerns. In rejecting that merger agreement, some state antitrust officials cited the challenges C&S would face in operating the disparate network of stores.",f7c75284d420ab91172a8c8ae958e820,trafilatura

The company has its detractors, and one chimed in with a research update.
-
In doing so, he reiterated his sell recommendation in no uncertain terms.
A negative analyst note published before market open on Thursday was the wet blanket that dampened Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) stock. The company, now transformed into almost a pure-play Bitcoin investor, saw its shares slump to close the day almost 2% lower in price. That compared unfavorably to the S&P 500, which shed a comparatively modest 0.4%.
A bear weighs in
The prognosticator who authored the Strategy update was Gus Galá of Monness, Crespi, Hardt. In the note, Galá reiterated his sell recommendation and $175 price target on the company. That's far below the stock's most recent closing price of $337.58.
According to reports, Galá zeroed in on several discouraging elements of Strategy's business in the note. He expressed concern about the premium valuation of the stock versus its total Bitcoin holdings. And he believes that the company might take hits to its financial strength with its growing load of convertible bonds (issued to, of course, raise funds to buy more Bitcoin).
Regarding convertible bonds, they either remain as debt or are converted into equity. The danger for an issuer of such securities is that they could weigh down a balance sheet with excessive debt, or on the other hand be quite dilutive to existing shareholders if many holders convert to equity.
Exposed to potential volatility
Another danger for any company with heavy Bitcoin exposure -- and Strategy is Exhibit A for this grouping -- is that it's very exposed to developments with its favorite asset. Lately Bitcoin has been performing well, at times shattering all-time highs. However, even though it's at the top of its asset class, it's still a cryptocurrency -- and as ever, cryptos can be volatile investments.

The bank said it had partnered with digital platforms ADDX, DigiFT, and HydraX to distribute the product. DBS told Decrypt that the first tokenized structured note will be linked to the performance of Bitcoin.
Structured notes blend debt securities and derivatives contracts to provide investors with exposure to a range of assets, including stocks and commodities. They are linked to an underlying asset and pay the investor a regular return.
With DBS's latest product, the underlying asset will be cryptocurrencies.
""The note structure provides investors with a cash payout when cryptocurrency prices rise, enabling them to build exposure to the asset class without having to manage any cryptocurrency,"" the bank said. ""The note is also structured to mitigate potential losses should cryptocurrency prices decline.""
DBS said that by tokenizing such assets, they can become ""more fungible and easier to trade.""
""Asset tokenisation is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure,"" DBS' Head of Foreign Exchange and Digital Assets, Global Financial Markets, Li Zhen, said.
""Our first tokenised product, a crypto-linked note, also addresses the growing institutional appetite for digital assets,"" he added.
EToro Plans to Tokenize Stocks on Ethereum and Offer 24/7 Trading
The bank isn't the first to offer such a product. Wall Street giant BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, debuted its first tokenized fund last year. Its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund runs on Ethereum. And BlackRock CEO and one-time crypto skeptic Larry Fink has repeatedly spoken about tokenizing assets.
Other major financial services firms are also exploring tokenization initiatives, including Bank of America and Citi. In a report this May, the World Economic Forum said that tokenization had ""the potential to unlock the next generation of value exchange in financial markets.""
""While barriers remain, momentum continues to build, and financial institutions, policy-makers and technology providers need to coordinate regulation, interoperability and consumer protections to safely usher in this evolution,"" the authors of ""Asset Tokenization in Financial Markets: The Next Generation of Value Exchange"" wrote.

Hardly for the first time in the adtech specialist's history, an analyst raised his price target on the shares.
-
He also raised his annual revenue estimates and maintained the equivalent of a buy recommendation.
Next-generation adtech company AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw its shares land in positive territory on Thursday, thanks in no small part to a price target raise from a prominent bank. The specialty tech company's shares saw a nearly 2% lift as a result, on a day when the S&P 500 index sank by 0.4%.
Banking on continued growth
That bank was Wells Fargo, and the analyst doing the raising was Alec Brondolo. The pundit cranked his AppLovin price target to $491 per share; previously he had flagged it as being worth $480. In making his move, he left his overweight (i.e., buy) recommendation unchanged.
Brondolo's lift derived from adjustments to his revenue estimates for both full-year 2026 and 2027, according to reports. He pushed his top-line expectation 6% higher for the former year, and by 3% for the latter.
This, in turn, is due to the analyst's observation that web traffic to AppLovin customer sites is rising, a trend that presages higher demand for its services. He also cited other positive developments, including the fact that although overall web advertising customer growth has declined over the past few months, the industry is attracting far larger clients (who, presumably, have much higher budgets).
Let the bulls run
It isn't hard to be bullish on AppLovin these days.
Earlier this month the company delivered second-quarter results that featured a mighty 77% year-over-year surge in revenue (to almost $1.3 billion), while earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations leaped even higher, nearly tripling to $2.39. This is a stock with serious momentum behind it, and it feels like a buy even though it's not as cheap as it once was.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell more than 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved down more than 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped over 0.3%.
A continued slide in Big Tech stocks is still a worry, even after the Nasdaq on Wednesday showed signs of a reprieve, coming firmly off session lows as buyers jumped in. Short sellers have reaped over $5 billion from bets against techs as AI fears rippled through markets.
Dimmed rate-cut hopes are also weighing on minds after minutes from the Fed's July meeting signaled that sticky inflation rather than a faltering labor market is the main concern for policymakers. There was broad support for holding rates steady, despite a growing divide at the Fed. Meanwhile, more policymakers indicated this week that they don't necessarily view a rate cut as imminent.
Amid that rate debate, jobless claims for the week ending Aug. 15 rose to 235,000, versus expectations for 225,000. Continuing claims jumped to 1.97 million, a notch above the 1.96 million anticipated by economists.
Meanwhile, manufacturing activity rose to its highest level in three years in August. S&P Global's flash US composite PMI survey, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, increased to 55.4 from 55.1 in July.
Earlier, Walmart (WMT) capped the week's earnings from retail giants, raising its full-year forecast for sales and profit after second quarter results showed a low-price push is drawing in shoppers. But its quarterly profit fell short of high expectations, and its shares slid more than 4%.
The Fed kicks off its Jackson Hole symposium of central bankers from around the world later on Thursday, with the countdown on to Chair Jerome Powell's highly anticipated speech on Friday. The gathering is taking place as President Trump puts public pressure on the Fed, most recently calling for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign. Cook has said she won't be ""bullied to step down"".

Ladenburg downwardly revised its price target and downgraded the stock to sell.

The company moved to the final round of a competition with the U.S. Army.
-
Investors who had been optimistic about Nano Nuclear Energy last week shouldn't change their outlooks based on the analyst's pessimism.
The dog days of summer are barking, and they're scaring off investors from Nano Nuclear Energy (NASDAQ: NNE) stock this week. After an inauspicious start to the week, shares of the nuclear energy stock recovered slightly -- very slightly -- on Thursday, stemming the downward trend that they had been on from Monday through Wednesday.
According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, shares of Nano Nuclear Energy have plunged 18.9% from the end of last Friday's trading session through the market's close on Thursday.
A case of the ""Mondays"" that lasted through Wednesday
Nano Nuclear Energy stock started the week on a sour note after Ladenburg analyst Michael Legg downgraded the stock to sell and slashed the price target to $9. Legg's actions are a stark turnaround from July, when Ladenburg initiated coverage on Nano Nuclear Energy stock with a buy rating and a $51 price target.
The bearish outlook that Ladenburg shared on Monday for the nuclear energy stock had a significant effect on investors, who continued to sell shares through Wednesday.
But Thursday brought a reprieve to the sell-off. Nano Nuclear Energy reported that the company had advanced to the final round of the pitch event for the U.S. Army xTechSearch 9 competition. The is a competitive initiative led by the U.S. Army's xTech program that fosters engagement with sophisticated technology companies to explore solutions for critical defense applications.
Does the stock's drop represent a buying opportunity?
While Ladenburg's outlook on Nano Nuclear Energy is inspiring a sell-off this week, investors should remember that analysts have shorter investing horizons in mind when they issue price targets, making them of less concern for patient investors who intend to hold on to their shares for at least several years. With respect to the news with U.S. Army, it's worth noting, but it does little to change the investment thesis for the company.
If you were bullish on Nano Nuclear Energy stock last week, nothing developed this week that should change your mind.

Delco was also named executive vice president of finance.
Delco joined J.B. Hunt in 2019. Prior to that, he spent 14 years in various corporate finance and equity research roles at financial services firm Stephens Inc. At J.B. Hunt, he has been responsible for investor relations, corporate development and financial planning and analysis.

You need to have credit to build credit, but qualifying for a loan or credit card can be tough with a poor credit score. One solution to this problem is a credit-builder loan, a type of loan designed to help you establish or improve credit.
By making regular payments on a credit-builder loan, you should see your credit score increase. You'll also receive the loan funds at the end of your repayment term, minus any interest or fees.
Understanding how a credit-builder loan works, along with its pros and cons, can help you determine if this tool would be helpful for you.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
What's a credit-builder loan?
A credit-builder loan is a type of installment loan designed to help people establish a credit history or rebuild their credit. Unlike many other loans, you can get approved for this type of loan with poor or no credit.
As you pay back a credit-builder loan, your lender will report your payments to at least one of the three major credit bureaus. On-time payments should build your credit over time. If you miss payments, your credit score will take a hit.
Your payment history is the most heavily weighted factor in your FICO credit score, making up 35% of your score. If you take out a credit-builder loan, make sure you can afford the payments so the loan will improve your credit, not make it worse.

How does a credit-builder loan work?
Credit-builder loans work differently from traditional personal loans. Rather than giving you the money up front, the lender sets the funds aside in a savings account or certificate of deposit (CD) account.
You'll make payments to the lender on a regular basis, typically on a term from six to 24 months. Once you've paid the loan back in full, you can access the full amount, plus any interest it earned.
You won't necessarily make money, though, as lenders charge interest and sometimes fees. The APR on a credit-builder loan varies by lender and may range from 4% to 19% or higher. Loan amounts tend to be small and often range from $300 to $1,000.
Let's say, for example, that you take out $1,000 at 6% APR on a 12-month term. Your monthly payments would be $86, and you'd pay $33 in interest over the year.
At the end of your loan term, you'd have access to the full $1,000, plus any dividends the bank account has earned. Ideally, you'd also see an improvement in your credit after a year of on-time loan payments.
Who should consider credit-builder loans?
Best for borrowers who:
-
Have thin credit histories
-
Have poor credit
-
Can make regular, on-time payments
More than 45 million Americans don't have enough of a credit history to generate a credit report or score, according to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. If you're one of them, a credit-builder loan could help you establish credit.
According to a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau study, taking out a credit-builder loan increased the chances of having a credit score by 24% among borrowers without existing debt. These borrowers also saw their credit scores increase by 60 points more than borrowers who already had debt.
Those who are seeking to improve a low credit score or rebuild a positive credit history can also benefit from credit-builder loans. Boosting your credit can make it easier to qualify for a loan, purchase insurance, or get a credit card in the future.
Who wouldn't benefit from a credit-builder loan?
Not ideal for borrowers who:
-
Aren't sure they can make every payment
-
Need access to loan funds immediately
-
Don't need to improve their credit
If your credit is in rough shape because you've missed payments on your debts, taking out a credit-builder loan could be a risky move. Missing payments on your credit-builder loan would not only defeat the purpose — it would further drag down your credit score.
Borrowing this type of loan also wouldn't be a wise move if you need immediate access to the funds. With a credit-builder loan, the lender locks away the money in a savings account, usually for six months or longer.
You may be able to access the funds before your term ends if you pay the loan off in full, but then your credit wouldn't benefit from steady, monthly payments over time.
Where can I get a credit-builder loan?
Credit-builder loans aren’t offered at every financial institution, but you may find them offered by:
-
Online lenders
-
Credit unions
-
Community banks
-
Low-income lenders that are part of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund
Credit unions, which may charge a small fee for membership or require you to open a savings or checking account, and community banks share a focus on consumer education. Their commitment to serving local communities makes them more likely to offer loans that build credit for underserved populations.

How to choose a lender
Before taking out a credit-builder loan, do your research and compare multiple lenders to find the best offer. Here are some factors to guide your decision.
-
APR: This is the cost of borrowing money, so look for a credit-builder loan with a low APR.
-
Fees: Find out if the lender charges origination, disbursement, late payment, or other fees.
-
Loan amount: Consider how much you can afford to lock away in a savings account for six months or longer.
-
Monthly payments: You'll make monthly payments on the loan, so review your payment amount to confirm it works for your budget.
-
Interest earnings: Find out if the lender offers any interest earnings at the end of your loan term or if it will refund any of your interest charges in exchange for making on-time payments.
How to apply for and manage a credit-builder loan
You don’t need a credit history or a good credit score to qualify for a credit-builder loan. Here's how to get one.
-
Research lenders: Shop around to find a loan with an affordable APR and reasonable monthly payments. Prioritize lenders that report to all three credit bureaus.
-
Apply for the loan: Fill out the loan application with your personal and financial details. You may need to provide employer information, proof of income, identification, and other verifying documents.
-
Make monthly payments: Pay your loan back on time every month to reap its credit-building benefits. Consider setting up automatic payments, if possible, so you don't miss any bills.
-
Keep tabs on your credit score: Use a free credit monitoring service to track your progress as you pay back your credit-builder loan. Don't expect to see immediate improvement, but you should see the dial move over time.
-
Access your loan proceeds: You'll get your full loan amount after you've paid it back. Consider what the best use of that money would be — perhaps using it as an emergency fund so you have a cushion if you run into unexpected expenses.

Pros and cons of credit builder loans
Here are some pros and cons of credit-builder loans to consider before you borrow.
Pros
-
Credit-builder loans are easier to qualify for than traditional loans
-
Taking out a credit-builder loan can help you establish credit
-
On-time monthly payments could improve your credit score
-
A higher credit score can make it easier to get approved for future loans, credit cards, and insurance plans
-
At the end of your loan term, you can use the amount to boost your emergency fund or cover an expense
Cons
-
Missing payments could decrease your credit score
-
You'll have to wait until the end of your loan term to access your funds
-
Loans are typically limited to small amounts
-
Lenders will charge you interest and fees
-
Rates and terms vary by lender, so you'll need to shop around to find the most affordable offer
3 alternative ways to build credit
If the idea of having to pay interest and then waiting for the loan proceeds rubs you the wrong way, here are a few other ways you can build credit without a credit-builder loan.
1. Ask to be an authorized user
If you have a friend or family member with good credit, they can help you establish a credit history by adding you as an authorized user to their credit card. They don’t have to give you access to the credit card — you benefit just by close association with their financial reputation.
This only works if the primary cardholder manages credit responsibly. If they tend to carry high balances and rack up interest fees, their credit card usage could end up damaging their credit, and yours.
2. Get a secured credit card
A secured credit card grants you access to a line of credit, but you’re required to pay a security deposit upfront. This security deposit usually becomes your credit limit. As your credit score increases over time, you should be able to graduate from a secured credit card to an unsecured one.
3. Borrow a secured personal loan
While your lack of credit history or low credit score might not make you a great candidate for an unsecured personal loan, you may still be able to get a loan by offering collateral, such as a savings account or vehicle. However, you will need to make on-time monthly payments to avoid a negative impact on your credit, and you’ll likely pay a higher interest rate than you would with a credit-builder loan. You could also lose your collateral if you default on the loan.

Credit-builder loan FAQs
Is a credit-builder loan worth it?
A credit-builder loan may be worth it if you can make payments on time and don't need immediate access to cash. It can be especially helpful for borrowers who haven't established credit yet and don't have existing debt.
Do credit-builder personal loans get reported to credit bureaus?
Check the fine print on the loan terms to ensure the lender is reporting to all three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. While it’s acceptable to report to just one, it's best if your credit report reflects robust credit scores across the board.
Should I pay off a credit-builder loan early?
The point of a credit-builder loan is to maximize your positive payment history, so you want as many on-time payments on your credit report as possible. Paying off a credit-builder loan early defeats that goal because you’ll make fewer payments overall. An early payoff isn’t advisable in most situations.
Are credit-builder loans the same as no-credit-check loans?
While credit-builder loans don’t usually require a credit check, they’re different from no-credit-check loans like payday loans. Payday loans are short-term loans that charge high interest rates and have short repayment periods of 30 days or less. Payday loans are associated with a cycle of debt and poor credit, and often don’t report to credit bureaus unless you default on the loan. So they aren’t a credit-building tool — rather, they can trap consumers in a cycle of high-interest debt.

-
Kimbal Musk supports Elon Musk's pay package and plan to invest in xAI.
-
Musk's pay and Tesla's investment in xAI are key issues ahead of Tesla's shareholder meeting.
-
Some investors are skeptical of Musk's interim pay package and of Tesla's pivot into robotics.
Kimbal Musk weighed in on his brother's Tesla pay package and Tesla's potential investment in xAI.
""I think my brother deserves to be paid,"" the younger Musk said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""He has zero pay for the past six to eight years. I don't think that's right. I'll let Tesla shareholders make that decision, but I believe that it does need to be. He needs to be paid.""
""Tesla can't go without a deep, deep understanding of AI. We have a great business relationship with xAI,"" Kimbal Musk, who sits on the Tesla board, added. ""I will again let the shareholders decide that, but we are Tesla, an AI company. As any advanced technology company — Nova, Tesla, others — AI is built into everything you do.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The question of Elon Musk's pay and whether Tesla should invest in xAI, which is Musk's AI company, are both contentious issues ahead of the company's November shareholder meeting.
Musk doesn't receive a salary or cash bonuses at Tesla. Instead, he receives stock-based performance awards tied to milestones the EV maker achieves.
A Delaware judge struck down Musk's $56 billion pay package in January 2024, ruling that Tesla's board had failed to properly justify what would be the highest pay a public company CEO has ever received in the US. Even though the shareholder upheld his pay package, the judge upheld her ruling again in December 2024.
Tesla has been appealing the ruling since, and the legal limbo has left Musk without compensation until earlier in August, when Tesla's board granted Musk an interim package worth roughly $29 billion in stock, equal to about 96 million shares.
The move was to incentivize Musk to focus on the company, and he can only claim the new award if he remains in a top executive role for another two years. The company would be voting on a long-term pay plan for Musk in the November shareholder meeting, according to an August 4 shareholder letter.
Musk also made clear his desire for Tesla to continue to invest in xAI, in a tweet in July that said Tesla would have invested in his AI company ""long ago"" if it were entirely up to him. The issue will also be put to a shareholder vote in November, according to Musk's post on X.",b30f270d4e118af0adbbc273b56eaa0f,trafilatura

Howard Marks said he sees investors making one major mistake in today's market.
-
The billionaire investor said he believes US stocks are in the early stages of a bubble.
-
His firm is adding credit to its portfolio, he said, urging investors to pick up more defensive assets.
In Howard Marks' view, investors today are doing one thing wrong: assuming the market won't or can't change.
The billionaire co-chairman of Oaktree Capital said he believes the US stock market is in the early stages of a bubble. That means investors today could be falsely assuming their strategy in recent years — which involves being heavily invested in equities and concentrated in just a few areas of the market — will continue to work going forward, he said, speaking to Bloomberg on Wednesday.
""The single biggest mistake — I've been thinking a lot, what is the biggest single mistake investors make — and I've concluded that it is that they conclude that the way things are today is the way it'll always be, and the things that have been happening will continue to happen. Whereas reversion to the mean is much more likely,"" Marks said.
While Marks said he didn't believe a correction or bubble burst will happen soon, he identified a handful of things that he finds worrying about today's market.
-
There hasn't been a serious market correction in about 16 years. Stocks entered a bear market in 2022 and have also weathered tough periods surrounding events like President Donald Trump's tariffs announcement and the COVID-19 pandemic. That doesn't compare, though, to the sell-off sparked by the Great Financial Crisis, when the market plunged more than 50% and took years to fully recover.
-
Valuations are high. Marks said he wasn't concerned about the Magnificent Seven stocks. That's partly because earnings among most of those firms are still strong, which could mean they're fairly valued.
The problem lies in the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500, he said, which are also highly valued despite not producing the same results.
""It's the fact that high valuations are being applied to more average companies, that I think is more alarming than exceptional valuations being applied to exceptional companies,"" he said.
-
Investors are extremely bullish. The last time the investing environment has looked this optimistic was around 1997, Marks estimated, in the years leading up to the dot-com bubble.
""People go from neutrality to liking stocks, to liking them a lot, to liking them a ton, to liking them too much. And that's the continuation that creates bubbles, and we're probably in the early days of that,"" he said.",9c2b5507a96faf661bf6d206c120c964,trafilatura

Personal loans generally fall into two categories: secured and unsecured. In both cases, lenders typically review your credit history before making a decision. However, if your credit isn’t strong, you may have better odds of qualifying for a secured loan. That’s because these loans are backed by collateral — a valuable asset you own that reduces the lender’s risk.
Here’s what to know about collateral loans, common forms of collateral, and how to qualify for a secured personal loan.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
What is a collateral loan?
A secured or collateral loan is a debt that’s backed by an asset. Lenders consider these loans to be a lower risk because they can seize your collateral if you fail to make your payments. For this reason, collateral loans are often easier to qualify for than unsecured, or non-collateral, loans. Secured loans also typically have more favorable terms, such as lower interest rates, since they are less risky for the lender.
Read more: Do you need collateral for a personal loan? See when it might help.
What serves as loan collateral?
You’re probably already familiar with common forms of loan collateral, especially if you’ve ever applied for an auto loan or mortgage — which are backed by your car and home, respectively.
These are some common and less common forms of loan collateral:
-
Car
-
Boat
-
Motorcycle
-
Recreational vehicle
-
Savings account
-
Certificate of deposit (CD) account
-
Investments, such as stocks or bonds
-
Jewelry
-
Life insurance policies
To pledge collateral for a secured personal loan, you generally need to own the item outright. That means if you’re still paying off your car, for example, you likely can’t use it to secure a personal loan.
Pros and cons of collateral loans
While you might have an easier time qualifying for a collateral loan, these loans aren’t without their risks. Here’s an at-a-glance comparison.
Benefits
-
Easier approval: Because your loan is backed by something of value, it may be easier to get approved. Unsecured loans are generally issued based on your credit and financial history, and thus, could be harder to qualify for if you’ve had past credit missteps.
-
Lower rates: You could end up with a lower rate on a secured loan than you would with an unsecured loan. Again, that’s because the risk for the lender is reduced due to the collateral.
-
Larger loan: A larger loan amount may also be a possibility because of your collateral.
Risks
-
Lender can seize your asset: The biggest risk of a collateral loan is that your lender can seize the asset backing your loan if you fail to make your payments. Ensure that your payments fit into your budget if you plan to apply for a collateral loan.
-
Longer application process: Depending on the type of secured loan you’re seeking, the approval process could be longer and more complicated. For example, a lender might require an appraisal as part of its decision process.
-
Fewer options: While some secured loans, such as auto or home loans, are common, some are harder to find. For instance, not every institution offers a secured personal loan, so you may have to do some research to find a lender to work with.

How to get a secured personal loan
Unsecured personal loans are more widely available than secured personal loans. That said, many lenders, including Upgrade and KeyBank, offer secured options. Borrower requirements, including income and credit score requirements, differ by lender.
But generally, the application and approval process for a secured personal loan is as follows:
-
Compare loan options: Search for loans with different lenders, compare rates and loan amounts, and decide on your best option.
-
Gather your documentation: Expect to provide personal and financial information as part of the application process. Your lender will likely request copies of a government-issued ID like a driver’s license, W-2s, tax returns, pay stubs, bank statements, or other documentation.
-
Complete an application: After gathering your documents, it’s time to apply for a loan. Most lenders offer online applications, simplifying the process. You’ll need to share your personal and financial information and submit everything once your application is complete.
-
Follow up with any additional paperwork: Your lender might request additional documentation after reviewing your initial application. Watch for email or phone requests, and submit additional paperwork quickly to keep the process on track.
-
Await approval: Approval timeframes differ by lender, though many offer approval in just a couple of business days.

'They Take Wild Risks, Chasing Gains Like Gamblers'
Kevin O’Leary has a message for anyone managing money for the rich: keep it boring and protect their wealth.
The investor and “Shark Tank” star took to X recently to criticize how many successful entrepreneurs handle their money once they make it big. In his words, “Most wealthy entrepreneurs are terrible investors. They take wild risks, chasing gains like gamblers.”
‘Your Job Is to Protect Their Wealth’
In a video he shared in the same post, O’Leary doubled down on the point. He explained that just because someone built a thriving business doesn't mean they know how to invest. “They have no idea what they’re doing,” he said.

The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share.
-
‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.
O’Leary argued that if you’re advising wealthy clients, you shouldn’t try to outperform the market. “Your job is not to beat the market. Your job is to protect their wealth,” he said. “I would tell my clients, I’m not going to beat the market ever. You’re going to be rich forever with me. I’m going to protect your money. I’m going to make sure you get your distribution out.”
He added that he doesn't mess around with high-risk trades or flashy strategies. “I love boring. I just love boring,” he said. Instead of trying to impress clients with aggressive stock picks, he believes in building a portfolio that “will probably track but be less volatile.”
Avoid The Cousin's Restaurant
One of the biggest traps for new millionaires, according to O’Leary, is saying yes to emotional investments. “The first thing they do is they give money to their cousin to open a restaurant or a bowling alley,” he said. “Your job is to say, ‘No, you can’t do that.'”

He emphasized that the entire point of investing for the wealthy should be preserving their capital, especially for those with $5 million or more. “All the crap that I see in the markets, all the garbage and the leverage and all that stuff, I don’t touch any of that,” he said.
O’Leary knows risk firsthand from his portfolio of 54 “Shark Tank” companies. “A lot of that stuff goes to zero,” he said. “So, I know how to lose money the old-fashioned way. But the real dough, it’s parked in that philosophy we talked about.”",495d5fd6e564fbcb64a6fe51b6b9bdc0,trafilatura

Sasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Kim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I am incredibly proud of our momentum and strong fiscal year 2025 results. Our full-year revenue grew 16% with another year of strong operating margin expansion. Our years of investments in data, data services, AI, and human intelligence, coupled with strong execution against our AI-driven expert platform strategy, fueled these outstanding results. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2026, we are confident in delivering another strong year of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. In the past year, we made significant progress powering prosperity for consumers, businesses, and accountants.
We launched a transformative all-in-one business platform with a virtual team of AI agents and AI-enabled human experts that can manage lead to cash for customers. We accelerated our innovation to mid-market with the introduction of Intuit Enterprise Suite and new go-to-market capabilities and delivered breakthrough adoption of TurboTax Live as we disrupt the assisted tax category. Looking ahead, we are doubling down in these key areas. Starting with our business platform, we are making great progress delivering done-for-you experiences with expertise for our customers. Last month, we launched a transformative virtual team of AI agents that complete jobs on behalf of our customers, dramatically improving how businesses run and grow.
Combined with our AI-enabled human expert, these agents are automating workflows and proactively delivering real-time insights to improve cash flow and fuel growth. Our redesigned user interface and new business feed highlight these real-time insights and tasks completed by agents on behalf of the customer. We are seeing strong traction since the launch last month, with customer engagement in the millions and repeat usage rates significantly above our expectation, demonstrating the value that we are providing to our customers. We are well-positioned to consolidate on our customers' tech stack and spend and significantly increase their ROI, where AI and human intelligence are doing the work to fuel their success.
With an all-in-one platform, we have all the pieces to help our customers grow, save time, and save money while fueling Intuit Inc.'s growth. Turning to mid-market, we continue to make strong progress serving large and more complex customers, which represent an $89 billion TAM. We are focused on fueling the success of customers with $2 million to $100 million in annual revenue, with our all-in-one platform, including QBO Advanced, Intuit Enterprise Suite, and an ecosystem of connected services. Our comprehensive set of offerings is aimed at helping businesses achieve their growth goals, such as boosting productivity and improving profitability by automating complex tasks, workflows, and functions, delivering insights and recommendations.
Many customers tell us they are overdigitized, with their data trapped in a number of disparate applications. This means they are spending too much time and money managing their business and not getting the benefits and return on their investments. Our data shows customers on our platform are spending billions per year on disparate apps. We are well-positioned to consolidate our customers' data and spend on Intuit Inc.'s platform to help fuel their growth and save money, all in one place. With quarterly product releases for Intuit Enterprise Suite, we aim to rapidly penetrate our existing TAM while expanding into new verticals. Our July product release was designed to supercharge customers' growth and profitability.
The launch included improved multi-entity capabilities, a new AI-driven done-for-you setup experience that dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes customers to get up and running, and new features that give customers a holistic view of their business KPIs with streamlined intercompany transactions and allocation. We also launched AI agents in Intuit Enterprise Suite, including accounting, payments, finance, and project management agents automating daily tasks, reducing hours of work to just minutes. Our done-for-you experiences are reducing manual work by up to 60% for customers when setting up projects. A recent Forrester study estimated that customers can see nearly a 300% return on investment over three years when using Intuit Enterprise Suite.
As we evolve our go-to-market strategy for mid-market, we are strengthening our partnership with the largest tech-forward accounting firms. We are helping accountants serve their business customers more efficiently and grow their practices profitably. In Q4, we continued to see strong growth in IES deals through accountants. This quarter, we signed a partnership with a rapidly growing top 25 accounting and technology advisory firm. This particular firm serves more than 14,000 business clients, representing a meaningful opportunity to acquire new customers over time. We have many other partnerships of similar scale in the pipeline. I am pleased with the momentum we are seeing with Intuit Enterprise Suite.
The total number of new build customers in Q4 was up nearly 2x versus Q3, with successful adoption by some very large customers, including one customer with over 200 entities that is also using payroll and payments. As we head into fiscal year 2026, we are nearing the one-year mark of launching Intuit Enterprise Suite, and I am proud of the progress we have made with both our product and our go-to-market strategy, which positions us to penetrate the $89 billion mid-market TAM. Turning to our consumer platform, we delivered an outstanding year. Consumer group revenue grew 10%, more than a two-point acceleration from last year.
This was driven by breakthrough adoption of TurboTax Live, which grew 47%, well above our long-term expectation of 15% to 20% revenue growth. This is the power of bringing data, AI, and human intelligence together to provide better experiences for customers. Credit Karma grew 32% this year and also drove a point of tax revenue growth as we delivered a seamless customer experience across TurboTax and Credit Karma. Our results also demonstrate the incredible opportunity to win as one consumer platform, to drive year-round engagement and increase monetization by serving a broader set of needs from building credit to building wealth.
The learnings we gained this year are fueling our investments and innovation to deliver durable double-digit growth across our consumer platform. We have significant momentum across the company, and I cannot be more excited about our opportunity ahead to accelerate growth. Our strategy and relentless focus on execution are working. We are leveraging data, data services, AI, and human intelligence to become the all-in-one platform for consumers, businesses, and accountants. Now let me hand it over to Sandeep.
Sandeep Aujla: Thank you, Sasan. We delivered strong results in fiscal 2025 across the company, including total revenue growth of 16%, a more than two-point acceleration from fiscal 2024, and GAAP and non-GAAP operating income growing 36% and 18%, respectively. Our disciplined approach to managing the business allowed us to achieve strong margin expansion while driving breakthrough adoption in assisted tax, introducing transformative AI agents across our business solutions, and building our mid-market go-to-market capabilities.
Our fourth-quarter results include revenue of $3.8 billion, up 20%, GAAP operating income of $339 million versus a loss of $151 million last year, non-GAAP operating income of $1 billion, up 39%, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.35 versus a diluted loss per share of 7¢ last year, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.75, up 38%. Now turning to the business segments. Global Business Solutions Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter or 21% excluding Mailchimp, and 16% for the full year or 18% excluding Mailchimp. All-in ecosystem revenue grew 21% in Q4 and 20% for the full year or 25% excluding Mailchimp.
This demonstrates the power of our all-in-one platform and that the innovation we are delivering is resonating with our customers, particularly as we move upmarket. We are making progress consolidating data and spending with us to help fuel their growth. Robust growth in online ecosystem revenue was driven by strength across both online accounting and online services, 23% in Q4, and 22% in fiscal 2025. Growth for the quarter and year was driven by higher effective prices, customer growth, and mix shift. Online services revenue grew 19% in Q4 or 29% excluding Mailchimp. Growth in Q4 was driven by money, which includes payments, capital, and bill pay, as well as payroll.
For fiscal 2025, online services revenue grew 19% or 29% excluding Mailchimp, driven by money and payroll. Within money, revenue growth in the quarter reflects payments revenue growth, which was driven by customer growth, an increase in total payment volume per customer, and higher effective prices, as well as QuickBooks Capital revenue growth. Total online payment volume growth in Q4 was 18%, relatively consistent with the range we have seen over the last several quarters. Within payroll, revenue growth in the quarter reflects customer growth, higher effective prices, and mix shift. Within Mailchimp, the revenue was down slightly versus a year ago, in line with our expectations for the quarter.
We remain focused to ensure the offering resonates with both mid-market and small businesses, and we are confident in delivering an all-in-one business platform that integrates the power of Mailchimp and QuickBooks. We expect Mailchimp to exit fiscal 2026 growing double digits. The overall addressable market for the business platform is over $180 billion, roughly half of which is mid-market, and we are well-positioned to win as an all-in-one platform. Online ecosystem revenue grew 21% in Q4 and 20% for the year. This includes approximately 40% growth for both the quarter and the year in online ecosystem revenue for QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite that serve mid-market.
Online ecosystem revenue for small businesses and the rest of the base grew a strong 18% for both the quarter and the year. Our Online Ecosystem revenue growth reflects the progress we are making with our strategy of serving both small and mid-market businesses with more complex needs. We had an exceptional year, driving 23% growth in combined QBO Advanced and Intuit Enterprise Suite customers, and 8% growth in US QBO customers excluding self-employed. Overall, online paying customers grew 5%, reflecting the headwinds we saw in our Mailchimp and international businesses, both areas where we have game plans to accelerate growth in the future.
Online ecosystem ARPC growth accelerated more than three points in fiscal 2025 to 14%, reflecting our progress serving more complex customers. We feel great about the customer growth and ARPC expansion we saw this year, with larger and more complex mid-market customers in our base. Turning to desktop, desktop ecosystem revenue grew 10% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the mid-teens in Q4 and high single digits in fiscal 2025. Turning to our consumer platform, Consumer Group revenue of $4.9 billion grew 10% in fiscal 2025. This outstanding tax performance reflects breakthrough adoption of TurboTax Live with revenue growth of 47%, a 30-point acceleration from last year, and customer growth of 24%.
We saw strong customer growth in full-service consumer and business tax offerings, both outpacing overall TurboTax Live customer growth. The learnings we gained this year will help fuel durable growth in the future. In our ProTax Group, revenue was $621 million in fiscal 2025, up 4%. Credit Karma revenue grew 34% in Q4 and 32% in fiscal 2025. On a product basis in Q4, personal loans accounted for 15 points of growth, credit cards accounted for 13 points, and auto insurance accounted for five points. As Sasan mentioned earlier, Credit Karma drove a point of revenue growth in fiscal 2025 as we delivered a seamless customer experience across TurboTax and Credit Karma.
I am proud of the progress the team made innovating on behalf of our members and partners this year, and I am excited about the opportunity ahead. Shifting to a balance sheet and capital allocation, our financial principles guide our decisions. They remain a long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.6 billion in cash and investments and $6 billion in debt on our balance sheet. We repurchased $748 million of stock during the fourth quarter and $2.8 billion during fiscal 2025. Depending on market conditions and other factors, our aim is to be in the market each quarter. The board approved a quarterly dividend of $1.2 per share payable on October 17, 2025.
This represents a 15% increase versus last year. Now shifting to fiscal 2026 and Q1 guidance. Our fiscal 2026 guidance includes total company revenue of $20.997 billion to $21.186 billion, growth of 12% to 13%. Our guidance includes Global Business Solutions Group revenue growth of 14% to 15%, or 15.5% to 16.5% revenue growth excluding Mailchimp. Our guidance also includes overall consumer group revenue growth of 8% to 9%, including TurboTax growth of 8%, Credit Karma growth of 10% to 13%, and ProTax growth of 2% to 3%. This guidance reflects the segment reporting change we shared today in our press release and fact sheet.
GAAP diluted earnings per share of $15.49 to $15.69, growth of 13% to 15%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $22.98 to $23.18, growth of 14% to 15%. We expect a GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% in fiscal 2026. Our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 includes total company revenue growth of 14% to 15%, GAAP earnings per share of $1.19 to $1.26, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.12. You can find our full fiscal 2026 and Q1 guidance details in a press release and on our fact sheet. We are also reiterating our long-term growth expectations for each of our businesses. First, Global Business Solutions Group.
With the momentum we see in online ecosystem revenue growth, we are reiterating our long-term revenue growth expectations for the Global Business Solutions Group of 15% to 20%. This includes online paying ARPC growth of 10% to 20% and online paying customer growth of 5% to 10%. Second, TurboTax. We had a strong tax season, and we see significant runway ahead to penetrate our TAM, particularly in assisted tax, which we expect to be the key driver of future growth. We are reiterating the TurboTax long-term revenue growth rate of 6% to 10% in this interim period, with TurboTax Live revenue expected to grow 15% to 20%. Finally, Credit Karma.
We are reiterating our long-term revenue growth expectations of 10% to 15%, reflecting the current size and scale of the business, our focus on delivering year-round benefits that lead to engagement, monetization, and TurboTax growth. With that, I will turn it back over to Sasan.
Sasan Goodarzi: We are well on our way to becoming the global tech leader for enabling financial success for consumers, businesses, and accountants. Given our early bets on AI, our low penetration of our large $300 billion TAM, and the significant investments we have made in the last decade in data, data services, AI, and AI-enabled human intelligence, we are well-positioned to power prosperity for our customers and deliver sustained double-digit revenue growth with margin expansion. We look forward to unpacking why Intuit Inc. continues to have a very bright future with the best years yet to come at our Investor Day next month. With that, let's open it up to your questions.
Operator: Certainly. Thank you, Mr. Goodarzi. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will go first this afternoon to Siti Panigrahi at Mizuho. Thank you.
Siti Panigrahi: Sasan, that's a great end to fiscal 2025. Mainly, I want to focus on the small business, your global business group, the 18% growth excluding Mailchimp. But as you look at fiscal 2026, what are the areas you are more excited about, and what did you learn in the fiscal 2025 execution? And if I could add one more to this, there's concern about this lead generation with the slowdown in SEO search.
Sasan Goodarzi: Would love to hear your views in terms of what you are seeing in your QuickBooks business. Yeah. Sure. Thank you for the question. You know, first of all, there are three things I would point out that give us confidence for the business group as we head into the year that we are in. One, the customer growth that we saw in the U.S. at 8%, the customer growth that we saw in mid-market at 23% is quite strong, and we are excited about what that will mean moving forward as we address some of the headwinds that you heard Sandeep talk about around Mailchimp and International. So that's one area that we are very excited about.
I would say the second is just the fact that we now have an all-in-one platform. We have all the pieces in one place to help a customer from lead to cash. And when you look at the fact that we just launched our new business feeds with a virtual team of AI agents and AI-enabled human agents, and the fact that we have several million customers that are already engaging, that gives us a lot of confidence as we look ahead durably relative to the growth that we can drive, particularly penetration of services. And the third is mid-market.
I mean, when you look at mid-market holistically, 40% growth in the context of the overall 20% growth that we had in online for the year, and the acceleration that we have with our product launches and our go-to-market capabilities, that gives us not only confidence for '26 but really beyond durably in terms of what's possible. So that's on the business group front. In terms of AI search, it actually plays into our favor. And let me just share a couple of stats. You know, one, this is across, by the way, our platform, not just QuickBooks. Our traffic is actually up quite significantly this year. And AI search is 1% of our overall traffic.
And the top 25% brands actually have a 10x visibility in AI search. So when you look at brands like QuickBooks and Credit Karma and TurboTax and Mailchimp, it actually plays into our favor. And then the last couple of things I would say is Credit Karma is not at all reliant on SEO search at all because we have 100 million folks that are in-app. And so less than 1% is SEO search, so that's not really impacted at all. And last but not least, the final thought I would leave you with is the essence of us being an AI-driven expert platform company and an AI company.
We have actually been all over this in terms of thinking through how we think about tagging our content, how we show up, so that not only do we show up in the AI apps, but over time, when it becomes a bigger part of our search, today, it's only 1%, we play a far bigger role. And maybe I lied. Let me make one last point. The majority of our growth comes from recommendations. And search overall is actually less than 15% of our overall portfolio as a whole. So I just wanted to make sure that point landed as well.
Siti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks for that color.
Sasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Siti.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. And congratulations on a really strong overall FY 2025, a lot of the pieces coming together. Looking forward into FY '26, really, one question, but in two parts. I think on one side of the equation, you guys released a lot of really interesting functionality with new agents a couple of weeks back. What should our expectations be for monetization around those agents? Is it still too early? Or what should the time frame be that we should be thinking about those ramping up into the revenue base? And then on the other side of the equation, Mailchimp has been a drag through FY '25.
That was the one part of the equation. But you guys sound really confident we are going to come back to double-digit growth. Any inklings you could give us on what's driving that confidence in getting that business back to a double-digit growth rate so it's no longer a drag on this overall GBS revenues anymore?
Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Absolutely, Keith. So let me take your first question, which is just around our launch of our all-in-one platform with the virtual team of AI agents and human experts. A couple of things I would say, we have high expectations around monetization in the future. We have not assumed anything really in our guidance for this year. So that's first and foremost. Second, it's actually thus far above our expectations in terms of engagement. As I mentioned earlier, we just launched this in July, and we have a couple of million that have been engaging with the AI agents. It's actually quite significant after one month of launch.
And the repeat engagement, the discovery of our apps is actually above our expectations. What we are really focused on right now is just making the experience and the adoption of our services. And we are giving our teams time to make that because that's the first step. You want engagement and repeat engagement and discovery, which is above our expectations. The second is monetization.
So we think it's going to play a very big role because when you look at the billions of dollars that are actually spent by our customers on our platform on services that are not ours, we are quite confident that we can consolidate not only the tech stack but the tech spend, which is where the monetization comes in. So we have expectations for the future, not this year. We did not count on it in our guidance just to be prudent. The second thing is you are absolutely right. Mailchimp is a drag on our growth, and we expect to exit this fiscal year fourth quarter double digits.
And what you should expect, by the way, is a slow ramp throughout the year. And there are two things that we see today that give us confidence. One is our sales playbook and the number of sales folks that we have added is starting to really pay off going after larger customers in the mid-market. And that will be a big driver of growth in the future. Two, the product improvements that we have already made, but a lot more that are coming. We are actually seeing green shoots. We have the highest customer satisfaction that we have had ever since we acquired the business based on the launches that we have had.
So those things are green shoots that give us confidence that as we look into our trajectory, we would exit double digits in the fourth quarter.
Keith Weiss: Awesome. Thank you, guys.
Sasan Goodarzi: Thank you, Keith.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: You know, I guess, Carl, for you, there's a lot of things going positively right now with Xtend or some of the partners contributing. I was just kind of wondering, are there any crosscurrents out there that are sort of offsetting that to what you would have thought maybe at the beginning of the year, obviously tariffs with Europe? Just anything you could give us some context on because it seems like you have some really nice momentum in some of your early state.
Sasan Goodarzi: Hey, Kirk. Was that question for us?
Kirk Materne: K.
Sasan Goodarzi: We will. So can we open his line?
Kim Watkins: We can come back to Kirk.
Operator: We will circle back around to Mr. Materne. We will go next now to Alex Markgraff of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Alex Markgraff: Thanks for taking my question. Sasan, can you maybe talk about or just sort of outline the product and go-to-market priorities around IES in '26? Just thinking about some of the momentum behind the business and potential acceleration in '26.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Absolutely. There are really, I would say, threefold. One, we are very focused on the several hundred thousand customers that are in our base, up to about 800,000 folks in our base that are eligible for either QBO Advanced and/or Intuit Enterprise Suite. And so we are very focused on continuing to mine those customers, and that's a big part of what's driving the growth that we are experiencing now. Two, we really most recently started creating a flywheel effect in having discussions with our accountant partners. Those are sort of more long-term opportunities, but that is a really big opportunity for us, not just in FY '26, but I would say beyond.
Now that we are getting traction with Intuit Enterprise Suite and Advanced, but particularly Intuit Enterprise Suite across multiple verticals. And I would say last but not least, an important reminder for all of us that we are one year in with Intuit Enterprise Suite. And we just had our largest launch in July because we are due for quarterly product releases. And really, our focus is to do two things. One, to be able to accelerate penetrating our existing addressable market. But to actually start opening up our total addressable market. And we are, of course, very excited about adding Ashley being on board and accelerating our progress.
But those are the key, I would say, product and go-to-market priorities.
Alex Markgraff: Thank you.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yep. Very welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Arjun Bhatia of William Blair.
Arjun Bhatia: Yes. Perfect. Thank you so much. Sasan, for you on some of the agenda capabilities and the AI that you are launching, it seems very interesting. I am curious how you think about AI readiness amongst your base. Clearly, you are getting good engagement already, but how ready are your customers to kind of implement these agents? And does that require some work on your end? Or is it fairly sort of plug-and-play kind of thinking through what we might expect in 2026 and 2027? Thank you.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Actually, I love your question because it's sort of very customer-back, and I think it's important as we think about serving whether it's consumers, small or large businesses. The first thing I would say is, you know, people are using AI apps in their life, but they do not really care about AI. What they care about is, help me grow my business. Help me get customers. Help me understand where I should focus my marketing dollars. Help me understand what financial decisions. And that's what's most important. And so let me bring that to life by just sharing an experience that is part of what we have launched with you.
So, for instance, one of the things you could see in our business feed is, it will show the customer that they had 10 unpaid invoices and that we, in essence, based on their past permission, executed a follow-up to go get that money for the customer. And then we actually, when they click on it, they see how their cash flow has improved. Or in the flow of the customer, we will send them a notification and let them know that, hey, they are eligible for a line of credit based on the sales growth that they are seeing, and we will show them that sales growth.
So really, what the AI agents are giving us the ability to do is to help customers make decisions. And I think that's really what customers care about. It's less about is it an AI agent? But the fact that in moments of truth, we are actually helping them get paid, pay others, get access to a line of credit, understand what decisions they can make to drive growth. Which really, I will end with the last point, and that is the Forrester study that we very intentionally shared in our script. And that is that what we are really after is helping customers consolidate their data, their tech stack, and their spend all in one place.
And when we do that, there is a 300% ROI over a three-year period. Because in essence, when the data is all in one place with our AI agents, we have the ability to help them make better decisions to drive revenue growth or profitability through our business feed and AI agents doing the work. And when everything is in one place, we can drive, we are automating tasks. We are automating workflows. And it delivers efficiency. And last but not least, when we consolidate their tech stack, they actually spend more with us, but overall, they spend less.
And so that's the way I would think about it relative to our customers and what we are experiencing as we are engaging our customers with these new experiences.
Arjun Bhatia: Arjun, one other thing I would add to it, this is where we were super deliberate in how we introduced the GenTick experiences and incorporated them into the lineup. So we expose our customers to them as opposed to having the customers go to and pick a separate offering to add on. So that delivery decision is also what is helping customers see the productivity, see the better business outcomes. And that's actually leading to conversations around what's the next set of agentic expenses we involve because the customers are showing high receptivity to it, as Sasan mentioned, significantly higher repeat usage than even our own internal expectations.
Sasan Goodarzi: Alright. Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you so much.
Arjun Bhatia: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.
Kirk Materne: Yes. Thanks. And sorry about earlier. Sasan, I was wondering if you could actually just talk a little bit about Credit Karma. Obviously, a fantastic year for that business. I think there's some concern, obviously, with that business that it can be potentially more cyclical than other parts of your business. But the double-digit guide for next year against what are very tough comps seems to give some indication that you guys feel good about how that's sort of operating.
Just curious if you could add a little bit more color to serve the confidence in the guide and maybe sort of some of the new product lines that are coming to make that perhaps a little bit less cyclical than it was perhaps before you bought it in the early days? Thanks.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Sure, Kirk. You know, first, let me just start with the strategic nature of why we, again, acquired Credit Karma because it's just important to reground there. And that is what we are really ultimately after is to create one consumer platform, so we can help customers with benefit delivery on an ongoing basis. And by the time it's tax time, we have really an opportunity to do people's taxes for them right through the Credit Karma platform.
So that's an important element because a lot of the innovation this year and a lot of what we already talked about, which is the contribution it had to tax, is a very important part of the go-forward, which is engaging customers year-round. So one element is just tax and the confidence that gives us overall in the consumer platform. The other is because of all of our data and AI investments, we are actually taking share. Because when you look at our credit card and personal loan performance, the majority of this is actually great execution, and where our share is increasing.
And the primary reason why the share is increasing is because of all of our data and AI investments. Because we engage customers in-app and we engage them at the right moment of truth, knowing when they are seeking a financial product, and we put choice in front of them, and they are able to interact with us to better understand what is right for them. So that's an important element, which is share gains that give us confidence. And it's been several quarters in a row where our execution is really outpacing what we even anticipated. Which leads to the last thing that you asked about, which is cyclicality.
I mean, we have been investing heavily in things that aren't as cyclical. One is tax, that I talked about, which is the whole reason why we acquired the platform. But two is insurance. Three is prime customers that really, when you look at the cyclicality of Credit Karma, the primary driver in the last several years was personal loans by those that are actually subprime or near prime, which is why we have been really focused on prime customers because they have a different set of needs. And so a lot of innovation around prime customers in insurance, as I mentioned a moment ago. And then last but not least is just around money.
We are investing heavily to not only provide immediate and instant access to people's money when it's refund time, how do we then engage those customers year-round when it comes to their money? And so it's a holistic set of those areas of innovation that gives us confidence not just in Credit Karma, but just across our consumer platform as we look ahead.
Kirk Materne: Super. Thanks, Sasan. Congrats on a great year.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Taylor McGinnis of UBS.
Taylor McGinnis: Yes. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. So if I look at the global solution business performance, excluding Mailchimp, it was really strong in 4Q, and it looks like that was driven by an acceleration in online. So first, can you maybe talk through the drivers of that performance? And how durable you think some of those trends could be as we go into 2026? And then secondly, as we look ahead into the guidance excluding Mailchimp, it implies a little bit of a deceleration. So maybe you could just walk us through how we should think about what that implies for desktop versus online and some of the assumptions there. Thank you.
Sandeep Aujla: Yep. Hey, Taylor. It's Sandeep. In terms of the Q4, the acceleration that you correctly pointed out was across both accounting and services. On the accounting side, as we continue to scale in the mid-market, that aided as well as us introducing a new lineup in early July. So those are the two factors that drove the accounting side. And on the services side, it was driven by our investments and innovation we have been driving across our money portfolio, including innovations such as making all invoices payable, which is something we rolled out in Q4, and that is continuing to see good momentum.
So again, these are things that are very durable, and they will continue to pay off into the new fiscal year. In terms of your question on how to think about the guidance excluding Mailchimp, the area I would point to that is a key factor there between what we delivered in '25 and our guidance for fiscal 2026 is less pricing. This is something that I discussed in Q4 as well, if you remember, is that once you look outside of our accounting platform, in desktop and in services, we had less pricing heading into fiscal 2026 than what we took in '25.
So the core momentum in the business remains strong, and the delta is driven by less pricing actions.
Taylor McGinnis: Thank you so much.
Sandeep Aujla: Absolutely.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank.
Brad Zelnick: I was on mute. You would think that I would figure that out by now. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Can you maybe just help expand a little bit on improvements that underpin the confidence in the 15% to 20% TTL growth next year after such a fantastic year? Thanks.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yes. Hey, Brad. Let me maybe kick us off. It really, I would say, comes down to two big things. One is mid-market. $90 billion TAM. We are just scratching the surface with our penetration in that addressable market. Customers grew 23%. When you look at overall online growth, which was 20%, up to now $8 billion, over $8 billion. 40% growth in mid-market. So that gives us a lot of confidence for years to come, not just FY 2026.
The other one is, with the launch that we had, which was sort of our all-in-one launch, with a virtual team of AI agents and an AI-enabled human expert, we now have all of our apps in one place to help customers manage from lead to cash. In fact, one of the reasons I mentioned earlier that we like where we are on a couple of million customers engaging, discovery and repeat engagement is actually higher than what we had anticipated for only a month in. Is that customers are actually surprised that we have all the apps that we have today. Because now it's all in one place.
They visibly see it in one place when we are actually continuing to do more and more of the work for them. And there is a significant services adoption opportunity within that, Brad. And so those are the two big things that give us a lot of confidence looking ahead because large TAM, low penetration, I just think our product launches are positioned well for durable growth for years to come.
Brad Zelnick: Sasan, that was really helpful. And shame on me, I did not speak very clearly. I actually meant to say TurboTax Live, and I abbreviated it TTL. But that was still very helpful. Thank you.
Sasan Goodarzi: Well, you know what? There's nothing like answering questions that did not get asked. No. Let me at least, and Sandeep was listening, let me let him answer that question.
Sandeep Aujla: No worries, Brad. You got cut off for the first part. So we were debating the 15 to 20. So no. On TurboTax Live, look. We had a phenomenal year in fiscal 2025 and made tremendous progress across showing up local, across making sure we extended our brand equity towards the assisted category, and that showed up in the timing of our brand spend. Delivering a better together experience with Credit Karma with many of those customers coming over and picking the method. And across all of those, we had outstanding outcomes, but we also had tremendous learnings.
Which gives us the confidence that as we execute that playbook in the year ahead, and execute even better, that we continue to drive strong momentum in the assisted tax category, and that's where the confidence in the 15% to 20% comes.
Brad Zelnick: Thank you both. Really helpful.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs.
Kash Rangan: Yeah. I am with the Brad guys. I thought I had to TurboTax Live. So but I love your explanation for the QuickBooks Online, though. But, Sasan, it's not a mundane topic, maybe back to the essentials of how Intuit Inc. goes to market with its QuickBooks business. I think people have been a little apprehensive about AI searches, AI overviews taking over from regular paid search, that sort of thing. What can you give us a primer?
How is the go-to-market engine of QuickBooks and other products that do depend upon ads, Internet ads work in this new era, and how do you take advantage of or how do you make sure that you are not at a personal disadvantage, and how do you take advantage of AI search taking over relative to normal paid search? Thank you so much.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you, Kash, for the question. You know, first of all, I would just start with the fundamental premise that as an AI company, we are all over all things AI. Inclusive of search and how you show up in search, whether it's across any platform. So that's really important in terms of just clarity, visibility, and focus on search. The second thing I would say is generally, we have not been overly reliant on search. I mean, specifically in the business group, our traffic was actually up double digits this past year. And less than 15% of that traffic was actually driven by search.
That's just important context to understand the elements of where our traffic comes from because we have intentionally over the years actually invested in many different channels to drive search down because of where customers are. So that's just, again, important to understand. With all of that said, as I mentioned earlier, AI search today is 1% of our overall search. But we have been doing a lot of work to ensure that over time, we actually show up with where customers are, no matter what platform they are on, whether it's social, whether it's search. And last but not least, the way to think about our business is almost in simplistic terms sort of three dimensions.
One dimension is one to many, which is how we drive campaigns to help customers that are solopreneurs, that just started their business, to be aware that we are an all-in-one platform, and we can help them grow. The other is much more one-to-one for our mid-market, and the one-to-one is our accountant channel, which is a large driver of growth. And then one-to-one with businesses. And third, this is the power of our platform. You know, we do not have to spend money on payments. Do not have to spend money on payroll. We do not have to spend money on FMS because we are a platform where it's all in one place.
And when we draw a customer in with one benefit, we can then, our AI agents can do the work to help customers whether to get paid, whether it's to help them with payroll. As you heard Sandeep talk about earlier, we are very intentional about what we make available in our SKUs to provide the capability and availability to our customers. But that's really the way to think about how we go to market. The way to think about search. How important it is to our business. And last but not least, we benefit because we are a top brand from AI searches as they grow over time.
Sandeep Aujla: One thing also that Kash, to keep in mind is a cash, and I think it's an important consideration. That search and AI traffic is not apples to apples. The AI traffic tends to be much higher consideration and converts automatically better through the funnel. So that's a very important area that we are very cognizant of and making sure we are investing to get more of that AI because it just makes the funnel automatically more efficient.
Kash Rangan: Awesome. Thank you, Sandeep. And, Sasan, I am so glad that I stuck my neck out a few weeks ago and investors asked me about this. I said, anybody working for Sasan will have figured this out. Otherwise, they will not have a job. So I am so glad you are on top of it. Thank you so much.
Sasan Goodarzi: Well, thank you for your confidence, my friend. I will pass it on to the team.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Steve Enders of Citi.
Steve Enders: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. I guess I just want to ask on just maybe SMB health and maybe what you are seeing out there from a macro perspective. Have you seen any change in terms of what you are seeing from that perspective? Either in your underlying data or from customers coming through? Just maybe what have you seen from a deal environment perspective?
Sasan Goodarzi: Yes. Sure. A couple of things I would say. You know, when you talk about businesses, you have to do it while talking about consumers. Right? Because businesses spend with businesses, but consumers spend with businesses. So I will just start with consumers first. And, you know, generally, what we see across our well over 100 million customers is, you know, balances on things like credit cards are up 4% year over year. But please understand that, you know, the last several years, it's been up double digits. And credit scores, depending on your credit band, could be down about 10 points. And so consumers, it's a good job market, but they are very intentional about where they spend money.
And they are stretched. When it comes to businesses that we see on our platform, revenues are generally flat, but profits and cash flows are actually up year over year. Now that's across, you know, 10 million customers. There are sectors that are performing far better, and then there are sectors that aren't performing well. And as you know, we are not concentrated in any particular sector, but sectors like real estate, advertising, manufacturing, depending on what you manufacture, are down. Whereas other sectors are up. So net-net, profits are up, cash flows are up across the millions of customers that we serve.
Steve Enders: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for taking the question.
Sasan Goodarzi: Very welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.
Alex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats. Sasan, maybe for you, kind of following up on the prior question about just the general kind of macro picture for your customer base. If you think about how over the course of the next twelve to eighteen months, you think about all of the functionality and the products and as well as in AI functionality starting to mix shift your customers with a more kind of simplistic yet holistic offering into higher tiers of service. How much is it how much push is it versus pull? How does the agentic functionality unlock that opportunity for you?
And it seems like there's an opportunity, at least seemingly with AI search yielding better and in-app selling and cross-selling also driving more efficiency in the go-to-market to also do that in a more margin-positive way. So maybe just comment on both of those aspects, if you can.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I love your question. So a couple of things I would say. One, every customer that we talk to, and I talk to, and accountants, they are overwhelmed with the number of apps that they have. They are overspending money on a bunch of different apps that is requiring them to spend more time than ever trying to figure out what is going on in their business. And even more important than all of that is their data is trapped in a bunch of different apps.
And so it really is our opportunity and our biggest impact that we are having right now is with our all-in-one platform, and that's why that Forrester study was so important that we shared in the script. To consolidate data, consolidate the tech stack, and consolidate spend. And because by doing that, that 300% return on investment is driven by when you consolidate data on our platform, our AI agents can do far better work to help customers with revenue growth and profitability growth. When we consolidate the tech stack, we can automate tasks and workflows to drive a lot more efficiency all in one place versus a bunch of different apps.
Last but not least, when you sort of add up what a customer pays to have a bunch of different apps versus what they would pay us, by the way, pay us, end up paying us more, they end up saving money. So we have proof, substantial proof that works. And I think to your question, it's a push and a pull. There's an element of with our AI agents and AI-enabled human experts, we are ultimately, what we are seeing and what we are looking to accelerate is how customers start doing more of their work on our platform versus using different apps. But we will also be working on how do you create a push.
Because, ultimately, you are working against human inertia, and although you have a lot of different apps, although you are spending a lot of money, the human inertia, they just change. Is hard. And so one of the things that we will continue to look at is what we include in our lineup and what we need to do to motivate, inspire, and drive consolidation because now we have everything in one place. It is a push and a pull, and that's really how we are thinking about our ongoing execution of our lineup and evolution of our lineup as we look ahead.
Alex Zukin: Sounds like ERP for the SMB. And it's working.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yeah. Thank you, Alex.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Brad Sills of Bank of America.
Brad Sills: Oh, great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the AI platform, maybe a little different angle. You have had the invoice generator out for quite some time, but would love to hear about any traction you are seeing there. And how that's performing and could that be a leading indicator perhaps for other agents that might be coming over time?
Sasan Goodarzi: Yes, absolutely. I mean, I will tell you what we saw very early on, which is one, customers that are using our invoice reminder, which I think is what you were asking about, we actually see 10% higher payments volume and conversion by those that are using the invoice reminder, and they are getting paid five days early. And I am glad you asked about it the way you did because that's just a tangible example of how our payments AI agent with that sliver of focus, which is invoice reminder, can have a substantial impact on our customers.
And really then if you expand that, what we are really focused on with our payments AI agent is how do we pay the customers' bills on their behalf? How do we help them with a line of credit? How do we help them with Instant Deposit? How do we actually help create an estimate that's payment-enabled upfront and they do not have to lift a finger, they have a handwritten note, they just take a picture of it, and we just create everything for them. So those are all the, you know, expanding beyond your question, the opportunities that we have with launching a virtual team of AI agents.
Brad Sills: Thank you, Sasan.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yep. Very welcome.
Operator: Thank you. We will go next now to Brent Thill of Jefferies.
Brent Thill: Sasan, the playbook to get Mailchimp back to growth, how do you think about this? What's the most important thing? I know you mentioned the user interface is a little too complicated for SMBs to use. How much longer is this going to take to get you back to growth in that business?
Sandeep Aujla: Hey, Brent, Sandeep, why I take this one? So a couple of things. Let's start with areas where we are seeing really good progress on the Mailchimp side, which is in the mid-market. As Sasan mentioned, we are scaling the Salesforce account management team there and getting really good ROI on that headcount and seeing really good progress there. An area where we continue to iterate fast, and I feel really good about the progress the team is making and is showing up in the customer satisfaction scores going up and being some of the highest in recent history is on the small business.
Small businesses are the bread and butter, and the angle there is to make sure the small business can get to its first and second benefit on our platform within the first thirty days or thereabouts. And that's where the team is helping make sure the offering is resonating, that they are able to navigate it, they are able to see the benefit, and we are making good progress, and I feel good about it, which is why we are confident in this business exiting double digits this fiscal year. One thing to keep in mind, it is a subscription business.
So there is a tilde six-month lag in terms of these actions getting implemented and them showing up in the revenue scaling up. So that's why we think, you know, it will be a couple of quarters at least before we start seeing the scaling up in revenue, but the momentum in the progress that we feel good about in Mailchimp.
Brent Thill: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions this afternoon. Mr. Goodarzi, I would like to turn things back to you, sir, for any closing comments.
Sasan Goodarzi: Yes. Hey, thank you, everyone, for attending. Thank you for all your great questions, and we look forward to seeing everybody at Investor Day. Until then, be safe. Bye, everybody.
Operator: Thank you. Again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call. We would like to thank you all so much for joining us today and wish you all a great remainder of your day. Goodbye.
Kim Watkins: Goodbye.
Trump’s Tariffs Could Create $1.5 Trillion AI Gold Rush
The Motley Fool’s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech. Over $1.5 trillion is already flowing into infrastructure, AI, and advanced manufacturing… and the number keeps climbing.

-
Walmart reported its Q2 earnings, showing tariffs are impacting its bottom line.
-
Sales were up, however, including same-store sales, a critical measure.
Shares of Walmart (NYSE: WMT) fell 4.9% Thursday. The drop came as the S&P 500 lost 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4% as investors await Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech tomorrow.
The retail giant reported its second-quarter earnings, which were somewhat mixed. The company delivered solid sales growth but missed on earnings.
Walmart expects tariffs to continue to impact earnings
Walmart's revenue exceeded expectations at $177.4 billion, but earnings per share (EPS) were $0.68, well below the $0.74 per share consensus. The company cited tariffs as the primary challenge, as well as some legal charges and restructuring costs.
Still, tariffs and discounts are cutting into its margins from either end. It expects this to continue. CFO John David Rainey said the company was doing its best to take on the rising prices rather than passing them to the consumer, saying, ""There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs. There are other areas where we've had to pass some of those costs along.""
Same-store sales were up
The top-line growth was a welcome sight for investors despite the margin and earnings impact. The key metric of comparable sales for Walmart in the U.S. ticked up 4.6% year over year, meaning overall sales growth is largely organic and not just driven by opening new stores.
While some investors were spooked, I think Walmart remains a cash-flow powerhouse and consumer staple. This is a solid addition to any portfolio.

Under the agreement, Meta will use Google Cloud's servers, storage, networking and other services, the source, who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential, said.
Google and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The deal was first reported by the Information.
The news comes after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments in July that the company would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build several massive AI data centers.
The company raised the bottom end of its annual capital expenditures forecast by $2 billion, to a range of $66 billion to $72 billion last month.
Meta is seeking outside partners to help it fund the massive infrastructure needed to power AI by offloading $2 billion in data center assets, the company disclosed in a filing earlier this month.
In June, Reuters reported that OpenAI was planning to add Alphabet's Google Cloud service to meet its growing needs for computing capacity, a surprising collaboration between two prominent competitors in the artificial intelligence sector.
Amid this flurry of deals, Google parent's cloud-computing unit delivered an almost 32% jump in second-quarter revenue in July, which surpassed expectations.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) -The hit to New Zealand confidence caused by global uncertainty will fade as businesses get used to a time of heightened economic policy unpredictability, the chief economist at the country’s central bank said on Friday.
Paul Conway, chief economist at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, said the confidence shock will pass and business will “just get on with it.”
""I fully expect uncertainty to persist into the future but to some extent, we get used to it,” Conway told Reuters in an interview. ""We can't sort of wait and see what's going to happen…forever,"" he said.
He added the central bank’s decision to cut the cash rate by 25 bps this week to 3.0% and flag further cuts was encouraging businesses to get on with it.
At its decision on Wednesday, the central bank highlighted weakness in both consumer and business confidence and the impact that this was having on spending as being one factor of concern for the economy. Governor Christian Hawkesby has said the impact of this uncertainty had been greater than the bank thought.
The U.S. has placed a 15% tariff on goods being imported from New Zealand, which was worse than the 10% initially signalled but not as bad as many other trading partners.
Conway said the changes to tariff rates were creating uncertainty and that is like “another shock on top of the tariff in the first place.”
“Those types of factors are ... causing businesses to be a little more reticent, households to be a little more reticent and that's perfectly rational,” he said.
The central bank decision to cut by 25 bps was not unanimous with two of the six board members voting to cut by 50 bps.
Conway said one member was ""particularly keen"" on a hold but ultimately the committee decided only to vote on cutting.
He said the member thought a hold at 3.25% might be a good idea as high frequency indicators were showing some improvement and inflation is nearing the top of the target range.
The member was concerned it ""could sort of morph into more persistent inflation pressure,"" he said.

The strategy is simple. Find companies that offer attractive dividend payouts and have the financial strength to sustain them.
Right now, Energy Transfer (ET) and Ares Capital (ARCC) are two stocks that offer high dividend yields of over 7% and have sustainable payouts. What makes these stocks even more reliable is that Wall Street analysts have assigned a “Strong Buy” consensus rating to them, signaling confidence in their ability to keep rewarding shareholders.
More News from Barchart
Dividend Stock #1: Energy Transfer
Energy Transfer is a reliable income stock, thanks to its sustainable and high yield of 7.6% and a solid history of increasing its dividend. This leading energy infrastructure company is well-positioned to benefit from rising demand for natural gas (NGV25) and natural gas liquids (NGL).
The company owns over 105,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, moving nearly 30% of U.S. production and serving around 200 gas-fired power plants. Its scale, storage capacity, and deep relationships with suppliers and customers give it a competitive advantage in capturing new growth opportunities.
Energy Transfer’s integrated business model, fee-based contracts, and high system utilization generate stable earnings and cash flow, supporting continued dividend growth. In April, it raised its quarterly payout by 3% to $0.3275 per share ($1.31 annually). Further, management expects long-term dividend growth of 3%–5% annually, backed by strong cash flows and new investments.
ET’s future growth will likely be driven by a robust pipeline of projects, most of which are already contracted with high-quality counterparties. These initiatives should begin contributing meaningfully to earnings in 2025, with benefits accelerating in 2026 and 2027. The company is targeting about $5 billion in organic growth projects for 2025, expected to deliver mid-teen returns.
Further, demand from data centers, LNG facilities, and power plants is providing additional momentum. Notably, Energy Transfer recently signed a long-term agreement to supply natural gas to CloudBurst’s new AI-focused data center in Central Texas — a capital-light deal with quick revenue impact.
With a growing project backlog and favorable market trends, Energy Transfer remains well-positioned to deliver reliable income and steady growth.",a710ed60fe860e875265503b6f5dfcaf,trafilatura
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stable-dividend-paying-stocks-223200708.html,8feb6b441f62973d3ec2cfebd3683d91,3 Stable Dividend - Paying Stocks That Are Perfect for Retirees,3 Stable Dividend - Paying Stocks That Are Perfect for Retirees,2025-08-23 04:15:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"For retirees seeking income, dividend investing is less about chasing the highest yield and more about owning stocks that reliably generate cash and consistently increase their payouts. Add in stability, safety, and diversification across industries and you have the hallmarks of an ideal retirement dividend portfolio.
Here's my three-ingredient peace-of-mind dividend-stock recipe:
Low beta, i.e., a stock that is less volatile than the broader market, is a good sign.
A modest payout ratio means the company can easily cover its current dividend payments while investing in the business, and also leave room for future increases.
Using this formula, three names stand out: Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG), ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ). Together, they span three very different industries -- consumer staples, energy, and healthcare -- offering retirees a diversified foundation for dependable dividends, as well as the potential for long-term gains.
Procter & Gamble: A consumer staples powerhouse
When it comes to stable income, few companies can match the track record of Procter & Gamble. With brands like Tide, Gillette, Pampers, and Crest, P&G's stable of products are part of everyday life in millions of households worldwide. Even during recessions, consumers rarely cut back on essentials -- even staying with brands they love -- which is why PG's business is so stable.
Here is how the company scores on the three ingredients mentioned above.
Dividend strength: Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend for 53 straight years, making it one of the most consistent income payers in the market. Its current dividend yield is 2.7%.
Volatility: A beta of just 0.34 , means the stock price tends to fluctuate only about one-third as much as the broader market.
Payout ratio: At around 63% of earnings, the payout ratio means the company is striking a balance between rewarding shareholders and reinvesting in growth.
For retirees, P&G offers exactly what they'd want from the consumer staples sector: predictable demand, conservative financial management, and a dividend you can rely on in almost any economic environment.
ExxonMobil: Energy income with a cushion
Energy companies often get tagged as cyclical for their connection to oil and gas prices and economic strength. Even so, ExxonMobil has proven it can weather downturns while maintaining -- and even growing -- its dividend. As one of the largest oil and gas companies in the world, Exxon enjoys scale advantages, strong cash flows, and a diversified global portfolio that spans exploration, refining, and chemicals.
Dividend strength: Exxon has paid and raised its dividend for 42 consecutive years, not quite a Dividend King, through multiple boom-bust oil price cycles, with a current yield of 3.7%.
Volatility: A beta of 0.50 is notably lower than many energy peers, reflecting its size and resilience.
Payout ratio: Around 55% of earnings, the payout ratio gives a healthy cushion even in weaker commodity price environments.
For retirees, Exxon provides exposure to the energy sector without excessive risk. While its dividend yield is often higher than consumer or healthcare peers, its modest payout ratio ensures the income stream is backed by strong cash generation. That makes it a solid choice for diversifying a retirement income portfolio.
Johnson & Johnson: Healthcare stability
In healthcare, Johnson & Johnson stands as a global leader with a mix of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Its diversified business model has helped J&J generate steady revenue growth across economic cycles, while its fortress-like balance sheet adds further confidence. The company spun off its consumer health brands to Kenvue in 2023, so it's not the same company it was in the past.
Dividend strength: J&J has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years, giving it one of the longest streaks. It's current yield is around 3%.
Volatility: A beta of 0.59 is low enough to provide stability while still offering long-term growth potential.
Payout ratio: At roughly 45%–50% of earnings, this is a reasonable level that balances shareholder rewards with reinvestment in research and development.
For retirees, J&J's healthcare exposure brings defensive qualities: demand for medical products tends to remain steady regardless of economic conditions. Its history of prudent capital allocation only strengthens its appeal.
The power of three
Individually, each of these companies offers retirees a compelling case for dependable dividends. But when combined, Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil, and Johnson & Johnson create a well-rounded foundation across three distinct and defensive industries: consumer staples, energy, and healthcare.
Together, they give retirees exposure to different economic drivers, reducing the risk that one downturn derails income. Each company's modest payout ratio and low stock volatility further reinforce the safety and growth potential of their dividends that can provide retirees with an important inflation-fighting edge.
For retirees seeking both peace of mind and steady income, chasing the highest yield is rarely the best strategy. A high yield might exist because of a plunging stock price that indicate the company is in trouble. Instead, focus on dividend history, low volatility, and a manageable payout ratio. Procter & Gamble, ExxonMobil, and Johnson & Johnson check all the boxes: stable businesses, modest payout ratios, and low betas.
That combination makes them three of the most stable dividend-paying stocks retirees can own -- providing reliable income and confidence they can weather whatever tomorrow's markets may bring.

(Reuters) -Mexican-themed fast food chain Guzman Y Gomez reported annual profit ahead of expectations on Friday, but rising U.S. expansion-related costs and a subdued start to the new business year in Australia sent its shares down 21%.
Guzman y Gomez (GYG) made its ASX debut in June 2024, marking the largest listing in Australia in three years. Regarded as a bellwether for the country's IPO market, its performance is also viewed as a yardstick for the quick-service restaurant industry.
The company posted an operating loss of A$13.2 million ($8.48 million) for its U.S. division in 2025 and flagged that the losses are expected to widen and margins to come under pressure in the current fiscal year as it embarks on expansion in the greater Chicago area.
""This investment ... is expected to offset ongoing improvements in the profitability of existing restaurants, and as a result U.S. losses are expected to increase slightly in FY26,"" the company said.
Network sales in Australia rose 3.7% in the first seven weeks of the current business year, sharply lower than the 7.6% growth forecast for the first half by Visible Alpha consensus.
Shares of GYG plunged 21% to a lifetime low of A$22.740, a few pips shy of their issue price of A$22 apiece. The stock marked its worst intra-day session on record.
Craig Sidney, a senior investment advisor at Shaw and Partners, estimates GYG is ""highly priced, so there is a view that they have got to achieve very strong growth in order to substantiate the share price"".
""So anything that slightly misses in this environment is being sold down quite heavily.""
In Australia, robust demand for its popular breakfast menu lifted sales 22% to a record A$1.09 billion in the year ended June 30, while sales in its secondary markets rose as well: up 40% in Singapore and 16% in Japan.
That propelled its full-year net earnings to A$14.5 million, more than double of the A$5.7 million it earned last year, and ahead of its own and market expectations.
The company also announced its first dividend payout of 12.6 Australian cents per share, citing strong balance sheet and cash flow generation.
For the current business year, GYG forecast operating earnings from its Australia segment, which includes its operations in Singapore and Japan, to expand up to 6.3%, compared with a 5.7% growth in 2025.

""The Administration has made it clear that enabling immediate trading of digital assets at the Federal level is a top priority,"" acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham wrote in a statement on Thursday.
The CFTC's latest sprint expands beyond spot crypto trading to address all remaining recommendations from the working group's report on strengthening American leadership in technologies such as crypto and digital assets.
The CFTC appears to be ""trying to lay a regulatory bedrock by seeking to establish a unified, federal-level spot market for crypto assets,"" Andrew Rossow, a public affairs attorney and CEO of AR Media Consulting, told Decrypt.
""It begins to address this state-by-state fragmentation and long-time occupancy of this grey zone,"" Rossow said, adding that he thinks the moves are made as part of a ""federal legitimacy strategy"" to create ""foundational reform.""
Still, retail investors would ""most likely benefit from heightened protections,"" once the ""federal handcuffs"" are lifted to restore trust in a space ""long tarnished by poor oversight,” he added.
CFTC Seeks Feedback on Plan to List Spot Crypto on Registered Exchanges
What's it all about
The report seeks to provide a unified federal framework for digital asset markets, addressing gaps in market structure, custody, stablecoin regulation, and anti-money laundering standards.
Remaining sprints are expected to tackle unresolved issues around DeFi oversight, banking access, tax clarity, and inter-agency coordination.
Thursday’s announced sprint is the third in a four-part series. The first, on August 1, laid the framework. The second, on August 4, launched the spot trading initiative.
How the Crypto Industry Is Responding to the CFTC’s Call on Perpetuals
The latest expands to broader rulemaking, while a forthcoming fourth sprint is expected to translate stakeholder feedback into formal rules and supervisory guidance.

How Can You Earn $100 Per Month As An Exxon Mobil Investor?
If you want to make $100 per month — $1,200 annually — from Exxon Mobil dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $32,520, which is around 303 shares at $107.42 each.
Understanding the dividend yield calculations: When making an estimate, you need two key variables — the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (3.69% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.0369 = $32,520 to generate an income of $100 per month.
You can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock.
The dividend yield can change over time. This is the outcome of fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.",89a97a96fdf8fe6829de3aac28e4e3c0,trafilatura

It holds true in stock investing, too, where it’s the underlying motivation behind momentum investing. This strategy, based on locating and buying into stocks that have posted solid recent gains, flies in the face of the oldest advice in the economics books, that past performance does not guarantee future returns. But it’s human nature to run with a winner – and we all know that when a stock price runs up, there’s a reason for it.

That’s why the real key isn’t simply spotting upward movement, but understanding why the gains are happening. Momentum investing works best when the stocks rising on the charts also have the fundamentals to keep them climbing. Companies with sound business models, proven leadership, strong customer bases, and profitable niches are the ones most likely to turn a short-term rally into a long-term win. And this is exactly where Wall Street’s professional analysts come in, identifying which “winners” are winning for the right reasons – the ones worth following.
With that in mind, we tapped into the TipRanks database to see which stocks fit the bill. Two standouts emerged – each already up more than 50% this year – and recently winning upgrades from analysts who see further upside ahead. Let’s take a closer look.
Kratos Defense(KTOS)
We’ll start in the defense sector, with San Diego-based Kratos. Kratos is a defense contractor providing technology, platforms, and systems for customers in the US and allied national security sectors, and in the civilian/commercial security segment. The company’s chief areas of operation are in cutting-edge technologies: hypersonics, advanced propulsion and power systems, unmanned systems, weaponry, space tech, and microwave and digital solutions. Kratos boasts high-level connections with the US Navy and Air Force, and is an important contractor with the nation’s Missile Defense Agency and the Intelligence Community.
Kratos has a range of active development programs that underscore its role at the forefront of next-generation systems. Among the most notable are drones, satellites, and microwave electronics – all technologies vital to strengthening today’s military capabilities and expected to become even more indispensable in the future. The centerpiece is the XQ-58 Valkyrie, an unmanned stealth drone currently being evaluated under the Air Force’s Low-Cost Attritable Aircraft Technology (LCAAT) initiative, via the Low-Cost Attritable Strike Demonstrator (LCASD) program. The goal is straightforward: to create a relatively inexpensive, long-range strike drone that can be sacrificed in combat if necessary.
Kratos has been flight-testing the XQ-58 since 2019, with results pointing toward its ability to fulfill those mission demands. Potential applications range from penetrating advanced air defenses to performing reconnaissance and executing both air-to-air and air-to-ground strikes.
Still, the Valkyrie is only one piece of Kratos’ broader portfolio. The company is also working with the US Space Force to advance satellite communications, while extending its technology into civilian markets. For example, a recent partnership with satellite services provider hiSky is leveraging Kratos’ software-defined ground systems to expand IoT connectivity, targeting both government and commercial customers.
Beyond aerospace and satellites, Kratos is finding practical applications for its automation expertise. In late July, the company announced a collaboration with Champion Tire & Wheel to deploy an ‘automated truck platoon’ at the NASCAR Brickyard 400. The project, which automated the delivery of pit equipment, marked the first use of automated trucking for NASCAR logistics.
All of these projects tie back to Kratos’ financial momentum. In its most recent quarter, the company reported $351.5 million in revenue, up 17% year-over-year and ahead of expectations by $45.67 million. Non-GAAP EPS came in at 11 cents, 2 cents above forecasts.
With KTOS shares up 144% year-to-date, investors are clearly taking note of both the defense contracts and the commercial partnerships fueling growth.
Wall Street is noticing, too. BTIG analyst Andre Madrid has turned more bullish, noting: “We have consistently called out that the lack of a sizable program of record with steady procurement volumes is something that has kept us from seeing further upside for KTOS shares. However, as of this summer, this no longer seems to be the case, with the company having been downselected for the Marine Corps’ MUX TACAIR program. Given funding currently earmarked for the program in FY2026 and the broader ~$8.8bn unmanned request, we have conviction that KTOS could see significant growth at Unmanned Systems (KUS) in the coming year. Furthermore, we continue to see upside across the breadth of the portfolio, most notably within hypersonics, C5ISR/Modular Systems (MS), Microwave Electronics (ME), and Kratos Turbine Technologies (KTT).”
Following this stance, Madrid upgraded KTOS shares from Neutral to Buy, setting an $80 price target that implies about 24% upside over the next year. (To watch Madrid’s track record, click here)
Overall, there are 15 recent analyst reviews on record for this stock, and the lopsided 13 to 2 split favors Buys over Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. (See KTOS stock forecast)
TriMas Corporation (TRS)
The second winner we’re looking at here is TriMas, a manufacturer of various specialty products used in the consumer, aerospace, defense, and industrial end markets. The company employs some 3,900 people in 13 countries, and is known for developing innovative solutions to some of the common problems that face its customers. TriMas has put together a set of brand names that, while not household names, are well known in the industrial world and are recognized for their quality.
TriMas has structured its business into several divisions, each targeting different markets with specialized solutions. The smallest of these, TriMas Specialty Products, focuses on the design and manufacture of high-pressure and low-pressure steel cylinders. While seemingly commonplace, these are in fact highly engineered precision devices, critical in the storage, transport, and dispensing of compressed gases.
The company’s larger divisions – TriMas Packaging, TriMas Life Sciences, and TriMas Aerospace – represent the core of its business. In packaging, TriMas produces dispensing pumps, sprayers, closures, flexible packaging, and even industrial drums, serving markets that range from beauty and food to pharmaceuticals and agriculture.
Its Life Sciences division extends the company’s reach into the medical field with precision injection-molded components used in patient monitoring, diagnostics, and surgical devices. Finally, the Aerospace division underscores TriMas’s engineering depth, supplying everything from air ducts and rivets to anti-icing devices for both commercial aircraft and the US military.
This operational diversity translates into measurable financial strength. In 2Q25, TriMas reported revenue of $274.8 million, up 14% year-over-year and beating estimates by $23.6 million. Non-GAAP EPS came in at 61 cents, also ahead of expectations by 13 cents. Investors have taken notice, with the stock climbing 52% year-to-date.
Reflecting on these results, KeyBanc analyst Ken Newman points out that TriMas is actively analyzing its business model, yet he sees ample room for the company to remain profitable given the momentum across its divisions.
“While we acknowledge that the portfolio may shift toward a pureplay Packaging mix as the board continues its analysis surrounding its ongoing strategic review, we are cautiously optimistic that transformation could take a slower transition given Aerospace’s solid demand visibility into FY26 and FY27. Assuming that Aerospace remains a strategic pillar of TRS’s portfolio over the near to intermediate term, we think it could allow the Company to unlock the full potential of its underappreciated multiple,” Newman opined.
That conviction also unlocked an upgrade from Newman, who boosted his rating on TRS from Sector Weight (i.e., Neutral) to Overweight (i.e., Buy). His $45 price target points to a 20% upside over the coming year. (To watch Newman’s track record, click here)
TRS has slipped under most analysts’ radar; the stock’s Moderate Buy consensus is based on just two recent ratings – but both are Buys. (See TRS stock forecast)

Volumes for the Guangzhou Futures Exchange in July racked up the busiest month since the lithium contract was launched in 2023, according to data from the bourse. Open interest — the number of outstanding bets on prices — was at a record too, with the surge continuing into this month.

The exchange has become a popular venue for betting on lithium, a key material for the electric-vehicle transition that in recent years was hit by a glut and signs of slower growth in EV-battery demand. Now, uncertainty over the supply outlook in Yichun, Jiangxi province — one of the nation’s major production hubs — has bulls and bears jousting over price trajectories, leading to wild swings.
The most-active futures surpassed 80,000 yuan ($11,135) a ton in July, before falling back to 67,840 yuan by the end of the month. Prices in August then rose more than 30% to above 90,000 yuan, before paring monthly gains to around 21% as of Thursday.
“Chinese commodity exchanges have a very high share of participation from speculative or individual investors — much higher than commodity exchanges outside of China — which can lead to greater volatility on a daily basis,” said Przemek Koralewski, global head of market development at Fastmarkets.
Battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. halted a major mine in the region earlier this month, after failing to renew a mining permit following its expiry. That’s fueled additional concerns of tighter scrutiny from Beijing over other nearby projects.
As well as the supply turmoil, the “anti-involution” theme that’s gripped China’s financial markets may have also helped drive the spike in futures activity for lithium due to speculative trading.
Guangzhou contracts for lithium carbonate, a refined form of the metal used in car batteries, have traded at daily limits more frequently in recent weeks. In July, the bourse moved three times to rein in speculative trading, including capping new positions and adjusting trading fees.
The market’s “current sensitivity to policy uncertainty around supply cuts and related news flow” is likely keep price volatility elevated during the next couple of months, Citigroup Inc. analysts wrote in a note this week.",62fd2a35c5b9928bbdbfa867a43f3ee6,trafilatura

Veralto’s stock prices gained 1.9% in the trading session following the release of its better-than-expected Q2 results on Jul. 28. The company’s core sales for the quarter increased 4.8% year-over-year, alongside it experienced favourable currency movements and an uptick in contribution from acquisitions.

For the full fiscal 2025, ending in December, analysts expect Veralto to deliver an adjusted EPS of $3.81, up 7.6% year-over-year. Further, the company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.
The stock has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 16 analysts covering the VLTO stock, opinions include nine “Strong Buys” and seven “Holds.”
This configuration is slightly less optimistic than a month ago, when eight analysts gave “Strong Buy” recommendations.

The two companies announced on Friday that they had signed a memorandum of understanding, in which SBI VC Trade’s role is that of distributor. SBI VC Trade, a licensed Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange Service Provider, aims to make RLUSD to go live in Japan during the first quarter of 2026.
RLUSD is Ripple’s first stablecoin initiative, launched in December 2024. The token is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, short-term Treasuries and cash equivalents, with monthly attestations from a third-party firm.
Ripple says this structure offers regulatory clarity and institutional-grade compliance — traits it argues will differentiate RLUSD from peers.
SBI executives framed the partnership as a step in strengthening Japan’s digital finance infrastructure. “The introduction of RLUSD will not just expand the option of stablecoins in the Japanese market, but is a major step forward in the reliability and convenience of stablecoins,” said SBI VC Trade CEO Tomohiko Kondo.
Ripple executives echoed the compliance focus. “RLUSD is designed to be a true industry standard, providing a reliable and efficient bridge between traditional and decentralized finance,” said Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins.
The rollout also highlights the deepening ties between Ripple and SBI, longtime partners in Asia’s blockchain ecosystem. It also comes as Japan approved the first yen-denominated stablecoin for issuance in the country earlier this week.",7202e86b2f11b4be752125e653b21935,trafilatura

According to the Financial Times, people close to the talks said the shift began after the US approved the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, known as the Genius Act.
Since then, officials have been rethinking how the European project should be structured.
Swift US Action On Crypto Regulation Pressures EU To Accelerate Plans
Signed into law by President Donald Trump in July, the Genius Act sets out the first comprehensive rules for the $288 billion stablecoin market.
Under the legislation, issuers of dollar-pegged tokens must hold full reserves in liquid assets, meet licensing obligations and comply with strict reporting standards. Supporters argue the framework strengthens consumer protection while still leaving room for innovation, a balance regulators had struggled to achieve.
In Europe, the swift move from Washington has unsettled policymakers who had been advancing their own project more cautiously.
Debate Grows Over Public Blockchain Versus Private Ledger For Digital Euro
Officials are now reportedly debating whether a digital euro should run on a public blockchain such as Ethereum or Solana, a departure from earlier plans that leaned toward a private ledger controlled by the European Central Bank.
Supporters say using an open blockchain could allow the euro to circulate more widely, while critics warn that public networks expose transactions to scrutiny and raise privacy concerns.
Supporters Argue Open Blockchain Could Expand Euro’s Reach Beyond Europe
The European Central Bank began studying the idea of a digital euro in Oct. 2021. Since then, the project has been viewed as a central bank digital currency. Its purpose is to complement cash and adapt to a more digital economy. Additionally, it aims to guarantee Europeans continued access to central bank money. Finally, it seeks to reduce dependence on foreign payment providers.
Today, international card networks handle the majority of eurozone payments, with non-European firms dominating between 68% to 72% of transactions.
Officials worry that without swift action, the US regulatory framework could accelerate global demand for dollar-backed tokens. As a result, the euro’s role in cross-border payments may gradually weaken.
The design choice has geopolitical weight. A private, ECB-run system would mirror the Chinese central bank’s approach to its digital yuan, which is tightly controlled. A public blockchain-based euro, by contrast, would move closer to the model promoted by private firms in the US.",d3a3e73a4cf371dfd55d09b91b20d1ea,trafilatura

Trading in shares in the world's most indebted developer, with more than $300 billion in liabilities, had been suspended since a court order on January 29 that the company be liquidated after defaulting on its debts and failing to come up with a reorganisation plan.
Shop Top Mortgage Rates
That paved the way for Evergrande's delisting on Monday under the exchange's rules.
For the most part, the company lived true to its name — it was once the country's premier developer, its listing in Hong Kong in 2009 was the biggest by a Chinese private developer, and it had the largest pile of debt in the property sector globally.
But for investors in the firm the journey has been anything but grand.
The developer started with a strong public market debut and a stock value of $9 billion in late 2009 that grew more than five-fold to $51 billion eight years later.
It was worth a meagre $282 million at the time the trade suspension kicked in.
The company's journey from stock exchange darling to a pariah in the financial markets is a cautionary tale of unbridled debt-fuelled expansion in the world's second-largest economy.
Its shares fetched HK$31.39 apiece at its peak, and it was down to HK$0.163 when it exchanged hands for the last time.
""The delisting marks a significant milestone, symbolising the culmination of Evergrande's dramatic downfall and signalling the end of an era for China's property-driven growth model,"" said Alec Tseung, a partner at investment and advisory company KT Capital Group.
Evergrande declined to comment.
SECTOR HOBBLED
Evergrande is unlikely to be the last to meet such a fate as the sector, which was hit by an unprecedented debt crisis in 2021, continues to be hobbled by a liquidity squeeze and a lack of homebuyer demand, analysts have said.
Earlier this month, China South City became the first state-backed property developer to be subject to a liquidation order from the Hong Kong High Court, following a similar fate for a handful of privately owned peers.

Announced on Thursday, the agency is seeking public input on how to better regulate spot crypto trading.
Running alongside the SEC’s Project Crypto, the initiative is a four-phased agenda that began early this month. The series of rulemaking efforts is designed to implement recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.
“The Administration has made it clear that enabling immediate trading of digital assets at the Federal level is a top priority,” said acting CFTC chair Caroline Pham.
Public comments are due on October 20, with final rules expected in a fourth sprint phase.
The regulatory efforts follow the release of a 166-page White House report, outlining how America can become the “crypto capital of the world” through comprehensive policy reforms.
New CFTC Crypto Sprint Expands Beyond Spot Crypto Trading
With the new phase, Acting Chairman Pham will begin stakeholder engagement on all other report recommendations for the CFTC.
“The public feedback will assist the CFTC in carefully considering relevant issues for leveraged, margined or financed retail trading on a CFTC-registered exchange,” she said.
The upcoming sprints are expected to tackle unresolved issues around crypto, such as tax clarity, banking access, among others. Further, the next phases would translate stakeholder feedback into formal rules.
Project Crypto to Make America Digital Asset Capital
SEC Chairman Atkins simultaneously announced Project Crypto at the America First Policy Institute, outlining plans to modernize securities regulations.
Launched on July 31, Atkins outlined plans to establish regulatory frameworks for digital asset trading.
Atkins also directed Commission staff to draft regulations that address the confusion surrounding the Howey test, which has led entrepreneurs to treat all crypto assets as securities preventively.

Narrowing the focus, Parker-Hannifin has also outperformed the sector-focused Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLI) 17.6% gains over the past year and 14.4% returns in 2025.
Parker-Hannifin’s stock prices observed a 4.1% uptick in the trading session following the release of its impressive Q4 results on Aug. 7. Despite the dynamic macro environment, the company delivered strong margin expansion and topline improvement. The company’s net sales for the quarter inched up 1.1% year-over-year to $5.2 billion, exceeding the consensus estimates by 2.7%. Meanwhile, its adjusted net income surged 12.2% year-over-year to $992 million, and adjusted EPS of $7.69 surpassed the consensus estimates by 8.6%.
Further, for the full fiscal 2025, Parker’s operating cash flows grew 11.6% year-over-year to $3.8 billion.
For the full fiscal 2026, ending in June 2026, analysts expect PH to deliver an adjusted EPS of $29.04, up 6.3% year-over-year. Moreover, the company has a robust earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.
The stock has a consensus “Strong Buy” rating overall. Of the 23 analysts covering the PH stock, opinions include 17 “Strong Buys,” one “Moderate Buy,” and five “Holds.”
This configuration is slightly more optimistic than a month ago, when 16 analysts gave “Strong Buy” recommendations.
On Aug. 15, Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino initiated Parker-Hannifin’s coverage with a “Positive” rating and set a price target of $860.
As of writing, PH’s mean price target of $786.85 represents a modest 7.3% premium to current price levels. While the street-high target of $880 suggests a notable 20% upside potential.

Though she forwent a career in music in favor of investment banking, van Oyen has demonstrated an acuity for working on a wide variety of projects — from IPOs to privatizations to two of the biggest deals beauty has seen this year: E.l.f. Beauty’s acquisition of Rhode and L’Oréal’s majority stake in Medik8, both said to be in the billion-dollar range. “What I love about investment banking is that every day is different,” said van Oyen, a Sydney native who currently divides her time between New York and London (where she serves on the advisory council of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.) “I love the variety.”

Here, van Oyen analyzes the current M&A landscape, what the prospects look like for the year ahead and why — like her favorite Albinoni concertos — it’s expected to be quite lively indeed.
After a very quiet 2024, we’ve seen a significant uptick in M&A activity, despite the uncertainty of the macro environment. What do you attribute that to?
Jeannette Smits van Oyen: Generally speaking, across all industries, M&A activities are up about 25 percent year-on-year. Consumer retail activity is up slightly ahead of that, about 35 percent. It’s interesting, we started the year, particularly in North America, but also globally, with a very strong, very bullish outlook on deal-making activity. That has obviously seen periods of volatility, but throughout that, strategics in the consumer retail space and more broadly, have remained very focused on identifying opportunities where there is strong industrial logic and fit and niches that they need to fill. We look more broadly at deals also happening in the beverages space, Pepsi buying Poppy, Celsius buying Alani, you can see that the broader trend of large consumer companies buying up niche capability or customer access has continued to hold.
I would also say that the capital markets have remained incredibly supportive, notwithstanding the macro volatility around us, and then through open private capital markets, where we’ve seen very strong activity. We advised on the take private of Walgreens earlier in the year and Skechers.
The debt markets have also remained constructive in facilitating those deals.
What’s your assessment of why we saw a slowdown?
J.S.v.O.: What’s been different about this year is the types of deals that have come to market. People have demonstrated this year, both strategics and financial investors, that they are prepared to lean in for businesses that are complementary and have sound industrial logic that they’re able to explain to their investors.
For a lot of the deals that we’ve done this year, across sectors, investor support for the deals at the multiples they’ve been done at, has been essential. As we think about the pipeline in the beauty industry, some of the deals that we’re seeing get done now have had longer lead times. And the deal environment the first half of this year has been conducive to buyers and sellers
You were involved both in the Medik8 and Rhode deals, two of this year’s biggest in beauty thus far. What was the unlock to getting those deals done now?
J.S.v.O.: Yes — so quite different businesses, different owners, different deal structures, but what they had in common is they both had a very strong brand identity that had been proven with a degree of global resonance, which I think is important.
Both brands had established a proven capability in their markets, outside their home market, and they had importantly demonstrated customer loyalty. In both cases, there was very clear data to underpin that customer loyalty. The other interesting point for both of those two was it was a very sensible window from a timing perspective, relative to their growth trajectory.
Because coming back to buyer appetite, it’s important for a buyer to both get comfortable with historic growth trajectories, but also to be able to underpin the future growth prospects. Sometimes we can see brands that aren’t necessarily at that perfect inflection point between both size and growth, and it becomes more difficult.
Has that perfect point changed recently?
J.S.v.O.: I think so. What we have seen is that the public valuation multiples across the listed peer group have come down over the last several years, and the appetite for strategics and for financial investors to invest has remained strong. However, there is much more focus now on establishing a view on what the sustainable growth rate is relative to a sustainable margin. Particularly within the beauty industry, the margin profile and the margin outlook is very much a function of channel and the channel mix is a key determinant of understanding the future profitability of a brand.
Do you think we’ll see an uptick in dealmaking for the rest of the year? Has the dam finally broken?
J.S.v.O.: I do think there is still incredible appetite from both strategic and financial investors to do deals. As we look more broadly at the personal care space, we’ve seen Unilever and Church & Dwight also transact. I think that there will hopefully be more deals to come through the second half of the year. The common theme between the deals that are getting done is they are high quality businesses that can articulate their historic and future growth and margin potential in a way that is underpinned by data.
I look at Medik8, specifically. In that case, we have a financial investor in Inflexion who had cultivated the business in a relatively short period of time. They had a long-standing and talented, creative, visionary founder and a recently incentivized management team. What that meant was each of the different buyers who thought about the business was able to bring their own vision to what the future for that brand could look like. So they had grown it to demonstrate capability and loyalty and efficacy, but it was still malleable for buyers to be able to put their own stamp on what they might do with it in the future. We saw a mix of strategic investors across the globe as well as financial investors, looking and thinking very hard about that.
How are you seeing the role of the founder evolve? Is their continued involvement with a brand becoming more important, less important or it hasn’t really changed?
J.S.v.O.: The role of the founder underpins the efficacy and the perception of the longevity of the brand. What’s interesting, if you look at how deals have been done this year, certainly both in the case of Medik8 and Rhode, those deals were structured such that both the founders, who are keen and will remain involved, are aligned with the buyers in the way that they carry on the brand and the brand strategies.
Are sellers more realistic about outcomes?
J.S.v.O.: I think so. We’re seeing high-quality, motivated buyers, and sellers who are grounded in where they are as a business and what their prospects look like, rather than necessarily where they were in terms of a historic lens.
Meaning the froth is less bubbly?
J.S.v.O.: No, I think if you’re a brand and you have investors that have entered at different stages in your development at different valuations, those valuations may not inform your current or future value.
Are there any dynamics that you’re seeing that are unique to beauty versus other segments?
J.S.v.O.: What makes beauty so unique and so interesting is that it has probably one of the most innovative new product development capabilities of any of the consumer verticals. That’s coupled with fast-moving channel dynamics and the ongoing evolution of online prospects relative to traditional retail. There’s also a very broad global strategic buyer universe that we don’t necessarily see in many other verticals and sectors, which are often weighted in one region or another. I would also highlight that it is the category that is inherently global with regional adaptation. If you think more broadly outside of beauty, in categories like foods and beverages, there are fewer examples of brands and products that have been adapted globally.
Last year we saw numerous brands that came to market that didn’t transact. What’s your advice to them?
J.S.v.O.: The thing I’d say is they haven’t transacted yet. But a lot of these are on the simmer, and that doesn’t mean they won’t. There are a lot of fabulous brands out there that we could still see transact this year. The key point — and this applies more broadly — is that there isn’t a single approach that fits all. In this dynamic macro environment, it’s incredibly important to tailor the way you think about a process or a solution. It goes back to understanding the brand and its evolution, and the way that historic valuation may or may not inform the future of a brand, and understanding investor dynamics based on those characteristics, and balancing all of that with the macro environment. There has been good activity this year, which does provide data points for brands to think about what is valuable and what is transactable for investors.
How are you seeing the buy side evolve? Are we seeing more non-traditional players interested in beauty?
J.S.v.O.: Definitely. The beauty landscape is increasingly intertwined within a sort of broader traditional personal care and wellness landscape. Beauty has evolved beyond a face value proposition, to one that really encompasses more broadly wellness and longevity. People are thinking of beauty as a way of feeling good about themselves.
Multiples. Are they coming down? Historically, we talk so much about profitability versus sales. What matters most now?
J.S.v.O.: I think they both matter. At its crux, you need to be growing in a way that is sustainable. In other words, you need to be investing in driving profitable growth. And you need to be investing to drive growth that demonstrates an ongoing enlargement of your brand, so expanding geographically, by channel and in product. It sounds very straightforward, but it’s incredibly difficult to do at the same time, and especially to do it profitably. It is thinking about deployment of capital in a way that unlocks both top line, as well as sustainable profitable growth in the future.
So as a founder it’s really important to think about the right operator for your brand.
J.S.v.O.: Yes, you need to think about investing to maintain optionality, so that there can be more than one [option]. But you need to do it in a way that is authentic to your brand.
At what stage do you like to come in to a brand? Based on what you’re saying, it sounds like rather than coming in when a brand is fully baked, you’d like your team to have the opportunity to advise on direction so that you can best position them to what you’re seeing happening in the market?
J.S.v.O.: One of the key things we do as JP Morgan that is differentiating is we bank through Chase. We work with a large number of small businesses, particularly in North America. We build relationships, often lending relationships, with these small businesses who then grow to become medium-sized businesses, and we provide commercial banking services, etc. It allows us to think in a patient way around what the right answer is. Sometimes it’s a sale, but other times it’s going to be to raise some more equity to invest, to get to the right point in the right profile to find the right counterpart. We can pivot and be quite unbiased in the advice we give, because we can do the debt, we can do the equity and we can do the M&A, and so we don’t think success necessarily is measured when a transaction happens. It’s measured in all the steps along the way that build to a transaction that ultimately then culminates at the right time for the founder.
You’ve been at JP Morgan for over 20 years. What was it like as a woman when you first started and how has it changed?
J.S.v.O.: I’ve been very lucky that there is a great network of senior women here overall, but also in my team and peers who work very closely together. That is true both in Europe and in Asia and in North America. Our culture is one of transparency and pragmatism, and that that has lent itself well to me as I’ve navigated my career. Finally, inherently, the financial markets can be volatile, and fundamentally, the ability to adapt to a changing environment and to be nimble in adjusting to different work environments and financial cycles has been differentiating. In a lot of ways, women are better at doing that than men.
Did you know that you always wanted to work in finance? Was your career more thought out or evolutionary?
J.S.v.O.: It’s a funny story. I was a classical musician, an oboe player, and my father was a CFO of a consumer company, so I knew I would go one way or the other. I’ve been in investment banking since the early 2000s and I’ve come to terms with the fact that I will not be a professional musician!
Are there any similarities between finance and classical music?
J.S.v.O.: I think the discipline of training in anything, if it’s sports or dance or music, sets you up to be disciplined and thoughtful, but also, ultimately to be able to connect with people of all different types and cultures.
How would you describe your leadership style and how has it evolved?
J.S.v.O.: I’m curious and somebody who fundamentally really enjoys the sector that I operate in. I’m collaborative. I like to work with lots of different people, and I really enjoy the opportunity to do that globally. And I think I’m calm. That’s why I really enjoy the beauty space, because the richness of the client types and personalities is multifaceted in a way that you don’t necessarily find in other sectors.
You’re chair of the DOI [diversity, opportunity, inclusivity] council for EMEA at JP Morgan. How are you thinking about creating an equitable environment, both in in the internal culture, but also in broader terms such as access to capital?
J.S.v.O.: Going back to my comment around the JP Morgan culture being one of transparency, of decency, of humility — all of that is very much encompassed in the way we think about creating an employee experience that is equitable for everybody. In terms of the way we think about our client proposition, it is very much around helping small founders set up businesses and investing with them at the beginning. That can be financial, but that can also be advice, helping with payment systems, making connections with people in organizations, suppliers or governments, depending on what is needed. It’s very much an extension of the culture of JP Morgan.
Is there a certain kind of deal that you love to do?
J.S.v.O.: I love the variety. What I love about investment banking is that every day is different. It’s small deals, it’s large deals, it’s public boards, it’s meeting different people. I really like the variety, simply put, of all of the different things and managing to do them all at the same time.

The step is intended to strengthen the Syrian pound after its purchasing power collapsed to record lows following a 14-year conflict that ended with President Bashar al-Assad's ouster in December.
Confirming the move, Syria's Central Bank Governor Abdelkader Husrieh said on Friday the revaluation was a strategic pillar of fiscal and monetary reforms.
""We have formed committees with public and private banks and experts from the central bank to determine the requirements for changes"" in the currency, he told Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya, describing the new currency as a ""necessity"".
He said a time frame to introduce the new currency was still ""under review"".
The Syrian pound has lost more than 99% of its value since war erupted in 2011, with the exchange rate now at around 10,000 pounds to the U.S. dollar, compared to 50 before the war.
The sharp depreciation has made daily transactions and money transfers increasingly difficult.
Families usually pay for weekly grocery runs from black plastic bags holding at least half a kilogram of 5,000-pound notes, currently the highest denomination.
In an attempt to ease transactions and improve monetary stability, Syria's central bank informed private banks in mid-August that it intended to issue new currency by ""removing zeros"", according to a document seen by Reuters.
Reuters spoke to five commercial bankers, one central bank source and one Syrian economic official who said the central bank had informed them that two zeros would be removed. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a decision that had not yet been made public.
Meetings on the currency overhaul have been chaired by Central Bank Deputy Governor Mukhlis al-Nazer, according to the commercial bankers who attended the meetings.
Nazer did not reply to a request for comment. Amal al-Masri, the head of the central bank's Banking Supervision Department, declined fo comment. The finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
It was not immediately clear whether the revaluation of the pound would need legislative approval. Syria is set to hold its first elections to set up a new legislative assembly in September.
Two of the bankers and another Syrian source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Syria had agreed with Russian state-owned money printing firm Goznak to produce the new notes.
They said the deal was finalised when a senior Syrian delegation visited Moscow in late July. Goznak, which also printed Syria's currency during the Assad era, did not respond to requests for comment.
POLITICAL SHIFT
Under Assad, the use of foreign currencies was outlawed, but Syria's new leaders pledged to create a free-market economy and lifted restrictions to ease cash flow.
While the economy has swiftly dollarised, with U.S. dollar prices everywhere from store fronts to fuel pumps, there are concerns about a Syrian pound liquidity crunch in a country with limited infrastructure for digital payments.
Three of the Syrian bankers said one driving force behind the planned currency overhaul was concern over an estimated 40 trillion pounds circulating outside Syria's formal financial system. Issuing new notes would grant the government better oversight over the cash in circulation.
It also carries symbolic weight, signalling a clear break from more than five decades of Assad rule. Bashar al-Assad's face appears on the 2,000-pound purple note, while his father, Hafez, features on the green 1,000-pound one.
Officials plan an information campaign in the coming weeks before the formal launch of the new notes on December 8, the one-year anniversary of Assad's ouster.
Two commercial bank directors told Reuters that Syria's central bank has instructed lenders to be ready for the roll out by mid-October.
Central bank circulars seen by Reuters asked banks to produce detailed reports on their infrastructure, including the number of cameras, cash counters, and storage capacity, and run tests to ensure automated systems could handle the new currency.
All five commercial bankers said they were told that a 12-month ""coexistence period"" will allow both old and new notes to circulate until December 8.
Karam Shaar, a leading Syrian economist and consultant to the United Nations, said replacing banknotes featuring Assad's image was a necessary political shift.
But he warned that the revaluation could confuse consumers, especially the elderly, and there was a lack of a clear regulatory framework or plan for full national implementation, given the gaps in the state's territorial control.
""Alternatively, Syria could issue higher denominations of the same currency, say 20,000- or 50,000-pound notes, which would achieve similar goals in terms of easing cash handling and storage, while avoiding the substantial cost of a full currency overhaul, which could run into hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Shaar told Reuters.

Ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's pivotal Jackson Hole address on Friday, cryptocurrency bettors are pricing in more than an 80% chance that the central bank cuts interest rates this year.
Polymarket Bettors Confident Of Rate Cuts
On the prediction platform Polymarket, the likelihood that the Fed loosens its monetary policy on or before Dec. 31 stood at 85% at the time of writing. Nearly $990,000 has already been wagered on the bet.
Meanwhile, the CME FedWatch tracker showed a 75% chance of a 25 basis-point cut in next month's meeting, down from 92% a week ago.
Polymarket, based on Polygon (CRYPTO: POL), allows users to buy “Yes” and “No” shares in USDC (CRYPTO: USDC). The shares representing the correct outcome are paid out $1 USDC each upon market resolution.
What Are Major Banks Saying?
These odds contrasted sharply with Morgan Stanley chief economist Michael Gapen, who said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance that the Fed will ""remain on the sideline"" for the rest of the year.
In contrast, other banking titans such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs expect the central bank to slash interest rates in the upcoming September meeting.
The Backdrop
U.S. producer prices surged in July at the sharpest pace since mid-2022, reigniting concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies on inflation. Investors scaled back their expectations after cooler-than-expected consumer inflation bolstered hopes of rate cuts.
The sentiment was further soured after the Fed indicated that inflation risks remain ""considerable"" due to the uncertain impact of trade tariffs.
Amid this backdrop, Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium holds great significance for the direction of monetary policy.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-setting arm of the Fed, last cut interest rates in December 2024 by 25 basis points, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.25%-4.5%.

Form 13Fs provide a way for investors to see which stocks Wall Street's smartest money managers are buying and selling.
Billionaire Philippe Laffont sold nearly 8.9 million shares of Supermicro stock in the June-ended quarter -- and profit-taking may tell only part of the story.
Meanwhile, Coatue's billionaire boss upped his stake in the face of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by 34% in just three months.
In case you missed it, last week marked one of the most important data dumps of the entire quarter. August 14 was the deadline for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
While earnings season -- the six-week period each quarter where a majority of S&P 500 companies report their operating results -- can clue investors into the health of corporate America, 13Fs are invaluable in helping investors spot which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have the undivided attention of Wall Street's greatest money managers.
Although Warren Buffett's trading activity is closely followed by investors, he's far from the only billionaire money manager with the prowess to uncover gems hiding in plain sight. For example, billionaire Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management has an extensive track record of investing in winners.
What makes Laffont such an intriguing fund manager to follow is his penchant for investing in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. During the second quarter, Coatue Management's 13F shows that its billionaire boss completely exited his fund's stake in Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) while concurrently piling into the face of the AI revolution.
Super Micro Computer is shown the door by Coatue Management's billionaire chief
According to Coatue's 13F, Philippe Laffont jettisoned more than a dozen stocks from his fund's portfolio in the June-ended quarter. Arguably none of these sales is more prominent than artificial intelligence-infrastructure giant Super Micro Computer. After being a shareholder for two quarters, Laffont sent all 8,886,735 shares packing, which had a market value of more than $303 million at the end of March.
The obvious question is: Why did Laffont sell Supermicro stock?
The most logical of all catalysts is that Coatue's billionaire chief was locking in gains. During the fourth quarter, which is when Laffont oversaw the addition of Supermicro to his fund, shares traded below $20 at one point. But during the latter-half of the second quarter, shares of the company consistently vacillated between $40 and $50. It's not out of the question that Laffont netted a triple-digit percentage gain on this position.
The concern is that profit-taking might only tell part of this story.
The reason Super Micro Computer stock nosedived in the second-half of last year had to do with allegations of fraud from a noted short-seller, as well as the company delaying the filing of its annual report and subsequent fiscal first-quarter operating results. It wasn't a good look for Supermicro, and it absolutely damaged investor trust in its management team.
The silver lining for Super Micro Computer is that an independent special committee found no evidence of wrongdoing by management in December 2024, and the company did, eventually, file its annual and first-quarter operating results without any restatements. Nevertheless, investors have been leery about placing much of a premium on Supermicro stock until it puts this event firmly in the rearview mirror.
The other possible issue that may have coerced Laffont to head for the exit is the competitive nature of AI-data center infrastructure. As production ramps up in the infrastructure space, Supermicro's customizable rack servers are likely to see their premium pricing power wane over time, which would adversely impact margins. Even with a sustained double-digit increase in year-over-year sales, waning margins runs the risk of stunting profit growth.
Billionaire Philippe Laffont bought Wall Street's No. 1 stock for the first time in over two years
On the other end of the pendulum, Coatue's billionaire boss oversaw the addition of 13 new stocks to his fund's portfolio in the June-ended quarter, as well as added to 19 existing positions. Perhaps none of these existing adds stands out more than the largest publicly traded company, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).
What makes this addition so noteworthy is that Laffont had been a persistent seller of Nvidia stock for eight consecutive quarters prior to this most recent quarter. Over two years, he'd jettisoned more than 41 million shares, when accounting for Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June 2024. But during the second quarter, Laffont grabbed 2,942,694 shares of Nvidia, which upped his fund's stake by 34%.
Just as Supermicro's potential triple-digit gain made cashing in Coatue's chips an easy decision, Nvidia's roughly 40% peak-to-trough tumble between early January and early April may have given Laffont the confidence to add to his fund's existing position. Wall Street's tariff-related swoon proved short-lived, and it's been up, up, and away for AI stocks in the subsequent four months.
There's a good chance Philippe Laffont is also enamored with Nvidia's seemingly sustainable moat as the undisputed leader in AI-graphics processing units (GPUs). Its Hopper (H100) and Blackwell chips are the preferred choice by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers, and CEO Jensen Huang's rapid innovation timeline should allow for a new advanced AI chip to be introduced every 12 months. It's going to be difficult for other companies to compete with Nvidia's hardware on a compute basis.
To build on this point, Nvidia's CUDA software platform has done a stellar job of keeping clients loyal to its ecosystem of products and services. On top of Hopper and Blackwell possessing compute advantages, CUDA assists developers in maximizing the compute potential of their AI-GPUs, as well as with the building and training of large language models.
But even though Nvidia is Wall Street's No. 1 stock, and billionaire Philippe Laffont appears to be increasingly optimistic about its growth prospects, there are no assurances its near-parabolic climb can continue.
For more than three decades, all next-big-thing technologies have endured early stage bubble-bursting events. In other words, it's been commonplace for investors to overestimate the utility and adoption of new technologies early in their expansion. With most businesses nowhere close to optimizing their AI solutions, it would appear that AI is the next in a long line of bubbles that'll eventually burst -- and that would be highly detrimental to Nvidia stock.
Beyond historical precedent, the other relevant issue for Nvidia is growing competition. As AI-GPU scarcity wanes due to expanding external and internal competition, Nvidia is likely to see its pricing power and gross margin dip.

The broader crypto market added just 1% to $3.86 trillion in capitalization, a move analysts described as a bounce on the way down rather than the start of a recovery.

“The technology sector in traditional financial markets remains under pressure, dampening the mood of cryptocurrency buyers,” said Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. “Bitcoin’s unsuccessful attempt to return above $115K only highlights the market’s weakness.”
ETF flows were indicative of caution. According to SoSoValue, bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows of $523 million on August 19, followed by $311 million on Wednesday and $192 million on Thursday. Meanwhile, ether ETFs incurred over $500 million in outflows during the same period.
The consecutive withdrawals reversed the prior week’s inflows. Kronos Research attributed the weakness to profit-taking and liquidations after BTC’s record high earlier in August.
Sentiment has also been hit by headlines. The SEC is investigating Alt5 Sigma after its $1.5 billion deal with World Liberty Financial, a firm tied to U.S. President Donald Trump.
Ethereum’s on-chain metrics have softened, with active addresses down 28% since July 30.
ETH traded at $4,289, up just 0.4% on the day but still down more than 7% from recent highs. Analysts say the drop in active addresses — now 28% below the levels seen in late July — reflects softer retail participation and could cap near-term upside even if bitcoin steadies.
XRP and Solana showed similar patterns, with XRP slipping to $2.87 and Solana at $183. Both tokens have declined by more than 6% in the past week, mirroring bitcoin’s weakness. Traders say a dovish Fed pivot could spark short-term rebounds, but without fresh inflows the moves may remain limited.
Derivatives markets point to hedging pressure, meanwhile. The 30-day delta skew in bitcoin options reached 12% this week, a four-month high, reflecting demand for downside protection.
“Bitcoin’s weakness is currently driven primarily by macroeconomic factors,” said Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler, in an email to CoinDesk. “No significant bearish crypto-native developments are weighing on the market.”
“In contrast, equity markets are experiencing elevated selling pressure, and this broader risk-off sentiment is spilling over into Bitcoin,” he added.
Lienkha said it was unclear if the current positioning represents short-term hedging ahead of Powell’s speech or a deeper turn. “Markets appear to be approaching the later stages of the bullish trend,” he said. “It remains unclear whether the present pullback represents the start of a broader trend reversal or merely another correction on the path to a final peak.”",e3a39849e91cf6082c426388ce81f97c,trafilatura

Data on Wednesday from the General Administration of Customs showed imports of rare earths ore from the U.S. surged to 4,719 metric tons in July after falling to zero in June, sparking market speculation over the source of the shipments.
MP Materials, which owns the only U.S. rare earth mine has long sent ore to China for its minority shareholder Shenghe Resources to process.
But MP said in April that it had stopped shipping the critical minerals to China as the U.S. and China clashed over import tariffs before ceasing them altogether in July after announcing the U.S. Department of Defence had invested in the company to effectively become the biggest shareholder.
MP told Reuters on Thursday that its final exports were sent in the second quarter and ""shipments over water, warehousing and other factors can contribute to reporting delays.""
The jump coincided with a recovery in China's exports of rare earth magnets, key to electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence sectors.
China's rare earth magnet exports to the U.S. jumped by 75.5% from the month before to 619 tons, 4.8% higher than the same month in 2024, the customs data showed.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is seeking to procure cobalt worth up to $500 million for defense stockpiles amid the country's move to boost its critical mineral supplies.
The Trump administration is also considering a plan to reallocate at least $2 billion from the CHIPS Act to fund critical minerals projects and boost Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's influence over the strategic sector, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The proposed move would take from funds already allocated by Congress for semiconductor research and chip factory construction, avoiding a fresh spending request as it seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on China for critical minerals used widely in the electronics and defense industries.
Separately, China released on Friday interim measures for the control and management of its rare earths mining, smelting and separation activities.
This came after that the world's dominant supplier of the critical minerals that are key to electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence sectors began in February a public consultation on new regulations designed to protect its domestic rare earths industry.

Dive Brief:
-
Subaru reported Q1 FY26 operating profits of 76.4 billion yen ($517 million), down 16.2% year over year, the automaker announced Aug. 7.
-
U.S. tariffs, which began in the middle of the quarter, factored into its operating revenue decline.
-
However, despite higher duties on vehicles and parts sent into the U.S. from Japan, Subaru’s quarterly sales grew by 25,000 units YoY to 171,000, driven primarily by the Forester and Crosstrek. “With regard to retail sales in the U.S., although demand trends have been volatile since the additional tariffs were imposed in April, sales remained firm in July,” CFO Shinsuke Toda said in the release.
Dive Insight:
The U.S. is a key market for Subaru, representing more than 70% of its total vehicle sales, according to President and CEO Atsushi Osaki.
While Osaki said the recently negotiated tariff deal with the U.S. that places a 15% duty on imports from Japan “alleviated some of the uncertainties surrounding the additional tariffs,” significant impacts remain.
Should the latest duty on Japanese imports hold, Osaki projects Subaru’s operating profits at 200 billion yen ($1.35 billion) for its fiscal year ending March 2026, a 50% ($2.7 billion) YoY decline.
But to hit that target, Osaki said Subaru will have to boost production and its sales mix, while also seeking ways to reduce costs.
Osaki said Subaru’s commitment to the U.S. has not changed, though the automaker shifted production of 2,000 units from the U.S. to Japan to offset Canadian duties on vehicles bound for that country.
Subaru is now focused on a plan to help the company adapt to rapidly changing business conditions, he said. The automaker will release additional details at a later date.
“Leveraging our company’s scale, we will continue making responsive and flexible management decisions as we explore investment strategies in Japan and the U.S. that will lead to Subaru’s sound and sustainable growth,” Osaki said.

A previously announced deal with the Trump Administration gives Nvidia access to a potentially lucrative market.
Nvidia isn't stopping there, but is designing a chip for Chinese customers based on its highly successful Blackwell architecture, tapping the growing demand for AI chips in the country.
This year has been quite a roller-coaster ride for semiconductor specialist Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). After rallying to a new all-time high to start the year, the stock plunged 37% from that level before regaining its footing and climbing to even greater heights. Concerns about the impact of tariffs, the battle to keep inflation in check, and the uncertainty about chip sales to China all fueled the historic volatility in 2025.
However, it appears those doubts have been put to rest, at least for the time being. Nvidia stock sat just 4% below a new record when the market closed on Wednesday, and it could be gearing up for another leg higher.
Reports emerged this week that may just be the catalyst that Nvidia investors have been waiting for.
An answer to the China conundrum
As stated, there has been considerable uncertainty regarding the sale of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to customers in China. Earlier this year, the U.S. government suspended the sale of Nvidia's H20 chips. These graphics processing units (GPUs) are specialized processors designed to meet the strict export restrictions imposed by the U.S. government, while still providing the computational horsepower needed for AI processing. In light of the moratorium, Nvidia took a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter associated with the H20 chips.
Sales of these China-centric AI chips totaled $17 billion in fiscal 2025 (ended Jan. 26, 2025), representing roughly 13% of total sales. Wall Street is estimating total sales of $202 billion this year, which would have meant a potential $26 billion hit to revenue.
However, Huang's extensive lobbying paid off. Nvidia agreed to a 15% revenue-sharing agreement with the U.S. government, which allowed the company to resume sales of the H20 chip to China. While the deal could weigh on Nvidia's margins, it marks the continuation of a potentially lucrative opportunity, but there's more good news.
Meet the B30A
A report emerged this week that Nvidia is developing a new AI chip for customers in China based on the company's wildly successful Blackwell architecture, according to Reuters, which cited ""two people briefed on the matter."" The new processor, reportedly dubbed the B30A, is said to deliver half the computational horsepower of Nvidia's flagship Blackwell B300 processor, according to the report.
It's no coincidence that Nvidia arrived at the 50% figure. During a press conference last week, President Trump admitted to being open to the idea of a reduced-capacity Blackwell chip. ""It's possible I'd make a deal"" on a ""somewhat enhanced -- in a negative way -- Blackwell"" chip, Trump said. ""In other words, take 30% to 50% [of the computing power] off of it.""
Nvidia continues hold its cards close to the vest. ""We evaluate a variety of products for our roadmap, so that we can be prepared to compete to the extent that governments allow,"" the company said in a statement. ""Everything we offer is with the full approval of the applicable authorities and designed solely for beneficial commercial use.""
That said, if Nvidia can come to terms with the Trump administration, this could open up a veritable windfall for the company in China.
The implications for Nvidia investors
In an interview in May, Huang estimated that the market for AI chips in China could reach $50 billion annually over the next few years, making it a potentially lucrative opportunity for the company.
Wall Street estimates Nvidia will generate revenue of $200 billion in fiscal 2026 (ending Jan. 26, 2026), $257 billion in fiscal 2027, and $302 billion in fiscal 2028. Given that China was responsible for roughly 13% of total sales last year, that suggests it could generate revenue from the country of as much as $99 billion over the coming three years. Furthermore, most Wall Street analysts are likely to haven't updated their models to reflect the higher revenue potential.
Furthermore, given the advanced capabilities of the Blackwell chips, even a scaled-back version would command a higher price from Chinese customers, resulting in additional revenue potential.
Fair-weather investors headed for the exits when it appeared Nvidia would be locked out of China's AI market. Now that Huang has been given the keys to the kingdom, the company's future prospects have just improved. And at less than 30 times next year's sales, Nvidia stock is attractively priced.

That's OK. While ""forever"" may be Warren Buffett's favorite holding period, we non-billionaires have to be a bit more strategically minded, locking in gains when it certainly seems smart to do so.
Just don't let too much cash sit idle for too long. The biggest risk to long-term investors still remains not being in the market.
With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at five stocks, any or all of which might make for smart additions to your portfolio while each is a bit undervalued. In no particular order:
PepsiCo
I get it. Coca-Cola is the more popular brand name as well as the more popular stock. Coca-Cola's also been able to sidestep most of the inflationary problems that have plagued PepsiCo's (NASDAQ: PEP) profitability since 2023. That's the big reason Coca-Cola shares have been able to continue climbing while PepsiCo stock is still down more than 20% from its mid-2023 peak.
Credit the two companies' different corporate structures, mostly. Coke is only a beverage outfit, and outsources most of its expensive production work to third-party bottlers. PepsiCo is not only its own bottler, but also owns snack chip company Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, both of which have struggled against an inflation-riddled backdrop.
The bears, however, have arguably overshot their target while ignoring everything PepsiCo's done to turn itself around. This includes the use of artificial intelligence technology to more efficiently manage its distribution efforts or even handle certain customer service tasks. The company's also adding healthier snacking options to its mix, better meeting today's ever-changing consumer preferences.
The stock's rally from June's multiyear low suggests some investors are starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. But there's still time to get on board.
There's certainly good reason to as well. PepsiCo stock's forward-looking dividend yield currently stands at 3.8%, which would be tough to beat with most other tickers of comparable long-term quality.
MercadoLibre
MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) shares have gone nowhere since the early August second-quarter report, although understandably so. While revenue was up 34% year over year, per-share earnings of $10.31 fell well short of the $11.93 analysts were expecting.
Most of the market, however, is missing the bigger picture. Operating income was still up nearly 14% year over year, with the bulk of the earnings shortfall stemming from the company's decision to offer free shipping to more of Brazil's online shoppers.
See, MercadoLibre is an e-commerce platform strictly serving the South American market. It's often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America, in fact, by seemingly becoming there what Amazon has become here. That's the dominant name in online shopping.
If MercadoLibre is going to mirror Amazon's domestic success, though, it has to do what Amazon did -- suffer a little short-term pain to secure its position as a long-term market leader. The company's willing to do so, even though it looks like investors aren't quite on board with the plan just yet. They'll get there.
This might help: Research outfit Payments and Commerce Market Intelligence believes Latin America's e-commerce industry will double in size between 2023 and 2027, when it will be worth an estimated $1 trillion. This growth should be led by Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, too, where MercadoLibre already does most of its business.
Upstart
Credit bureaus like Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion played their parts well enough when there was no feasible alternative to figuring out if someone was creditworthy. But, lenders and consumers alike had to know something better would eventually come along. Upstart(NASDAQ: UPST) is filling that role.
Simply put, Upstart uses artificial intelligence to determine how much credit risk an individual actually poses. And it does so measurably better than the more common means being used. Looking at more than 1,600 different data points per person, Upstart's approach allows for 43% more loan approvals without any additional defaults compared to credit bureaus' decision-making guidance. That's why more than 100 banks (and counting) subscribe to Upstart's solution, more than doubling its second-quarter revenue.
The company's results are still a bit erratic and unpredictable, as is its profitability. The stock tends to follow suit.
The business premise is strong and clearly marketable, though, making the stock's pullback from July's high a buying opportunity for investors that can stomach the volatility. The analyst community is on board anyway. Their consensus target of $79.14 is more than 20% above this ticker's present price.
Pfizer
There's no denying that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer(NYSE: PFE) just hasn't been the same since the wind-down of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, its Comirnaty vaccine accounted for nearly half of its revenue, while well over half of 2022's top line -- when Paxlovid became an approved treatment for COVID infections -- was linked to the coronavirus contagion. Since its revenue peak of just over $100 billion in 2022, though, sales have tanked. Last year's sales were a mere $63.6 billion. Nothing seems to be able to replace its coronavirus business, and the stock has paid the price.
As the old adage goes, though, expect it when you least expect it. While it's got nothing to show for it yet, over the course of the past couple of years, this iconic pharmaceutical outfit has set itself up for some significant success down the road. As of the most recent look at its pipeline, Pfizer says it's got several oncology drugs that could each be billion-dollar producers as soon as 2030. In fact, all told, recent acquisitions and continued R&D could add an additional $20 billion in revenue by then, with even more being possible beyond that. Meanwhile, simple cost-cutting could add more than $7 billion back to the bottom line by 2027.
None of this seems to be priced into Pfizer stock yet, which, by the way, currently sports a forward-looking dividend yield of 6.8%. And that's based on dividend payments that are far more protected than the stock's recent action would suggest.
Lyft
Finally, I'm adding ride-hailing name Lyft(NASDAQ: LYFT) to my list of five favorite stocks to buy now.
Yes, I know Uber Technologies is the leader of the North American ride-hailing industry, which it largely helped develop. Bloomberg says it controls roughly three-fourths of the all-important U.S. market, in fact. Uber's also been profitable for far longer than Lyft, and is still growing its bottom line in step with industrywide growth. Last quarter's year-over-year revenue growth of 18% improved per-share profits from $0.47 in Q2 of last year to $0.63 per share this time around, extending well-established trends on both fronts.
Uber's stock is also pretty darn expensive right now, though, thanks to what's been more than a 300% run-up from 2022's low to its recently hit record high.
Lyft shares, conversely, haven't budged since crashing in 2022 despite the company's swing to what should be sustained and improving profitability. Lyft's top line is expected to grow at an average of about 13% per year at least through 2027, when its yearly earnings are expected to reach $0.78 per share. The stock's current price is only about 20 times that amount, which is a bargain for a growth stock making as much profit progress as this one is now. The market's going to connect these dots sooner or later, and probably sooner than later.

On Friday, the company said it would set up a local team in India and open a corporate office in the capital, New Delhi, in the coming months. The move builds on OpenAI’s recent hiring efforts in the region. In April 2024, the company appointed former Truecaller and Meta executive Pragya Misra as its public policy and partnerships lead in India. OpenAI also brought on former Twitter India head Rishi Jaitly as a senior advisor to help facilitate discussions with the Indian government on AI policy.
India — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China — is a natural fit for OpenAI, which is competing with tech giants like Google and Meta, as well as AI upstarts like Perplexity, all looking to tap into the country’s massive user base.
The company said that it has started hiring a local team to “focus on strengthening relationships with local partners, governments, businesses, developers, and academic institutions.” It plans to get feedback from Indian users to make its products relevant for the local audience and even build features and tools specifically for the country.
“Opening our first office and building a local team is an important first step in our commitment to make advanced AI more accessible across the country and to build AI for India, and with India,” said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a statement.
OpenAI also announced it would host its first Education Summit in India this month and its first Developer Day in the country later this year.
While India is clearly an essential market for OpenAI, the company faces key challenges — including how to convert free users into paying subscribers. Like other major AI players, it must navigate the monetization hurdle in a price-sensitive South Asian market.
Earlier this week, the company introduced its sub-$5 ChatGPT plan called ChatGPT Go, priced at ₹399 per month (approximately $4.75), making it the first ChatGPT plan in India to attract the masses. This came just days after arch-rival Perplexity partnered with Indian telco giant Bharti Airtel to give Airtel’s more than 360 million subscribers access to Perplexity Pro for 12 months.
OpenAI also faces challenges in integrating with Indian businesses. In November, Indian news agency Asian News International (ANI) sued OpenAI for allegedly using its copyrighted news content without permission. A group of Indian publishers joined that case in January.",5a1d160060d95b6553bdab1cb2219c18,trafilatura

It is the only global region where digital wallets accounted for the majority of both in-store and e-commerce transactions in 2024. More striking still, emerging markets like Thailand are driving this innovation, developing breakthrough solutions that achieve remarkable scale while addressing financial inclusion. This entirely challenges the notion that payment innovation typically flows from advanced economies to emerging markets.
The rise of digital payments where cash is king
Cash usage across APAC has dropped sharply over the past decade as consumers, merchants and policymakers have sought to embrace digital payments. Leading this transformation are China (5% cash usage) and South Korea (7%), while emerging markets like the Philippines (41%) and Thailand (31%) remain more cash dependent. This matters because cash reliance disproportionately affects lower-income and unbanked populations - in Thailand, 63% of adults fall into these categories.
Yet Thailand stands at a crucial turning point. While there continues to be a high reliance on cash, Thai consumers are rapidly adopting digital alternatives, with account-to-account (A2A) transactions now comprising 44% of spending, driven largely by the success of PromptPay. Although cash remains a key entry point into the financial ecosystem in Thailand, digital payments are playing an increasingly important role in driving access and inclusion.
Emerging markets are driving innovation in financial inclusion
Initiatives backed by public authorities across emerging markets are reshaping the global payments playbook. There is often the assumption that innovation in financial inclusion solely originates from advanced economies. In reality, emerging markets are often at the forefront of innovative payment solutions that meet local needs and, in turn, influence the global landscape.
In Thailand, policymakers are committed to accelerating digital payment adoption, with an ambitious target to halve cash circulation by next year through wallet-based payments and interoperable QR codes. Efforts are already underway to achieve this. In 2024, digital wallets started being used as a distribution mechanism for social benefits, targeting traditionally cash-reliant communities. Through state-owned Krungthai Bank's Paotang super app, eligible citizens receive aid via the ""g-wallet"" feature. This move has directly introduced millions of users to digital payment infrastructure while delivering essential financial support.
Similar public-led innovations are transforming payments across other emerging markets. In India, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has transformed the country's payment landscape by facilitating instant transactions. As of 2024, UPI dominated with 58% of point-of-sale and 64% of e-commerce transaction value, highlighting its pivotal role in expanding digital payment access for a wide range of Indian consumers. Similarly, Brazil's Pix system has rapidly gained traction, with three in four Brazilians now using it to make payments.
These examples demonstrate that public-led initiatives combined with the absence of entrenched credit card systems have allowed emerging markets to jump straight to innovative payment solutions and rewrite the global standard.
An opportunity for payment providers, merchants and end-consumers
The shift toward digital payments is creating new demands and opportunities for payment providers and merchants. Consumers now expect instant, seamless transactions across all channels. Now more than ever, those at the heart of global payments must have the right regional presence and market understanding to deliver optimal payment experiences.
In Thailand, merchants must be able to accommodate multiple payment methods, including local solutions like LINE Pay, TrueMoney, PromptPay and online banking. Success in this environment requires support from payment providers that can seamlessly handle these diverse payment types while maintaining high authorisation rates, strong fraud protection and domestic settlement capabilities in Thai Baht.
Ultimately, it is not about reinventing the wheel in emerging markets; it is about payment providers paying attention to local ecosystem, which in turn helps to broaden financial access and subsequently drive business growth in the region.
Payment systems will drive forward financial inclusion
The very fact that digital payments adoption can boost GDP-growth by 6-8% underscores the transformative role payments will play in economic development across emerging markets. Ultimately, when payment systems prioritise accessibility and local preferences, they become catalysts for broader economic participation, enabling entire communities to engage with the formal financial system.

The former kickboxer and self-styled entrepreneur opened a three-times leveraged short on YZY at $0.8524, according to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. With the token now trading near $0.77, his position remains in the green.
But while the trade looks like a win, Tate’s broader track record in crypto markets is far less flattering. On Hyperliquid, a decentralized perpetuals exchange, he has made 80 trades to date.
Only 29 were profitable, giving him a win rate of just 36.25% and total losses of around $699,000, Lookonchain data shows.
Concentrated Holdings Fuel Sharp Rise And Faster Collapse
YZY itself has mirrored the hype-fueled rise and spectacular falls that often define celebrity-linked tokens. The coin soared to a $3b market capitalization within 40 minutes of launch this week, propelled by Ye’s star power and broader speculative frenzy.
That momentum quickly evaporated, with the token plunging almost 23% in the past 24 hours alone to $0.7743, according to CoinGecko. Its market cap now sits near $100.3m.
Behind the price swings lies a concentration of power. Blockchain data shows that over 94% of supply was in the hands of insiders at launch. A single multisig wallet controlled 87% before retail investors could meaningfully participate.
Those insiders appear to have booked huge gains. One wallet, labeled “6MNWV8,” spent 450,611 USDC to buy 1.29m tokens at $0.35 each, later selling most for 1.39m USDC and retaining holdings still worth $600,000.
Another whale put in 12,170 SOL, valued at $2.28m, for 2.67m tokens and continues to hold an unrealized gain of about $6m.
Hype-Driven Ventures Keep Tate In The Spotlight Despite Losses
Tate’s role as a trader has often drawn attention, not least because of his own ventures in memecoins. His Daddy Tate ($DADDY) token launched on Solana, reaching a $124.57m market cap by July 2024 before collapsing to $17.79m a year later. On-chain records later showed 11 wallets bought up 20% of the supply just before Tate began promoting it.
He has also linked his name to Andrew Tate’s Dog ($G), another short-lived attempt to capitalize on the meme token trend. Critics argue these projects lean more on celebrity hype than sustainable communities or technology.
Even his leveraged bets have carried controversy. Tate once claimed a 138.5% profit on a 25x long position in Ethereum, but blockchain analysis later revealed steep net losses.

Investbybit Pty Ltd, Binance’s Australian arm, has 28 days to nominate external auditors for AUSTRAC’s consideration and selection following regulatory engagement across the priority sector.
Global Exchange Fails to Meet Local Compliance Standards
The mandatory audit requirement stems from multiple compliance issues, including Binance’s limited independent review scope relative to its size and business offerings, high staff turnover, and lack of local resourcing and senior management oversight.
AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas emphasized that global operators must understand local money laundering and terrorism financing risks rather than applying generic systems across multiple jurisdictions.
“Businesses can have systems and processes that apply to multiple jurisdictions – but they need to reflect local regulatory requirements. The systems must adapt to the regulatory requirements, not the other way around,” he said.
The action against Binance follows AUSTRAC’s broader crypto enforcement campaign, with authorities targeting 13 remittance and digital currency exchange providers over compliance issues while investigating 50 additional providers.
The agency has cancelled, suspended, and refused renewals for nine providers that failed to meet Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act obligations.
AUSTRAC Escalates Nationwide Crypto Enforcement Campaign
Australian regulators have dramatically expanded crypto oversight through systematic enforcement actions targeting non-compliant exchanges and money laundering networks.
AUSTRAC established a crypto task force in December to address violations by crypto ATM operators, identifying worrying trends in suspicious activities and transactions linked to scams and fraud.
The agency contacted 427 registered digital currency exchange providers that appear inactive, warning they risk deregistration if they fail to withdraw voluntarily.
Many registered platforms have ceased operations but remain listed, potentially exposing the system to criminal exploitation by bad actors seeking legitimacy.
AUSTRAC plans to launch a publicly searchable register enabling consumers to verify whether crypto exchanges are officially registered and under regulatory scrutiny.
The initiative addresses growing concerns about criminals exploiting legitimate registrations to operate fraudulent platforms.",19f160e292f5cc694461eeb34267d5e5,trafilatura

Find out which banks are offering the best MMA rates right now. The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate three times in 2024 for a total reduction of one percentage point. As a result, deposit interest rates — including money market account rates — have been falling.
It’s more important than ever to compare MMA rates and ensure you earn as much as possible on your balance.
A look at the best money market account rates today
Although money market account rates are elevated by historical standards, the national average rate for MMAs is just 0.59%, according to the FDIC. The good news: Top high-yield money market accounts offer well over 4% APY — more than six times the national average.
That’s why it’s important to shop around before opening a money market account. Interest rates vary widely, but there are several banks (in particular, online banks) and credit unions with highly competitive offers.
Here’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today:
Additionally, the table below features some of the best savings and money market account rates available today from our verified partners.
This embedded content is not available in your region.
Why do online banks have the best money market account rates?
Online banks operate exclusively via the web. This significantly reduces their overhead costs, so they’re able to pass those savings onto customers in the form of high deposit rates and low fees. If you’re searching for the best money market account rates, online banks are a great place to start.
That said, online banks aren’t the only place you can find savings accounts with rates of 4% to 5% APY. Credit unions are not-for-profit financial cooperatives, and are also know for providing competitive rates and fewer fees. Many credit unions have certain requirements that must be met in order to become a member, though there are some that allow just about anyone to join.

Should you open a money market account?
Money market accounts can be a great option for short-term savings goals, like building an emergency fund or setting aside money for an upcoming expense. They generally offer higher interest rates than regular savings accounts, and they provide easier access to your money compared to some other options like certificates of deposit (CDs).
Money market accounts are also considered low-risk, and they are FDIC-insured up to the standard $250,000 per depositor, per institution. This makes them safer than money market funds, which can be subject to market risk.
However, keep in mind that many money market accounts require a minimum balance to open the account and earn the highest advertised rate. If you can’t maintain this balance, you might incur fees or miss out on the best rates.
And although you can generally access your funds as needed, MMAs may limit the number of transactions you can make each month. If you need frequent access to your money, this might be a consideration.
Read more: Is there a penalty for withdrawing from your money market account?
When a money market account makes sense:
-
You want to earn more interest than a regular savings account without locking up your money in a CD.
-
You can maintain the minimum balance to avoid fees.
-
You want to keep funds easily accessible for emergencies or near-term expenses.
Frequently asked questions — money market rates
What are money market interest rates right now?
Currently, the average money market account rate is 0.63%. However, several high-yield accounts pay upwards of 4% or more. If you're considering opening a money market account, be sure to shop around and compare rates.
Where can I get 12% interest?
There is no one account or investment that guarantees a 12% return. However, if your goal is to earn a strong return on your money and grow your wealth significantly, investing in market securities such as stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds is the best strategy for doing so. The stock market returns about 10% per year, on average.
If you aren't sure where to start, it can be helpful to speak with a financial advisor about your financial goals and priorities. Alternatively, you can sign up with a robo-advisor, which is an automated, cost-effective option for managing your portfolio.

Would alternative assets help or hurt?
There are several positives to this change that could unlock new opportunities for retirement savers. However, everyday investors may want to proceed cautiously, or at least do thorough due diligence.
Pros
Supporters argue that diversifying with private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrency could improve portfolio diversification and long-term growth.
For example, Vanguard estimates that private equity could generate annual returns around 9%, outperforming typical public-market funds.
Access to traditionally exclusive investments may also expand. Firms like BlackRock, Apollo, and KKR have historically limited private assets to institutional or high-net-worth investors. Now, platforms like Empower are preparing to offer them through target-date funds in retirement plans.
The order may accelerate the inclusion of crypto-based funds or ETFs in 401(k) investment menus.
Cons
There are inherently higher costs and lower returns associated with the alternative investments in question. For example, private equity firms often charge management fees around 2.5% annually, plus 20% of profits above a set threshold. By contrast, passive index funds recently averaged fees of just 0.11%.
These assets are also less liquid and harder to value. They often lack regular reporting and can be difficult to sell quickly. This potentially makes them riskier and less transparent, especially for everyday investors without the tools or experience to evaluate them.",5faa7082ab45ebc3e589f4b89fab9b19,trafilatura

Tesla stock is down more than 21% since the start of 2025.
-
Those who have held Tesla stock for three years have recognized only modest gains compared to those who bought shares a decade ago.
-
While there are outspoken bears who are down on Tesla stock, there are also plenty of bulls who think the stock can still charge higher.
To say that it has been an interesting year for Elon Musk would be a gross understatement. From his tumultuous time in Washington, D.C. to his decisions to start and then not start a political party, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) shareholders have clearly disapproved of Musk's exploits since the start of 2025. These factors and questions around Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) business have sent the stock down more than 21% as of this writing.
But how have investors who bought Tesla stock several years ago made out? Let's consider what an investment of $10,000 from three years ago would be worth today.
Recent shareholders have endured quite the winding road with Tesla stock
Disrupting the automotive industry is hardly easy. Recognizing this, early investors in Tesla had faith that Elon Musk was steering the EV maker in the right direction -- and they were rewarded in 2020 when the company reported its first annual profit. Shortly thereafter, Tesla stock charged higher in concert with the company's growing profitability and strong free cash flow.
Those metrics have both reversed course over the past few years, however, and investors have been much less enthusiastic about the company's prospects.
Investors who've parked the EV maker's stock in their portfolios for a decade have seen their investments surge 1,900% higher. But those who have only held Tesla stock for the past three years have hardly fared as well. Those who invested $10,000 on August 22, 2022, have seen their investment grow in value to about $10,880 as of this writing.
Has the time to power your portfolio with Tesla stock passed?
Since Tesla stock first began trading on public markets, skeptics have dismissed Elon Musk and doubted his overly ambitious projections. Musk has often proved them wrong, though not in every instance.
While Tesla stock has struggled this year, it would be foolhardy to write the company off altogether. Even as the core EV business struggles, there are plenty of Tesla bulls who believe the stock still has plenty of growth potential.

Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey says there's only one way to choose between Bitcoin and Ethereum—and it has little to do with technology. Instead, he frames the debate as a question about the kind of world we want to build for future generations.
The Speed vs Security Showdown
Dorsey's analysis, delivered in a YouTube short that continues to resonate with crypto investors, cuts straight to the heart of cryptocurrency's biggest philosophical divide. According to the tech entrepreneur, there’s a fundamental trade-off that every crypto investor must understand: you can prioritize speed and efficiency, or you can prioritize decentralization and security—but you can’t maximize both.

“Ethereum is very, very fast in terms of development speed,” Dorsey explained, acknowledging the platform’s rapid innovation cycle and constant stream of updates. This agility has made Ethereum the go-to platform for decentralized finance , non-fungible tokens , and countless other blockchain applications.
Bitcoin, by contrast, takes a dramatically different approach. Dorsey describes it as “slower” but emphasizes this isn’t a bug—it’s a feature. Bitcoin’s development team is “very deliberate about what goes in and what stays out,” prioritizing stability and security over rapid feature deployment.
The Great Granddaughter Test
Perhaps the most striking moment in Dorsey’s commentary comes when he frames the choice in generational terms. “What world do you want your great-granddaughter to live in—one that is safe or one that is fast?” he asks.

This isn’t just philosophical rhetoric. Dorsey is highlighting a critical consideration that many retail investors overlook: the long-term implications of the technological foundations we’re building today. While Ethereum’s speed and efficiency make it attractive for immediate use cases, Dorsey argues that Bitcoin’s emphasis on decentralization and security creates a more robust foundation for the future.",e18f5c7c33169864f4d202166d59ab6e,trafilatura

Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it
Josephine and her husband are comfortable financially, and can afford the $30,000 gift she proposes. She hopes it will enable her son-in-law to buy a new car and pay down some student debt.
Ramsey said that both Josephine and her husband are neglecting to answer a key question: ""What's best for the kid?""
The problem with being an enabler
Ramsey acknowledged that Josephine has good intentions. As she explained, her daughter and son-in-law are not asking for money. She just feels that she wants to help.
The daughter and son-in-law live frugally in a modest house, and have no car payments. However, the son-in-law has been driving a ""beater"" for the past few years and the daughter's car needs to be replaced. He also has a lot of student debt to get ahead of.
Ramsey asked Josephine how much her daughter and son-in-law earn to help figure out why they would need her financial assistance. When she told him they earn $180,000 per year, he laughed and said, ""You've got to be kidding me.""
Josephine explained that they have two kids, which eats up a lot of their income. But Ramsey didn't buy it.
""They're pissing their money away,"" he insisted.
In terms of answering the question of whether Josephine and her husband should gift their daughter money, Ramsey said, ""Neither one of you are right. Both of you are wrong.""

BestPlaces data shows that Michigan is about 8.5% cheaper than the average U.S. state in terms of living costs, and that a minimum annual income of $41,760 is needed for a family to live comfortably. So in Ramsey's mind, there's no reason Josephine’s daughter and son-in-law can't afford to buy a modest car and pay off their student debt.",811a0b9afbe2640b404041598f056b41,trafilatura

His legacy will continue through the conglomerate he has led for six decades and turned into a wealth-building force of nature. The stock price has compounded at an annualized rate of 19.9% from 1965 to 2024, giving it a total return exceeding 5,500,000%. That would have turned an initial investment of just $100 back in 1965 into $5.5 million, so it's safe to say that Berkshire has been a millionaire-maker stock.
But what might the future hold for long-term investors looking to add Berkshire Hathaway to their portfolios today? Can the stock still help make you a millionaire?
Why Berkshire Hathaway may struggle to repeat its past successes
The largest obstacle to Berkshire Hathaway continuing to mint new millionaires is its own success. The company has a market cap just north of $1 trillion today, making it the world's 10th-most-valuable company.
Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company with multiple operating subsidiaries in industries that span insurance, railroads, energy, utilities, manufacturing, and more. Additionally, it has a diversified stock portfolio worth approximately $300 billion, plus another $340 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet.
In other words, Berkshire consists of many smaller pieces that add up to make one massive parent company. So to grow Berkshire Hathaway's value from its current level to the extent that it could make someone a millionaire -- multiplying its market cap by at least four or five times -- the company will need to hit some home runs. For example, it could make another massively successful investment like its Apple stake was, or it might acquire some high-growth businesses.
But even for the best investing professionals, spotting such opportunities isn't easy, and even if Berkshire does so and boosts its market valuation by a factor of five over the next 15 to 25 years, that would still be nowhere near the types of returns the stock has historically delivered. Simply put, Berkshire Hathaway is a legendary success story, but it's likely too big to produce such rapid growth anymore.
Expect changes in how Berkshire Hathaway operates
One way Berkshire Hathaway may be able to create additional shareholder value would be to deploy some of that $340 billion in cash it has amassed. Berkshire Hathaway doesn't pay dividends and does buy back its own stock, but it's careful about when it does so. Buffett is famously focused on valuations, so he only repurchases shares when he thinks they are trading below their intrinsic value.
Could Berkshire Hathaway initiate a dividend once Buffett steps down? He will remain chairman of the board, but perhaps he will relinquish such decisions to Abel. Dividends can boost investors' returns, and shareholders can reinvest them to buy more shares and generate more dividend income.
But the more cash Berkshire Hathaway sends out the door, the less capital it has to invest in acquisitions and investments to grow the business. It's a delicate balance that may fall on the new CEO to strike. I suspect that Berkshire Hathaway may initiate a dividend. Still, if it does, its payout might be modest, presuming that Abel will want to avoid immediately diverging too far from the management philosophy that made the conglomerate what it is today.
What does the future hold for Berkshire Hathaway?
Never say never, but the reality is that the odds are against Berkshire Hathaway stock single-handedly turning any reasonable sum of money into a million dollars anytime soon.
Not only has the company reached a size that somewhat inhibits its capacity for further growth, but Abel still has to show how well he'll fill Buffett's shoes. Certainly, Abel will have some big decisions to make about what to do with Berkshire Hathaway's massive cash hoard, and those decisions will likely impact how the stock performs over the next five to 10 years.
What investors can expect is for Berkshire Hathaway to excel. It can easily sustain steady growth for years with its sprawling empire of business assets that touch almost every corner of the economy, so the stock could certainly be a pillar within a retail investor's diversified portfolio.

How Can You Earn $100 Per Month As A Coca-Cola Investor?
If you want to make $100 per month — $1,200 annually — from Coca-Cola dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $41,522, which is around 590 shares at $70.41 each.
Understanding the dividend yield calculations: When making an estimate, you need two key variables — the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (2.89% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.0289 = $41,522 to generate an income of $100 per month.
You can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock.
The dividend yield can change over time. This is the outcome of fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis.

For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40).",854b27a00b284d0b87f8184a578049e1,trafilatura

When you get a mortgage, you have to choose between two types of interest rates. The first is a fixed interest rate, which remains the same for your entire loan term. The second? That’s an adjustable mortgage rate, which changes throughout your loan term and causes your monthly payment to increase or decrease. Fixed-rate mortgages are typically more popular, but adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have recently gained traction. So, should you also be considering an adjustable-rate mortgage?
This embedded content is not available in your region.

Market conditions point toward 'yes'
If you’re just looking at the broader market, conditions are ripe for taking out an ARM. In the short term, using an ARM instead of a fixed-rate mortgage in today’s housing market can save you quite a bit on your rate and monthly payment.
According to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), the current average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages as of late August was 6.68%. On a $300,000 mortgage loan, your monthly payment toward principal and interest would be $1,932.
The average rate on 5/1 ARMs was 6.01%, putting your monthly mortgage payment at $1,801. That’s a savings of over $200 per month (at least for the first five years, before your rate resets).
Future market projections also make ARMs a worthwhile choice. The Federal Reserve is poised to reduce rates later this year, and according to both Fannie Mae and the MBA, mortgage rates are expected to decline steadily over the next couple of years. Yahoo Finance’s five-year mortgage rate forecast also projects a decline.
Should those predictions come to fruition, rates on ARMs would also come down too. Your interest rate would fall at your ARM’s next adjustment period, and so would your monthly payment.
However, no one has a crystal ball about what long-term mortgage rates will do. While interest rates are poised to decrease gradually, there’s no guarantee.
Learn more: Fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgage — Which should you choose?
Your personal situation may say otherwise
Market conditions are only one piece of the puzzle, though. To determine if an ARM is a smart move, you need to consider your personal finances, goals, and other factors.
How long do you expect to live in this house and have the mortgage? Will you sell the home or refinance your mortgage before the rate on your ARM can start to adjust?
Most ARMs have a set rate for the first three, five, seven, or 10 years, and after that introductory rate period, it can move up or down based on the index it’s tied to. As long as you plan to be out of the loan before the end of your intro rate period, you’re safe from any potential mortgage rate increases.
You should also consider your financial situation, specifically your income. Do you have a consistent income you can rely on each month, or does it vary monthly or seasonally? Do you expect to earn more or less in a few years? Is your job stable?
The answers to these questions can help you decide if you can handle shifting mortgage payments over the years. If your budget is already tight with the introductory ARM rate, and you don’t expect to earn much more in a few years, you could be setting yourself up for financial strain.
While market conditions currently point to rates falling in the next few years, things could change significantly over time. You will need to make sure you’ll have the funds to cover a higher payment should rates go up later.
Run the numbers, and talk to a professional
ARMs have caps that limit how high your rate can go initially, at each adjustment period, and over the life of the loan. So, your best bet is to apply for the home loan, check out the terms and rate caps a mortgage lender offers, and use these numbers to determine your absolute maximum payment. This information can help you decide whether an ARM fits into your budget — both now and in the long run.
If you’re still not sure what the right move is, consider talking to a mortgage professional or financial advisor. They can look at your financial picture and make recommendations that fit your goals and budget.
Is now a good time to get an adjustable-rate mortgage? FAQs
Is a 5-year ARM a good idea in 2025?
If you’re just looking at market conditions, 2025 can be a good time to take out an ARM. First of all, average rates are quite a bit lower than those on fixed-rate mortgages, which can save you money on your monthly payment. Second, rates are expected to decrease in the coming years. This would result in a lower rate and monthly mortgage payment.
What is the downside to getting an ARM?
The biggest downside of an ARM is its unpredictability. With ARMs, your interest rate can rise or fall over time, taking your payment up or down with it. This makes it hard to budget for and, in some cases, may make it hard to stay on top of payments. Falling behind on payments could put you at risk of losing your house to foreclosure.
Will we ever see 3% mortgage rates again?
While it’s possible to see 3% mortgage rates again, it’s not likely. The bargain-basement rates seen during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted from the Federal Reserve zeroing out its federal funds rate — the rate that other interest rates tend to follow — in hopes of spurring economic activity. Barring any big downturn like that again, those ultra-low rates probably aren’t in the cards.
Is an ARM a bad idea right now?
An ARM might be a bad idea right now if you have a variable income that would make it hard to handle higher monthly payments should your rate increase down the line. A fixed mortgage rate could also be better if you plan to stay in your home for the long haul, because the fixed payments are easier to budget for. You also might not want to take out an ARM if mortgage rates are projected to rise over the next few years.

Smart people with advanced degrees often struggle financially while less educated entrepreneurs build substantial wealth.
The problem isn’t lack of intelligence. It’s psychology.
“There’s a critical distinction between academic intelligence and financial intelligence,” the Rich Dad team explained in the blog post. Academic intelligence involves memorizing and analyzing information within established systems. Financial intelligence means understanding money’s psychological dynamics and taking calculated risks despite uncertainty.
The Numbers Don’t Lie
The statistics back up Kiyosaki’s team’s observations. According to the blog post, 67% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, including many with advanced degrees. Medical doctors have one of the highest bankruptcy rates among professionals despite substantial incomes. Lawyers, engineers and MBA graduates often struggle with debt despite their academic achievements.
The difference comes down to mindset. The educational system trains people to seek security, follow rules and avoid mistakes, according to the blog post. Students learn to find the “right” answer and fear failure. This creates excellent employees but often struggles to create wealth builders.
The Five Psychological Traps That Keep Smart People Broke
Here’s a closer look at some traps many intelligent people face:
Analysis Paralysis in Investing
Highly educated people often research investment opportunities to death. They create elaborate spreadsheets and study every possible variable before making decisions. This need for certainty paralyzes them because financial markets are inherently uncertain.
The blog shared a typical example: a software engineer who spends months researching real estate markets and analyzing cap rates. By the time they feel “ready” to invest, property prices have increased, and the opportunity has passed. Less educated investors who understood the basic principle of buying income-generating assets made profitable purchases months earlier.
Perfectionism Preventing Action
Students get penalized for mistakes, creating perfectionists who struggle with trial-and-error learning. However, when you’re building wealth, making mistakes means you’re learning.
The idea is: If you’re too busy waiting for the “perfect” business idea, you might wait forever without getting started.
Overconfidence in Complex Strategies
Intelligence can breed overconfidence, leading people to believe they need sophisticated strategies to make major money.
In day trading, smart people sometimes think they can beat the market just by being clever and doing a lot of analysis. But the blog argues this can actually lead to losing money, because success in trading is more about staying calm and keeping things simple.
Neglecting Basic Financial Fundamentals
People with fancy degrees are often smart, but they don’t always understand everyday money stuff. They can do hard math, but might not get things like budgeting, debt or how to pay less in taxes. They focus on making more money instead of using it wisely.
This happens because they think making a lot of money means they’re building wealth. But as they earn more, they also spend more.
Emotional Decision-Making
Perhaps most surprisingly, intelligent people often make emotional financial decisions despite their analytical capabilities. They panic during market downturns, chase investment trends and make impulsive purchases.
This happens because money triggers deep psychological responses like fear, greed and pride. Intelligence doesn’t eliminate these emotions.
The Brain Science Behind Poor Money Decisions
The blog explained that neuroscience illuminates why intelligence doesn’t guarantee financial success. The brain processes financial decisions through multiple systems: the analytical neocortex and the emotional limbic system. Under stress, the limbic system often overrides rational thinking.
The brain’s risk assessment mechanisms evolved for physical survival, not financial markets. When faced with potential financial loss, the amygdala triggers fight-or-flight responses designed for immediate physical threats. This system interprets market volatility as danger, prompting protective actions that often damage long-term wealth building.
The wealthy develop what psychologists call “emotional regulation” around money. They recognize their emotional responses without being controlled by them. They understand that market fluctuations are normal, not threats to their survival.
How To Rewire Your Wealth Psychology
The Rich Dad team outlined specific strategies for overcoming mental blocks:
Practice Making Quick Financial Decisions
Instead of researching investments for months, set deadlines for decisions and act within that timeframe. This builds comfort with uncertainty and reduces analysis paralysis.
Reframe Failure as Education
Each financial mistake provides valuable feedback about markets, timing and personal psychology. Wealthy individuals often maintain “failure resumes” documenting their mistakes and lessons learned.
Develop Emotional Awareness Around Money
Notice physical sensations when making financial decisions. Anxiety, excitement or fear signal emotional involvement that may compromise judgment. Learning to recognize these feelings means you can focus on more objective decision making.
Build Wealth-Building Habits
Successful wealth building depends more on consistent habits than brilliant strategies. Essential habits include paying yourself first through automatic investments, tracking expenses and continuously educating yourself about money and investing.",365ca5a96ada265cf1d9755bb57f00c5,trafilatura

The real estate sector has underperformed the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) significantly over the past decade. The Vanguard Real Estate ETF (NYSEMKT: VNQ) delivered a 77% total return for investors over the past decade, compared with a stellar 290% return from the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).
Invest in Gold
It isn't necessarily that real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are doing poorly as businesses. They aren't. Rather, the underperformance can be blamed on two factors.
First is that fact that the S&P 500 -- and especially the megacap technology stocks -- has done incredibly well. And the second reason is interest rates.
Why interest rates can hurt REIT stock performance
REITs are some of the most rate-sensitive stocks in the entire market, and for a few reasons:
-
REITs depend on borrowed money for growth, and higher rates makes borrowing less attractive.
-
Commercial real estate values are based on expected rental income potential, adjusted for risk-free rates. In other words, rising rates can push commercial property values lower.
-
Higher interest rates can cause an investor rotation out of riskier investments like REITs and into CDs, Treasury securities, and others.
The biggest reason to buy now?
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to gradually lower rates, and chairman Jerome Powell's recent Jackson Hole speech cleared the way for this to start in September.
In the previous section, I mentioned three reasons why rising rates are bad for REITs. Well, they all work the other way too. If rates start to fall, it could create a better growth environment for REITs, cause investors to rotate money into the sector, and generally be an upward catalyst.

How about a monopoly on a critical technology that will fuel a $700 billion industry for years to come?
That's ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) in a nutshell. The semiconductor equipment manufacturer has a lock on the lithography market, with a dominant market share and no viable competition for its extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography technology.
ASML's High NA EUV systems, which push EUV technology further, are being adopted by Intel for its future process nodes. Foundry market leader TSMC has been slower to jump on board, sticking with standard EUV systems for now, but the company will eventually make the switch when it runs into the limits of the older technology. ASML's top-of-the-line High NA EUV systems are pricey, costing around $400 million per unit.
With ASML dominating its core market, growth investors with $1,000 available should seriously consider the semiconductor equipment giant.
Wildly profitable
ASML's financial performance can be volatile, ebbing and flowing with capital spending from its large customers. The company sold 67 new lithography systems in the second quarter of 2025, generating 7.7 billion euros of revenue in the process. Around 2.1 euros of revenue came from installed base management services, while the rest came from lithography systems. Total revenue and the number of system sales were down slightly from the first quarter.
ASML managed a gross margin of 53.7% in the second quarter, and it produced net income of 2.3 billion euros. That's good for a net income margin of nearly 30%. The company is seeing progress in the memory chip market, and it shipped its first TWINSCAN EXE:5200B High NA EUV system in the second quarter. This new system is the second iteration of the company's High NA EUV technology, which enables high-volume production.
ASML expects to grow revenue by 15% this year. In 2026, the company isn't yet providing an outlook due to high levels of uncertainty. The macroeconomic environment, tariffs, and geopolitical developments are all wild cards that could impact sales.
Intel is another issue. The chip giant is an early adopter of ASML's High NA EUV systems, but future sales of those systems will depend on Intel getting its next-generation process nodes into volume production on time.
While these headwinds could hurt growth next year, ASML will still benefit from the long-term growth of the semiconductor industry.
Benefiting from the AI boom
Global AI infrastructure spending is booming, pushing up demand for cutting-edge data center GPUs that require the most advanced manufacturing processes. ASML's EUV systems play a critical role, and as long as the AI boom continues, ASML should continue to see a strong tailwind from the artificial intelligence (AI) industry.
Competition between TSMC, Intel, and Samsung could benefit ASML, as all three companies look to win a piece of the AI accelerator market. TSMC dominates the production of AI chips for now, but Samsung recently won a deal with Tesla to manufacture the carmaker's next-generation AI chips, and Intel needs to win external customers for its next-gen Intel 14A process node for its foundry business to remain viable.
While there is some risk that the AI boom slows down, a more competitive foundry business is ultimately a good thing for ASML.
A reasonable valuation
ASML stock trades around 27 times the average analyst estimate for 2025 earnings. While ASML's growth can be inconsistent, the company's dominant position in the lithography market and its sky-high profit margins more than justify the stock's price tag.
2026 may be a slower year for ASML as it reckons with a tough economic environment. In the long run, though, this dominant semiconductor equipment manufacturer looks like the perfect stock for a growth investing portfolio.

Not really , analysts say . ",2025-08-23 13:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump is injecting nearly $9 billion into Intel in exchange for a 9.9% equity stake. But the money — which the struggling chipmaker was slated to receive anyway under a federal funding act — will not be enough for its contract-chipmaking business to flourish, analysts said.
What Intel needs is external customers for its so-called cutting-edge 14A manufacturing process - a tough ask, at least in the short term.
CEO Lip Bu Tan, who took the top job in March, warned last month that the company may have to quit the chip contracting business if it does not land any big clients. ""Going forward, our investment in Intel 14A will be based on confirmed customer commitments,"" he said.
Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights, underlined the economic rationale of Tan's message: “Intel must secure enough customers' volume to go to production for its 18A and 14A nodes to make its foundry arm economically viable,” he said, referring to Intel's manufacturing processes.
“We don't think any government investment will change the fate of its foundry arm if they cannot secure enough customers.”
The chipmaker, once synonymous with American chipmaking prowess, has stumbled due to years of management missteps, ceding its manufacturing lead to Taiwan's TSMC and losing out on the race for artificial intelligence chips to Nvidia.
Now, at an impasse, Intel needs to prove it is capable of making advanced chips to attract customers. Reuters has reported that Intel’s current 18A process - less advanced than 14A - is facing problems with yield, the measure of how many chips printed are good enough to make available to customers.
Large chip factories including TSMC swallow the cost of poor yields during the first iterations of the process when working with customers like Apple. For Intel, which reported net losses for six straight quarters, that's hard to do and still turn a profit.
“If the yield is bad then new customers won't use Intel Foundry, so it really won't fix the technical aspect of the company,” said Ryuta Makino, analyst at Gabelli Funds, which holds Intel stock.
Makino, who believes that Intel can ultimately produce chips at optimal yields, views the deal as a net negative for Intel compared with just receiving the funding under the CHIPS Act as originally promised under the Biden Administration.
""This isn't free money,"" he said.
The federal government will not take a seat on Intel's board and has agreed to vote with the company's board on matters that need shareholder approval, Intel said. But this voting agreement comes with ""limited exceptions"" and the government is getting Intel's shares at a 17.5% discount to their closing price on Friday.
The stake will make the U.S. government Intel's biggest shareholder, though neither Trump nor Intel disclosed when the transaction would happen.
Intel's shares closed up 5.5% on Friday on news of the government's equity stake, but fell 1% in post-market trading after the chipmaker detailed the terms of the deal. They have risen 23% so far this year as Tan has announced huge job cuts.
'MARGINALLY WEAKER APPETITE'
The investment, the latest extraordinary intervention by the White House in corporate America, is consistent with the president's desire to boost domestic production and bring back jobs. It follows comments from Trump earlier this month calling Tan ""highly conflicted"" due to his ties to Chinese firms and demanding Tan's resignation. However, Trump soon changed his mind about Tan.
Some analysts say Intel could benefit from the government's support, including in building out factories.
Intel has said it is investing more than $100 billion to expand its U.S. factories and expects to begin high-volume chip production later this year at its Arizona plant.
""To have access to capital and a new partial owner that wants to see you succeed are both important,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel.
The government's $8.9 billion investment is in addition to the $2.2 billion in grants Intel has received to date, making for a total investment of $11.1 billion, Intel said in a statement.
The government will also receive a five-year warrant, at $20 per share for an additional five percent of Intel stock, exercisable if Intel ceases to own at least 51% of the foundry business.
""On one hand, a government stake could be viewed as a strong signal that Intel is 'too big to fail.' On the other hand, people are concerned about potential governance implications and how that may impact the company’s ability to act in the best interest of shareholders,"" Andy Li, a senior analyst at CreditSights.
""The company is not receiving incremental government funding ... that indicates a marginally weaker appetite of the U.S. government to provide support.""
The investment follows a $2 billion infusion from SoftBank announced earlier this week.
""This is a great deal for America and, also, a great deal for Intel. Building leading edge semiconductors and chips, which is what Intel does, is fundamental to the future of our nation,"" Trump said on Friday.

Multiple headwinds have been shared across the life science sector, but either those headwinds are temporary, or Danaher is better positioned than peers, in our view.

First, biotechnology funding has been constrained, and earlier stage, discovery research has been under pressure.

-
XRP is viewed as one cryptocurrency and blockchain network that could disrupt the traditional payments space.
-
What also makes XRP unique is its ties to Ripple, which is building financial solutions that bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance.
Cryptocurrencies are controversial. Some investors think they are the future, while others see a scam. The big ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum experience growing acceptance in the investment community and even on Wall Street. However, for the rest of the cryptoverse, the jury is still out.
One cryptocurrency that has captivated the market this year is the world's third-largest cryptocurrency, XRP (CRYPTO: XRP). XRP has been on a huge run since Donald Trump got elected president last November. Investors correctly assumed that Trump would install new leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that would lead the agency to drop an appeal in a long-standing lawsuit against Ripple, the company behind XRP.
Aside from the big gains that XRP has made this year, even if you are not interested in the token, there's one reason every investor should at least know about XRP and what the cryptocurrency is capable of.
Crypto could disrupt payments, and XRP is well positioned
While cryptocurrencies haven't come close to replacing fiat currencies yet, crypto advocates believe there is still strong potential for blockchain technology to disrupt the traditional payments system. That's because people can transfer money quickly and affordably using crypto, as long as they have internet access.
XRP's network is strong from a technical perspective, able to process up to 1,500 transactions per second. It also operates in the Ripple ecosystem, which has its own stablecoin, a large prime broker, and is also working with traditional mainstream financial institutions.
Ripple's CEO Brad Garlinghouse thinks XRP could transform the way international payment transactions are completed and even take volume from the Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT). This messaging system enables financial institutions all over the world to send payment instructions to one another, facilitating international payment transactions.
Even if you have no plans to invest in crypto, people should stay up to date on changes in the payments system, which can impact their daily lives. Watching XRP and Ripple's progress is a good way to do this.

This week is Part 2 of my conversation with financial advisor and author Wes Moss about his years-long research into what makes for a fulfilling retirement. But first, let's look at what happened last week in money. We start with chaos at the IRS. President Trump recently fired IRS Commissioner Billy Long, who had been on the job for less than two months. He will be temporarily replaced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who apparently doesn't have enough on his plate already. This transition makes Bessent the seventh person to become the head of the IRS so far this year. The seventh. Meanwhile, a quarter of the IRS's employees have left or been let go in 2025. This comes after the passage of the one big beautiful bill a month ago, which requires the IRS to provide guidance, issue regulations, and update publications regarding the myriad changes enacted by the new law. It could be an interesting tax filing season next year. The immediate consequence of all this turnover and reduction in staff is that it may take longer to get official clarifications from the IRS, either via their publications or if you're just trying to get anyone on the phone. It could also mean fewer audits. Listen, I don't want to be audited more than anyone else, but I also don't love the idea of people getting away with not paying their lawful share. According to a recent article in Barns that highlighted this likelihood of lower audits, the IRS collected $5.1 trillion in 2024 taxes, but estimates that there's another 700 billion that goes uncollected. Speaking of audits or what the IRS calls examinations, know that in the vast majority of cases, the IRS will contact you via regular old snail mail. Anytime you receive an email or a text from the IRS, it's actually probably a scam. Don't click on any of the links. Don't download the attachments. Don't reply with any personal information. If you do get a letter in the mail about being audited from the IRS, respond immediately.
There's actually an official appeals process for audits, but if you wait too long to respond, you lose your right to appeal. Our next item comes from Peter Mallouk of Creative Planning, who wrote this in a recent post on X, ''Credit card debt is the silent killer. Over 12% of balances are 90-plus days delinquent, near the highest level in 14 years, with interest rates north of 21%. Nothing destroys wealth faster.'' You may have heard that credit card debt is at an all time high, which some experts find alarming, whereas others say that, well, considered relative to today's current GDP and income, today's debt levels actually aren't anything to worry about, but I certainly find the increasing levels of credit card delinquencies concerning, and the rise in the average credit card rate is remarkable. According to the Federal Reserve, the average rate is 21.2%. Three and a half years ago, it was below 15%, and then it began to take off. In fact, before the spike that began in 2022, the last time the average credit card rate was above 16% was 1995. Why are rates so high? Well, banks will tell you that they need to charge those rates to compensate for all the defaults. Of course, someone has to pay for all those credit card rewards and TV commercials. The bottom line, in my opinion, is that banks get away with charging these higher rates because they can. Of course, you don't have to pay those rates if you keep your spending in check and you pay off your balance each month.
If you have a card charging a high rate or maybe offering modest rewards, look for a better deal. Many websites these days offer credit card reviews, offer special deals, including one here at The Motley Fool, which you can find by visiting fool.com/money/credit cards. Now we come to the number of the week, which is 90. That's how old Social Security turned this past Thursday. President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law on August 14th, 1935, and here are some current stats on the program, according to the Social Security Administration. The average monthly retirement benefit is $1,975 or $23,700 a year, that represents 31% of the income of Americans aged 65 or older. For almost half of people that age, Social Security is their Number 1 source of income, and for 12% of men and 15% of women, Social Security accounts for at least 90% of their income. Your Social Security benefit will be determined by the 35 highest earning years of your career, adjusted for inflation or that of your spouse if you're married and your spouse earned much more than you over your careers. The amount you receive will also depend on when you claim benefits. The longer you wait, the bigger your benefit up to age 70. To help you determine the best claiming strategy for you, check out some free online tools such as opensocialsecurity.com and the T Rowe Price Social Security Optimizer. Another tool that costs $49, but it's still worth considering. Many professional financial advisors use it can be found at maximizebysocialsecurity.com. Up next, I talk with Wes Moss about the value of super activities in retirement when Motley Fool Money continues.
Wes Moss is a certified financial planner practitioner and the author of What the Happiest Retirees Know. Last week, I spoke with Wes about the financial resources and habits of the happiest retirees. This week, we discussed the non-financial keys to a fulfilling retirement and whether more people should retire sooner. You found out that a happy retirement isn't just about how you spend your money, but also how you spend your time. What does your research say about the day-to-day habits of the happiest retirees?
Wes Moss: There's something I have referred to for many years now called core pursuits. Core pursuits are essentially hobbies on steroids. Joe saw Shi from stacking Benjamins. I ran into him at some VIP event. Of course, he would be there for that. It's like an event you should be at. I think it's a FinCon. He goes, ""I really love those super activities you talk about in your book."" I said, ""Joe, that is such a great name for it."" But I give him the credit for that, ""But they're super activities. That's just how I do this once in a while. I like them."" It's those core pursuits, super activities, hobbies on steroids. The more of them we have, the better, Number 1. But the other thing is I measured recently the amount of time we spend doing them. There is a big difference between the amount of time we spend during our week between the happy and unhappy retiree camp. As you may imagine, the happy retiree camp spends more time on those core pursuits they love. Now, it doesn't really matter. Yes, there are certain categories that I show to lean people toward a higher propensity to land in that happy group. Yes, there are some specific categories around that that seem to work even better than other categories, but most importantly, it's about the amount of time we spend doing them. Happy retirees, and again, I measured the time. I looked at how many hours do you spend doing this and doing that, and whether it's an athletic activity or an adventure activity or a creative activity, etc.
Happy retirees spend about 280 hours a year more than the unhappy group. That's weeks and weeks if you add it all up. It's 40% more time doing the things they love, doing those super activities. That is extraordinarily important. The other part of that is that if I were to dive in to what is bringing people joy in retirement, many of those activities, Robert, are social. There is a real sense, and we can maybe talk about this even further, but if I look at those categories, I categorize nine different, let's call it, categories of corpursuits, seven of the nine in answering the question, what brings me the most happiness when it comes to retirement had something to do with socialization. It was with doing XYZ with friends, doing with friends and family, doing with family. It was striking to me, and this took a long time. It's funny. I actually tried to use AI for this, and it didn't work because it was too much data. The reason it didn't work is that many of the responses I got that were open-ended in the latest research had multiple things in their answer. It was, I like to garden, but also what I really love is my biweekly walking group with my friends and neighbors. What AI couldn't decipher for me was when somebody had two or three different things in one sentence. I gave up doing it that way and literally just went through and read every single response and categorized where it landed, even though there were two or three things, and I wanted to get the essence. What is the most important aspect of these respondents' retirement life that brings them the most joy? I manually put all of these into different categories. I have a social category. I just love to socialize and love to hang out with my friends, hang out with my family. There were some that were purely social. But many of those other groups were, I like to volunteer with my friends at church. I like doing my part-time job because I'm with my friends and my colleagues. There was this real heavy ingredient of socialization that permeated through many of the different core and pursuit categories. It's just so important.
Robert Brokamp: Let me rephrase this, 3, 2, 1. You talk about people taking walks with friends. Sometimes people play tennis, golf. It's a social activity, but it's also a physical activity. Did you find any connection between happiness and just general exercise, getting outside, getting up, and doing things?
Wes Moss: The answer is yes. It is not a massive difference in the amount of time because again, I measured the amount of time these two groups spent in these different categories. The great news is, and this is what I'm writing about in this most recent book that I'm writing, I think maybe you'll give me a title for it, but it should probably be called the Retire Sooner Method. You like formula, but it's really a method to retire sooner, and it's about the five secrets of America's happiest and least happy retirees. But what I'm writing about is that some small changes, call it 15 minutes a day, more in the active category activities. It doesn't matter what it is. What could be biking, yoga, spin class, a lot of hiking in my research. People love to hike. There's a lot of golf, tennis pickle, but these are categorized as physical activity. There is something about that that tips people even further into the happy category versus the unhappy group. Yes, it works. It matters, but it's not as big of an uplift as people might think.
Robert Brokamp: The name of your podcast is Retire Sooner, and it does seem that there's a general trend these days for people to say, you know what? You shouldn't put off retirement. You don't know how long you're going to live. You don't know what shape you're going to be in in your 60s, 70s, or 80s. You should take advantage of the time you have while you can. Do you think people should be retiring sooner?
Wes Moss: Without question, yes, more than ever. I had a long drive recently back from Michigan to Atlanta, which took 15 hours. One of the audiobooks I listened to it was called Outlive, and it was long. There's only so much my wife could handle, but I found it pretty depressing. I know it's a really good book, but so much of the book is just how often people die and the four horsemen of heart disease, cancer, autoimmune. It was a depressing listen, if you will. As I'm listening to it, and yes, of course, the whole point of the book is that you can fight against that and maybe Outlive, you have more of a life health span, and maybe a lifespan extension. But it just made me think how many Americans should be retiring as soon as they're financially ready to do so, and understanding some of the other things we talk about, which is the lifestyle side of retirement. The other thing, Robert, did I think is also fascinating from my most recent research study, and I'm looking at, again, general happiness baseline in America. What do we do to be above that baseline? What activities and habits do we do that lands us below that baseline? We want activities that bring us above the happiness baseline. It's called happiness Alpha, if we're talking finance today. There is a massive jump just getting to the point where you say, yes, I no longer have to work. I'm retired in happiness in America. Just getting into that new mode of, now I'm done. We know this. We're in an amazing work culture.
That's why we love investing in America. One of my themes on the Retire Sooner podcast is the Army of American productivity. We get up every day, and we work, and everybody in the labor force just pushes the peanut just a little further up the hill, and you have 166 million people doing that. You've got an amazing economy like no other place in the world. Now, only about one in five of those people really love what they're doing. The rest of America either absolutely hates their job, or they're just doing it because they have to, and that's the reality. It's expensive to live in America. But it does create a powerful army of productivity. Even though we have this great work culture, all you have to do is hop on LinkedIn for five minutes. You're going to see your 5:00-9:00 routine. What is it? I saw something just the other day. It was my 5:00-9:00 routine before my 9:00-5:00 job, which get up, you do a cold plunge, you run 10 miles. You do yoga, save the world, and then you do your 9:00-5:00. We get up. The reality is that work on a human level ranks really low on the things that we want to do if it were totally up to us. It ranks just above being sick and bed, Robert. To some extent, it does make sense that the very act of tipping into retirement is in itself a happiness booster.
Robert Brokamp: You mentioned earlier that people are concerned about outliving their money, even multimillionaires. There are studies that show there are people who are retired and could spend more than they do, but they don't. How do you, as a financial advisor, help someone get over that hurdle of saying, according to your analysis, they have enough to retire, but they're nervous, they're anxious. They say things, well, I don't know how long I'm going to live. I'm worried about long-term care. What's it take to get someone to say, no, you've been saving for this for decades. It's now time for you to take advantage of it?
Wes Moss: You've got to put it in black and white, or black and white in color is fine. It's got to be written down. Whether you draw it out, you analyze it through artificial intelligence, whether you use one of the more sophisticated software programs that exist today to map out your cash flow. That blueprint, seeing it on paper and putting in the right variables, which are not that complicated. Inflation, expected rate of return, amount of spending. You put all that together, and as long as you are utilizing and I've written about this several different times, and I believe so strongly in this, you understand how you're able to max out your withdrawals without running out of money, abiding by, I call it, the 4% plus rule. If you're able to understand that and map it out, which doesn't need to be overly complicated. It's preparation, and it's some education, having the confidence around some of these really important rules of thumb. I think if you understand that, and I think that's a job for an advisor to do when they sit down with folks if they're uncomfortable, to help them understand that as long as you're mapping this out and you're using conservative long term assumptions, then people should have the confidence and not the fear of running out of money. That's a huge part of the overall equation. Is that planning takes away so much of the anxiety, as long as you have enough resources to make it work.
Robert Brokamp: It's time to get it done, Fools. This week, we're focusing on funds. There's approximately $40 trillion invested in US registered mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to the Investment Company Institute. It's split roughly evenly between actively managed funds and index funds even though the evidence is clear that most actively managed funds fail to beat a relevant index fund. Morning Star threw more evidence on this pile in its recently released mid-year active passive barometer report. Here's what it found. Over the 12 months ending on June 30th of this year, only 33% of actively managed funds beat a passively managed peer. That figure drops to just 21% when you stretch out the timeline to the past decade. Fees really matter. The percentage of actively managed funds in the cheapest quintile had a success rate that was 12 percentage points higher than the funds in the priciest quintile. Now, I'm not saying you shouldn't own actively managed funds. I own several myself, but you should check the performance once a year or so to make sure they remain in the minority of outperformers. Here's what to do. Line up the performance of your fund with that of an index fund that is in the same category. You want to make sure you're doing an apples-to-apples comparison. For example, if you own an actively managed small-cap value fund, compare its performance to a small-cap value index fund from a firm like Vanguard or iShares. If your actively managed fund isn't beating the index fund over the past 5-10 years, then it might be time to part ways. Now, if the fund you own is in an employer-sponsored account like a 401K, you may not have a choice. You're limited to the funds offered by the plan. But if the actively managed choices in your plan aren't keeping up, make some noise. Reach out to your benefits administrator and the company that operates the plan. They have a duty to offer you low-cost investments that at least match the performance of their stated benchmarks.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The second quarter witnessed extreme volatility. Stocks declined sharply after the “Liberation Day” tariff announcement and staged a remarkable recovery as the administration initiated a 90-day pause. In the quarter, Ariel Small Cap Value Tax-Exempt Composite appreciated +7.72% gross of fees (+7.58% net of fees) against this backdrop, compared to +4.97% and +8.50% returns of the Russell 2000 Value Index and the Russell 2000 Index, respectively.

Ariel Small Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA) in its second quarter 2025 investor letter:
Also in the quarter, we bought shares of bar-code manufacturer, Zebra Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:ZBRA), which is held in other Ariel portfolios. ZBRA’s brand strength, distribution network and commitment to innovation enable it to take share, earn industry-leading profitability and penetrate new markets. A recent pullback in the stock price provided an attractive entry point. Shares have come under pressure due to investor concerns around supply chain disruptions and tariffs. At current the valuation, we think the market is underappreciating ZBRA’s alignment with the global effort to improve supply chain efficiency. At the same time, the company is leveraging the wide moat in its core business to expand into faster growing markets including warehouse robotics and machine vision. Meanwhile ZBRA continues to deliver prodigious free cash flow which we believe will continue to be deployed towards both growth and share repurchases.

Narrowing the focus, PRU has also lagged behind the iShares U.S. Insurance ETF’s (IAK) 8.6% rally over the past 52 weeks and its 5.3% surge this year.
On Jul. 30, Prudential Financial posted strong Q2 results, and its shares dipped 1.6%. Its adjusted operating income after tax rose to $3.58 per share from $3.28 a year earlier, driven by solid contributions from its asset management arm PGIM and international businesses. Assets under management climbed to $1.58 trillion from $1.48 trillion, underscoring growth momentum. The company also returned $735 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.
For the current year ending in December, analysts expect PRU’s EPS to increase 8.1% year over year to $13.64. Moreover, the company has surpassed analysts’ consensus estimates in three of the past four quarters, while missing on one occasion.
Among the 18 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” That’s based on two “Strong Buy” ratings, 14 “Holds,” and two “Strong Sells.”
On August 18, Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Nigel Dally reaffirmed an ""Equal-Weight"" rating on Prudential Financial and raised the price target from $113 to $117, a 3.5% increase signaling a more positive near-term outlook.
PRU’s mean price target of $116.13 indicates a premium of 8.4% from the current market prices. Its Street-high target of $136 suggests a robust 26.9% upside potential from current price levels.

Narrowing the focus, SJM has also underperformed the industry-focused Invesco Food & Beverage ETF’s (PBJ) 3.1% rise over the past 52 weeks and 3.5% return on a YTD basis.
On Jun. 10, shares of SJM plunged 15.6% following its Q4 earnings release, as revenue fell 2.8% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, missing expectations and weighing on investor sentiment. The decline in gross profit, pressured by higher costs, unfavorable volume/mix, and divestiture impacts, further dampened the outlook. However, adjusted EPS came in at $2.31, down 13.2% from last year but still topping analyst estimates by 2.7%.
For FY2026, which ends in April, analysts expect SJM’s EPS to fall 99.1% year-over-year to $9.25. However, the company has an impressive earnings surprise history. It has surpassed the Street’s bottom-line estimates in each of the past four quarters.
SJM has a consensus “Moderate Buy” rating overall. Of the 17 analysts covering the stock, opinions include six “Strong Buys,” two “Moderate Buy,” and nine “Holds.”
The configuration is slightly more bullish than it was a month ago, when five analysts issued “Strong Buy” recommendations.
On Aug. 20, UBS raised its price target for J.M. Smucker from $115 to $130 while maintaining a “Buy” rating, citing stronger earnings estimates and improved demand trends.
SJM’s mean price target of $118.07 indicates a premium of 4.6% from the current market prices. While the Street-high target of $135 suggests a robust 19.5% upside potential.

Moreover, the ETF’s marginal losses on a YTD basis outshine the stock’s single-digit dip over the same time frame.

Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it
Why high earners slip into debt
One major culprit is lifestyle creep: as income rises, so does spending. Bigger homes, luxury cars, and lavish vacations may feel justified with more money coming in, but they can undermine financial security.
Higher taxes, larger mortgages, and the social pressure to spend in high-income communities — combined with easy access to credit — only exacerbates this.
But how many people actually earn that much? It's rare. According to U.S. Census data, only about 2% of individuals make more than $300,000, and fewer than 10% of American households earn $250,000 or more.
Inflation and unplanned costs — a double threat
Beyond lifestyle factors, broader economic forces also drive people into debt.
For one, inflation — especially on essentials like groceries, gas, and housing — quickly eats into budgets and erodes purchasing power, even for high earners. A July 2025 Associated Press survey found that more than half of Americans are highly stressed about grocery costs, and only 14% report not worrying about them at all.
Unplanned expenses are another major strain. From medical bills to sudden home or car repairs, these costs can overwhelm even those with strong incomes.
The Federal Reserve reports that 23% of adults faced major unexpected medical expenses in the past year, and 15%-18% are carrying medical debt. Even with insurance, medical emergencies can be costly.
A 2022 study on elective orthopedic surgeries found that out-of-pocket expenses ranged from $2,700 to nearly $3,200 per procedure, and those numbers continue to rise.
The rich aren’t immune to market volatility. Many invest heavily in stocks or real estate, assuming these assets will ensure financial stability. But when markets fall, wealth can shrink dramatically.",bdcefba3ea4c7b8b1404289567bc8ee6,trafilatura
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mp-materials-overvalued-450-surge-133500446.html,aaa1ed8b926c4bb41f00c8f9393fc9bf,Is MP Materials Overvalued After Its 450 % Surge ? ,Is MP Materials Overvalued After Its 450 % Surge ? ,2025-08-23 14:30:00+00:00,gdelt_finance_yahoo_com,finance.yahoo.com via GDELT,gdelt,en,False,"MP Materials(NYSE: MP) has seen a phenomenal stock price advance over the past year, with the shares up over 450%! That was largely driven by a price move which started in May and really took off in July. That was when the United States government agreed to invest $400 million in the rare-earth element producer.
There's a lot to unpack here as you try to decide if the rally has gone too far or if there's still long-term value on offer.
What does MP Materials do?
MP Materials mines for and produces rare-earth metals. These are vital inputs to modern technology from the cellphone in your pocket to military products, like missiles, which are essential for a country's self-defense.
Right now, most of the world is reliant on China for rare-earth metals. Given the geopolitical tensions today, it should be clear why this could be a problem. The problem has been magnified by the fact that China has proven more than willing to restrict access to its rare-earth metals as it attempts to gain leverage over other nations.
What's unique about MP Materials is that it operates in the United States. That not only means it operates in a geopolitically stable region, it means that the U.S. government has direct access to the business. To facilitate MP Materials' growth, Uncle Sam has made a big investment in the company, as noted above. The cash infusion is in the form of convertible preferred stock, which means that, at some point, the U.S. government could also become a large shareholder in MP Materials.
That's a huge vote of support for the business, which is still fairly early in its development. Investors got excited by the news and the stock rocketed higher, pricing in a lot of the good news. Leveraging the stock price advance and increased market notoriety, MP Materials also sold additional stock to the public.
It even attracted additional investment from other companies looking to solidify their access to rare-earth metals, notably Apple. But this is also where things really start to get complicated for investors.
Is MP Materials too expensive to buy?
When MP Materials reported second quarter 2025 earnings, which occurred after the announcement of the U.S. government investment, it posted a loss of $0.19 per share. Taking out some one-time items improves that to a loss of $0.13 per share. Stepping back and looking at the big picture, MP Materials is a money-losing startup.
For that reason alone, conservative investors should probably avoid it. But even for more aggressive investors, the red ink on the income statement creates a problem since it makes it difficult to value the shares. You simply can't create a meaningful price-to-earnings ratio with negative earnings. That's the normal go-to valuation metric for most investors.
But given the start-up nature of the business, price-to-sales is a tough metric to use, too, since revenue is still growing quickly at the moment -- up 84% in the second quarter of this year, which seems likely to be an unsustainable figure over the long term. But it could be sustainable over the near term, if MP Material executes well.
How much that revenue growth is worth really depends on how long MP Materials can sustain its growth. And that is kind of unknowable at the moment.
But investors are currently pegging the price-to-sales ratio at around 46. That's a huge figure for any company. For comparison, Apple's P/S ratio is 8.5 right now. Nvidia's P/S ratio is around 29. There is a lot of good news being priced into MP Materials' stock at the moment. And almost all of that has come from the quick burst in the stock price over the past few months.
Tread carefully with MP Materials
MP Materials is still building its business, so high capital investment costs are likely to remain a major headwind to profits for longer. While it is impossible to know the timeframe on that, mining is a capital-intensive business so it could be years. The market excitement around the shares, on the other hand, could quickly wane as fickle investors move on to newer stories.
There is a huge long-term opportunity here, but even the most aggressive investors should be careful with MP Materials today. This is a story stock and all it would take would be a single negative, or even less positive, news story to turn investors from being shockingly bullish on the stock to bearish.

Lucid stock looks pricier than the competition.
-
The robotaxi opportunity supports a premium valuation.
On paper, Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) looks expensive compared to other electric vehicle (EV) stocks. Shares currently trade at 6.3 times sales. Rivian Automotive, a competitor, trades at just 2.5 times sales.
Think Lucid shares are too expensive? Think again. One well-known investor just made a prediction that could create massive value for Lucid shareholders over the next decade and beyond.
Lucid Group should benefit from this $10 trillion opportunity
Earlier this year, well-known investor Cathie Wood made a bold prediction. The global robotaxi industry, she believes, could eventually be worth up to $10 trillion. ""We think $8 trillion to $10 trillion for the entire autonomous taxi opportunity throughout the world, from almost nothing,"" she told investors in March. ""That's how quickly AI is going to cause these things to happen.""
Last month's partnership deal with Uber Technologies and Nuro put Lucid in the race for this opportunity. Lucid will supply Uber with 20,000 of its Gravity SUVs to help start up a new robotaxi division, using Nuro to drive the vehicles and Uber to manage the customers. Lucid has long promoted its technology stack over its manufacturing business, arguing that the company should be viewed more as a tech stock than a conventional carmaker. Uber deciding to partner with the company on arguably its most technologically intensive venture yet adds a huge vote of confidence to that vision.
""The whole industry has tried to move from just hardware and manufacturing -- which requires a lot of scale to get costs down -- to adding more software and services,"" venture capitalist Laurie Yoler told McKinsey & Co., this month. Lucid is proof of this industrywide pivot, and the deal with Uber and Nuro suggests it's getting a jump on some of the competition. Not only can it produce vehicles that robotaxi operators want at scale, but these vehicles are also ready for the software-dominant use cases the future will demand.
Yes, Lucid stock is more expensive than peers like Rivian. But its early success in the robotaxi industry strongly supports a premium valuation.

Key Takeaways:
-
IRS digital assets chief Trish Turner resigned after just three months and will join Crypto Tax Girl as tax director.
-
Her departure comes amid growing scrutiny of the IRS’s handling of crypto taxation and calls for clearer policy frameworks.
-
Turner’s move reflects a wider trend of senior regulators transitioning into crypto advisory roles as the industry faces major compliance shifts.
Turner announced her departure in a LinkedIn post on Friday, reflecting on her two-decade career at the agency.
“After more than 20 years with the IRS, I have closed an extraordinary chapter of my career with deep appreciation for those who shaped my journey and made the work so meaningful,” she wrote.
Turner Vows to Bridge Gap Between Industry and Regulators
Turner added that she looked forward to “building bridges between industry and regulators” from a new position outside the agency.
Bloomberg Tax later reported that Turner will join Crypto Tax Girl, a private tax advisory firm, as its new tax director.
Founder Laura Walter confirmed the appointment, saying Turner’s expertise will help clients navigate the growing list of compliance challenges.
“With all of the big crypto tax and compliance changes on the horizon, we are excited to have Trish on board,” Walter said.
Her resignation comes at a critical moment for U.S. crypto taxation. The IRS has been under increasing pressure to modernize its digital asset strategy, following repeated criticism from lawmakers and watchdog agencies over its handling of crypto-related investigations.
Turner herself was only appointed in May, following the departures of Sulolit “Raj” Mukherjee and Seth Wilks, who left the division after roughly a year.
The shake-up coincides with heightened congressional scrutiny. Last month, the House Committee on Ways and Means announced a hearing on how to establish a clear tax framework for digital assets.
Earlier in July, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration recommended reforms to the IRS’s criminal investigation unit, citing failures to follow protocols in crypto cases.
Meanwhile, the broader regulatory environment has shifted under the Trump administration.
In April, the president signed a resolution overturning a Biden-era rule that would have required decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to report user transactions to the IRS.
Turner’s move to the private sector highlights the ongoing migration of senior government officials into crypto-focused firms, as the industry braces for sweeping changes in U.S. tax and compliance policy.",f30474e04cf19e2000d5579859a04a0c,trafilatura

In November, Musk announced plans to start an AI video game studio within xAI, to “make games great again.” Ex Populus, the company behind gaming blockchain Xai, now claims that Musk’s announcement immediately created “substantial actual confusion” online between their established video game brand, Xai, and Musk’s xAI gaming venture.
Numerous news aggregators and commentators used the blockchain’s logo in announcements about Musk’s venture, the company’s attorneys claim, and many more internet users mistook the separate ventures to be related. What’s more, Grok—Musk’s AI chatbot—also confused the two separate entities, and told X users they were both controlled by Musk’s companies, the attorneys said.
In a complaint filed Thursday, Ex Populus asked a federal court in northern California to order Musk’s AI company to cease using any words or symbols likely to cause confusion with Xai’s registered trademark, in the contexts of video gaming and blockchain.
It also requested punitive damages and all profits reaped by Musk’s companies for the alleged infringement.
Ex Populus’ attorneys repeatedly argued in their complaint that Musk’s company has not only consistently infringed on their copyright since last year—but, further, that the particular notoriety and controversy associated with the world’s richest man have made the alleged infringement particularly damaging to their brand.
“Musk and defendants’ xAI company routinely receive substantive negative media attention that is now being attributed to plaintiff’s XAI trademark,” the attorneys wrote.
The lawyers made particular note of a controversy that erupted last month when Musk’s AI bot, Grok, referred to itself as “MechaHitler” for a brief period and made antisemitic, racist, and sexually violent comments across the X platform.",193f1791012f9cdc953ee21ee8f034e5,trafilatura

Most seniors would like to consider their senior living community a safe haven. But sometimes, these properties turn out to be money traps.
That’s the precarious situation Martha Bray, an 84-year-old Vietnam veteran, found herself in after 10 years of living at River Glen of St. Charles. When the senior living community near Chicago was acquired by two investment companies, they swiftly raised costs. Bray told NBC News her monthly maintenance surged by 365%, from $1,395 to $6,500.
Unable to pay, Bray decided to move out — receiving only 75% of the entry fee she paid to move in. She estimates her total loss was $100,000.
Many seniors are exposed to similar risks when they move into these communities. Here’s why the industry’s reputation is getting increasingly shaky.
Private equity’s invasion
Bray’s story is not unique. The same factors that make senior living facilities valuable to many families are also what make them attractive to investors. Elevated rents, recurring revenue and the nation’s aging population have made this a lucrative asset class for private equity firms.
Eight of the 50 largest operators in the U.S. senior housing space were private equity firms, according to the American Seniors Housing Association’s (ASHA) 2024 annual report.
Private equity’s influence could expand further in the years ahead. A survey of seniors housing trends by global real estate investment firm JLL showed that 78% of institutional investors plan to expand their investments in senior care facilities.
“Opportunities exist for investors to acquire high-quality real estate at below replacement cost,” according to the 2025 report. The Center for Medicare Advocacy said the impact of private equity ownership can be “significant and troubling” for facility residents.
According to their analysis, when properties were taken over by a private equity firm in Iowa, they received lower overall and health inspection ratings, had fewer nursing staff, faced more abuse citations, incurred higher federal civil monetary penalties and experienced more payment denials for new admissions.
Put simply, some investment firms may be incentivized to put profits and shareholder returns above the interests of vulnerable seniors. If you or your loved ones live in such facilities or are considering moving in, you should take some steps to protect yourself.
There are several ways you and your family can reduce the financial risks involved with moving into a senior living community.
Before signing up, make sure you review the contract carefully and consider having the terms reviewed by a lawyer. You should also try to find out which entity owns the property you or a loved one is considering.
There are minimal disclosure requirements for senior living property transactions, so it won’t necessarily be easy to find out whether a facility is owned by a private equity firm, but the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) offers some limited information on its website about “affiliated entity performance” that could help.
Last year, Democratic Senators Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren introduced the Corporate Crimes Against Health Care Act, which aims to “root out corporate greed and private equity abuse in the health care system.” At the time of writing, the act has been referred to the Committee on Finance after two readings in the Senate.
Grow your retirement cushion
Beyond policy fixes, you can also take steps to safeguard your retirement finances. After all, the more prepared you are for unforeseeable expenses, the more likely you are to avoid ending up in a scenario like Bray’s.
When it comes to picking and choosing your retirement investments, alternative assets can provide stability and resilience, especially in periods of market volatility.
For instance, a report by First National Realty Partners found that in times of market stress, high-quality properties can be acquired at a discount. After all, real estate is one avenue that can safeguard your wealth, but not everyone wants to take on a 30-year mortgage.
FNRP has relationships with the nation’s largest essential-needs brands, such as Kroger, Walmart and Whole Foods. And since these retailers provide necessities, they tend to still perform well during times of economic volatility and can act as a hedge against inflation.
You can engage with experts, explore available deals and easily make an allocation, all in FNRP’s personalized portal.
Another alternative asset beloved by the wealthy is art. Historically, art has been used to store value away from the ups and downs of the stock market, but the buy-in for pieces that appreciate well over time has been out of reach for most investors.
Now, Masterworks is opening up the door for more investors to get into this market-resilient asset. You can invest in fractional shares of iconic paintings from artists such as Picasso, Basquiat and Banksy — depending on availability.
Masterworks’ expert team has already exited 23 offerings to date, with investors seeing net annualized returns such as +17.6%, +17.8%, and +21.5% among assets held for longer than one year. You can click here to start diversifying your portfolio. See important Regulation A disclosures at Masterworks.com/cd.
Finally, gold is another alternative asset with a strong reputation for its safe-haven potential. Year-to-date, gold has seen strong performance even during April’s tariff-driven S&P 500 dip.
What’s more, JP Morgan Chase estimates that the yellow precious metal could strike highs of $4,000 per ounce by the second quarter of 2026 if current trends continue.
With Priority Gold, you can invest toward your retirement with a gold IRA, which combines the tax benefits of an IRA and the inflation-hedging benefits of investing in gold.",df18f5e18f14a3d1d29bd7ccba365eb2,trafilatura

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.40%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.25%.
Stock indexes are moving higher today after five consecutive sessions of declines. Short covering and position squaring are lifting stocks ahead of a speech later this morning from Fed Chair Powell at the Fed’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The markets are waiting to see if Mr. Powell stays cautious on inflation or tilts toward supporting a softer labor market.
Stocks may come under pressure today if Fed Chair Powell takes a hawkish tilt and expresses caution about cutting interest rates. Several Fed policymakers this week expressed concerns about inflation, with Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack saying she’d oppose a Fed rate cut “if the meeting were tomorrow,” and Kansas City President Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago Fed President Goolsbee both said inflation remains too high. Solid US economic data and hawkish Fed commentary over the past week have reduced the chances of a 25 bp Fed rate cut at next month’s FOMC meeting to 71% from 93% last Thursday before the July PPI report.
Comments today from Boston Fed President Susan Collins were slightly hawkish when she said, US economic growth is slowing, but overall economic fundamentals are solid as she sees upside risks to inflation and downside risks on labor. She added that Fed policy is modestly restrictive, which is appropriate.
On the geopolitical front, US Vice President Vance said negotiations over ending Russia’s war in Ukraine are focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and territory Russia wants to control, including Ukrainian territory that it currently isn’t occupying, as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two countries. The US is working to set up a meeting between Presidents Putin and Zelensky, and if that meeting goes well, President Trump said he’ll look to follow up with a trilateral summit with the leaders.
Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.
In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 71% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 50% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 93% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 83% of companies exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.29%. China’s Shanghai Composite climbed to a new 10-year high and closed up +1.45%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 recovered from a 1.5-week low and closed up +0.05%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) today are up +4 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -2.2 bp to 4.306%. Sep T-notes are moving higher on short covering and position squaring ahead of comments later today from Fed Chair Powell at the Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Gains in T-notes are limited by hawkish comments from Boston Fed President Susan Collins, who said modestly restrictive Fed policy is appropriate.
European government bond yields today are mixed. The 10-year German bund yield is down -0.9 bp to 2.748%. The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 2.75-month high of 4.759% and is up +0.9 bp to 4.739%.
German Q2 GDP was revised lower to -0.3% q/q and -0.2% y/y from the previously reported -0.1% q/q and unchanged y/y.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.
US Stock Movers
Strength in chipmakers is supporting gains in the broader market. ON Semiconductor (ON), Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), GlobalFoundries (GFS), Analog Devices (ADI), ASML Holding NV (ASML), and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) are up more than +1%.

-
Archer is making steady progress toward launching commercial operations.
-
Government agencies are streamlining the approvals of electric aircraft.
The low-altitude economy is on the verge of rocketing higher over the next few decades. Bank of America sees the global adoption of electric vehicle take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to increase by 62% by 2030.
While Joby Aviation is one way to profit from this opportunity, it's worth noting that Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has placed her bet on Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR) for the Ark Innovation ETF, which holds almost 18 million shares. There's one reason that may explain why Wood is bullish, and it's also why I hold shares -- and that's a steady flow of positive developments in the past year that position Archer to be a leader in the air taxi market.
Why buy Archer Aviation stock
Over the past year, there have been a number of announcements that show the company progressing toward receiving the required certifications and launching commercial operations. This has had a significant impact on the stock price, which has doubled over the past year despite the company not generating significant revenue yet.
Archer has previously announced partnerships with United Airlines and Southwest Airlines to operate air taxi networks across major cities in the U.S. It also has financial backing from Stellantis and other investors as it works toward its goal of manufacturing 50 aircraft per year. In its second-quarter earnings report, Archer reported there were six Midnight aircraft in different production stages, with three in final assembly at its Georgia and Silicon Valley facilities.
In June, Archer, along with the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation, announced an alliance with the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand in streamlining the certification and commercial launch of eVTOL aircraft.
Finally, Archer Aviation was recently named the official air taxi service for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, which will be valuable marketing in demonstrating its capabilities. Given these developments, Archer Aviation is a potential breakout growth stock to watch over the next year.

During the session, Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) climbed to its highest price of $5.08 before a slight selling pulled the company down to end the day just up by 39.17 percent at $5.01 apiece.
This followed signals from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the central bank could begin slashing interest rates beginning next month, sparking rosy prospects for the residential market on expectations of lower borrowing costs for prospective homebuyers.
In recent news, Opendoor Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) announced the immediate resignation of CEO Carrie Wheeler, who took over the role in 2022 but failed to reassure investors of the ongoing turnaround efforts. She was temporarily replaced by chief technology officer Shrisha Radhakrishna while a permanent CEO has yet to be named.

NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) saw its share prices climb by 14.44 percent on Friday to close at $6.34 apiece as investors welcomed the unveiling of its budget-friendly SUV called ES8.
In an interview with CNBC, Morningstar analyst Vincent Sun said that the rally can be owed to expectations of a strong demand in the ES8 and the Onvo L90, which was launched earlier.
NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) is scheduled to launch the ES8 next month, with a starting price of 308,800 yuan ($43,000) for the battery subscription plan which will allow owners to upgrade batteries through monthly payments.

The new vehicle measures 5,280 mm in length and 3,130 mm in wheelbase, making it the largest battery electric vehicle in China.
The unveiling followed the company’s slower vehicle deliveries in July. During the period, NIO Inc.

September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.40%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.25%.
Stock indexes are moving higher today after five consecutive sessions of declines. Short covering and position squaring are lifting stocks ahead of a speech later this morning from Fed Chair Powell at the Fed’s annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The markets are waiting to see if Mr. Powell stays cautious on inflation or tilts toward supporting a softer labor market.
Stocks may come under pressure today if Fed Chair Powell takes a hawkish tilt and expresses caution about cutting interest rates. Several Fed policymakers this week expressed concerns about inflation, with Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack saying she’d oppose a Fed rate cut “if the meeting were tomorrow,” and Kansas City President Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago Fed President Goolsbee both said inflation remains too high. Solid US economic data and hawkish Fed commentary over the past week have reduced the chances of a 25 bp Fed rate cut at next month’s FOMC meeting to 71% from 93% last Thursday before the July PPI report.
Comments today from Boston Fed President Susan Collins were slightly hawkish when she said, US economic growth is slowing, but overall economic fundamentals are solid as she sees upside risks to inflation and downside risks on labor. She added that Fed policy is modestly restrictive, which is appropriate.
On the geopolitical front, US Vice President Vance said negotiations over ending Russia’s war in Ukraine are focused on security guarantees for Ukraine and territory Russia wants to control, including Ukrainian territory that it currently isn’t occupying, as the US tries to broker a peace deal between the two countries. The US is working to set up a meeting between Presidents Putin and Zelensky, and if that meeting goes well, President Trump said he’ll look to follow up with a trilateral summit with the leaders.
Regarding tariffs, President Trump widened steel and aluminum tariffs to include more than 400 consumer items that contain the metals, such as motorcycles, auto parts, furniture components, and tableware. The change went into effect on Monday and did not exclude goods already in transit. Last Friday, Mr. Trump said, “I’ll be setting tariffs next week and the week after on steel and on, I would say chips – chips and semiconductors, we’ll be setting sometime next week, week after.” Mr. Trump last week said he planned a 100% tariff on semiconductors but would exempt companies that move chip manufacturing to the US. Mr. Trump also mentioned 200% or 300% tariffs on chips.
In other recent tariff news, Mr. Trump last Tuesday extended the tariff truce with China for another 90 days until November. On August 6, Mr. Trump announced that he will double tariffs on US imports from India to 50% from the current 25% tariff, due to India’s purchases of Russian oil. On August 5, Mr. Trump said that US tariffs on pharmaceutical imports would be announced “within the next week or so.” According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.
Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 71% at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting, down from 93% last Thursday. The markets are discounting the chances at 50% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.
Earnings reports indicate that S&P 500 earnings for Q2 are on track to rise +9.1% y/y, much better than the pre-season expectations of +2.8% y/y and the most in four years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. With over 93% of S&P 500 firms having reported Q2 earnings, about 83% of companies exceeded profit estimates.
Overseas stock markets today are higher. The Euro Stoxx 50 is up +0.29%. China’s Shanghai Composite climbed to a new 10-year high and closed up +1.45%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 recovered from a 1.5-week low and closed up +0.05%.
Interest Rates
September 10-year T-notes (ZNU5) today are up +4 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield is down -2.2 bp to 4.306%. Sep T-notes are moving higher on short covering and position squaring ahead of comments later today from Fed Chair Powell at the Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Gains in T-notes are limited by hawkish comments from Boston Fed President Susan Collins, who said modestly restrictive Fed policy is appropriate.
European government bond yields today are mixed. The 10-year German bund yield is down -0.9 bp to 2.748%. The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 2.75-month high of 4.759% and is up +0.9 bp to 4.739%.
German Q2 GDP was revised lower to -0.3% q/q and -0.2% y/y from the previously reported -0.1% q/q and unchanged y/y.
Swaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.

-
Archer is making steady progress toward launching commercial operations.
-
Government agencies are streamlining the approvals of electric aircraft.
The low-altitude economy is on the verge of rocketing higher over the next few decades. Bank of America sees the global adoption of electric vehicle take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to increase by 62% by 2030.
While Joby Aviation is one way to profit from this opportunity, it's worth noting that Cathie Wood of Ark Invest has placed her bet on Archer Aviation (NYSE: ACHR) for the Ark Innovation ETF, which holds almost 18 million shares. There's one reason that may explain why Wood is bullish, and it's also why I hold shares -- and that's a steady flow of positive developments in the past year that position Archer to be a leader in the air taxi market.
Why buy Archer Aviation stock
Over the past year, there have been a number of announcements that show the company progressing toward receiving the required certifications and launching commercial operations. This has had a significant impact on the stock price, which has doubled over the past year despite the company not generating significant revenue yet.
Archer has previously announced partnerships with United Airlines and Southwest Airlines to operate air taxi networks across major cities in the U.S. It also has financial backing from Stellantis and other investors as it works toward its goal of manufacturing 50 aircraft per year. In its second-quarter earnings report, Archer reported there were six Midnight aircraft in different production stages, with three in final assembly at its Georgia and Silicon Valley facilities.
In June, Archer, along with the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation, announced an alliance with the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand in streamlining the certification and commercial launch of eVTOL aircraft.
Finally, Archer Aviation was recently named the official air taxi service for the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, which will be valuable marketing in demonstrating its capabilities. Given these developments, Archer Aviation is a potential breakout growth stock to watch over the next year.

Within the broader sector, ROP has also trailed the US Technology iShares ETF (IYW), which has risen almost 21% over the past year and 11.8% year-to-date.
However, investor attention sharpened on July 21, when Roper reported Q2 2025 results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Revenue rose 13.2% year-over-year to $1.94 billion, edging past analyst estimates of $1.93 billion. Organic growth of 7% was driven by strong momentum in the Application Software segment, while acquisitions added another 6% to total sales. Software bookings grew in the high teens, and adjusted EPS grew 8.7% to $4.87, exceeding the Street consensus of $4.82.
The company also announced the acquisition of cloud-native software provider Subsplash, strengthening its vertical market offerings, and raised full-year revenue guidance while revising its debt outlook. On the back of these advances, the stock jumped roughly 1.3% that day and added another 2.2% the following session.
For the fiscal year 2025, ending in December, analysts forecast a 10.8% growth in EPS, estimating $20.28 on a diluted basis. Moreover, the company has a strong track record of consistently outperforming analyst estimates over the last four quarters.
Among 18 analysts covering ROP, the consensus rating stands at ""Moderate Buy,"" comprising 10 “Strong Buy” ratings, one “Moderate Buy,” six “Hold” recommendations, and one “Strong Sell.”

(NYSE:NIO) delivered 21,017 vehicles last month, higher by 2.5 percent than the 20,498 in the same month last year, but was notably slower than the double-digit year-on-year growth in the past three months.
June deliveries were higher by 17 percent; May was up by 13 percent; while April increased by 53 percent.

Many also learn (the hard way) that “RSI overbought” is not an automatic sell.
In strong trends, RSI can stay overbought for weeks while price keeps marching higher. That’s where the Average Directional Index (ADX) — Welles Wilder’s trend-strength indicator — can save you from getting shaken out too early.

2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks Offering Fat Yields of Over 7.5% in August 2025
In a recent live webinar, John Rowland, CMT walked through a clean approach on Microsoft (MSFT): reference RSI for momentum conditions, and use ADX for trend strength/confirmation. Below is the distilled playbook so you can put it to work, along with links to the short explainer clip and the full webinar for deeper training.
What RSI Really Says (and What It Doesn’t)
-
RSI > 70 = overbought condition, not an automatic sell.
-
RSI < 30 = oversold condition, not an automatic buy.
An actionable RSI signal is often the indicator’s exit from those zones (e.g., RSI falls out of >70). But that signal can be weak when viewed in isolation, especially during powerful trends.
What ADX Tells You
ADX measures trend strength, not direction.
A rising ADX indicates a strengthening trend, while a falling or flattening ADX suggests that momentum is wearing thin.
Common guideposts for using ADX include:
-
< 20: weak/choppy trend
-
20–25: building/borderline
-
> 25: trending
Optionally, use Wilder’s companion lines, +DI / –DI, for directional bias.
Why Combine RSI + ADX?
Because context turns a “maybe” into a plan:
-
If RSI exits overbought territory but ADX is still rising, the uptrend is still strengthening – which means that RSI dip may be noise (an early/false sell signal).
-
If RSI exits overbought and ADX rolls over (stops rising and turns down), that’s a stronger warning of trend fatigue – meaning it’s time to manage risk, take partial profits, and tighten stops.
-
Bearish divergence adds conviction: this is when price makes higher highs while RSI makes lower highs — and if ADX also stalls after rising, odds of a pullback increase.
John’s MSFT Example
Check out the MSFT example in John’s webinar to see this play out on the charts:
-
Setup: MSFT in a strong uptrend; ADX elevated (trend strong) but beginning to flatten.
-
RSI falls out of overbought — alone, that would look like a sell.
-
Cross-check: ADX is still strengthening → not a high-quality RSI sell signal.
-
Higher-quality signal: wait for ADX to turn down while RSI falls, or spot bearish divergence on RSI as price grinds higher.
-
Tactical takeaway: In strong trends, consider risk management (scale out/raise stops) rather than flipping short on the first RSI exit.",845d5748fccc73ea0c88aa85f4491482,trafilatura

The company joins the growing list of electric vehicle (EV) startups that opted for a reverse stock split. Among others, Nikola and Lordstown Motors did reverse stock splits but eventually went out of business. In this article, we’ll examine Lucid’s forecast after the reverse stock split.
Why Is Lucid Motors Doing a Reverse Stock Split?
Companies announce a traditional stock split when their stock rises and becomes too expensive (in dollar terms) for investors. Splits help artificially lower the stock price, which leads to higher liquidity. Conversely, companies announce a reverse stock split when their stock price plunges. Often, these are done to meet the minimum exchange listing requirements, as companies whose share price falls below $1 become delisting candidates.

In Lucid’s case, the reverse stock split is not borne out of regulatory requirements, as the shares are still comfortably above $1. However, it is in the penny stock category as it trades below $5. Looking at the reverse split ratio, LCID shares will trade in the ballpark of $20 after the split is completed.
During the Q2 2025 earnings call earlier this month, Lucid Group’s CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said that the then-planned reverse stock split wasn’t a “cosmetic action” but a “deliberate and targeted measure to ensure Lucid’s equity remains accessible to broader universe of long-only institutional investors.”
He added, “It also aligns our share price with the strategic trajectory of the company as we move into the next chapter of scaling our operations and deepening our capital market engagement.”
To decode that, a higher share price might make Lucid shares appealing to institutional investors as the company will need to do share sales soon, given the upcoming 2026 debt maturities and the depleting cash pile, which stood at $3.6 billion at the end of June.
Are Reverse Stock Splits Good?
While fundamentally, splits and reverse stock splits don’t change anything for a company, markets perceive a stock split as a positive and a sign that the management is feeling good about the company’s outlook. Similarly, a reverse stock split is invariably seen as a negative, and shares tend to fall on such announcements.",0cb2a718a030627120750143773390f7,trafilatura

Edgen, an AI-driven market intelligence platform, today announced a series of major platform upgrades, centered on the launch of AI-generated stock picks, stock ratings, and stock price forecasts. Alongside these initiatives, the company is rolling out a new Market Report system and advancing its proprietary model, EDGM, bringing unprecedented speed and depth to investment research.
AI Stock Picks and Ratings: A Faster Path to Market Clarity
The new AI stock picks feature draws on Edgen’s multi-agent system to identify opportunities across equities with speed and precision. Users can now see which stocks surface as high-potential investments, rated and ranked by AI across multiple dimensions.
Stock ratings distill performance into a transparent scoring framework, providing both institutional and retail investors with a quick way to differentiate between stronger and weaker companies. This rating system, combined with stock price forecasts, enables investors to anticipate potential moves rather than react after the fact. The outcome is sharper, faster decision-making, where signals come directly from AI agents trained to scan, assess, and act at scale.
Market Report: Research Made Instant
Edgen’s new Market Report delivers professional-grade research in under a second. The platform provides structured analysis that consolidates financial data, market momentum, and forward-looking scenarios into a single, easy-to-read report, enabling confident investment decisions at speed.
This capability is powered by EDGM, Edgen’s private model, now upgraded to deliver results almost instantly. What once required hours of manual research, cross-checking analyst notes, and piecing together market commentary can now be compressed into a few seconds of AI-powered insight.
Multi-Agent Intelligence: Personalized, Actionable, Executable
Edgen’s vision goes beyond static recommendations. Its multi-agent architecture introduces a dynamic layer of discovery, exploration, recommendation, and rating. Each agent operates with a specialized focus, such as analyzing technical signals, identifying market trends, or flagging undercovered opportunities, before converging on insights to provide a unified view for the user.
What sets this apart is personalization. Every recommendation is shaped by a user’s preferences, with agents learning and adjusting over time. And critically, every asset surfaced on Edgen is not just rated, but can be executed and traded directly through AI agents, creating a seamless path from analysis to action.",1435da7f34fcadca772588754b31fa3f,trafilatura

But, against the odds, local opponents are starting to make some headway — either by getting concessions from companies or slowing them in their tracks — in an effort to combat the centers' detrimental effects on their communities.
Their strategies include everything from negotiating with tech firms to filing lawsuits against their cities or starting grassroots social media movements. Some 142 activist groups in 24 states across party lines made organizing efforts that resulted in $64 billion worth of US data center projects being stalled or stopped between early 2023 and March 2025, according to a report from Data Center Watch.
Global spending to build data centers — including data center infrastructure and the chips and servers to fill them — is projected to hit $493 billion in 2025 and soar to $920 billion in 2028, according to a July report from Morgan Stanley. This rapid expansion has been promoted by President Trump, who recently signed an executive order aiming to speed up the permitting processes for projects. Already, reckons CNBC, some 16 states granted $6 billion in tax exemptions to data centers over the past five years.
In exchange, Big Tech firms are touting economic benefits to local towns: millions in property tax revenue and jobs. But these centers employ relatively few people and, because of strain on infrastructure, the tax revenue may not be a fair tradeoff. Another problem: Communities are often caught by surprise when their towns announce a data center is coming to their neighborhoods, changing local zoning laws and potentially impacting property values. That's because developers and Big Tech firms ask municipalities to sign controversial nondisclosure agreements.
State legislators’ efforts to enact laws regulating the industry have fallen short. While states have introduced a slew of bills looking to add regulations, most aren’t passed. In Virginia, only one of over 30 bills related to the regulation of data centers made it to the governor's desk — and it was vetoed by the governor. In Georgia, a bill that would have prohibited Georgia Power from passing the electricity costs from data centers on to other ratepayers died in committee. Environmental and advocacy groups in Minnesota have critiqued a recent state law adding regulations for data centers, saying it didn’t go far enough.
No one is under the illusion that the runaway AI train will be stopped in its tracks. But some local communities are slowing it down — taking action where they believe their state and local officials have failed them.
Here are some of their strategies and how they've fared.
Grass roots
Elena Schlossberg is a former middle school counselor living in Haymarket, Va., who started a movement to combat data centers at her kitchen table in 2014 — one that has inspired similar action across the state and even the nation.
Since its inception more than a decade ago, Schlossberg and her neighbors’ group in Virginia, the Coalition to Protect Prince William County, has helped mount two separate years-long legal battles against ""hyperscale"" data centers moving into the state's rural crescent.
The first fight, which lasted from 2014 to 2018, was related to a data center project built by a subsidiary of Amazon (AMZN). While the coalition didn’t stop the data center, their case against Virginia’s dominant utility Dominion Energy — which powered the data center — resulted in a settlement that forced Dominion to bury a piece of its infrastructure (a transmission line) for the project that otherwise would have run through a century-old, working-class Black neighborhood. Schlossberg calls that outcome only a “partial win,” because the cost to cover the infrastructure was still passed on to captive Dominion Energy ratepayers.
After that battle, she and her fellow coalition members were well prepared for their second big legal fight, when Blackstone-owned QTS proposed a 22-million-square-foot data center campus, called the Digital Gateway, in Prince William County, about 35 miles southwest of D.C. Over the course of several years, they helped pay the legal fees of residents who appealed the county’s rezoning of land for the data center. A judge in early August ruled in favor of residents, voiding plans for the project.
“Our pressure is relentless,” Schlossberg said.
(A spokesperson for QTS told Yahoo Finance that it is ""committed to the project and being a responsible, trusted partner to the Prince William County community"" and that the Digital Gateway ruling is ""putting at risk $200 billion of investment into American AI."")
Schlossberg said the coalition has effectively created “a 12-step program in stopping data centers.” Those steps include making a Facebook page, creating neighborhood flyers and yard signs, getting data center critics elected to local commissions, and lawyering up.
Now, Schlossberg shares her knowledge with communities across the state. That includes groups in the cities of Chesapeake and Pittsylvania. Those organizations effectively squashed their towns’ data center proposals with only a few of Schlossberg’s 12 steps.
Chesapeake residents Dennis and Nancy Cashman learned about a proposed data center half a mile from their home through a post on NextDoor and promptly joined a Facebook Group of concerned citizens. They printed out 200 yard signs and joined 200 other residents at a city council meeting in June, where they convinced counselors to vote against rezoning land for the data center.
Schlossberg’s efforts go beyond Virginia. “I get emails from people in Peculiar, Mo., and Texas, and Maryland, and Georgia … Pennsylvania, Ohio,” she said.
Winning delays
In Georgia, more than 2,000 residents across two communities have had mixed success using the Virginia playbook to stall two massive data center developments from entering environmentally sensitive residential areas.
Residents in Palmetto — a rural town that lies across Coweta and Fulton Counties in Georgia — failed to stop 320 acres of rural land just outside their city limits from being rezoned for a 2-million-square-foot data center development called Project Peach. That site sits hundreds of feet from a working-class, rural Black neighborhood in the city, made up mostly of senior citizens.
Their efforts, like writing editorials and calling commissioners in Coweta County, didn't work. Palmetto City Council member Jess Wilbanks told Yahoo Finance that residents’ inability to stop the data center was partly because they found out about Coweta County’s rezoning meeting just weeks before it occurred, after she and her other neighbors spotted a sign on the side of the road.
“We all showed up when it was already too late,” she said. Now, Palmetto Mayor Teresa Thomas-Smith is attempting to negotiate directly with Project Peach’s developer, Cyrus One, to “negotiate some community benefits,” according to Wilbanks. It’s unclear whether the negotiations will result in any concessions.
In a statement to Yahoo Finance, a representative for Cyrus One said, ""While we cannot comment on any ongoing efforts, we look forward to establishing new economic opportunities and community benefits with the establishment of our campus in Coweta County.”
And yet, some success was had: Coweta County placed a six-month moratorium on new data center proposals in May after strong local opposition to Project Peach and another development called Project Sail — a 5-million-square-foot site that, if constructed, would be one of the largest data centers in the world and sit on more than 800 acres of rural land near a Native American heritage site. County commissioners put the moratorium in place while they add new zoning ordinances to govern data center development.
“We were vocal enough in saying that there needs to be ordinances passed specifically for data centers that the county put a moratorium on any new data centers requesting to come into the county,” said Laura Beth, the chair of Citizens for Rural Coweta, who’s leading the fight against Project Sail.
Recently, commissioners delayed a vote on those ordinances after public backlash followed a report that commissioners were caving to data center lobbyists when drafting the rules.
A spokesperson for the commission told Yahoo Finance, ""In terms of the data ordinance, the Board of Commissioners and Coweta County staff have been working diligently to conduct thorough research on data centers in order to develop a draft ordinance ... the Board and staff welcome all feedback from the public as updates to the ordinance are still underway.""
Whatever rules are drafted will help determine whether Project Sail prevails. That project has not gotten approval for rezoning.
Wilbanks’s own group, Stop Project Peach, is helping pay legal fees for an attorney hired to assist residents, who are preparing to fight any zoning decisions related to Project Sail once the county’s zoning ordinances are updated.
“Data centers beget data centers,” Wilbanks said. “So that's why it's really important to stop Project Sail because we weren't able to stop Project Peach.”
Court wars
A group of residents in Minnesota, on the other hand, have focused on the latter part of the Virginia playbook: legal action. Some 17 neighbors have forced a temporary halt in the development of a 338-acre data center campus in Farmington, just hundreds of feet from their homes, after filing a lawsuit against the city.
Cathy Johnson is a Farmington resident and retired teacher. She has owned her home since 1979 and was surprised to learn about the massive data center campus coming to her neighborhood, a middle-class farming community 35 miles outside of Minneapolis, replacing a golf course and unused school board property. The data center is set to be the largest in the state to date and would more than double the city’s water demand.
Her main concerns: that the data center, proposed by Colorado-based developer Tract, would strain Farmington’s water supply; push up utilities costs; disrupt their quiet, residential area; and send her and her neighbors’ property values down.
She and her husband, Gary, helped start their coalition with those neighbors, who reside in Farmington and the neighboring township of Castle Rock, in 2024. They asked the city council in Farmington not to rezone the golf course for industrial use. But that didn’t work, and the city approved the project. Their questions to local officials went unanswered, as city officials had signed an NDA with Tract.
“After we were just being 100% ignored by the city, we combined our pennies and we hired an attorney,” Johnson told Yahoo Finance. They sued the city, alleging that it unlawfully changed Farmington's comprehensive plan — a blueprint cities develop for growth that guides land use — to allow for the site. They also charged that it broke an agreement with a neighboring town by failing to get consent for the site.
Tract did not respond to requests for comment, and the City of Farmington directed Yahoo Finance to its website.
In July, a judge ruled that the city of Farmington could not dismiss the lawsuit.
“We will have our day in court,” Johnson said.
A negotiated win
Indiana stands out as a rare example of advocates successfully negotiating concessions directly from Big Tech data center builders. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG) — which are each developing massive AI data centers worth a total of over $14 billion in northern Indiana — agreed to pay a cumulative $7.5 million into a fund for low-income ratepayers in the state as part of a settlement agreement with advocacy groups and Indiana’s leading utility, I&M.
The Citizens Action Coalition, a nonprofit, and the Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, the state’s ratepayer advocate, negotiated those concessions by intervening in a case filed by I&M with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, which oversees electric utility rates.
“We don't always have this kind of unanimous settlement agreement where every single party in the case is able to reach a grand bargain,” said Ben Inskeep, a program director at the Citizens Action Coalition.
I&M was asking the commission for approval to increase the minimum bill data centers would have to pay each month and to make them pay a fee that could exceed $1 billion if they tried to back out of their long-term contract early.
The Citizens Action Coalition wanted more concessions from both I&M and the Big Tech companies — and they got it. In addition to each company paying $2.5 million over five years to the Indiana Community Action Association to support low-income ratepayers, the settlement includes a provision that requires I&M to file a transparency report, disclosing how much it’s spending to provide service to the data centers and revealing how much power the sites are consuming.
“It is a problem across the country, generally speaking, that data centers are very secretive,” said Inskeep. “It's been a huge problem in Indiana … so this settlement term is unique.”
Firewalls
Virginia's Elena Schlossberg said she believes data centers can be stopped or slowed down.
""Right now, the heavy lift is community by community. Grassroots organizations popping up to protect where they live, one [data center project] application at a time, until finally our state and federal government understands that the way this industry is developing in the most pure sense of the word is not sustainable,"" she said.
She pointed to political pressures on local leaders that are rising in tandem with data center fights.
Schlossberg’s Coalition to Protect Prince William County, for example, has forced out two pro-data center candidates from the county board of supervisors in the last few years and replacedthem with industry critics. Similar upheavals have occurred in Peculiar, Mo., and Oldham County, Ky.
And earlier this month, Laura Beth’s Citizens for Rural Coweta in Georgia launched a political action committee to raise $150,000 to help elect candidates to the Coweta County Commission who would put guardrails around data centers.
Said Schlossberg, ""These small communities are the firewall.""

A Reddit user recently posted a relatable confession titled, “Hate being homeowners, renting feels like throwing money away, condos are a money pit.” They explained that they want to live in a “walkable, urban area” but feel conflicted. Renting feels wasteful to them, while nearby condos “are selling for less than they did 15-20 years ago” and come with high monthly homeowners association fees, sometimes as much as $1,500.
Homeownership Isn’t Always The Dream
That sparked a wave of replies from homeowners, renters, and real estate pros who all agreed on one thing: there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. “Renting is fine,” one realtor replied. “I can’t wait to be a renter again, this house is bankrupting me.”

Another person chimed in with a reality check: “Renting isn’t throwing money away if you actually do the math and you invest what you save versus homeownership. Stop operating off of vibes and really evaluate your options.”
Some commenters shared that they had sold homes and returned to renting, calling it the best decision they ever made. One said, “We moved several times in the last 8 years and only made a profit on one house. Not to mention the last house we bought cost us about $500 more per month than the nearby identical rental homes.”
Condo Life: Complicated And Costly
As for the condo route, multiple people warned about the financial risks of HOAs. “You need to review the HOA’s financials,” one said. “If their reserve funding is low, then do not buy it.”

One person, who runs an HOA, said boards often face pressure to keep dues low, but that can backfire. “We have had boards spend the reserves irresponsibly. It is better for all owners to keep their money till we need it.”
Is Renting The Smarter Move?
Many made strong cases for renting, especially when paired with disciplined investing. “I rent and earn a very high income. I make more in interest and bonds than my rent,” one commenter wrote. “Renting doesn’t feel like throwing money away when I don’t have to pay for repairs, taxes or insurance.”",a03113b4c0bc83fd4a8dcab159d25cb6,trafilatura

Consider This: I'm a Retired Boomer: 6 Bills I Canceled This Year That Were a Waste of Money
According to 2023 research from Capitalize, 29.2 million 401(k) accounts had been forgotten about, equaling around $1.65 trillion in assets. What makes this forgotten money issue even more daunting is the realization that many of these accounts could be frozen at death for the account holder.
Furthermore, FINRA pointed out that when a brokerage account holder dies, the firm will request various documents to help proceed, including a death certificate, a court letter of appointment naming the executor, and a trustee certification (among others).
Your investment accounts can be significant assets that you want your family to benefit from upon your passing. This is why GOBankingRates spoke to experts to help you figure out what you can do to avoid having your investment accounts frozen after you die.
Assign a Beneficiary
“One of the first things I encourage my clients to get in order is their account titling and beneficiary designations,” remarked Aaron Brask, a financial planner at Aaron Brask Capital. “I find the lowest hanging fruit are bank, brokerage and retirement accounts.”
When a married couple has a joint account, the surviving spouse can maintain control of the assets upon the passing of a partner. However, if your accounts are in your name, you want to ensure that you have designated a beneficiary so the account isn’t locked from your family.
“To ensure the accounts aren’t frozen after death, account holders should ensure they’ve designated what’s called a ‘Transfer on Death’ beneficiary, which is someone who can take over the investment account(s) if they die, and in turn benefit from the investment,” said Leslie H. Tayne, Esq., a finance and debt expert and founder of Tayne Law Group. In order to assign a TOD beneficiary, the account holder has to contact the financial institution where the investments are held. The institution should provide the account holder with the proper paperwork and follow up to ensure it’s filled out completely.
Tayne elaborated, “A benefit of assigning a TOD beneficiary is that they should be able to take over the investment accounts without probate, which can be a time-consuming and, at times, complicated process.”

Establish a Living Trust
Brask brought up that in some cases, one’s situation or goals may be too complex for standard account titling or beneficiary designations. Tayne noted the best option here is to establish a living trust, which can include your investment accounts. Tayned added, “While the original account holder is alive, they can manage these accounts, but can also designate a successor to take over these accounts and distribute funds upon their death, if necessary.”",1a47101e28246289b430c493f175f7a9,trafilatura

The coffee chain, which is undergoing an overhaul under CEO Brian Niccol to cut costs and reinvest in its stores, has been struggling with weak demand in the United States for its pricey beverages.
Last week, Starbucks also capped raises for all North America salaried employees at a fixed 2% as part of its cost-cutting measures. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The five plants will adopt a five-day schedule, and the reduction will help pay for upgrades elsewhere after the company found it no longer needs to operate the facilities seven days a week to meet current demand, Bloomberg reported, citing one of the people.
The plants are located in Georgia, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Washington state and produce coffee for Starbucks' stores as well as packaged coffee the company sells at retailers and grocery stores.

By contrast, Ethereum (ETH) surged more than 10% to reach a fresh all-time high of $4,900. This move followed dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the Jackson Hole symposium, signaling lower interest rates.
Powell noted that downside risks to employment have risen, opening the door for a possible rate cut in September. In response, CME Group’s Fed Watch tool shows analysts now pricing in 75% of a rate easing in the next FOMC slated for September 17, 2025.
Altcoins reacted strongly with ETH, Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) all posting double-digit gains in the past 24 hours, consolidating above key resistance levels at $4,750, $3, $200, and $0.90, respectively, at the time of publication.
Bitcoin, however, failed to keep pace, quickly retreating to $115,600, after a rejection from its intraday peak of $117,370. Market metrics highlight three main reasons behind BTC’s underwhelming performance compared to its rivals.
1. Bitcoin Sees Weak Demand Among Coinbase Whale Traders
One major factor has been weak institutional demand. Cryptoquant’s Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the difference between Bitcoin prices on Coinbase Pro, dominated by US-based corporate investors and retail-dominated Binance, fell to 0.002%, its lowest since Aug. 1.
When this metric trends negative or near-zero, it signals that corporate investors are showing little appetite, leaving retail traders to drive market activity. The 21-day low reading on Fridays suggested that while retail participation was strong, whale buyers in the U.S. remained hesitant.
This cautious stance among institutions has weighed heavily on Bitcoin’s ability to push higher against its layer-1 rivals.
2. Bitcoin ETFs Failed to Register a Single Day of Inflow this Week
ETF flows this week further emphasized investor preferences, sidelining Bitcoin. According to Farside Investors, Bitcoin funds recorded $23 million in outflows on Friday.
This meant that the Bitcoin ETF failed to register a single day of net inflows this week, shedding $1.2 billion as withdrawals exceeded deposits in six consecutive trading days dating back to Aug. 15.
In contrast, Ethereum ETFs pulled in $337 million in net inflows on Friday after taking in $287 million on Thursday.
This divergence highlights how investor capital rotated toward Ethereum and other altcoins following Powell’s remarks, leaving Bitcoin sidelined in the rally. Without ETF inflows to support upward pressure, BTC’s upside trajectory was inevitably capped.",97d3424c28be13b58bb72ed3408a1c13,trafilatura

Find out how much you could earn by locking in a high CD rate today. The Federal Reserve cut its federal funds rate three times in 2024, so now could be your last chance to lock in a competitive CD rate before rates fall further. CD rates vary widely across financial institutions, so it’s important to ensure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a CD.
The following is a breakdown of CD rates today and where to find the best offers.
Overview of CD rates today
Generally, the best CD rates today are offered on shorter terms of around one year or less. Online banks and credit unions, in particular, offer the top CD rates.
As of August 23, 2025, the highest CD rate is 4.4% APY offered by Marcus by Goldman Sachs on its 6-month CD. There is a $500 minimum opening deposit.
Here is a look at some of the best CD rates available today:
This embedded content is not available in your region.
How much interest can I earn with a CD?
The amount of interest you can earn from a CD depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (CD interest typically compounds daily or monthly).
Say you invest $1,000 in a one-year CD with 1.81% APY, and interest compounds monthly. At the end of that year, your balance would grow to $1,018.25 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus $18.25 in interest.
Now let’s say you choose a one-year CD that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.74 over the same period, which includes $40.74 in interest.
The more you deposit in a CD, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a one-year CD at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance when the CD matures would be $10,407.42, meaning you’d earn $407.42 in interest.

Types of CDs
When choosing a CD, the interest rate is usually top of mind. However, the rate isn’t the only factor you should consider. There are several types of CDs that offer different benefits, though you may need to accept a slightly lower interest rate in exchange for more flexibility. Here’s a look at some of the common types of CDs you can consider beyond traditional CDs:
-
Bump-up CD: This type of CD allows you to request a higher interest rate if your bank's rates go up during the account’s term. However, you’re usually allowed to ""bump up"" your rate just once.
-
No-penalty CD: Also known as a liquid CD, type of CD gives you the option to withdraw your funds before maturity without paying a penalty.
-
Jumbo CD: These CDs require a higher minimum deposit (usually $100,000 or more), and often offer higher interest rate in return. In today’s CD rate environment, however, the difference between traditional and jumbo CD rates may not be much.
-
Brokered CD: As the name suggests, these CDs are purchased through a brokerage rather than directly from a bank. Brokered CDs can sometimes offer higher rates or more flexible terms, but they also carry more risk and might not be FDIC-insured.

Free mortgage calculator
Use the mortgage calculator below to see how today's interest rates would affect your monthly mortgage payments.
For a deeper dive, you can use Yahoo's free mortgage calculator to see how homeowners insurance and property taxes factor into in your monthly payment estimate. You even have the option to enter costs for private mortgage insurance (PMI) and homeowners' association dues if those apply to you. These details result in a more accurate monthly payment estimate than if you simply calculated your mortgage principal and interest.
30-year fixed mortgage rates: Pros and cons
There are two main advantages to a 30-year fixed mortgage: Your payments are lower, and your monthly payments are predictable.
A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has relatively low monthly payments because you’re spreading your repayment out over a longer period of time than with, say, a 15-year mortgage. Your payments are predictable because, unlike with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your rate isn’t going to change from year to year. Most years, the only things that might affect your monthly payment are any changes to your homeowners insurance or property taxes.
The main disadvantage to 30-year fixed mortgage rates is mortgage interest — both in the short and long term.
A 30-year fixed term comes with a higher rate than a shorter fixed term, and it’s higher than the intro rate to a 30-year ARM. The higher your rate, the higher your monthly payment. You’ll also pay much more in interest over the life of your loan due to both the higher rate and the longer term.
15-year fixed mortgage rates: Pros and cons
The pros and cons of 15-year fixed mortgage rates are basically swapped from the 30-year rates. Yes, your monthly payments will still be predictable, but another advantage is that shorter terms come with lower interest rates. Not to mention, you’ll pay off your mortgage 15 years sooner. So you’ll save potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest over the course of your loan.
However, because you’re paying off the same amount in half the time, your monthly payments will be higher than if you choose a 30-year term.
Dig deeper: 15-year vs. 30-year mortgages
Adjustable mortgage rates: Pros and cons
Adjustable-rate mortgages lock in your rate for a predetermined amount of time, then change it periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years and then goes up or down once per year for the remaining 25 years.
The main advantage is that the introductory rate is usually lower than what you’ll get with a 30-year fixed rate, so your monthly payments will be lower. (Current average rates don't necessarily reflect this, though — in some cases, fixed rates are actually lower. Talk to your lender before deciding between a fixed or adjustable rate.)
With an ARM, you have no idea what mortgage rates will be like once the intro-rate period ends, so you risk your rate increasing later. This could ultimately end up costing more, and your monthly payments are unpredictable from year to year.
But if you plan to move before the intro-rate period is over, you could reap the benefits of a low rate without risking a rate increase down the road.

Is now a good time to buy a house?
First of all, now is a relatively good time to buy a house compared to a couple of years ago. Home prices aren't spiking like they were during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you want or need to buy a house soon, you should feel pretty good about the current housing market.
However, mortgage rates are staying relatively high due to the political and economic climate. Experts don't think rates will plummet in 2025, so you might not want to base your decision on whether to buy strictly on interest rates. Recent news that home price gains are slowing, with predictions that house values may actually ease lower this year, can be part of your home-buying decision.
The best time to buy is typically whenever it makes sense for your stage of life. Trying to time the real estate market can be as futile as timing the stock market — buy when it's the right time for you.

Today's mortgage rates: FAQs
What is a 30-year mortgage rate right now?
According to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.53% right now. But keep in mind that mortgage rates vary by state and even ZIP code. For example, if you're buying in a city with a high cost of living, rates could be higher.
Are interest rates expected to go down?
Overall, mortgage rates are expected to decrease slightly in 2025. Rates may inch up or down daily, but there shouldn't be a huge shift in the next couple of weeks.
Are mortgage rates dropping?
Overall, mortgage rates are dropping slightly. Today's 30-year fixed mortgage rate is down by three basis points.
How do I get the lowest refinance rate?
In many ways, securing a low mortgage refinance rate is similar to when you bought your home. Try to improve your credit score and lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Refinancing into a shorter term will also land you a lower rate, though your monthly mortgage payments will be higher.",81d5e2493987a6119310534b0aa925a1,trafilatura

I’ve seen enough people describe income-centric strategies as the investment equivalent of watching white paint dry. And despite being a conservative dividend investor, I find the comparison utterly funny and eerily accurate. But one of the advantages of dividend investing - especially if you invest in ultra-safe companies like the ones in the Dividend Aristocrats list - is the security and consistency it brings.
Sure, they don’t have double-digit yields. Sometimes, they don’t even have single-digit yields. But what they do offer is reliability and the promise of potential price and dividend growth over longer investing horizons, making them perfect for retirement portfolios.
And, if you’re looking to enhance your chances of returns, you can limit your selection to stocks that have both favorable fundamentals and technicals. But since we’re all busy and nobody really has the time to delve into fundamental metrics and technical indicators of thousands of stocks, I can show you how to identify ripe opportunities using just a handful of indicators, courtesy of Barchart’s Stock Screener and proprietary analysis tools. Here’s how it works.
How I Came Up With The Following Stocks
With Barchart’s Stock Screener, I used the following filters:
Overall Buy/Sell/Hold Signal: Buy. This filter is based on Barchart Opinion, the website’s proprietary analysis tool that combines 13 popular technical indicators to provide stock ratings. A “Buy” recommendation means that most of the indicators suggest a bullish trend.
Overall Opinion %: More than 70%. Through this filter, I am limiting the results to Dividend Aristocrats with a weighted score of over 70%, so that I get a list of companies that offer the best chance for a favorable upside price movement.
Current Analysts Rating: 4.5 to 5 (Strong Buy). Next, I’ve limited the results to stocks that have high analyst scores. Wall Street analyst ratings reflect the company's business and prospects, so the focus is on fundamental metrics. Though some analysts may have different analysis processes than others, a consensus Strong Buy means Wall Street is quite optimistic about the stock.
Watchlists: Dividend Aristocrats only.
After running the scan, I got exactly three companies, which I arranged from highest to lowest opinion percentage score:
With that out of the way, let’s get started with the top one:
S&P Global Inc (SPGI)
First on the list is S&P Global, one of the most prominent financial services companies worldwide. The company offers market analytics, credit ratings, mobility insights, and the establishment and management of indices, some of which serve as barometers for entire markets and industries. Even newbie investors would recognize the S&P 500, and even the basis for this article - the Dividend Aristocrats list - comes from S&P Global.
The company currently pays $3.84 annually, translating to a yield of approximately 0.7%, which is relatively low by most standards. S&P Global has maintained low yields for almost all of its dividend-paying history.
But that’s not why dividend investors and analysts love the stock. In the last 20 years, SPGI has returned over 1,000% to investors on price appreciation alone. Right now, Wall Street gives the stock a 4.71 average score, while Barchart Opinion echoes the assessment with a 100% Strong Buy recommendation.
Nucor Corp (NUE)
Nucor Corporation is a producer of steel and steel products. The company is the largest steel manufacturer in North America and operates over 300 mills and recycling facilities that service data centers, automotive companies, energy outfits, and, of course, the construction industry.
Nucor currently pays $2.20 per share per year, which translates to a roughly 1.5% yield. Analysts rate NUE a borderline Strong Buy with a 4.5 average score, while Barchart Opinion rates it an 88% Strong Buy.
Walmart Inc (WMT)
Last but not least is Walmart, the retail behemoth that operates over 10,750 brick-and-mortar stores to service over 255 million customers weekly. The company also operates a growing e-commerce platform and has a presence in over 19 countries.
Like S&P Global, Walmart has a relatively low yield: around 0.96% based off its 94-cent annual payout. But, like the other companies on this list, WMT has proven itself as a winner for long-term investors, returning over 550% in the last 20 years.
Analysts rate WMT stock a 4.78 average score - the highest on this list, while it maintains an 80% Strong Buy rating from Barchart Opinion.
Final Thoughts
These three Dividend Aristocrats, while offering low yields, provide investors the opportunity for above-average growth over the long term, based on analyst expectations and technical analysis. However, no stock list will ever be the end-all, be-all of dividend investing. Market dynamics - and, indeed, personal priorities - can be fluid, so make sure you do your research and ensure that you’re investing in companies that fit your investment thesis.

Find out how much you could earn with today’s savings rates. Interest rates on savings accounts have been falling, so it’s important to be sure you’re getting the best rate possible when shopping around for a savings account. The following is a breakdown of savings interest rates today and where to find the best offers.
Overview of savings interest rates today
The national average savings account rate stands at 0.38%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.06%.
Although the national average savings interest rate is fairly low compared to other investments, the best savings rates on the market today are much higher. In fact, some of the top accounts are currently offering 4% APY and up.
As of August 23, 2025, the highest savings account rate available from our partners is 4.3% APY. This rate is offered Openbank and requires no minimum deposit.
Here is a look at some of the best savings rates available today from our verified partners:

How much interest can I earn with a savings account?
The amount of interest you can earn from a savings account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (savings account interest typically compounds daily).
Say you put $1,000 in a savings account at the average interest rate of 0.39% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $1,003.91 — your initial $1,000 deposit, plus just $3.91 in interest.
Now let’s say you choose a high-yield savings account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $1,040.81 over the same period, which includes $40.81 in interest.
The more you deposit in a savings account, the more you stand to earn. If we took our same example of a high-yield savings account at 4% APY, but deposit $10,000, your total balance after one year would be $10,408.08, meaning you’d earn $408.08 in interest.

HELOC rates today are mostly unchanged. Little movement is expected between now and the next Federal Reserve interest rate announcement on September 17. That's when home equity line of credit interest rates could move slightly lower — if the Fed announces a rate cut.

HELOC rates Saturday, August 23, 2025
According to Bank of America, the country's highest-volume HELOC lender, today's average APR on a 10-year draw HELOC is 8.72%. That is a variable rate that kicks in after a six-month introductory APR, which is 6.49% in most states.
Homeowners have an abundant amount of value tied up in their houses — more than $34 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Federal Reserve. That's the third-largest amount of home equity on record.
With mortgage rates lingering in the high 6% range, homeowners are not going to let go of their primary mortgage anytime soon, so selling a house may not be an option. Why let go of your 5%, 4% — or even 3% mortgage?
Accessing some of that value with a use-it-as-you-need-it HELOC can be an excellent alternative.

How lenders determine HELOC interest rates
HELOC interest rates are different from primary mortgage rates. Second mortgage rates are based on an index rate plus a margin. That index is often the prime rate, which today is 7.50%. If a lender added 1% as a margin, the HELOC would have a rate of 8.50%.
Lenders have flexibility with pricing on a second mortgage product, such as a HELOC or home equity loan, so it pays to shop. Your rate will depend on your credit score, the amount of debt you carry, and the amount of your credit line compared to the value of your home.
And average national HELOC rates can include ""introductory"" rates that may only last for six months or one year. After that, your interest rate will become adjustable, likely beginning at a substantially higher rate.
How a HELOC works
You don't have to give up your low-rate mortgage to access the equity in your home. Keep your primary mortgage and consider a second mortgage, such as a home equity line of credit.
The best HELOC lenders offer low fees, a fixed-rate option, and generous credit lines. A HELOC allows you to easily use your home equity in any way and in any amount you choose, up to your credit line limit. Pull some out; pay it back. Repeat.
Meanwhile, you're paying down your low-interest-rate primary mortgage like the wealth-building machine you are.

Look for introductory rates, but be aware of a rate adjustment later
Today, FourLeaf Credit Union is offering a HELOC rate of 6.49% for 12 months on lines up to $500,000. That's an introductory rate that will convert to a variable rate later. When shopping lenders, be aware of both rates. And as always, compare fees, repayment terms, and the minimum draw amount. The draw is the amount of money a lender requires you to initially take from your equity.
The power of a HELOC is tapping only what you need and leaving some of your line of credit available for future needs. You don't pay interest on what you don't borrow.
HELOC rates today: FAQs
What is a good interest rate on a HELOC right now?
Rates vary so much from one lender to the next that it's hard to pin down a magic number. You may see rates from nearly 7% to as much as 18%. It really depends on your creditworthiness and how diligent a shopper you are.
Is it a good idea to get a HELOC right now?
For homeowners with low primary mortgage rates and a chunk of equity in their house, it's probably one of the best times to get a HELOC. You don't give up that great mortgage rate, and you can use the cash drawn from your equity for things like home improvements, repairs, and upgrades. Of course, you can use a HELOC for fun things too, like a vacation — if you have the discipline to pay it off promptly. A vacation is likely not worth taking on long-term debt.
What is the monthly payment on a $50,000 home equity line of credit?
If you take out the full $50,000 from a line of credit on a $400,000 home, your payment may be around $395 per month with a variable interest rate beginning at 8.75%. That's for a HELOC with a 10-year draw period and a 20-year repayment period. That sounds good, but remember, it winds up being a 30-year loan. HELOCs are best if you borrow and pay back the balance in a much shorter period of time.",28eb2cf974d64a2429992a0c6d40853f,trafilatura

Find out how much you could earn with today’s money market account rates. Deposit interest rates (including money market account rates) have been falling over the past year. That's why it’s more important than ever to compare MMA rates and ensure you earn as much as possible on your balance.
Overview of money market account rates today
The national average money market account rate stands at 0.59%, according to the FDIC. This might not seem like much, but consider that three years ago, it was just 0.07%. So by historical standards, money market account rates are still quite high.
Even so, some of the top accounts are currently offering over 4% APY. Since these rates may not be around much longer, consider opening a money market account now to take advantage of today’s high rates.
Here’s a look at some of the top MMA rates available today:

How much will $10,000 make in a money market account?
The amount of interest you can earn from a money market account depends on the annual percentage rate (APY). This is a measure of your total earnings after one year when considering the base interest rate and how often interest compounds (money market account interest typically compounds daily).
Say you put $10,000 in an MMA at the average interest rate of 0.59% with daily compounding. At the end of one year, your balance would grow to $10,059.17 — your initial $10,000 deposit, plus $59.17 in interest.
Now let’s say you choose a high-yield money market account that offers 4% APY instead. In this case, your balance would grow to $10,408.08 over the same period, which includes $408.08 in interest.
Frequently asked questions about money market account rates
What is the downside of a money market account?
Compared to a traditional savings account, a money market account may come with more restrictions. For example, money market accounts often require a higher minimum balance in order to earn the best interest rate and/or avoid fees. Certain MMAs may also limit the number of withdrawals you can make per month (typically six).
Which bank gives 7% interest on savings accounts?
In general, there are no banks that offer a 7% interest rate on money market accounts or any other type of deposit account. That said, you may be able to find local banks and credit unions running limited-time promotional rates on certain accounts, which could be as high as 7%. However, promotional rates at this level often apply to a limited balance.

That passivity has left trillions of dollars’ worth of BTC sitting idle in wallets, disconnected from the yield strategies and composability that define decentralized finance (DeFi).
The rise of liquid staking tokens promises to change that, positioning bitcoin not only as a store of value but as a productive asset integrated into onchain capital markets.
Liquid staking refers to the process of uses offering their crypto to help secure a network, and receive a liquid, tradable token in return that represents their staked assets and can be used across DeFi while the original tokens continue earning staking rewards.
Lombard Finance has emerged as one of the prominent projects in bitcoin liquid staking. Its flagship product, LBTC, is a yield-bearing token backed 1:1 by BTC.
When BTC is deposited into the Lombard protocol, the underlying coins are staked, primarily via Babylon, a protocol enabling trustless, self-custodial bitcoin staking. Users receive LBTC in return, which can be deployed across DeFi ecosystems while the original Bitcoin earns staking rewards.
This dual functionality is key. Holders can keep exposure to bitcoin while using LBTC in lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision across protocols such as Aave, Morpho, Pendle, and Ether.fi. Designed for interoperability, LBTC moves across Ethereum, Base, BNB Chain, and other networks, preventing liquidity fragmentation and ensuring bitcoin can participate in a multi-chain DeFi environment.
A market potentially worth billions
By mobilizing BTC's dormant liquidity, Lombard and other liquid staking projects aim to provide the infrastructure for Bitcoin DeFi, channeling the asset’s vast market cap into onchain capital markets.
This effort mirrors Ethereum’s own transformation through liquid staking derivatives, but with the potential to unlock a deeper pool of value given bitcoin’s scale.
To contextualize the difference in scale, Ethereum’s liquid staking market, led by Lido’s stETH, boasts a market cap of approximately $38 billion. In contrast, the entire bitcoin LST sector is still nascent, with total market capitalization around $2.5 billion. Lombard’s LBTC alone accounts for roughly $1.4 billion of that, or around 40% of the bitcoin LST market.
Lombard’s BARD
Building on that foundation, Lombard this week announced the creation of the Liquid Bitcoin Foundation and its native $BARD token, alongside a $6.75 million community sale.
The Foundation will act as an independent steward of the protocol, funding research, grants, and education, while establishing governance frameworks to preserve neutrality. $BARD will serve as the utility and governance token of the ecosystem, giving holders the ability to stake to secure Lombard’s core infrastructure, vote on proposals, and gain access to new products.
Jacob Phillips, Lombard’s co-founder, described the community sale as “an invitation to over 260,000 LBTC holders and others in the Bitcoin ecosystem to help shape the future of bitcoin onchain.” Erick Zhang, founder of Buidlpad who will host the sale, added that Lombard is “a pioneer unlocking bitcoin’s full potential as digital gold and a foundation for next-gen capital markets.”",51f4fb8f8834e103b8f00a68b9844f1c,trafilatura

The rating affirmation reflects the growing momentum in Amazon’s Project Kuiper satellite initiative.
Using both United Launch Alliance and SpaceX rockets, Amazon has completed four launches to date. The firm noted how Amazon has revealed plans to launch commercial beta later this year or in early 2026.
Provided that Amazon achieves a similar satellite launch trajectory as Starlink (between 2020-2023) over the next 2-3 years, the firm estimates Project Kuiper to generate between $2.5 billion and $5 billion in incremental revenues by the year 2028-2029.

“AMZN’s Project Kuiper has historically faced setbacks due to delays from launch providers, but recent activity indicates growing momentum. The company has now completed four launches (2 ULA, 2 SpaceX), bringing the total constellation to 102 satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). On AMZN’s 2Q25 earnings call, the company indicated plans to launch commercial beta later this year / early FY26E. 3P data we monitor indicates that AMZN has plans to send another 350 satellites (bringing the total to 450) in upcoming launches throughout 2025.”

Leading ETF issuers such as Franklin Templeton (NYSE: BEN), Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, CoinShares, 21Shares, and WisdomTree updated their XRP ETF filings on Aug. 22, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart highlighted on X. He added:
""Almost certainly due to feedback from SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected.""
The updates request the SEC to allow some of the ETFs to have XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions instead of cash creations and redemptions only.

That's a question we can ask about Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Shopify(NASDAQ: SHOP), two tech leaders that have been on a tear this year. The former is up 20% since January, while the latter has climbed 27%. Is there any upside left?
In my view, the answer is a resounding yes. Not only can both companies still deliver superior returns, but they also have many of the qualities required of ""forever stocks."" Let's dig in.
1. Microsoft
Microsoft is firing on all cylinders. The company's revenue in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 2025, which ended on June 30, increased 18% year over year to $76.4 billion. On the profitability front, earnings per share rose 24% year over year, to $3.65. To no one's surprise, the company's cloud division had a lot to do with this strong performance. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew significantly faster -- 39% versus 30% the same period last year.
Microsoft is increasingly gaining on its competitor in the cloud industry, namely Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which currently holds the spot. Furthermore, the numbers indicate that there is still significant room for growth for the company. Microsoft had $368 billion in contracted revenue on its books as of the end of the period, representing a 37% increase year over year.
Had Microsoft not seized the cloud opportunity when it did, choosing instead to focus on its operating system (OS) offerings, it would be a different company today. Although there is nothing wrong with its legacy OS business, it has been supplanted as Microsoft's most important growth driver by cloud computing and artificial intelligence, two industries that are expected to maintain an upward momentum for a very long time.
That tells us several things about Microsoft: It is a well-run, innovative company with attractive growth prospects. Add the company's moat, derived from its brand name and switching costs, and Microsoft looks likely to continue offering competitive returns over the next five years and beyond. Lastly, Microsoft is a terrific dividend stock: Don't let its meager 0.7% forward yield fool you.
Microsoft generates significant amounts of cash flow, has ample funds to more than cover its annual dividend payments -- as evidenced by its conservative cash payout ratio of 33.6% -- and has increased its payouts by 130.6% over the past decade. Microsoft is a no-brainer for growth and dividend stocks that investors can park in their portfolios for the long term.
2. Shopify
Shopify experienced a slump after reaching its all-time high in late 2021, which lasted approximately a year. Since 2023, the company has been on fire. Several changes to its business have allowed it to get back on track. Shopify increased its prices after more than a decade of not doing so. The company also got rid of its expensive logistics business. The result: Rebounding revenue growth, expanding margin, and the occasional net profit.
Shopify had most of those during the second quarter. Revenue increased 31% year over year to $2.7 billion, while its net income came in at $906 million, which was much better than the $171 million reported in the year-ago period. Shopify's free cash flow jumped by 26.7% to $422 million, while free cash flow margin remained flat at 16%.
Shopify should experience growing demand for its services over the long term as the e-commerce market continues to expand. The company has already established itself as a leader in its niche, helping merchants build online storefronts. Shopify's platform makes it easy for merchants to get started and offers a rich suite of services ideally adapted to the demands of modern commerce, so they can focus on running their businesses.
That's why Shopify's customer count has been growing at a good clip for a while, and it has grabbed more than 12% share of the U.S. e-commerce market by gross merchandise volume. Further, it also benefits from a moat thanks to switching costs and network effects. Shopify wants to be a 100-year company. This long journey has, so far, started well, and there should be plenty of upside for investors who stay the course. Shopify looks like an excellent forever stock.

(NYSE:VRT) is one of the best data center stocks to buy now. On August 11, Morgan Stanley analyst Christopher Snyder raised his price target on Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) to $165 from $125 and reiterated a Buy rating, citing stronger order trends and more favorable margin comparisons as the company heads into fiscal 2026.
Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) had already delivered an impressive second quarter, with full-year guidance lifted. The company closed the quarter with an $8.5 billion order backlog, which Snyder sees as a key support for growth.

The analyst highlighted that Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) added another $1.3 billion to backlog in the first half of 2025 while organic growth accelerated to 30%. With the business already running at close to a $3 billion quarterly revenue pace, Snyder believes Vertiv is on track to meet 2027 sales expectations even without incremental order growth.
One area of caution is margins, which have been flat through 2025. Snyder attributes this to short-term inefficiencies linked to urgent customer demand, ongoing capacity expansion, and some pricing delays in contracted data center projects. However, he expects these headwinds to ease over the next year, giving room for margins to expand again and unlocking higher operating leverage.
Although valuation is above peers, Snyder believes the premium is justified given Vertiv Holdings' (NYSE:VRT) robust growth, sizable backlog, and leading position in AI-driven data center infrastructure.
Vertiv Holdings Co. (NYSE:VRT) is engaged in the design, manufacturing, and servicing of critical digital infrastructure for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments.

Analysts remain divided on the rationale of the deal. Some see the transaction as a political move, while others question its immediate financial benefits for SoftBank. There were no significant changes seen in ratings, and most of the analysts remain on the sidelines, given the uncertainty over the long-term outlook.
Voicing similar concerns in an August 20 report, an analyst from Truist Securities reaffirmed his Hold rating on Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) with a $21 price target. The analyst noted that Intel’s recent capital raise provides short-term support but stressed that the company’s issues extend beyond funding.
According to the analyst, Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) is still in the midst of a turnaround, with key parts of the business needing more work before it can consistently execute. He expects this process to take time, which supports a cautious view on the stock.

The company is shifting toward much larger builds, moving from 10 MW facilities to 30-60 MW sites, with plans for multi-hundred MW campuses.

More recently, analysts from Bank of America Securities and Evercore ISI also reiterated their Buy or equivalent ratings during August 11-14, with price targets of $950 and $960, respectively.

(NYSE:DLR) with a $195 price target. His decision comes even as data center stocks have recently come under pressure, which is partly attributed to rising interest rates.
Despite that, the analysts pointed out that second-quarter results across the group were broadly healthy, with estimates moving higher. Demand for data centers remains strong, pricing trends are supportive, and hyperscale customers continue to emphasize infrastructure buildouts to support AI, with sector-wide investments expected to approach $550 billion by 2026.

The stock has surged 114% year-to-date, fueled by accelerating demand for artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC). This demand has elevated APLD’s position in the data center space and kept investor attention firmly on its growth pipeline.
That story gained an extra push on August 18, when the company unveiled plans for a $3 billion, 280-megawatt (MW) AI Factory near Harwood, North Dakota. The project, called Polaris Forge 2, will break ground in September 2025, with the first capacity expected in 2026 and full operations in early 2027. The announcement triggered a 16% rally in the stock by the end of the trading day.

In addition, Polaris Forge 1, a 400 MW HPC campus, remains under construction and is scheduled to go live in 2025. Together, these projects significantly expand the company’s scale in an industry seeing rapid capital inflows.
Reflecting this momentum, George Sutton, an analyst from Craig-Hallum, raised his price target to $23 from $12 while keeping a Buy rating. In the note published on August 18, the analyst noted that private-market deals in the data center sector are being struck at multiples and capitalization rates that imply more upside for Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) than current trading levels suggest. In his view, the market has yet to fully price in the company’s project pipeline or the valuation benchmarks set by comparable transactions.
It is worth noting that the stock carries a beta of roughly 6.0, highlighting its high volatility. Investors may want to carefully weigh this risk before making any investment decision.

No doubt, demand for capacity from the ever-evolving generative AI and high-performance computing (HPC) is at the core of this investor enthusiasm.
While the company is scheduled to report its results on August 21, expectations remain high, and analyst consensus is overwhelmingly positive. Analyst sentiment has been broadly supportive, indicating confidence in its investment case.
A data center filled with the latest servers and networking equipment representing the company's cutting edge security infrastructure.
First of the two names that have recently published their optimistic reports is Yang Liu from Morgan Stanley. In a report released on July 22, the analyst maintained a Buy rating on VNET Group (NASDAQ:VNET) and raised the price target to $12 from $10.
Back in late June, Citi analyst Louis Tsang also reaffirmed his positive stance on VNET Group Inc. (NASDAQ:VNET), keeping a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $20, which is closer to the consensus high of $24. At that time, the company had raised its FY 2025 revenue and EBITDA guidance, which was already in line with Tsang’s above-consensus forecasts, reinforcing confidence in its operating momentum.
Tsang highlighted that VNET’s $50 million share repurchase could help stabilize the stock. He also cited upcoming projects such as B30, along with possible Hong Kong and C-REIT listings, as events that may drive further interest. In addition, he noted the company’s partnership with Shandong Highspeed on green power, which is expected to cut energy costs and support margin improvement for VNET Group Inc. (NASDAQ:VNET) and its clients.
Beyond these near-term drivers, Tsang emphasized VNET’s expansion of IDC capacity and its exposure to AI-related demand as important long-term growth levers.
Tsang’s bullish thesis has held up so far, as the stock has gained another 11% since his report. The 1-year median consensus price target for the stock stands at $12.2, which still indicates a substantial potential upside of 56% and further room for the rally to continue.

For the most part, analysts are optimistic about the report, due out after the close of trading on Aug. 27. Consensus forecasts have the semiconductor company growing earnings 48.5% year over year, to $1.01 per share, as insatiable demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips drives a near-53% rise in revenue to almost $46 billion.
That's a lot of money Nvidia will be raking in for a single quarter. This is one of the primary reasons why a staggering 58 analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence give Nvidia stock either a ""buy"" or an ""outperform,"" or an equivalent rating -- versus only one single analyst who says ""sell.""
One reason why two analysts are worried about Nvidia
And yet, not everything's unicorns and rainbows for Nvidia stock. As the final countdown to earnings day begins, two separate Wall Street analysts chimed in Wednesday morning to raise reservations about Nvidia stock and the challenges that lie ahead for it.
First up was Deutsche Bank, where analyst Ross Seymore set a price target of $155 that implies the stock could fall 12% over the next 12 months. Ordinarily, the prospect of a 12% near-term loss in a stock would inspire an analyst to recommend selling that stock. But perhaps fearing to deviate too far from the herd on this popular AI stock, Seymore only reiterated a ""hold"" rating on Nvidia. (Seymore is still one of only a half-dozen analysts with neutral ratings on Nvidia).
No matter. Whether any one analyst thinks Nvidia is a ""buy"" or just a ""hold"" probably shouldn't concern us as much as why he rates the stock as he does. And in Seymore's case, the answer couldn't be clearer:
Writing on StreetInsider.com on Wednesday, Seymore warns that U.S. trade restrictions on semiconductor exports to China will cost Nvidia about $8 billion in ""foregone"" revenue in Q2. True, a resumption of shipments upon receiving export licenses from the Trump administration should help rectify this situation by Q3. But there's a cost to that solution -- specifically, the Trump Administration's requirement that, to obtain export licenses, Nvidia must fork over 15% of any revenue it generates in China to the IRS.
With China accounting for roughly $17 billion of Nvidia's revenue over the last 12 months, that could amount to a $2.6 billion drag on Nvidia's profits over the next 12 months.
KeyBanc chimes in
Investment bank KeyBanc shares Deutsche Bank's concerns about Nvidia and China. On the one hand, KeyBanc anticipates Nvidia could book $2 billion to $3 billion in revenue from selling H20 and B40 chips in China next quarter. On the other hand, the banker believes this revenue is unreliable and dependent upon the receipt of export licenses from Washington.
For this reason, KeyBanc warns Nvidia may ""exclude direct revenue from China"" when giving revenue guidance next week, potentially creating a kind of guidance miss that could send Nvidia shares lower.
KeyBanc also cites the ""potential 15% tax on AI exports"" from the U.S. side as a risk, and adds that ""pressure from the [Chinese] government for its AI providers to use domestic AI chips"" could dampen Nvidia's China revenues even further -- adding a third risk that Deutsche didn't mention!
Finally, some good news
Now, I hope I haven't painted too bleak a picture for you here. Fact is, despite his reservations, Deutsche analyst Seymore still expects Nvidia to report a ""typical"" earnings beat next week, exceeding the company's $45 billion revenue forecast by about $2 billion. Blackwell revenue is ramping, says Seymore, more than doubling sequentially between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, to $24 billion.
With the prospect of an imminent earnings beat, it makes sense that Seymore would hesitate to recommend selling Nvidia stock -- even if he does feel it's a bit overpriced.
Furthermore, KeyBanc agrees that Blackwell production is ramping, and a new Blackwell Ultra (B300) chip is on the way, potentially boosting revenue even more in Q3. For these and other reasons, KeyBanc not only still rates Nvidia stock ""overweight"" (i.e., buy). KeyBanc actually raised its price target on the stock to $215 on Wednesday.
So, is Nvidia stock a buy or not?
That's the real question, isn't it? Wall Street's confident Nvidia will ""beat"" on Q2 next week. It's just worried that Nvidia will ""miss"" on guidance for Q3. Longer-term, though, is Nvidia stock a buy or isn't it?
Here's how I look at it, and I'll keep this really simple:
Valued at 4.28 trillion dollars, earning nearly $77 billion in annual profit, and backing that up with roughly $72 billion in annual free cash flow, Nvidia stock costs about 55 times trailing earnings and about 59 times free cash flow. For Nvidia stock to be a clear-cut buy, I'd want to see the stock growing earnings at least 50% annually over the next five years.
The best that Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to do, however, is 30% annual growth -- even with nine out of 10 analysts polled saying Nvidia stock is a buy.
The math here isn't hard. Nvidia stock is not a buy at this price -- but it might be if it sells off after earnings.
Should you buy stock in Nvidia right now?
Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:
The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

On August 11, the company presented at the KeyBanc Capital Markets Technology Leadership Forum, where Michael Stager, SVP of Corporate Development, discussed SuperMicro’s market position and growth targets.
Stager highlighted that the company has expanded its share from 3.5% in 2021 to 22% today and now targets about one-third of the market by fiscal 2026. Revenue is projected to exceed $33 billion that year, implying growth of more than 50% from current levels, with gross margins expected in the 15–17% range.

Stager also pointed to sovereign cloud as a key growth area, citing a potential $20 billion opportunity linked to Databol. Alongside this, the company intends to add two to four large-scale customers by 2026 to strengthen its revenue base.
On the analyst activity side, on August 6, JP Morgan’s Samik Chatterjee trimmed his price target on Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) to $45 from $46 while keeping a Neutral rating. The adjustment came after the company’s fiscal Q4 results, which fell short of expectations.
According to Chatterjee, the shortfall was driven by tighter capital availability and hesitation from customers, both of which slowed order activity. He also noted that the quarter reflected a broader issue for Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), which is that execution continues to lag the goals set by management.
Super Micro Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) designs and builds high-performance server and storage systems used by cloud providers, enterprises, OEMs, and large data centers, as well as in telecom and edge computing.

The system isn't perfect. For example, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is in the consumer discretionary sector even though its cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, is its most valuable segment -- meaning Amazon is arguably more of a technology company. But overall, the system is useful for achieving portfolio diversification and seeing which sectors are outperforming or underperforming the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).
Here are the 11 stocks I would choose if I could only buy one dividend stock from each sector for the rest of the year.
1. Technology
The technology sector makes up just over a third of the S&P 500 with a 34% weighting. The tech sector includes the three largest companies in the world -- Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. My top tech stock for the rest of 2025 is Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN).
The company is an industry veteran that makes analog and embedded semiconductors. It's not a pure artificial intelligence (AI) play. But Texas Instruments is unique in that it has a highly diversified business. The company stands to benefit from the growth of edge AI, which involves AI on a device level rather than in the cloud.
With 21 consecutive years of dividend raises and a 2.7% yield, Texas Instruments stands out as a unique way to invest in tech while generating a sizable amount of passive income.
2. Financials
Financials are the second-largest stock market sector with a 13.8% weight in the S&P 500. Payment processors have wide moats, rock-solid business models, and extremely high margins.
American Express(NYSE: AXP) takes it a step further by acting as both a payment processor and a card issuer. Issuing cards adds risk to the business, but American Express has an excellent track record of managing that risk, as evidenced by its low net write-off rate.
3. Consumer discretionary
The consumer discretionary sector makes up 10.4% of the S&P 500. The sector can be highly cyclical and sensitive to macro data from the broader economy, housing market, interest rates, and more. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is my top pick from the sector because the company's turnaround is going well and the dividend is excellent.
Last August, Starbucks poached Chipotle Mexican Grill CEO Brian Niccol to get Starbucks back on track to consistent international growth. Niccol's Starbucks hasn't been perfect, but it's much more organized and focused on improving customer service.
With 14 consecutive years of boosting the payout and a 2.7% yield, Starbucks stands out as a top consumer discretionary stock for generating passive income.
4. Communications
The communications sector comes in at 9.9% of the S&P 500. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) stands out as a high-conviction pick due to its diverse business model and dirt cheap valuation.
Fears of Al disrupting Google Search are overblown. Google Search continues to grow at an impressive rate. And adoption for Google Gemini, Alphabet's Chatbot, has been accelerating.
Alphabet announced its first dividend last year, but it only yields 0.4% .
5. Healthcare
Healthcare now only makes up 8.8% of the S&P 500 because the sector has been under pressure due to sell-offs in companies like Eli Lilly(NYSE: LLY).
Eli Lilly is an exciting company in the space because of existing drugs, especially for weight loss and diabetes -- as well as its pipeline of drugs in development.
The company passes along capital directly to shareholders through its growing dividend.
6. Industrials
Industrials are right behind healthcare with an 8.6% weighting in the S&P 500. Investors are getting a great value for industrial conglomerate Honeywell International(NASDAQ: HON).
Honeywell is splitting into three separate businesses to unlock value for shareholders. At 24.7 times earnings and with a 2.1% dividend yield, Honeywell is a good buy for folks who believe the company will be more innovative and flexible as three independent entities.
7. Consumer staples
Consumer staples make up 5.2% of the S&P 500. The sector has been struggling due to inflationary pressures on consumers. So it's best to approach consumer staples with an emphasis on quality.
Procter & Gamble(NYSE: PG) is as quality as it gets, with a 2.7% dividend yield and 69 consecutive years of boosting its payout, strong pricing power, and a diverse lineup of industry-leading products spanning beauty, grooming, healthcare, fabric and home care, and baby, feminine, and family care.
8. Energy
Like consumer staples, the energy sector has been under pressure from relatively low oil prices. There's also the ongoing risk of the energy transition as oil and gas demand could fall over the coming decades.
Integrated major ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM) provides a straightforward way to mitigate the sector's risks. ExxonMobil has a low cost of production, diversified portfolio across upstream, product solutions, and low carbon.
ExxonMobil has 42 consecutive years of increasing its payout and a high yield of 3.7%.
9. Utilities
The utilities sector makes up just 2.5% of the S&P 500. But it's one of the best sectors for generating reliable passive income.
Southern Company(NYSE: SO) is hovering around an all-time high due to steadily rising demand from residential, commercial, and industrial customers and AI-related tailwinds in Southern Company's wheelhouse in the Southeastern U.S.
With a yield of 3.1%, Southern Company is a reliable passive income powerhouse that's worth buying now.
10. Real estate
The real estate sector makes up 2% of the S&P 500. The sector includes companies that own, manage, and develop property, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) that generate income from rental properties.
Mid-America Apartment Communities(NYSE: MAA) is a REIT that specializes in multifamily apartment complexes in the Sun Belt. The company has an excellent track record of maintaining its dividend, which has never decreased over the 30 years that it has been paid. The dividend has increased significantly in recent years, boosting the yield to 4.3%.
11. Materials
The materials sector makes up just 1.8% of the S&P 500. Sherwin-Williams(NYSE: SHW) is the lone materials stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and it's a perfect representative for the sector.
The company has raised its dividend for 46 consecutive years and consistently repurchases its stock. The company does much more than residential paint, including a thriving industrial and commercial business that includes paint and coatings for industrial wood, marine, automotive, and more. It operates its own stores and works with retailers like Lowe's and Walmart.
Sherwin-Williams only yields 0.9%, but that's due to the stock's strong long-term performance rather than a lack of commitment to growing the dividend.

Bolton pointed to Astera Labs's (NASDAQ:ALAB) strong execution across its product portfolio as a key driver. The Scorpio, Aries, and Taurus lines have all contributed meaningfully to results, leading to a solid, better-than-expected second quarter of 2025 (results announced on August 5). The engagement metrics for the company’s Scorpio X product have been especially encouraging, with more than ten AI and cloud service providers now working with it, a sign of its technology’s expanding relevance.
The analyst also argued that Scorpio P switches, which are now in volume production and already contributing over 10% of revenue, mark a key development for the business. He also noted steady demand for Taurus Active Electrical Cables, with further growth likely as the industry shifts toward 800G AECs.

-
Palantir is growing rapidly thanks to its impressive AI tools.
-
The stock has risen far faster than its revenue or earnings.
-
Compared to Nvidia, Palantir has achieved valuations practically unheard of.
Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is one of the most popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the market. It has been an absolute rocket ship and has more than doubled this year.
But it has had a rough couple of days and is off nearly 20% from its all-time highs. And one Wall Street analyst thinks it could tumble a lot further.
Rishi Jaluria of RBC Capital Management, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada, has a $45 price target on Palantir's stock. So the stock still needs to tumble about 70% more to reach his price target. That's a long way to fall for a proven AI leader, but is that a legitimate price target?
Palantir's product serves two major client bases
Palantir has become one of the leaders in practical deployment of AI. Its platform allows companies to take in huge data streams, process them, and present actionable insights to their users. It also has various tools to automate these processes through AI agents, making businesses far more efficient.
The company also has a unique advantage: Governments around the globe are significant customers. This stems from its original offerings, which were tailored for government use. Palantir eventually expanded to the commercial side, although its government business is still a huge part of the stock's investment thesis.
In the second quarter, government revenue rose 49% to $553 million, while commercial revenue increased 47% to $451 million. Those are impressive results, and nearly any company would be happy with them. Palantir is also very profitable, converting 33% of its $1 billion in revenue into net income.
Clearly, the company is doing quite well right now. It has AI buildout tailwinds blowing in its favor and is rapidly growing its revenue profitably. It's hard to imagine a scenario in which the stock plummets 70% from these levels, unless it is grossly overvalued -- which it is.
Palantir has achieved a valuation few could imagine
Palantir's stock has been on a monstrous multiyear run. Since 2023, when the AI race kicked off, it is up over 2,300%. However, revenue has only risen 80% since then. That's a huge mismatch and indicates that the stock's valuation has dramatically expanded. At 115 times sales and 241 times forward earnings, this overvaluation thesis is confirmed.",47a67cadcb914aa2cad89f83c287a414,trafilatura

BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes has upped his Ethereum price target again, this time suggesting that the second largest crypto asset could jump to as high as $10,000 or $20,000 by the end of the cycle.
Hayes outlined his price prediction—centered on his expectation of major money printing during President Donald Trump’s time in office—on the Crypto Banter podcast hosted by crypto personality Ran Neuner this week, ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole on Friday.
“I think ETH goes [to] $10,000 or $20,000 before the end of the cycle,” said Hayes when asked about his price prediction. “Once it’s broken through, there’s a gap of air to the upside, and you have obviously all these digital asset treasury companies who are raising money. It’s going to be easier to raise money if the asset they’re buying has broken through all-time highs and is ascending upwards.”
Ethereum began surging upward once more on Friday, challenging its all-time high after a more doveish tone came from Powell, who signaled a rate cut could be in order. The price of ETH jumped to a new peak of $4,789 on Friday, just barely edging out the coin's 2021 price record.
Its recent rise has been propelled in part due to the digital asset treasuries Hayes mentioned, notably BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming–the two largest ETH treasuries which combine for more than $10 billion worth of ETH. Ethereum ETFs too have contributed, adding record breaking inflows throughout July and growing to hold more than 5% of the entire ETH supply.
Ethereum Hits All-Time High Price After Nearly 4 Years
Hayes has been bullish on ETH in recent months, telling Decrypt in May that he saw the second-largest crypto asset rising to $4,000-$5,000 before year’s end. He later upped that prediction in July, saying that ETH would “tear the market a new asshole” as it ripped to $10,000, once more citing its place as one of the “most hated assets.”
Now, he’s suggesting that Ethereum could rip towards $20,000 by the end of the cycle, or the time at which the bull market ends, in part because of the amount of money the Trump administration is likely to print.
In other words, Hayes expects the administration to institute major quantitative easing, a monetary policy where new money is created and can be used to purchase financial assets.

Before you borrow, it helps to understand the biggest factors that determine what rate you’ll pay. Here are seven key things you need to know about personal loans.
These Factors Determine Personal Loan Interest Rates
Interest rates on personal loans are determined by larger economic forces and the individual borrower’s credit history and score. Some of the factors that have the biggest impact are:
-
Economic environment: Federal Reserve policy, inflation and overall credit market conditions drive rates up and down.
-
Lender’s risk tolerance: Rates also reflect the lender’s own costs, operational overhead and their risk tolerance for potential loss if a borrower defaults.
-
Borrower-specific factors: Lenders evaluate individual borrowers’ credit scores, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio employment status and repayment history.

Credit Score Has a Big Impact on Your Rate
Of all these factors, credit score plays a big role in the rate you’ll be offered, as it’s the lender’s way of understanding their level of risk in loaning you money.
Higher credit scores (670 and up) may qualify for lower rates, while those with scores in the fair (580 to 669) to poor (below 580) credit tiers may see significantly higher interest rates.
Loan Length Affects Interest Rates
The loan length determines how quickly or slowly you’ll repay the money you’ve borrowed and will also affect how much interest you pay. Shorter-term loans (24 to 36 months) tend to come with lower rates as a kind of incentive for the likely lower risk the lender is taking. Thus, longer-term loans (60 to 84 months) tend to come with higher interest, since there’s a greater likelihood of missed or defaulted payments the longer you have to pay it back.
While a longer-term loan often results in a lower monthly payment, over the life of that loan you’re paying a lot more in interest.
For example: A $10,000 loan at 10% over three years costs around $1,600 in interest. The same loan at 12% over seven years will cost you around $4,800, additionally — a significant amount of money.
Fixed vs. Variable Rates
There are two main ways that interest can be applied to your loan, either fixed-rate or variable-rate loans.",b606cd4e9f84d5f9949dafe59a1098a5,trafilatura
